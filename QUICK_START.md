# 🚀 Quick Start - Push MovieHub to GitHub NOW!

## ⚡ Immediate Action Required

**You have 2 options to push your project to GitHub:**

### 🎯 Option 1: Use the Setup Script (EASIEST - Recommended)

#### For Windows Users:
1. **Double-click** `setup.bat` in your project folder
2. **Wait** for the script to complete
3. **Done!** Your project is now on GitHub

#### For Linux/Mac Users:
1. **Open terminal** in your project folder
2. **Run**: `chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`
3. **Wait** for the script to complete
4. **Done!** Your project is now on GitHub

### 🎯 Option 2: Manual Git Commands

**Open PowerShell/Command Prompt in your project folder and run:**

```bash
# 1. Initialize Git
git init

# 2. Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Pushya04/MovieHub.git

# 3. Add all files
git add .

# 4. Make commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: MovieHub - Movie Discovery & Sentiment Analysis Platform"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔍 What Happens Next?

1. **GitHub Repository Created**: `https://github.com/Pushya04/MovieHub`
2. **All Files Uploaded**: Your complete working prototype
3. **Ready for Deployment**: Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` for hosting

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Don't worry** about `.env` files - they're automatically excluded
- **All your code** will be preserved exactly as it is
- **Your working prototype** will work perfectly after the push
- **Nothing will be lost** - this is just copying to GitHub

## 🎉 Success Indicators

- ✅ Repository initialized

### "Authentication failed" Error:

### "Repository already exists" Error:
