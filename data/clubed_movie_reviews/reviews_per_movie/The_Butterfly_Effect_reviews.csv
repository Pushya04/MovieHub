Wow. What a film,"Okay, so after years of just hearing about this film and not seeing it (I have no excuses) I finally put it on. And wow, it's an absolutely fantastic film.Ill start by giving my reason why I haven't watched for so long and that's because I was told it was really complicated and confusing. And I'll be honest, 10 minutes into this film I was completely out of whack. I had absolutely no idea what's happening. But after around half an hour or so it becomes really apparent what's happening and the story just becomes more and more interesting. So if you're worried about complexity of the plot. Don't, you'll be fine.The ending as well I liked. You honestly don't know how this film will end, I was 10 minutes from the film ending and I still didn't know what was going to go down. But it's done really nicely and closes off any unanswered questions.
Watching films like Donny Darko you end up confused by the end and have several questions whereas this doesn't have this and I prefer that. (Donny Darko is great by the way, I was just giving an example).Beyond that I thought the acting was really good, the managed to pull off good character development and the changes of memory were quite obvious so there wasn't any overlapping or confusion on what you were watching.It's just overall an absolutely fantastic film and I highly recommend watching this if you haven't done so already.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How Kelso lost his mind.,"Every so often we all seem to move away from the usual nothings we talk about amongst our friends, and instead get into a deeply philosophical conversation about the workings of Chaos Theory and the existence of parallel universes. No? Okay, just me then. In any case, this discussion just the other day led to a friend recommending The Butterfly Effect, a film that puts both a stylistic and sinister spin on the idea that even the mere flapping of a butterfly's wings can result in drastic changes in another place or time. Being initially sceptical because of the generally negative reaction from critics, I was certainly not disappointed by film's end.Ashton Kutcher couldn't be more different that his concurrent role as the dimwitted Kelso from That '70s Show in his lead performance as Evan Treborn, a man who has suffered blackouts since his childhood, and realises that he can access and relive vital gaps in his memory through the help of other sources like journals or images. He uses this skill to, in his eyes, right the wrongs of the past. Namely, injustices that were performed upon his friends Lenny and Tommy and only love Kayleigh (Amy Smart). What he doesn't realise is that the changes he thinks are made for the better actually result in a severely changed future that threatens his own life.Without trying to sound like a sadist, The Butterfly Effect excels in presenting a consistently dark, melancholy atmosphere. Indeed, there is hardly a happy moment in the entire film, although that may be untrue depending on which ending you watch (more on that later). Any event that looks as if it might provide a slim ray of hope for Evan to make things right is quickly dashed by a sudden escalation of the plot, maintaining the viewer's interest the whole way through. The film doesn't shy away from heavy subject matter either, including prostitution, murder, paedophilia and drug use, all of which culminates in an enjoyably gritty, underground tone.Positively, the menacing nature of the movie isn't weighed down by comic relief. I suppose when many of us think of this sort of plot, we first think of the Simpsons Halloween special when Homer invents the time-travelling toaster. Not knowing quite how dark the film would turn out to be, I was concerned The Butterfly Effect would go down a similar path, in which Evan keeps returning to the present to find that all humans have grown wings or Pauly D has become President. Instead, any changes are limited to the persona of the characters, rather than altering the physical environment, which was definitely the professional path to take.The pacing is another strength. For a film that comes in well under two hours, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber deserve credit for packing a lot in, and doing it well. Certainly, some thrillers benefit from slow-moving scenes to draw suspense (the superb Eyes Wide Shut, for example) but Butterfly manages to combine compounding urgency with engaging character development in constructing a fast-moving film that requires both thought and stamina to decipher, without being needlessly confusing.Oddly, the film possesses four different final scenes, and so the lasting message of the movie may differ depending on the copy viewed. My favourite ending is the 'official' one applied to the theatrical release. It is satisfying, yet open-ended, as is the case with its alternate cut. Another is uncharacteristically upbeat and illogical, perhaps suggested in the editing room as a way of appeasing confused screen-test viewers. But if you really want to get down to brass tax, go with the Director's Cut: a far more morbid conclusion with a surreal twist. Intrigued? Don't let me stop you.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Mindf@ck film just like they should be,"I seldom come out and write movie reviews in IMDb but I felt this one deserved some effort from me. I don't recall any movie which made me shiver thinking about what was gonna come next when I hit pause to go for a pee or any other reason. This one is really something. There is a ""Lost Highway"" feel to it and the themes are closely related but...The Butterfly effect is in fact more complex.It is a really disturbing movie, not so much for what it shows, but for what it keeps you guessing - like all true thriller masterpieces - , about events that take or might take place, and above all, about human sanity and the subtle twist there is between the average Joe's walk of life and outright perversion.

"What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence?","What if you could go back to major junctions in your life and take the other path? What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence? On the flip-side - what if, at the end of the day, you really can't achieve a solid grip on these things, no matter how hard you try?A great deal of science fiction works of art have tried to approach these meaningful questions throughout the years, all presenting many philosophical ideas and notions as to how one man can change his own fate, for better or for worse. In this surprisingly good sci-fi adventure from 2004, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber (who are also behind the screenplay of Final Destination 2) raise all these questions once again, but use a different angle this time around. Time travel is not the issue here. Instead, our lead protagonist, Evan Treborn (portrayed by Hollywood prankster Ashton Kutcher  but more on that later) leads his whole life up until his early 20's without knowing he has a rare medical condition that seemingly helps him shut away traumatic incidents that occurred throughout his childhood and adolescence years. All he remembers from these various occasions are bizarre blackouts. But when a blast from his past comes back into his life only to leave it ever so tragically (Kayleigh Miller, portrayed by the lovely Amy Smart who we've since seen in films such as Just Friends and Crank), Evan learns that he can return to those important lost moments in his life and re-inhabit his younger body, thus changing the present and future. However, with every shift in the past comes an alternate present that may seem better at first, but is in fact a far harsher reality than the original one Evan has left.What truly touched me about this film was the essence in which it captured the troublesome youth of my generation, that was born in the 1980's, grew up in the 1990's, and is ever since trying to adapt to the ever changing reality in which we all live in. Here, one man tries to alter all this, and his own personal journey is parallel in many ways to the journey many young people go through nowadays. Part of capturing this Generation X notion is the pop-culture presented throughout the film. When you see the young actors and actress fall in love, fight, and grow up real fast, it all happens amidst references to films of the period (Se7en, etc.), outfits, 1980's technology and other devices that fill you up with an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and sentiment, as if you were there yourself, living these events and going through all these horrible/wonderful events.Above all things, the makers of The Butterfly Effect do the unbelievable and turn Ashton Kutcher into a good actor  a feat I thought was unachievable at best. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible. Bottom line, it was a fresh breath of air when I saw it, left me pondering for days, and gave me the inspiration and write something myself after a long period of writers block. If a film manages to be this inspirational and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its 113 minutes duration, all I can do is humbly bow down in front of its makers' talents. I'm eagerly waiting for other outings by these young folks.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprisingly a great movie,"Ashton Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a troubled man who suffered blackouts as a child. When he discovers a way to travel back into the body of his past self, his time trips start to cause negative results on his present. As he uses his powers to try to fix his past and present, the effect escalates, creating alternate realities, many of which are worse than the past that he is trying to change.The Butterfly Effect is a terrific thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The previews looked very intense and the whole film is pretty much like that. It held onto the audience right at the start and it didn't let go until the end. The plot is nothing new but the execution was very nice. It offers a bunch of interesting and unpredictable twists so it's hard to see where things are going. The whole film is like that, just one long engaging thrill ride.The acting is okay, some people did better than others. Ashton Kutcher is surprisingly good as Evan and he does a good job for his first serious movie. Amy Smart is very pretty and talented and she plays Kayleigh perfectly. The only person I didn't really like was Melora Walters. She was pretty wooden and unconvincing. Besides for her, the acting was pretty good and convincing. No one really did a bad job.This film was directed and written by both Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber. They did make their mistakes but the film is still pretty good. The critics never gave this movie a chance. As soon as they heard Ashton Kutcher was in it, they all prepared to give it thumbs down. The movie moves around a lot that its hard to keep up but it also keeps you paying attention. Plenty of movies have gone back in time before but this one does it so more effectively that its almost original in that sense. The beginning is done well, the middle it starts dragging but it starts picking up and the ending is done extremely well. This is one of the best films of 2004 and certainly an entertaining one. In the end, this underrated gem is worth checking out. Rating 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Real Tripped Out Roller Coaster,"Man... Whew... Wow! I'm at a loss of words to describe this high octane, tantalizing, brain-stimulating movie. The acting: excellent. The plot: superb. The story: great. The drama/suspense: mind numbing.How the writers were able to put this story together so flawlessly, I don't know, and how the director was able to actualize it, even more amazing. There was plenty of visual stimuli as well as mental stimuli as you waited to see the outcome of each alteration made by the main character, Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher).The movie kept me guessing and kept me at the edge of my seat, and the writers outdid themselves by making sure the movie didn't peter out with some lame ending. The ending was icing on the cake and it capped what should be a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One good turn....,"This movie received WAY too many bad reviews. The only reason was to PUNK Ashton Kutcher. Say what you will, Kutcher did a fair to midland acting job here. There have been a lot worse performances on film in much better reviewed movies. I tell you, you will NOT be disappointed watching the Director's cut Alternate ending. It is a story of how one action causes a series of reactions...no matter the intentions, be careful what you wish for. This film's biggest mistake was promoting it in the horror genre. It is NOT! It is a nice dark fantasy film, nothing more, nothing less. There are 2 different endings, with 2 different meanings for me. I preferred the Alternate ending in lieu of the Theatrical ending.

Every part of the film plays an important role to the main thread. Every details have a role! The film is like reading a poem from the 18th century, where every sentence means something.

Like swiss cheese - tasty but full of holes.,"I should state up front that this review is for the director's cut.To put it bluntly, this movie suffers from having a smart heart and a stupid brain.  Any movie like this requires the viewer to suspend disbelief.  In doing so the storytellers have the option to establish replacement rules to govern the universe they've created.  This movie sets up well, giving the main character (Evan) blackouts which it will fill in later.  However, once Evan ventures into his past to 'fill in' the empty spaces, the movie begins to contradict itself.  This would be excusable if it was a lighter, more amusing movie.  But this is far from light material.  It is extremely morbid.  The audience is bombarded with this darkness, which attempts to engage us, to give us something deeper.  Unfortunately, it doesn't take much digging before you get frustrated.For me, there are two particularly frustrating aspects to this film:First, the tagline of this movie is ""change one thing, change everything"". As such, I expected that when Evan goes back to change something, everything from that point forward will be different.  In other words, if Evan has ten blackouts, and goes back to visit the fifth one, then all the following blackouts would either vanish or be completely different.  Instead, the blackouts are always the same.  Evan jumps around to whatever blackout is convenient.  However, this betrays the movie's central concept.  This could have been fixed with a more careful storyline, where the blackouts were visited in reverse order.The second frustrating aspect is the gross simplifications in Evan's revised histories.  When Evan goes back and changes over a decade of history, the effects of his change are summed up far too easily and conveniently, almost as if the other people are all in on some cruel joke being played on Evan. I understand that this is done to keep the pace moving, but again the central theme of ""change one thing, change everything"".  But even after multiple changes, a lot of the world stays pretty much the same.Comparisons to Donnie Darko are inevitable.  Donnie Darko was a superior film in this regard because it did not make the mistake of laying down ground rules and then breaking them.  Instead, it hides the rules from the audience and leaves them up for discussion.  As a result, you have a much more interesting conversation piece.  The Butterfly Effect essentially outsmarts itself by trying too hard.For some, my comments may seem like cynical over-thinking.  This movie has a lot of polish on it to make it look good, and if you want to keep your brain turned off, you may enjoy it considerably.  Some people may not like Ashton Kutcher and discredit the movie based on that, but honestly I thought his performance was far more convincing than the script itself.Like I said before, this movie does have a smart heart.  It tries very very hard to bring something interesting to the table.  The setup and ending are good, but the path between is too dark for its own good and ultimately a mess of contradictions.  6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Promises more than it delivers,"If we want to analyze where this movie fails, we can look no further than the title. It alludes to a popular metaphor in chaos theory, the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings could cause a storm on the other side of the world. It also draws heavily on Ray Bradbury's classic short story in which the entire history of mankind is affected by someone stepping on an insect.Based on this background, you'd think this movie would be about how tiny, trivial events can have monumental, unpredictable consequences. I would have liked to see a film that truly addresses this possibility, since most time-travel movies ignore it. In ""Back to the Future,"" for example, I could never believe that Marty would ever be able to set the past straight after his initial interference. Just his setting foot in the 1950s ought to have threatened his existence. Why? It's quite simple. Even though his parents will get married to each other, how can he be sure they'll have the same kids? ""Back to the Future"" set the standard for the genre by narrowing the scope of possible changes when dealing with time paradoxes.The main problem with ""The Butterfly Effect"" is that it doesn't transcend this level but simply thinks that it does. Take the scene where Kutcher tries to stop the exploding mailbox. The chain reaction of events that result from this act may be drastic, but there is nothing unpredictable about it. He affects a crucial event in his life and the result is a straightforward, logical consequence, hardly akin to stepping on an insect and changing the course of man. The writers could have used far more imagination when devising the plot. Other changes that the character makes are unconvincing, such as the notion that he could prevent recurrent child abuse simply by threatening someone on a single occasion. That scene, in any case, is not a good example of little things affecting the world in big ways. It's an example of wishful thinking, plain and simple. When the scenario finally goes wrong, it happens because of the way Kutcher's character acts in the altered present, not because of the altered time-line itself.The film's first forty-five minutes are somewhat more promising. These early scenes deal with Kutcher's childhood experiences, how he blacks out whenever his life becomes too traumatic. It's an intriguing setup that would have left me wondering where the story was headed had I not already seen the trailer, where I learned that it was going to be about time travel. On a dramatic level, the movie's biggest failing is that it never follows through with the tone it sets up in the beginning. We're promised a thriller, but the movie degenerates into what can best be described as an episodic black comedy, almost a dark version of ""Bedazzled.""This is sort of entertaining, but I was hoping for more. I may have been influenced by the fact that shortly before seeing the film, I read ""Bid Time Return,"" the Richard Matheson novel on which the 1980 movie ""Somewhere in Time"" is based. This book, even more than the movie adaptation, strongly leads us to suspect that the time-traveling experience occurs only in the protagonist's mind. ""The Butterfly Effect"" has a similar ambiguity that it never truly addresses, perhaps because mainstream audiences would have found such an approach too disturbing.You may notice that I have so far not talked about the acting, and I will resist the temptation to rag on Kutcher's performance more than others have done. He's not terribly engaging, but it's not all his fault (especially considering that his character is played by other actors for a good portion of the film). The real problem lies at the level of the script, which doesn't give Kutcher much to do. The film is so plot-driven it doesn't spend much time on its characters.Ultimately, this movie has nothing new to contribute to the time travel genre. While it tries to pass itself off as a twist on the old premise, it quickly becomes a fairly routine thriller about a man tweaking his past. I hope that the next time they decide to do such a film, they'll leave cool metaphors like butterfly effects to a script that is truly willing to deal with such concepts instead of simply pretending to.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Possible good plot.......destroyed!,"It's a pity, I still ask me how is it possible to waste such a brilliant idea. From the beginning, the plot catch you, it seems twisted (it is), but easy to understand, and it is effective. Going on it fall into the banality, always worse going to the end. It seems like they had this starting idea, but they were not able to evolve it for the rest of the movie, so it remain as an embryo. It become obvious and often pathetic. The only message escapes is the classic and obvious:""if you want to change the future it could be worse"". Another problem: actors! Incredibly not able to act, Kutcher (I don't know if famous in the States) is not ""strong"" enough to have such a responsibility, Amy Smart is beauty, but just that, Melora Walters is always crying, very far from the good interpretations with P.T.Andersson.

Buy the Director's Cut and watch ONLY this version,"OK it's a bit to late to write a comment about this movie but let me tell you about it. Don't by any means watch the theatrical version!!! The first time I watched the movie was when I rented the Director's cut version. I was fascinated, really stunned by this movie. It kept me wondering why I haven't heard of that movie before and the answer was that people didn't see the Director's cut but the Theatrical version instead. Oh yes there are no similarities between those versions. The theatrical version is a light version if you like, a version at the end of which you will say ""well OK nice movie"", but(!!!!) the Director's cut gives the real meaning of the movie. It changes the whole idea, it adds new scenes and omits others, it changes the whole movie with a new outstanding ending and the plot in general is more concrete!!!

One Big Butterfly!!,"I found ""The Butterfly Effect"" to be a pretty good movie for the most part. I saw nothing wrong with the acting and had no preconceived notions about Ashton Kutchner to poison my view (have never seen the Dude, Where's My ... movies). He played Evan well given how one would react to these events if they were to occur to one in real life.The storyline was good and the powers that be brought the events together well, for the most part. The movie kept me interested throughout, although the mysterious events (blackout moments of Evan's childhood that are not shown to the viewer), while well hinted at before and after the blacked-out portion, were not handled well. Let me elaborate. Evan's friends would not tell him what had actually happened during these periods (for one reason or another). This, I felt, was a downfall of the storytellers. While it supposedly produced the effect on the viewer in wanting to know what happened, it left in me a feeling of unbelievability in the plot (somewhat).As to what the Butterfly Effect is and Chaos Theory in general, note the following quote: ""The flapping of a single butterfly's wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done. So, in a month's time, a tornado that would have devastated the Indonesian coast doesn't happen. Or maybe one that wasn't going to happen, does. (Ian Stewart, Does God Play Dice? The Mathematics of Chaos, pg. 141)"".Chaos Theory can be explained using the Butterfly Effect but it's relation to the movie is in name only. I say this because the wing flaps (childhood events in the movie) are HUGE events in anybody's childhood. Changing these events would, of course, have a huge impact on any child's later life. So, this butterfly is one whopping big one.The movie has some inexplicable events and doesn't tie everything up neatly for us, the viewer. This is a good thing in that it leaves them open for discussion as to what there meaning is. This is bad in that the lesser-thinking viewers may be left scratching their heads and disliking the movie because of it.It all relates to the idea of time-travel and what happens in the original time-line. Will it, in fact, be affected by the subsequent time travel events? I don't want to get into the specific details as it would give spoilers. I can only say that these are the things that one is left pondering.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Much Better Movie Than You Would Suspect...,"THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT- THEATRICAL CUT (4 outta 5 stars)THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT- DIRECTOR'S CUT (3+ outta 5 stars)Now normally I tend to prefer movies that let the writer/director tell the story that they want to without having to water it down for mass consumption. In this case I have to say that the ending they they were forced to re-shoot for the theatrical release of this movie is a much more emotional, resonant and appropriate ending than the bleak, cold and grotesque finale they had originally planned. On the US DVDs you get the choice of which version to see (foreign editions only have the less compelling director's version)... so North American viewers can make up their own mind about which ending they prefer. I would suggest watching the theatrical cut first... and then check out the director's cut... which would you prefer to think of as the ""real"" ending?As for the movie itself... don't be put off by the idea of Ashton Kutcher in the lead role. He does quite a good job in a serious part quite different from his usual TV persona. He plays a college student who, having been plagued by mental blackouts all his life, devotes himself to the study of human memory. Eventually he finds that by re-reading old journal entries he can will himself back in time to experience the events he had blacked out... and even CHANGE THEM using the knowledge that his older self possesses. Unfortunately one small change in the past causes some HUGE ramifications in his present day world. Can't say too much more about the plot without giving away the many fun surprises. Believable performances and a basic seriousness give the film an urgency that is sometimes missing in modern fantasy films of this type.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Incredibly Great Film,"With over 1000 reviews, chances are not many are going to read this, but I just have to say how much I love this film, which I just discovered about a month ago, and have now watched 7 times, once the theatrical version and six times, the directors version, which I greatly prefer, as it fits the overall script better and what was intended originally. I am 70, and hardly expected this or any new movie to make it to my top 10, especially since I am not a fan of fantasy or time travel movies generally, but ""The Butterfly Effect"" has become my 4th favorite of the nearly 3000 films I have viewed in my life. The movie has many disturbing scenes, but the pace is amazingly fast, the acting excellent for the most part, and the characters physical continuity from childhood through adolescence to adult was the best I have ever seen in a film with 3 separate periods. The plot has been so thoroughly reviewed, I won't waste time telling the details again. Suffice it to say, if you can handle the elements of child abuse and animal mistreatment, (not graphically depicted) and can ignore the critics and watch the film at least twice, I think you will appreciate what a great film this is. And I have recently watched the director's commentary and deleted scenes, which further illustrate what an ambitious film this is. It should have been a classic, and it shows how off-base the critic's fraternity can be. Roger Ebert was fairer to the film than most of the others among major critics, but I think they were determined to knock the film because they didn't like Ashton Kutcher, and the film came out in January, which predisposes most critics to expect a bomb. Do yourself a favor if interested, and rent this Infinifilm.

It should've been called-how to be excruciatingly stereotypical.,"I was rather surprised with this movie, not expecting much from something with Ashton Kutcher in the lead. I just can't seem to him picture with him any kind of real acting ability. I just always see a Michael Kelso. But, Butterfly Effect changed my opinion a little.The Butterfly Effect is another one of those science fiction stories in which characters, distraught with their present reality, can change that reality by revising their past decisions, even slightly.Evan (Kutcher), as a young boy, endured a few childhood trauma along with his three childhood friends, Kallie, Tommy, and Lenny, such as his friend's pedophile father (Stolz). Evan has some kind of problem, however, that causes him to blackout during these traumatic, life changing events. These past events obviously effect the present as they mold the person the four children will become. And it isn't always pretty.As a psychology major, Evan is inspired to study memory patterns, and consequently, discovers his neurological knack for forcing himself to remember things. When he does, he is able to transplant himself back to that time (through the help of his journals that he kept since he was 7) and, still knowing what he knows in the present, is able to alter the past, and also the present. So, his goal is to make all of his friends' and mother's lives at least as perfect as they can be by wiping out as much of the bad stuff as he possibly can. But not everything works well on the first try. In other words, it is an opportunity to be able to ""redo"" his past. Evan is able to give everyone a second (and third, and fourth) chance at life. Now granted, the story is a cool idea, but the idea may've been pushed too far. Why are the possibilities for a second chance endless? Why can't there be some point, or at least some possbility of Evan not always being able to go back, or not being able to revise things?The problem with this movie at first glance is that the complexity of the story creates problems with details. For instance, in one of the times that Evan goes back, he is able to make some of the friend's life nearly perfect. Say, Evan is able to start off this perfection by going back to age 7, then we would not expect the bad events that took place at age 11 to involve him, as his line of perfection would've already been set in place. Yet, the journal entries never change. And that's a problem with this movie. Evan's life may change, but his journal entries never seem to, not even after his age of revision.The second problem with this movie is that it is so excruciatingly stereotypical. When Evan improves the present for he and Kallie, she is the sorority girl and he the frat boy. They live in a nice place, he drives a brand new luxury car. When things go well for Tommy, he is a sweater vest wearing campus crusader for Christ type. Evan's roommate, Thumper, is the by-the-book version of ""goth."" There is no character that simply seems to exist as just normal, and not the stereotypical version of perfection or being utterly dismal. In fact, this movie may best be titled, ""Equations for Being So Stereotypically White."" But then again, mainstream pop culture exists on lumping people into one generalized group or another.As a sigh of relief at least, thank goodness this did not turn out to be another piece of obnoxious teen movie garbage.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
a real surprise,"I saw this intriguing film last night & was quite amaze at how much I enjoyed it.The lead actor Ashton Kutcher, has made a name or himself on a Television show & a few films in comedic roles.In THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, he gives a superb dramatic turn, I can foresee a big future for this young actor. Very few actors have excelled in both comedies & dramas. To name only 2, GLENN FORD & JACK LEMMON.The female lead is played by Amy Smart, this is a multi part performance & she too is excellent. I have heard her name but cant place her in any film, Mark my word,We will see much more of her,The rest of the cast are actors I did not recognize excerpt fort Eric Stolz, who plays Amy's father, The all are excellent.The entire production is first rate all the way through.This is a very complicated story of imagination, some real events & pure fantasy.The last film of this type that impressed me this much was DONNIE DARKO. In fact both films would make a fantastic double bill,BUT it would be hard to sleep the night you saw both.Like Donnie Darko, this is psychedelic fantasy, science fiction,horror story. This type film is rare & very hard to succeed.The Butterfly Effect succeeds on all counts.rating ***1/2 /4 points 90/100 IMDb 8",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Only watch Director's Cut, not Theatrical Release!","Director's cut: 8, Theatrical release: 6. Seriously, can you destroy a movie any worse than by putting a sappy ending on a serious movie? I mean, can you? No, you can't. So do yourself a service and avoid the pap that they fed the audiences in the theater because they are gutless worms and go with the actual story. I just thank god I saw the Director's Cut first. It sort of gives me the creeps to think how many movies I've seen that were lobotomized and left me feeling they were just ho hum.That said, it is only a few minutes at the end that are different. Either way you would have felt you were watching a pretty good movie. The difference is just that if you watched the theatrical release you would have this nagging feeling following you around the rest of your life that you should be able to go back in time and change the ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Compelling and Intriguing Movie About Making Choices and Taking Responsibilities,"A troubled young boy with the memory issues (Ashton Kutcher) is suddenly able to transport himself back into moments from his past, change them for the better and return to the present. The changes he makes affect not only his life but the lives of his close friends. The problem is - he never knows how exactly the changes made in the past would affect the present. The idea of the movie is anything but new - we all read Ray Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder,"" an unforgettable short story about a time-traveler who steps on a prehistoric butterfly and causes the horrible changes in the fate of the whole humanity. We've seen the films Frequency, Groundhog Day, and Memento - Butterfly Effect borrows a lot from them. BE is not as good as they are but it is a compelling and intriguing movie about making choices and taking responsibilities. I recommend watching director's cut with the ending completely different from the theatrical release. The ending that I saw really made this movie for me.Very respectable even if not completely successful effort for Kutcher to do something different than Cheaper by the Dozen (2003), My Boss's Daughter (2003), and Just Married (2003).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An interesting concept hastily put together – 6 (A little disappointing),"So I'm watching the BUTTERFLY EFFECT with eyes peeled to Ashton Cutcher's mom. Where have I seen her before? Ten minutes later, it hit's me like a time-warped flashback, and I'm sitting on my couch back in Massachusetts watching Magnolia again. Yeah Cutcher's worried to death mom, Melora Walters, was also that strung out coke-head girl in Magnolia! But how did she end up in a movie with Ashton Cutcher? Before my question is answered, the flashback ends and unfortunately I'm back in my Japanese apartment watching THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT. Wait, I want to finish Magnolia! I have to go back!I selected this movie without knowing what it was about. That is undoubtedly the best way to watch any movie, whereupon surprises flow like the salmon of Capastrano. But because of struck-over-the-head obvious hints, I soon deciphered the concept behind this Luke-warm sci-fi Oldsmobile. ""Your father thought he could ... could ..."" Yeah, mom, I thought, just say it and get it over with. He thought he could change the past! Walters was definitely more convincing in Magnolia. What happened? Could I go back in time and tell her not to do this movie?OK, I'm a big fan of sci-fi time travel movies, because they touch upon that most guttural of human emotions – regret. What would you give to go back and change the past? If you had that second chance, your life might turn out to be totally different, like the alphabet might have a new letter or worse, former president Richard Nixon might not have been elected. Think about that one.The tradition of altering the course of history jumped onto film with It's a Wonderful Life, skipped from body to body in Quantum Leap, and actually had a scientific basis in several episodes of Star Trek: Generations. I raise a toast to those works of art.Thus THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT automatically gets a better-than-average rating in my book at the get-go for having the guts to take on the rich concept of time travel. But even though the chick-flick in sci-fi clothing starts off with a lot of potential, several production and writing shortcomings drag THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT back down to mediocrity.First of all, the story seems to have been written by a sixth-grader. Is Ashton Chritchner really traveling back in time, or is he just wandering around the corridors of his confused and twisted psyche? It's a mystery, which is okay, but if I were to portray this mystery on film, I'd try a smarter approach. Sure, Ashton Cutcher's fan-base might have yet to reach puberty, but every dog sniffs out a questionable screenplay. There are too many loopholes and contradictions. Are we to swallow the idea that Cutcher's brain is a time-machine, or worse yet that he doesn't want to change real world problems like South Africa or the former Bush Administration? My throat is not deep enough for hook line and sinker, I'm sorry.The scenes where he goes back to his childhood body and bosses Eric Stoltz around is laughable. Maybe Eric Stoltz's feelings really are that easy to manipulate. Or maybe the scriptwriter ran out of clever ideas to fuel this groundless time travel movie and was desperate to get the script in on time. Instead of time-travel, the crew should have focused on the concept of a 26-year old trapped in a ten-year-old's body. You know, something akin to Travolta's Look Who's Talking. That's something worth exploring.Another questionable aspect of the production behind THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT is slapdash and thinly transparent speed. Too few actors and too few props are spread over too many time leaps, which amounts to something like a high school skit more than anything else. Where the movie starts to get creepy with nicely orchestrated music, it stops halfway. I would say, up the creepiness behind the insidious molestation theme, tone down the obvious references to fraternity life, and come up with a scientific basis for the time travel. That would automatically bump the movie up a point or two, even though it might confuse some of Ashton Cutcher's most die-hard fans.JYJimboduck dot com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Imagine a particularly poor Outer Limits episode remade by Roland Emmerich's hypnotised apeman offspring.,"Then imagine the best actor in it being - wait for it - Mr Eric Stoltz!With all the credibility, appeal and consistency of a bad bout of diarrhoea comes The Butterfly Effect, sure to cause irreversible damage to the brain cells of any who encounter it.The ""Butterfly Effect"" theory states that even minute changes in the present can have massive and incomprehensibly wide-ranging impacts on the future. In the movie this is represented by a gimpy bloke making a series of rather large changes to his past, each time leaving him in the same university with the same people (who randomly switch between a grab bag of zero-dimensional stereotypes): ""Oh,look, now she's a crack-whore."" ""Ha, now he's a cripple!""Thus, actors who struggle to convince in just one role are impossibly tasked with playing many.If brutalising general logical consistency and weren't enough, the film manages to include just about everything you'd expect to find in a crap short story by a 14 year-old Evanescence fan. Child abuse? Check. Drug abuse? Check. Audience abuse? By the bucketload.Stir in a lead character who brutally murders one of his friends halfway through and shows no apparent remorse at any point (it's okay, I'll just use my journal to break the rules of physics and then forget about it) and you have one of the most severe affronts to creation ever witnessed.But hey, at least it has Eric Stoltz.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The effect of ""The butterfly Effect""","I should have written about this film the first time I watched it. Now it's been the third time and although I loved it as much as the first time, my head has added up lots of things and I can't say something straight. What I'll do, is try to summarize all my thoughts in some paragraphs. I'm just going to say one main thing, because there were bad reviews and lots of opinions; this is a great film. Other subjectYou have these two guys who got together to do something. Yes, they knew it would be a script, but the relevant thing is that their union, I believe, departures from this concept: cheating all the stereotypes, avoiding common places and typical ideas; working hard to achieve the constant surprise of the spectator, because his logical expectation is always betrayed. You may criticize this film, but you can't deny that it is anything but predictable. There are some resolutions, things or parts I thought about many times, that are not totally perfect; but it happens with any film of any type, and we tend to forgive.I tried hard (although it wasn't difficult) to find the reasons that could make this movie unlikable for some viewers. I resolved that mainly it is because it presents itself as an action piece, better yet, an ""entertaining even""; and these are usually underestimated works, with no further purpose than making someone spend a good time. If ""The Butterfly Effect"" was that, I spent an awesome time. The other reason is a name: Ashton Kutcher. Yes, how can a movie with this guy who played the most stupid roles be appreciated? And he produced it? Not good signs.However, and for my pleasant surprise, this was and still is Kutcher's best performance to date. He composed something really interesting, like Amy Smart, who sows off here, and leaves not one doubt of how promising she is. Merit of the casting directors was the selection of the younger cast, occupied by very talented kids, like Logan ""Bobby"" Lerman, Jesse James, Irene Gorovaia, and specially John Patrick Amedori.Those two guys I was talking about are called Eric Bress and J. Mackie Gruber, and they are not just writers, but also directors of this unappreciated beauty. What a way of telling a story and representing it visually! It is true that their feature is betraying, and has lots of twists (what could tire out our patience), but I believe for some motive they knew we would die to see what happened; that we would stick around. So they play with our thoughts, and keep us awake. When I was having little sleeping time last year, this was the one thing that woke me up. I didn't even want it to end, and when it did, I didn't want to get out of theater, I wanted to see more.It is also true that their movie is very powerful; everything. The cinematography, the sceneries: a crafted work. While it is not common in this type of film, there is an emotional power beyond. The words the characters speak, the things they live...We feel for them, and at the ending, WowI mean: Wow! They inserted ""Stop crying your heart out"" and an ending so incredible that hit (or probably impacted) me the other day for the third time; but it felt just like the first.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Excellent, Unpredictable and Intriguing Screenplay  A Must- See Film","Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher when adult) blacks out painful memories since he was a kid. Although being the beloved son of Andrea Treborn (Melora Walters), he misses the presence of his father, who is an intern of an institution for the mentally ill. His best friends are Kayleigh and her brother Tommy, and Lenny. When Evan is about seven years old, he is advised by his doctor to write a journal, as a kind of memory exercise. When he is about twenty years old, he decides to read his notes, and realizes that he can travel in time and change his past. However, when he does it, the reality in the present changes too much, affecting the lives of his mother and friends. Evan tries to improve their lives, but he realizes that he is not God.

"Interesting, but flawed","I really wanted to love this film. It has an incredibly interesting idea which resonates to that of Donnie Darko which is one of my favourite films. However there are significant scripting issues which make events feel incredibly forced. The idea behind the whole film is clever, and does clear some of the anomalies the film has. But there is an underlying issue with the film which just feels frustrating and very forced. It's definitely worth a watch as it is thought provoking, and it would be good to have your own opinion on it. But it is best not to go into this film expecting to see a masterclass. It is enjoyable, and the overall theme is particularly stimulating, yet it feels lacking and a few elements short of a great film.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Disappointing,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsEvan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is a young man who suffered a troubled childhood.He was sexually abused,nearly killed by his psychotic father and was constantly menaced by a psychotic childhood chum.However,he's grown up into a relatively normal and focused fraternity brother and appears to have accepted all the hands that fate has dealt him.Until,that is,he discovers a way of altering his past to make his present better.However,it is from here that he discovers that maybe it is better to just let memories be memories.This is the latest in a long line of movies to deal with the concept of reverse plotting,perfected to style with 2000's Memento and dallied with up to this point.There are,admittently,a number of interesting ideas swimming around here,but even if you pay close attention to it,the plot feels totally disjointed and hard to make out,not to mention follow.It's senseless,is what I'm trying to say.As a result,it all winds up as one big emotionally uninvolving affair.And that's a big complaint to bear in mind for two hours.On the performances front,Kutcher is pretty much impossible to take seriously in the lead role.He is a comedic actor and his transition to serious acting puts him in the forefront of bad acting in a year of bad leading male performances.In the supporting role,Amy Smart is easily the best thing in it,but,well,there you go...The Butterfly Effect ultimately emerges as a wasted opportunity on all fronts.It coulda been worse,that's for sure.But it could also have been one hell of a lot better.**",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not your father's nose bleed,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Admittedly, psychological thrillers are my favorite film genre.  First time co-directors (and co-writers from ""Final Destination 2"") Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber deliver some effective suspense and a few thrills and chills ... especially in the first 20 minutes.  The film does lose a bit of momentum in the second half and there were some missed opportunities for more twists and turns, but overall ""The Butterfly Effect"" will keep your attention and make you squirm a time or two.  Today's Mr. Overexposed, Ashton Kutcher (""Dude, Where's My Car"") flashes some dramatic promise, especially when called upon for the deer in the headlights look.  He effectively sneers his way through the college boy moments, but doesn't really pull off the prison time.  Amy Smart (from the underappreciated mini-classic ""Outside Providence"") is remarkable in her many roles within a role. Hopefully this will boost her career and she will continue to be pushed artistically.  Melora Walters (fresh from her spot-on performance in the over-hyped ""Cold Mountain"") delivers as Ashton's frightened Mom who just can't make the right move to save her boy.  The story takes time travel to an entirely new dimension - it's definitely NOT ""Back to the Future"".  It does have a touch of ""Seven"", which not coincidently, plays a role in the film.  The child actors are all very well cast, but I would have liked to see a bit more of the story line on Ashton's dad.  Still, worth seeing if you enjoy a thriller with a different look and feel.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good Idea, Complicated Implementation","""The Butterfly Effect"" is not a typical movie. With its weird story, its many and sometimes difficult to follow plot twists, its dark and depressing atmosphere, it definitely is a film which can be described as ""different"". But is it also good?The answer to the above question is not easy. The idea that the ""TBF"" plays with is clever, that's for sure: The story is about Evan Treborn (Kutcher), a boy who faces mysterious memory black-outs when faced with unhappy events. Doctors attribute this to stress, although his mother (Walters) suspects that this might be related to his hospitalized father's mental illness. Things get really nasty though, when a mischief conducted by him, his friend Kay (Smart), her brother Tommy (Scott), and their friend Lenny (Henson), goes really awry. This event makes the life of everyone take a dramatic turn, but the problem is that Evan (and the viewer), have no clue of what happened due to a black-out he faced. Then suddenly after many years, Evan discovers that there is a way to reveal his lost memories; however, this brings some unintended and strange side-effects...If this sounds a bit confusing, then rest assured that it is much more complicated than that; in fact, the main weakness of the film is that although it is based on a very good idea, the scenario gets too complicated and over-stretched. If it was kept a bit ""lighter"", then I would sure grade the movie 2 notches higher in the 10-point grade scale than the 6/10 grade I have given it.The performances are more than satisfactory, especially if you take into account the fact that there are no grand names involved. So is the direction, despite the difficulty posed by the frequent flash-backs and twists that are required by the scenario.In brief, the film is overall OK, but had the potential for meeting even higher expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Kelso acts ""serious"".","Got a sneak preview of this flick on January 21st.  Seeing it for free never hurts the review.This movie is good.  The performances for the most part are pretty strong. With the one exception towards the end of the movie when Ashton asks the doctor for his notebooks in an intense voice but doesn't pull it off and just sounds like goofy kelso acting angry.  For the most part, Ashton's acting wasn't that bad.  To be honest I expected much worse and therefore wasn't that disappointed.The movie also started to get ridiculous when Ashton started using his time travel power capriciously.  All he needed to do was be able to just see his old writing on a piece of paper and BAM he was instantly in a trance and into time travel mode.  This was a little silly in the jail sequence when he runs into the cell, grabs the notebook, reads a few words as the goons are chasing and BAM, like a magic spell he is warped out of there.....So in short, the screenplay is average with some pieces of the plot a bit too contrived.The director did a great job.  The camera work and editing and sound effects were excellent.  Simple conversations that turned really intense shocked the viewers as they should.And the acting is good, with Ashton doing a decent job and the rest of the cast doing very well I might add (the guy who played Tommy needs a bit more polish to be believable).So overall, a good but not great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thought-provoking,"I went to see this film with 3 friends, none of us expecting too much, and we were all very surprised. I found the film to be thought-provoking and it is one of the few films in recent memory I've seen where I actually gave a damn about the characters. I found myself actually flinching at parts of the film and wishing certain bits wouldn't happen, even though you knew they would. The best acting jobs in the entire film are done by the children. Those playing Kutcher and Smart and especially William Lee Scott in thier troubled years do outstanding jobs. My advice to anyone wanting to see this film is to go into it with an open mind and don't try and pick holes in the time-travel theory. Suspend your disbelief and just allow yourself to say ""well maybe this is how it would happen"", only then will you get the true experience. It may suffer from ""Back To The Future"" syndrome regarding time-travel, but that's only an annoyance if you let it be. Don't.

OK movie with lots of problems,"""The Butterfly Effect"" marked Ashton Kutcher's debut into more ""serious"" acting roles.  While most of the time he came off as believable there were a handful of scenes that just didn't work.  He sure is trying, and it really isn't all that bad for his first attempt.  The movie has some pretty interesting story developments and makes you think.  However, a lot of the time spent thinking is over the plot holes that just don't seem to make sense.Evan Treborn suffers from a disease where he blacks out events of his life and can't remember them.  Through reading through the journals that he keeps Evan is somehow able to go back in time and change events.  His decisions later influence the future and how he and his friends turn out.  Apparently the changes only effect major events, as Evan can still go back to his blackouts after things have already been changed.The film is an interesting science-fiction trip, but the story just fails to make sense sometimes.  It's a solid effort, but it really comes out way too buggy.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sore Disappointment,"The butterfly effect in chaos theory and time travel have nothing to do with each other, thus the title of the movie has nothing to do with the movie. At best, it is an average time travel movie. At worst, it is the vision of someone who read something interesting in physics once, understood absolutely nothing, and made a movie about it. Unnecessarily dark and at some point the scenarios seem almost comically exaggerated. Maybe I'm ""objectively wrong"" but that was my impression. The Butterfly Effect feels like one of those really pretentious films that tries to be the big thing of its generation, but it turned out to be a sore disappointment due to lazy inconsistent writing. As much as I tried to I could not care about the main character because of how stupid he was. Not only that, but most characters actions and dialogue did not feel natural at all, they felt like they were simply pasted there solely for plot convenience. The time travel also does not make sense, I hate that they never even try to explain how it works, all that you get it ""When he looks at book he goes back in time and everything becomes bad.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Dude, where's my suspense?","In an ideal world, this movie would have been a clever little movie that explored its cast of characters through a series of experiments in cause and effect. Unfortunately, in reality The Butterfly Effect falls short. The movie shows plenty of signs throughout that it's simply trying too hard to be clever and suspenseful - some scenes feel forced, especially towards the end as it starts trying to tie everything up.I could imagine that this film might have hoped to be a sort of sci-fi Memento, though it falls plenty short of that lofty mark. Memento did a far better job of developing its cast of characters (which, in turn, was portrayed by a stronger group of actors) and was much more tightly written. The Butterfly Effect would probably prefer that you brush over the details as it's filled with inconsistencies and even contradicts itself at times.Still, the ""gimmick"" central to the movie is actually pretty interesting and, as I'm a sucker for these kinds of things, I appreciated what mileage they managed to get out of it. If you think the plot synopsis sounds interesting, you'll probably find it enjoyable. If not, you're probably wise to look elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

More Enjoyable Than That Other Similar Time Travelling Film,"It seems that word of mouth has affected peoples' enjoyment of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT with many comments reflecting bitter disappointment . In many ways these feelings sum up what happened when I saw DONNIE DARKO , a similar type of movie featuring teen angst and time travel . The main difference though was that I'd heard all the lavishing praise thrown at DARKO while I'd had no knowledge of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT until the credits started on Channel 4 last nightIt's not a masterpiece of course but many of the complaints can be dismissed that it's utterly depressing featuring scenes of animal cruelty , sex , violence etc but would you have preferred a film with Michael J Fox going back to 1950s High School ? Much of the film works simply because protagonist Evan finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place and despite the criticisms of casting Ashton Kutcher by some people you really can believe that a good looking pretty boy would find them self popular in prison for the wrong reasonsThe screenplay by Gruber and Bress does raise an interesting point that destiny will always win out in changing the past . You might be able to stop a bad thing happening to someone but you'll never stop something else terrible happening to you or someone close to you by changing a big bad event . The plot might be full of mystic mumbo jumbo but it's a film that is much easier to follow than DONNIE DARKO which makes it a superior film",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You can't change who people are without destroying who they were.,"The Butterfly Effect - Directors CutThe Butterfly Effect is directed by Eric Bress and Bress co-writes the screenplay with J. Mackye Gruber. It stars Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters, Amy Smart, Elden Henson, William Lee Scott, Eric Stoltz and Ethan Suplee. Music is by Michael Suby and cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti.The title refers to the butterfly effect, the chaos theory of a popular hypothetical situation that illustrates how small initial differences may lead to large unforeseen consequences over time. The plot pitches Kutcher as Evan Treborn who suffers blackouts during during critical mments in his life. When older he finds that through reading the journals he has written since a child, that he can go back in time to the significant events and change what happens. Unfortunately each time he does it comes at a great cost...It was mercilessly kicked by the pro critics upon release, not helped by coming at a time when Kucher was something of a kicking post to critics. To compound the misery for the makers, they released a theatrical cut that featured a quite apalling ending. Inspite of these trevails at the time of release, the pic made a pot load of cash at the box office. Once the Directors Cut surfaced, with a key scene added to cement the different - quality - ending, time has seen the stock of the pic rise considerably. So much so that it currently sits at a 7.6 rating on IMDb and a 75% rating on TMDB, wile there are some critics who have come out and admitted they were too quick to judge the first release back in 2004.What we have is a time travelling corkscrew narrative that is immensely sombre in telling how ones actions can have far-reaching consequences. It's a compelling and often thrilling picture, one that can spark hearty debate about the thematics at work - notably we the audience being forced to contemplate our own actions in life. The pic demands the utmost attention, switching off for a few minutes is a definite no no. Some scenes linger long in the memory as we trawl through the evil that kids and men do, right up to the unforgettable finale.There's plot and logic holes, that are small irritants, and even though this definitely could have been better cast with more senior actors, none of the youthful cast members hurt the picture. It packs a punch, that is on proviso you only see the directors cut. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just short of the mark,"I went to see this film with an open mind as to what was going to happen, i didn't expect anything amazing to happen, which is the point of view everyone should go into a film with, however nothing amazing did happen. The concept is one that hasn't really been used a lot to my knowledge, and could have been really done well, but the film didn't really go anywhere from the start, it stayed to the lines all the way through the film, what you see in the trailer is the film basically. When watching the film I expected it just to go that bit further but it never really took off!Also another point that really didn't help the film was the acting, no offence to the lead character (Ashton Kutcher) but so not the type of film he should attempt to do, from other films that I have seen him in, you just expect him to say something funny or stupid, and sort of ruined the seriousness that the film was trying to get across. Meanwhile the other actors, didn't really have the chance to show off there talents, The lead actress (Melora Walters) was however quite good with the time she had on screen, I look forward to seeing her in more films. The other actors all played to there expected parts.Over all this film I have to say is not really a stunner, and probably not one that you are going to remember, but at least worth a watch just so you can make your own opinion about the film. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When the Theatrical Version is Much Better than the Director's Cut,"`The Butterfly Effect' is presently in the movie theaters of Rio de Janeiro, but last Thursday I rented an imported Infinifilm DVD. I saw the theatrical version two days ago and I have just finished watching the director's cut. I found the theatrical version an excellent, unpredictable and intriguing screenplay. The director's cut has a few modifications along the story, the larger when Evan is sent to prison. However, I really did not like the end of the director's cut. I prefer the commercial happy sappy ending showed in the deleted scenes of the theatrical version. I do not know how common this system is in USA, but in Brazil, we do not have any Infinifilm DVD. I found the commands a little complicated to be operated. For example, I did not find the subtitles. I used the TV closed caption to get the subtitles in English. I highly recommend the theatrical version of this intriguing film. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Efeito Borboleta' (`Butterfly Effect')",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"haven't seen this until now, I regret skipping past this many times.","I'm shocked on how good this movie was, I swear critics hate every good movie and love every nonsensical movie. Anyway this is a gripping, unforgettable, and quite frankly f'ed up ride to sit through, it has many twists and extremely suspenseful and crazy plot, ashton kutcher is surprisingly good which is not what I was expecting lol. I heavily recommend this movie if you want a gripping thriller that you'll never forget.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ashton Kutcher in good film shock!,"Ashton Kutcher isn't generally regarded as being synonymous with great movie-making (I can appreciate that not everyone loves 'Dude, Where's My Car?' as much as I do), but if there's one title in his filmography that genuinely excuses the guy for his endless forgettable roles in crap rom-coms, it's gotta be The Butterfly Effect—the dude puts in a sweet performance!Kutcher plays Evan, a young man whose troubled life has been blighted by memory loss; when Evan realises that by reading the journals he has kept since a child he can travel into the past, he gradually begins to fill in the missing pieces of his memory. Meddling with the past, however, is not without its risks...Admittedly, The Butterfly Effect is in danger of unravelling in a big old mess of improbabilities and impossibilities if studied too closely—that kind of thing happens with even the most meticulously plotted time-travel/alternate time-line movies— but if you allow yourself to just sit and accept things as they happen, you'll find the film a rewarding and very entertaining experience that will take you through the gamut of emotions and really drive home the importance of making the right decisions in life.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wanted to love this,"I really wanted to love this film.  As it was, it was alright, but it could have been much better.  First of all, there was some serious acting issues in the film.  Ashton wasn't so bad, but other parts of the cast, like his mom, really was.  The story was cool, but there were some really forced plot points in the beginning, and in the very end which hurts the film.  It seems to me that the makers had this great idea, and knew in general what they wanted to do, but needed a quick way out because they just couldn't figure out what else to do.  All of the plot problems could have easily been solved though with just a little reworking.  No other real major complaints, and fairly enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An under-rated masterpiece,"The Butterfly Effect ranks among the best movies I have ever seen. It proves that you don't need big names to make a film that will have lasting appeal. Although everyone involved in the film, from directors Bress-Gruber to main actors Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters and Amy Smart are not household names, they prove to be artists in the truest sense. And the soundtrack is so appropriate. When I decided to watch the movie, I was admittedly skeptical that something so obscure could be as powerful as a friend described it to be. But my friend was right. The Butterfly Effect is that rare gem of a movie that entertains while giving the viewer food for thought. The edition that I borrowed from my local DVD club had an accompanying disc with interviews where renowned academics define the ""butterfly effect."" The movie and the accompanying interviews are a truly thought-provoking experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty good d00d...,"This was a lot better than I expected. Kutcher is very good and believable in the lead role. And while the plot does have holes in it - there were a lot fewer than in most Hollywood movies and the film at least tried to make things consistent. The premise of the film, the mood of impending doom, and the fact that you really do care about the characters more than make up for the flaws in logic. I'd also like to compliment the filmmakers for having a non-Disney ending but more likely the credit goes to a perceptive test audience. Anyway I was surprised that there are negative reviews in the mainstream media but then again I haven't read them since they have become totally irrelevant with the advent of IMDB...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The worst kind of film,"The Butterfly Effect is a special example of the very worst kind of film. If it had merely been dull or boring it would have just been another bad film that simply vanished over time. If only.The Butterfly Effect is so mind-twistingly stupid, so incomprehensibly brainless that it can sometimes manage to trick you into thinking it's clever. It's what people do when they're not intelligent enough to make a consistent, engaging story. They take a concept, string a bunch of bizarre and confusing scenes together and end it with some asinine ""twist"" in an attempt to stun the audience so they don't notice that nothing makes any sense.The film endlessly contradicts itself, thinking it's getting ever more thrilling when really it's just digging itself a deeper hole. It doesn't even adhere to it's own rules or logic, and in a film that is supposed to be about the nature of cause and effect, it's only real obligation is to be consistent to itself. Sadly, this is all too hard for the makers of The Butterfly Effect.The concept of a magic diary that sends you back in time is a hard thing to sell at the best of times, but when you give up trying to sell it altogether and try and pass it off as 'surreal' or 'abstract' then you're just adding insult to injury.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What movie did you people see?,"This is one of the worst films of the year - a true howler. The plot is ridiculous (and I love time travel scenarios). Kutcher simply cannot carry a film, and I can't say much for the acting of the other ""leads,"" either. I watched this with five friends, and we all found it laughable, at best. The script is a cheat, never explaining exactly ""what"" is going on. And, if Kutcher is able to keep changing the past, resulting in a different future, how does he manage to remember all that happened in every single variation? Personally, I found the acting and dialogue of the childhood version of the characters to be distracting and annoying.WHAT is that fat,""goth"" college roommate even doing in this screenplay?The whole ""frat"" alternate universe totally disregards Kutcher's character's personality, regardless of what changes he makes.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Change your life before it has changed you,"Would you like to change your life before it has changed you? To get back to your past and cap the holes? It's much harder than you think, even if you have the moments in your past you didn't live and have a chance to live them out whenever you want! Basically, that's the plot of ""The Butterfly Effect"". Nothing shocking, nothing scaring, not really much stunning but still well-made, well-acted and indeed well-invented in 1972 by Edvard Lorenz, the meteorologist from the Massachusets Institute of Technology.Direction, editing, light and make-up are amazing. Photography is not outstanding but still fine. Special effects are barely present: they are not needed in this story. In fact, the film could be a little shorter but then it would make some final scenes misunderstood. The biggest screenplay hole is that it seems like the characters can either live in perfect harmony or get to the penitentiary or the madhouse.Psychology-fiction. I don't really like such kind of movies but this one is 8 of 10. Don't ask for the matter, just watch it. And further try to think before you do.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
the director's cut was much better,"I really thought this movie was underrated because no one wants to take Ashton kutcher seriously. I feel that critics were waiting for him to fail in this movie. I did not see the movie until it was out on video and was shocked by how much I liked Butterfly Effect. It was a good movie that made you think. But the Director's cut was much much better. I thought it made it a more unique movie and kept you thinking even after the movie was over. I think it would have done much better if they stuck to the director's cut.

The Butterfly Effect!,"The Butterfly Effect is a very unique film that has a different cast including Eric Stoltz, Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters, Amy Smart, Elden Henson, William Lee Scott, Nathaniel DeVeaux, and Ethan Suplee. The acting by all of these actors is very good. Kutcher and Smart are excellent in this film. I thought they were really great together. The mystery is really good and some of it is unbelievable. The movie is filmed very differently. The music is very good. The film is quite exciting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. The Butterfly Effect is not for everyone. There are some scenes that are unsuitable for the squeamish but it is a decent and thrilling film.

Makes you think...,"The film has some really scary moments thanks to clever editing and excellent sound effects, and some incredible visuals. The film deserves a few viewings, as everything might not make complete sense the first time around. Once you know the story and the outcome, its easier to piece everything together. Ashton Kutcher is excellent in the film. Memory and fantasy starts to blur as Evan (Ashton) reprograms his mind, and he remembers events as he would have wanted them to materialize. The film is all about decisions. How different would our lives be (have been) based on a simple decision at a given moment? The film portrays this so effectively, and makes me think. The film is pretty much about ""What if...""?Very unpredictable ending. Well done!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I am finally able to write this review.,"On December 10th (a day before I am writing this review) I had to watch this movie for the second time- just to make sure that it was still the best movie that I have seen all year.It is.By watching this the second time, it simply drove in the fact that this movie was as ingeniously put together as I originally thought.Please, if you have never watched the film, do not be put off by its peculiar, seemingly mediocre beginning. I almost was, and I nearly missed a masterpiece.I was expecting- as many of you reading this probably are, or were- something totally and utterly different. The trailers gave the impression that this would be yet another thoughtless slasher horror flick. Ashton Kutcher's presence in the movie did not help. I had never previously watched any of his movies, and you would hope that ""Dude, Where's my Car?"" was at least as good as ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"", but I have my doubts.In this, however, Ashton Kutcher displayed for us his ability to both act in a serious role, and act in a serious role with excellence.More importantly, this was not at all the bloody teen horror film that I expected, but an intricately sewn together thriller that was based (although loosely) on the theory after which it was named- The Butterfly Effect. This theory states that small events can have catastrophic effects- such as the flapping wings of a butterfly acting as the prerequisite to a hurricane.Of course, you probably know the synopsis. After losing the woman that he loves, a man learns how to go back in time (no, I will not tell you how) and attempts to change the past, but each time he tries to change it, he ends up changing too much.Apart from being deliciously entertaining, The Butterfly Effect helped to drive in something that I had always known, but never wanted to believe. As cheesy as it may sound, The Butterfly Effect has made me realize how important it is to be grateful for life exactly as it is. I will quote from the movie, ""There is no perfect. You can't change what people are without changing what they were."" And, ""You can't play God."" This movie does not fit into just one genre. It is a science fiction, a fantasy film, a romance, and a drama, all rolled into one. Some may think this makes it disjointed, but I believe that it gives the film a depth that so many others lack. At times it made me laugh, other times it made me cover my face with horror, but for the most part it always had me at the edge of my seat.I also cried when it ended- which despite me being a sappy female happens very seldomly with movies. Yes, it was just that moving.Of course, I have my own opinions about what Evan should have done (the part of me that was in support of him changing things at all) but I will leave them to myself. What he should have done is not as important as what he does do. As a popular band once said, it is about the journey, not the end or the start.Now, if you do not get the movie the first time, try watching it a second time. Doing that helped me, too, even though I got most of it on the first try, and it has helped other viewers as well.Lastly, I must address the way this film is constantly compared to Donnie Darko and Memento- both of which I have seen before. The Butterfly Effect is not nearly as confusing as either of those, and the plot is radically different. Memento is played backwards for one, and Donnie Darko is sometimes more allegorical than it is literal and much darker a film than either one. They have almost nothing to do with each other in my opinion, apart from the fact that I liked all three, and that they do not follow the chronological patterns of your average movie.There ends the similarity.Oh, and by the way? The movie really is very violent, and its R rating quite deserved. The violence, however, is not the focus of the film, so please do not allow this to deter you from watching the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Float like a butterfly, sting like Quantum Physics....","If you could go back in time and change just one thing, could you? What could you change, without altering the present noticeably? This is one issue looked at in this movie; it works well. It is a pleasant film, diverting and interesting, demanding that the viewer be an active participant, not merely cruise along.I saw the movie on TV, and it had me thinking from the start: through carefully setting up the important scenes, a story is told (involving parallel universes). The conclusion is so obvious:but only because the preceding multiple universes do not have the desired effect.The acting is okay, and the film is gripping.It's much better than the overrated documentary ""What the bleep do we know"" and, while not as tightly or artfully structured as ""Sliding Doors"", it raises issues and doesn't try to answer these glibly.An interesting film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent,"I just got back from a showing of The Butterfly Effect and I have to admit, it wasn't at all what I expected. It's hard to get into the specifics of the plot without spoiling the experience, so I will simply say that this is one movie anyone who has ever thought about how great it would be to change their past should see.The Butterfly Effect is a rare breed of cinema, which is not nearly as Hollywood as the movie poster might lead you to believe. This film is dark and gritty, almost hard to watch at times. The first thirty minutes is unlike anything you'll find in 99% of films in America which receive major release. Of all the traumatic childhood events I've seen movie characters in turmoil over, these are the only ones I've ever really bought.But by far this film's greatest aspect is it's story, which unfolds similar to Memento. No we're not watching everything backwards, but  seeing bits and pieces that come together later. Much like the memories of the main character played by Ashton Kutcher.Kutcher has caught a lot of grief from the critics about his performance in this film, but I couldn't disagree more. Quite frankly, I couldn't picture anyone else more fitting. While his acting may still not be ""Oscar Worthy,"" I think its safe to say he owned this role and has at least earned himself one new fan.Final Rating: 4 out of 4 Stars",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Highly recommended,"Haven't seen this movie in a long time. Excellent movie: Score, plot and idea, direction. Made me tear more than once.Ashton Kutcher: I'm not a fan, but this is probably his best role. He's very good in most of the movie.Amy Smart: Come on, I love this girlEric Stoltz: He is always great and here he is perfect in a minor role (P.S.: What happened to Stoltz's career? What a waste of his talent, should have won an Oscar by now).Melora Walters: She took me out of the film a few times. Her acting is very uneven. She can be good and she can be lousy.All the other cast members are also good in their roles.I should probably mention that I watched the director's cut. IMO it's MUCH better than the theatrical version.I can't decide whether this movie deserves a 7/10 or a 7.5/10. It's great, yet you always feel that something isn't really perfect.Oh, don't try to watch any of the sequels. They are terrible.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could have been good,"If there is any one thing that REALLY holds this movie back, it's probably MTV eye-candy Ashton Kutcher. Sure the script is weak and smacks of late night pot sessions, sure the direction is alternatingly sloppy and overwrought, and sure I reached the movie's end thinking 'why the hell should I care?'...but all these considerations are nothing compared to the mess that is Kutcher's acting! The kid can not act his way out of a paper bag, and I don't know what would possess anyone to put him in such a demanding dramatic role (more demanding, honestly, than popcorn fare like this should ever expect). The only reason I can see to have put this guy -- whose previous credits included portraying the chowderhead on 'That 70's Show' and HIMSELF on the idiotic 'Punk'd' -- in this role was to get ANYONE to see it! Seriously: would anyone have gone to see a movie about the paradoxes of time travel if some schmuck nobody knew was in the lead role? Almost certainly not. At least with Kutcher on the posters you'd at least snag the poor suckers who thought 'Donnie Darko' was the deepest thing ever... Aside from they abysmal Kutcher, this movie had certain things going for it. It is, essentially, a clever premise, but a tough one to tackle. A writer could never be certain how far to go when trying to calculate the changes one could effect in one's own life and the world if able to go back and change key events in one's past. And the creators of 'Final Destination 2' are not necessarily up to the task. But why should they be? Nobody expects much of them, and this movie will assuredly become another short-term classic for high-school/college half-thinkers to hash over as they play it again and again, searching for greater meaning than will ever be there. See this movie only if you're a time-travel nut...or a 13-year-old with pretensions toward genius. Otherwise, anyone could sit this one out, and spend the time changing their own life.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Really Sophisticated Film,"Ashton Kutcher (whom I never took seriously) stars in this semi-scjence fiction/psychological drama. Kutcher's character is introduced to us as a young child, living with his single mom, her husband incarcerated in a facility for the criminally insane. The boy begins to have blackouts, usually when something bad takes place. He hangs out with some kids who have messed up existences, one in particular. His psychiatrist recommends that he keep a journal which may at some point be used as a trigger for what is happening to him and which may fill in the blank spaces. Others have already commented significantly; suffice it to say that the Butterfly Effect (which is part of Chaos Theory, showing that a small event changed in the past could alter the present in dramatic or even destructive ways) comes into play in a big way. When Kutcher reads from his journal, he leaps into the past with opportunities to relive or change it. I found this movie to be a real mind bender with a great story.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Incredible Movie and Script,"The fact that nearly 500.000 people voted for this movie and nearly 1.200 people wrote a review shows clearly how this movie made the people feel about this incredible little gem. You cannot compare it to Donny Darko guys this is different here. Having a very heavy youth here the group of ""friends"" are shown and Evan with his power is trying to save everyone here.

Surprise surprise,"I'm as surprised as anyone that Ashton Kutcher has done a good movie, but he has pulled it off. The Butterfly Effect is the very violent, depraved story of a guy who has suffered blackouts his entire life in order to block out painful and traumatic experiences.  When the memories start flooding back, he discovers that he can go back in time and change the future by altering events of the past, with disastrous results. This is a good, strong suspenseful movie with superb acting by the mostly reliable Amy Smart and Ethan Suplee(Mallrats represent!) and a decent performance by Kutcher. I don't think Suplee's part was big enough to warrant the starring credit he's received but that's not a big deal. About 3/4 of the way through the movie you start to figure out that the writer had no idea how to end the film, and the abrupt unsatisfying finish only proves it. Still, this is a good movie for fans who want to see a new twist on the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" theme.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Maybe the past has been changed.,"Prior to ""The Butterfly Effect"" it seemed like Ashton Kutcher's movies were among the stupidest, with ""That '70s Show"" as his only good credit. This movie will shock anyone. Portraying a teenage boy messing with the paradox of time travel - meaning that if you change even one thing in the past, the future will be completely different - it really grips you. It's the sort of movie that makes you afraid to touch things, wondering what sort of strange ripple effects your actions might have.So do see it. What this movie portrays just might save your life.

Best psychological thriller movie ever !,Each decision changes the trajectory of your life completely !,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Stick with it,The plot of this movie is tangled and at first appears to be disturbing and weird. Thankfully we stuck with it and it develops into a clever and innovative storyline and the seemingly random scenes at the beginning come together in a brilliant fashion. Ashton Kutcher is surprisingly deep considering his performance in other movies. It may merit a second watch as I think it will be one of those movies where you miss things early on that link into the plot later. Drama/Fantasy/Scifi/Thriller certainly describes this movie as it has a little of everything and yet it isn't overly graphic and doesn't rely on shock factor to be compelling.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fantastic concept,One of my favourite films explores an ingenious concept and does it in an intelligent way that leaves you wondering what could have been! It delves deep into what effect small decisions have on our future and allows us to live the fantasy of fate. I love how it explores every possibility and looks at how our decisions have consequences right from a young age. It explores dark themes which gives it an edgier feel but without making it too extreme. The acting is excellent and the storytelling is fantastic.

"A very stale awful rip off of ""Donnie Darko""...","""The Butterfly Effect"" is a rather ludicrous hybrid of two very good movies ""Donnie Darko"", and ""Frequency"" and what results is the bastard child of the two, a pretty dumb and utterly pretentious jumbled drama that is never sure what it's trying to say, or what in fact it's trying to mean. Is it a tragedy? Drama? Thriller? Science Fiction? Fractured Romance? Does the butterfly effect really apply to this, or is that theory just used as a plot device for this? I was never really sure what exactly, but what I was sure of in the end is that this definitely is none of the more complex dimensions above, instead it's just more like a really long practice in human misery, and cruelty than anything else.As I stated in the aforementioned paragraph above, this tries to be two movies, firstly like ""Donnie Darko"" a film about a troubled boy attempting to seek a purpose in a world he's not sure he's supposed to be in and seeks to stop tragedy to strings of events even including the usual Christ references, and then there's the concept on which the events in the future, with the help of a special ability, can change the past and tragic events, but somehow, the slightest change only makes things worse.""Frequency"" was a very good study of the Chaos theory and while creating a very engrossing thriller also managed to demonstrate the complexities and sheer fascinating results by it, while ""The Butterfly Effect"" uses it more as a mere plot device rather than a concept to revolve around. The butterfly effect or The Chaos Theory discovered by Edward Lorenz is the theory that the slightest alteration in a current environment can alter the people, the situation, the time period, and environment with humongous and many times disastrous repercussions, and regardless of how much the environment has been repaired, the results can continue to remain disastrous regardless of the length of repairs, thus was examined by Lorenz after he mistakenly altered a series of numbers during an experiment and no matter what he did couldn't go back to the original series of numbers.Now, if ""The Butterfly Effect"" revolved around the concept of the actual theory for the purposes of the story, examining it further, dealing with the mass complexities, and at least practicing in originality, this may have been such a good movie, but instead it never deals with the actual theory, and instead just proceeds in dealing out themes and contexts that reminded me a lot of snuff film, and most of which I felt were just shown for shock value on the writers part to keep the audience cringing, most of the time it left me cringing but not for the reasons you'd think. Many times the events are so ridiculous you can almost hear the screenwriter manipulating the audience for shock value including one scene when the kids stuff a large firecracker in a mailbox as a prank, and it just happens to go off at the ""right moment"" which you'll see. It's a scene that I'm sure was intended for people to gasp in shock and cover their eyes, but from where I sat, it was just so darn ridiculous.""The Butterfly Effect"" is not an intelligent film thought it deals with fascinating themes, it's still just a really one-dimensional quasi-thriller with nothing going for it except a script that copies ""Donnie Darko"" page for page, but there was a difference, ""Donnie Darko"" was a very good, thought provoking thriller that never went to extremes for the purpose of shocking the audience, while this deals with a grab bag of ""taboo"" plot devices that wants to be daring, but is just manipulative.Dabbling in suggestive but very uncomfortable themes of incest, pedophilia, child abuse, animal cruelty and extreme violence that, again, borders on snuff for the sheer purposes of making the audience gasp, this will be a very uncomfortable experience as it was for me. The story is ultimately very skewed in its approach taking a more routine approach that we've seen before in ""The Twilight Zone"" and the short lived and hardly remembered ""That was Then"" but they were done a lot better though they never acknowledge the concept.""The Butterfly Effect"" has the ability to observe what their story is working with but is just filled with constant miserable sequences including a lot of violent content, a lot of sexual references, and delves into the incredibly campy by the climax, with one ridiculous result from the main character's attempt to alter life, and then, as if the writers have given up, the concept is thrown out the window and the whole plot is stretched and changed becoming very insulting towards the audiences intelligence with an attempted surprise ending, but by then we realize we've just wasted a lot of our own time we can never get back.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Interesting and original,"A conveluted and quite complex plot, written brilliantly and acted very well indeed by Ashton and his co workers. I state 'Ashton and his co workers', because this really is Ashton Kutcher at his best. The support cast are credible, but at a time when Kutcher was trying to break away from his fun but forgettable roles such as Dude Wheres my Car, and his stint on Punked, this film couldn't have been any better. This is definitely a film you need to concentrate on for every minute, as one moment of the story you miss, may lose you in the following events that occur. I have seen many films that use time travel as a plot line, and i have seen many fail because of it. But this film gets it bang on, and by the end you are really anticipating how Evan will sort the whole mess out to make everyone happy, because if you shred away the many layers of this film all he is trying to do is exactly that, bring happiness to people who only know despair. i would love to see Ashton Kutcher in similar roles to this, as i feel his career has begun to tail off into mondane and mediochre rom-coms. A truly great film, very underrated and very understated.On another note, DO NOT WATCH THE SECOND ONE. It is the biggest smack in the face to any film franchise, completely loses the whole ideology of this film, and becomes a poorly acted farce.P.S Very clever use of character name Evan Treborn.

This film is one of a kind, going in I was hesitant to see whether I would agree with the critics who bashed the film back in 2004 when it released, or agree with the many reviewers who praised the film on IMDb. I loved it. I haven't felt this moved in a film in a very long time, and it may not be perfect in every regard, but it is a film that has given me much to think about, and one I look forward to watching again in the future. To start, I will list the biggest problems with the film. The main problem I saw throughout was the casting of Amy Smart in the role of Kayleigh (at least when she is an adult). She nails the performance in some circumstances, but more often than not, her portrayal of the character seems a bit out of place in the whole scheme of things, not playing the character effective enough throughout the film to feel like she is the right person to have been casted. Nevertheless, I still found myself enjoying many of the scenes with her in it, as Ashton Kutcher surprisingly is great in this film. I have always appreciated him as an actor in the entertaining sense, as I have seen him in other films like Dude Where's My Car? And watched him on That 70's Show, but his performance here is incredibly profound, and very deeply grounded. He not only feels perfect in the role, as well as great with his line delivery, but he truly put the effort involved into the making the film, as he studied psychology, mental disorders, and chaos before and during the film to fit the part. The script, needless to say, is brilliant. It's very ambitious, but it works so well, you'll be surprised how well it is all executed. In the end, I found up loving this film, and I recommend it to all who are a fan of Sci-fi, Ashton Kutcher, or want something truly unforgettable.

It's about time!,"I have long been searching for a first-class film and thankfully, my pursuit has not proved to be futile. This was by far one of the best pieces ever created in the film industry, and here's why; The plot was original and the dialogue flowed throughout the film's course. Every character was portrayed with flawlessness and the directing was done with perfect execution.I remember watching this movie as a kid, I remember liking it. And even though it is seldom that I re-watch a movie, I just knew this one was in dire need of a second look.It was very refreshing to see Ashton Kutcher in a serious role for a change, one where he depended on his ability to connect with the audience rather than solely relying on his charisma and wittiness to earn our admiration. This is without a doubt his finest work to date, and it is quite saddening that he has chosen to selectively pursue comedy roles when he is obviously a talented young man. The butterfly effect definitely showed us a side of him we haven't been given a chance to see before, which I doubt we'll get another glimpse of in the future.The film grabbed my attention from the get-go, and never did it fail to lose it – it kept me interested with every scene.And unsurprisingly, this film was produced in 2004, back when films had a hardcore story line – it is quite heartbreaking that the quality of movies has severely deteriorated since then.This film is well worth the watch, and it leaves you with the satisfying thought that maybe ""everything does happen for a reason"" and that even though we may contemplate the past and ponder on how things might've ended up differently had we made different choices, it wouldn't necessarily be ""for the better"". For you see, life and all of its consequences are tightly linked by a series of events and should one of those incidents become somehow altered, it leads us to a downward spiral and ultimately, another life. We may strongly believe that fate is not on our side, but somehow, it always comes together eventually.There was a prevailing message in the film about how sometimes the only thing we can do is to let someone go, and how every now and again we are faced with situations where we have to make the tough decision of being selfless for the sake of others.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ashton continues to surprise,"I can't figure out Ashton Kutcher. On That 70's Show I thought he had potential. He did Just Married, which I personally found quite amusing, and thought he was good in. Then he became tabloid fodder and was everywhere, being the annoying, obnoxious guy we all see him to be. I blame Punk'd. I admit, I find some of them very funny, but he just comes across as so completely immature and obnoxious. But then I see this film, and again I think he's got something. He played his role quite well, and never once resorted to his usual style of lowest-common-denominator humor.I'd probably closest compare this to Final Destination. It's something different, very well done, with its own tone and style, and not driven by star power. New Line Cinema continues to impress me as a force in the genre. While not anything groundbreaking or spectacular, this film is satisfying. Here's hoping Kutcher continues to make good project decisions.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A real downer,"This movie did not start out on the wrong foot. A child growing up who suffers periodic blanks in his memory when parts of his and his friends' lives take very traumatic turns. Unfortunately, after Evan found out a way to remedy all this by using his diaries, it goes downhill from there. His efforts seemed very compulsive, clumsy, and sloppy with little forethought, which might be understandable for the first couple of time jumps but frankly gets old after a while. Every change made screws up more and more of his life preventing him from fixing the previous mistakes he made as he is no longer able to write the diaries from that point on. Finally, at the end, unlike in the movie ""Groundhog Day"", he just plain gives up (in both the theatrical and director's cut).The director's cut, while probably more in the spirit of this dark, depressing film, was even worse than the theatrical, not only because of the ending but also the creepy fortuneteller and sickening political correctness. You could think of that version as the ultimate twisted antithesis of ""It's a Wonderful Life"".I mean, come on. Life isn't a bowl of cherries, but it isn't a bowl of offal either. If everyone thought the way the directors of this movie did, the human race would be doomed to extinction. And if you're trying to simply send the message that messing around with time can change the future in ways you don't want, the body of the movie did that in spades, making the failed ending unnecessary. Murphy's Law prevails throughout the film, with no respite and to a rather ridiculous degree. Two thumbs down.Also, I would keep this movie away from children. It's rated R for a reason. And if you're an adult, only see it if you're a perpetual optimist or high on Prozac.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ugh,"I had the opportunity to see a preview of this film last week, and am glad I didn't have to pay for it. Overall, it's a great concept - probably was a fabulous script - but the execution is terrible.  I didn't expect great acting from Ashton Kutcher, but he's apparently studied under the Joey Tribianni school of acting (i.e., portray emotion by pretending you smell a fart) and probably didn't graduate. The special effects are nice, and there are some cool plot points - and others which are infuriatingly stupid and nonsensical.  (A 7 year old boy convinces a pedophile to stop his with four minutes of dialogue.  Yeah, right. Too bad the mental health community never tried that.)  Some of the most suspenseful moments are destroyed by bizarre acting choices, as when Ashton throws in a goofy run during what should be a highly dramatic and tension filled escape scene.  The audience I saw this with cracked up then - as they did at other unintentionally funny moments. Somehow I think the success of the ""Scary Movie"" franchise is to blame, but for me, slapstick is a distraction when I'm watching something pretending to be a serious suspense thriller.If you're looking for an entertaining film about going back and changing the future, rent ""Groundhog Day"" or any of the ""Back to the Future"" films. In those, at least you are supposed to laugh, and your laughter won't be followed by a groan.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Transformative butterfly,"This truly is one of those films where, inside you get what it says on the package. Even though this film is about the butterfly effect theory, it also has heavy themes of change and discovery which mirror that of the butterfly.If this film was made today I don't feel it would have the same simplicity, a film like this is already complex in nature so the director chose an easy way for us to ride the rollercoaster.All in all I'd say this is a solid picture for anyone who's never viewed before. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys science fiction, drama, thriller. Even though it's not a thriller it's intense at points.Overall 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What is the Butterfly Effect?,"The Butterfly Effect is the socialization process that people go through as a child that determines their psyche, their future behavior and the type of person that they will become. There is a myriad amount of things at work here. One of the important is the relationship between youth and adulthood. Every childhood experience shapes and molds the life of adults, which is essence with every flashback that alters something new in the present. This is not just a sci-fi thriller it is a morality play on power, compassion and happiness. The title character wants to geninuely help his friends but not to a sacrifice his own happiness. When he has no hands, but everyone is happy he refuses this alternative reality, because he is crippled. He says he is doing it for his mother but he is not. Everything in life cannot be perfect or else it wouldnt be life, it would be a false reality. The center of the movie is the scene between the lead characters father and the younger version when the father tells him he cannot play God and begins to choke him. The diary is metaphor for keeping everything that encompasses your experiences with you. You will never forget what happens, but you cannot let the past dictate the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Come Back When You Grow Up,"This review recommends you watch the ""directors' cut"" before sampling the ""theatrical version"" of ""The Butterfly Effect"". Also, it will also enhance the film's effect if you refrain from reading the comments, good and bad, until after viewing; I was more intrigued by the storyline because I wasn't completely sure where the psychology and physics were going to wind up. The writer/director team of Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber kept me guessing as I did not read any comments, or even the DVD sleeve's synopsis. Bress and Gruber weave an extremely intricate, thought out, well paced, and imaginative drama.The protagonist is unstuck young ""Evan Treborn"" (played by Ashton Kutcher, John Patrick Amedori, and Logan Lerman). The film traces the lives of Evan and three childhood friends: ""Kayleigh"" (Amy Smart, Irene Gorovaia, and Sarah Widdows), ""Tommy"" (William Lee Scott, Jesse James, and Cameron Bright), and ""Lenny"" (Elden Henson, Kevin Schmidt, and Jake Kaese). Kayleigh and Tommy's abusive father (Eric Stoltz), and Evan's loving mother (Melora Walters) are the main parental figures. To say the cast exceeds expectations would be an understatement. The overall effect left by the interrelating performances is remarkable, and rarely achieves at the level evident. This is also a technically beautiful film.Be prepared. The character ""George Miller"" is a pedophile, who has obviously abused his children (off screen). ""Mr. Miller"" invites young Evan and his daughter to get undressed for his camera; it is a non-erotic, tastefully filmed scene. But, the violence, especially between the young children, is disturbing to the extreme; certainly, it shows the most devastating effects of child abuse. In the case of ""The Butterfly Effect"", artistic license trumps irreparable damages. ""I'll come back for you"" indeed.******** The Butterfly Effect (2004) Eric Bress, J.

Do You Like To Think While Watching?,"Do you like to be challenged while watching a movie? Do you like to really think about the repercussions of the actions transpiring on screen? If you answered ""Yes"" to both of those questions, then ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a movie for you!For a basic plot summary, ""Butterfly Effect"" tells the story of the rather unique Evan (Ashton Kutcher), who as a child begins to experience strange blackouts that frighten mother Andrea (Melora Walters), whose husband had a history of similar experiences. As Evan begins to age, he discovers that his blackouts all revolve around a series of traumatic memories spent with childhood acquaintances Kayleigh (Amy Smart), Lenny (Elden Henson), and Tommy (William Lee Scott). I wish I could delve more into this wonderful film, but to do so would give away too many spoilers and ruin the experience.There are two things to know about this movie right off the bat:1. Do not be scared away by Kutcher. No, he is not God's gift to thespians, but this isn't goofy Kelso here. He plays a very good role.2. Do not give up after the first 30-40, which will seem rather random and disjointed. If you can give the movie at least an hour, you will be hooked.This is very much a ""thinking person's"" movie at its core. It deals with relativistic physics and the like.

this film is about a man who wishes he could change his life for the better,"this film was fairly strong at the beginning, which is where a lot of films are at their weakest. The way that it was set out at the beginning left the viewer with a lot of questions, which I think helped relate to the confusion of the character. I liked this in a film because I often think films tend to give too much away to the viewer, and I personally like to guess and try to work it out myself, partly because when you're relating to the confusion of a character it helps you understand the emotions they encounter in the situations they are put in, and I found this a lot in this film. A lot of films kill characters and perform a lot of similar acts as though they mean nothing, which doesn't seem realistic, but this film kept it more realistic, and i found it easier to relate like this, because events were treated in such a way that they all seemed to have meaning. Although I thought this film was good emotionally, and kept the viewer entertained at the beginning, I found that after a while I began to understand the point and found it slightly boring, and I found the ending fairly predictable. But in spite of this, the ending left me feeling uneasily satisfied, questioning the rights and wrongs I encountered during the film, and trying to make sense of them all, which I found rather interesting, because, in a way, it showed me the daring to question right and wrong, and whether thats what matters, and also questioned happiness. Overall I quite enjoyed this film but it could have been a bit shorter in the middle.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Read forward if you want to know the reason why this film is overrated,"As an active member of the Internet Movie Database, I was anxious to watch this movie because I had read about it's good reviews; as a matter of fact, it had it's place in the best 250 films ever, although only for a short while (of course it is no longer there nor will it ever climb that high again)... but I was disappointed.The clue to this film is that it brings an almost (almost) absolutely new script line, which -I must admit- get's you caught until the end.The bad news are that the film has (in disgusting order): 1)Completely unnecessary rudeness and violence. I keep wondering how can it be possible that when I watch any film made 20 years ago, I do not have to worry about my little kids being around, while when I watch *any* present time film I do have to be extremely careful! 2)Serious script flaws. I'm not script flaw obsessive, but this one has HUGE script flaws.3)(this one's local) Some imbecile-alike executive in South America took the liberty of discarding pan-scan/widescreen DVD aspect and leave *only* a 3/4 distorted old TV aspect ratio, resulting in silhouettes 1/4 higher like in that old English terror series of the '70s. Awful.Anyway, -relax-, it's not a bad film.Still it's a pity, because given this script to Stanley Kubrick it would have been resulted in a multiple Oscar winner (yes, I do know he's dead).Director Adrian Lyne also, would have been astonishingly good in this line; as a matter of fact, his unique and never fairly appreciated ""Jacob's Ladder"" might be one of the only two films I know of, that resemble this one, only that ""Jacob's Ladder"" is simply a masterpiece (so this is the one film you should watch first in any case).The other one is the (very complex but) great thriller ""Mulholland Dr."" by David Lynch (which you *will* have to watch at least twice)The ending, however, is very good.In conclusion, this is a 5/10 film; maybe a 6/10 one if you are happy the day you watch it, but that's it. I give it 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Away from the Flame,"Things like this depress me. It panders; its stupid; it treats us like children.This comes from the tradition of folding the narrative by reinventing things we have seen. Probably the most celebrated of these is ""Rashomon,"" and the most famous ""Groundhog Day."" The idea is usually one of untrusted narrators through whose minds different realities flow. Sometimes the rewriting only happens after we leave the theater having seen something that reinvents what we've seen inside.It has to be clever. It has to be bold to engage us. ""The I Inside"" and ""Primer"" are so much more intelligent than this (and harder to figure out), so they actually engage.So I will advise you to stay away from this because of how dumb the writers believed you to be. But there's probably a more fundamental reason. You can be outside a story, or inside. Or you can be both, but it always starts with the outside because that's where you naturally start, even with your own life.The artists involved have to help you in. That's job number one.

The Butterfly Effect Directors Cut Review,"The Butterfly Effect is a mind-bending psychological thriller that delves into the concept of time travel and the repercussions of altering the past. Something as small as moving an item to a different spot or saying something to someone could change the way you and the lives of those around you can be altered in ways you could never imagine.The premise of the movie is incredibly fascinating and executed with skill and precision. It follows Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), who possesses the ability to revisit his past through journals, allowing him to change events and potentially reshape his life. The exploration of cause and effect, the butterfly effect theory itself, is portrayed in a compelling and intense manner, leaving you constantly engaged and intrigued. The movie follows Evan as he continually attempts to change the past so that the girl he loves Kayleigh doesn't suffer growing up while still ensuring they fall in love while also ensuring that those he cares about turn out okay as well.What sets The Butterfly Effect apart is its willingness to delve into the dark and disturbing aspects of life, tackling topics such as child abuse, mental illness, and addiction. It doesn't shy away from the consequences of Evan's actions, and it provides a gripping and unsettling exploration of the choices we make and their far-reaching impact. Evan's actions cause harm to himself and others while all the time he is trying to do the exact opposite.Ashton Kutcher delivers a surprisingly impressive performance as Evan, showcasing his range as an actor in a role far removed from his typical comedic characters. He embodies the emotional turmoil and complexities of the character exceptionally well. The beautiful Amy Smart, who plays Evan's love interest Kayleigh, is equally convincing in her role, adding depth and eye candy to the narrative.The supporting cast, including Elden Henson and William Lee Scott, contributes to the film's overall effectiveness. Each character has a pivotal role in the unfolding of the story and in showcasing the ""butterfly effect"". The ensemble cast works seamlessly together.The visual effects and sound effects in The Butterfly Effect are impressive, particularly when Evan time travels and the world around him morphs and changes. The effects help to enhance the film and were certainly pretty good for the year in which the film is made.The only thing I absolutely hated about the film is the fact that we don't get a happy ending. As I watched the DC of the movie I didn't even get the semi-happy ending the theatrical version got. That being said I prefer the DC to the theatrical version any day of the week. The DC is the perfect dark ending to the movie if they weren't going to go for a proper happy ending, and I don't mean one where Evan and Kayleigh meet 25 years later and go out on a date but a happy ending where he finally goes back and does the thing that allows him to come back to a future where he and Kayleigh are happy and in love and his friends and family are all also okay.Overall The Butterfly Effect gets a solid 9/10 from me. It's a remarkable and thought-provoking film that lingers in your mind, offering a unique and memorable cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An entertaining ride,"Watched the movie without having any idea about the plot (which I think made the storyline more puzzling and captivating).

Then in the second half, you slowly begin to make sense out of all you've watched so far.Though I couldn't connect with the movie right at the beginning, it got me hooked as the pieces of storyline began to fall together. Every flashback moment made me feel excited to see how the lives of the characters would turn out to be in the future, making me wonder what I'd do differently if I were the main character.Overall an enjoyable movie with okay acting performances: a nice pick if you want to be entertained for 2 hours or so.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Can We Choose?,"It can be seen that when one of the details is changed in the past, people's destiny will change in different directions. That is, people's life will be changed in different ways by a little bit inadvertently. This should be the reason why the film is named the butterfly effect. But the meaning of the film is not limited to the explanation of the chaotic theory of the butterfly effect. It seems to imply such a problem: if you want to make the status quo better and have the opportunity to come back from the unsatisfactory past, the ending Can it be perfect as you wish? The film also seems to give the answer: when a hypothetical tragic ending is attempted, trying to change them from the beginning often goes against the wishes, leading to a more tragic ending. This should be the theme of this film.
There are infinite possibilities in life, we can only experience one of these infinite possibilities. We always think that if the past is not very good, it will be better now, but the fact is often that if the past is really not the same, your Part of the goal is achieved, but worse things may happen to yourself or those around you. Because you are not God, you can't let things develop in the direction you set up. Even if you have the superpower to go back to the past, you still can't lead the future to your design blueprint, and you can't accurately control the direction of destiny. When you are happy to achieve a certain wish, there will always be another regret waiting for you, and there will always be things that you did not expect. Because there is always an unexpected flapping of butterfly wings, no one can grasp this except God.
The accidental flapping of butterfly wings will bring a hurricane thousands of miles away. A change in detail may bring a completely different fate. If we cannot predict or avoid when and where butterflies will flap their wings, we cannot predict or avoid which details of life will bring us huge changes. So we have to believe that existence is reasonable, and you and everything around you are the best. Do n't regret which intersection of life you have taken the wrong way, because every choice you ever made was the result of a mixture of countless antecedents and countless details in the background of space and time at that time. Make the best arrangement. It is better not to imagine changing the past. Accepting reality and moving forward is always better than indulging in the fantasy of changing the past.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Ashton Kutcher is a mediocre comedy actor, an he is totally unconvincing when trying to do serious acting. Some actors, like for example Jim Carrey, have the talent and skill to be both comedians and serious actors, but even he would have struggled being credible in this mess.If you want to see a good movie that messes with your mind in a similar way to how this one _tries to_ to do it, I'd rather recommend Donnie Darko, Mullholland Drive, or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Didn't know Kutcher had it in him, I was surprised and impressed.I am a real sucker for this butterfly effect concept and find it to be an extremely fascinating concept also IRL.You should try to get a hold on the directors cut though. I have seen both versions and the best moments of the movie is only in the directors cut.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting.,"It's funny how the people who are giving the film low ratings are the ones who are also saying negative things about Ashton Kutcher. Well.. that makes it clear on why so many people didn't like that film. I thought the film was good because it keeps your attention and does make you think. I felt as if in the end.. you could sort of decide yourself which part of Evan's memory was real and which was imaginary. I like films with something psychologically out of the ordinary and this wad interesting. The acting wasn't bad but what the hell was the point of the fat goth guy? Seriously? Other than that, there were some violence shown amongst children which people might question but it's quite common in western countries.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This film is better than people are making it out to be.,"Like many people, I went to see The Butterfly Effect because it looked interesting and original. But unlike many who like to take the words of critics and run with them as if they were their own, I enjoyed the film. I thought it was very thought provoking, and even thought the acting was not ""terrible.""  Now, I'll agree it is not the best film I've ever seen, but it does not deserve the dogging it has been receiving.I've seen and heard people saying it is Back to the Future with a dark twist. To some extent, it may be, but what this movie is really dealing with is a person's psyche. Think about what you really saw throughout the film. Let it all simmer for a minute or two, then think about the situation Evan (Ashton Kutcher) found himself in. Think about some of the subtle things dropped in throughout (i.e. the Mr. Hyde poster next to the pay phone) and then question if everything truly ended up happy like a cheery Back to the Future.If you like a thought provoking, relatively original idea, you'll probably enjoy your two hours at The Butterfly Effect.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Enjoyable movie, but misses something...","It was a good movie, an enjoyable one, but it sure misses a lot of things. I saw a lot of reviews before I watched the movie and I was surprised with some of them saying that we should watch the movie more than one time to fully understand it. I personally watched it once, won't watch it twice and I fully understood it. It wasn't so mysterious, so Christopher Nolan's like, but it sure had some interesting parts where your attention was needed. I'm giving it a 7.

Two hour MTV music video,"'Butterfly Effect' is the kind of movie that is quite entertaining the first time around, but on subsequent viewings the flaws become glaringly evident. The original idea was a good one, and in the hands of a competent film-maker, this could have been a classic. Unfortunately, the film looks like crap. The whole production has a cheap, MTV style look. Totally devoid of artistic flair, such as impressive camera angles or stylish lighting, this looks exactly like a cheapo TV show. I cannot fathom how something that looks like THIS has such a high rating on IMDb. The acting as well, is just about on TV show level as well. And I could not for one moment take the airhead 'surfer dude' Ashton Kutcher in a dramatic, serious role. This 'actor' doesn't look like he has ever experienced a real emotion in his life. Every character here was such a complete, phony stereotype; Hayley, molested by her dad, isn't just a wreck of a woman; She is the crack whore from Hell, complete with the facial scar. Or when things go right, she isn't merely a normal, well adjusted young woman; No, she is a living, breathing TV commercial, sorority girl in pink with the dork boyfriend. Ready to rule the world, just because she wasn't molested after all. And how did people contain their laughter at seeing Ashton Kutcher, fraternity boy with the yellow windbreaker and sports car? Everything here was just sooo extreme, and so outrageously;y exaggerated, as if we as an audience are so stupid, that we can only understand things in the most extreme stereotyped characters conceivable. Thumper, the obese roommate/buddy, absolutely laughable. Not only was the film poorly conceived, but it was offensive as well. exploiting subjects like sexual child abuse, prostitution, drug addiction, for the sake of making this tacky movie, pretty bad. And the absolute worst thing about this mess is that it seems to be making the arrogant, and highly ridiculous claim that it is somehow a film in the same vein as 'Seven', a film that is so superior to this MTV nightmare, that it is just ludicrous. During the scene where the kids, (who were the films only saving grace) were watching 'Seven' in a movie theatre, I really was wishing that I was watching that film instead of this one. And during the totally unbelievable 'prison sequence' I was wishing that I was watching 'American History X', or Sean Penn in 'Bad Boys'. Anything more realistic than a film where a 20 year-old Sorority babe says things like ""You said we were gonna be together forever, come Hell or High Water!"" Are we supposed to believe that anyone under the age of 65, much less a Barbie doll sorority bimbo, actually uses terms like ""Come Hell or high water?!?"" 'Butterfly Effect' has a good idea, but it has no idea of how to present it capably. I can see how people under 18 might think this is 'a cool flick', but it mystifies me that any intelligent adult would see this as a legitimate film. Yes, it is somewhat entertaining, and yes it is an ugly, 2 hour MTV video.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Movie - don;t listen to negative feedback,"All around good film.One of those that is hard to understand in the first fifteen minutes though. I was kind of lost.  Thinking to myself, ""why are we seeing this first?"" Then it all started to make sense to me as the movie played out.  The screenplay was great.  Actors do a great job too.  I really liked the film. First flick in nine years that my wife I and I both liked.  It is on my top ten, and I believe is good enough for at least some nominations this fall. I like films with twists, and odd circumstances, with weird and out of the ordinary plots.  This one was right up my ally.  Others who did not like the film, probably got bored with it early on.

"Change One Thing, Change Everything","The Butterfly Effect is a brain teasing thriller, that slowly connects Evan Treborn's childhood blackouts to his father's special gift. As Evan grows up he experiences multiple mysterious blackouts. Evan and his friends are very devious and end up doing taking pranks too far. Because of Evans blackouts he can't remember what dangerous actions he had done. Years later Evan takes a look at his childhood journals and they end up taking him to places he doesn't remember. Evan has the ability to go back into his childhood and change the past in order to change the future.Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber first introduce the film with a low-lighted, flat angle shot of the main character, Evan Treborn, running through the halls of a mental institution. The character is dressed in a hospital gown which suggests that he was a patient at that hospital. The lighting stays the same for a sequence, then moves to a downward facing camera angle as Evan Treborn crawls under a desk and scribbles in a journal. The film consists of multiple camera angles to entertain and thrill the audience.The Butterfly Effect is packed with several flashbacks. In the beginning, the use of flashbacks in this film make the storyline hard to follow, but these flashbacks are necessary at the end of the film. Along with flashbacks, the directors use a specific selection of music in the film. The music creates suspense and keeps the audience focused on the film and story. Music helps the audience relate back to the film and keep the audience intrigued.Ashton Kutcher plays Evan Treborn in this film and he is able to convince the audience through his acting and dialogue that his character had the ability to go back in time and change the past and drastically change the future. Kutcher showed the audience a variety of roles in this film. For example an intelligent college student, a selfish member of a fraternity, as well as a mentally unstable young adult. He was able to transform himself into each character, with different personalities and styles. His range of characters were impressive, and he was clearly the best one for this job. His role in this movie paved the way for a diverse acting career.The Butterfly Effect is an intriguing film, that explored the theory of the ""butterfly effect"". It's a good movie if you are patient and interested in a whirlwind of flashbacks and a rollercoaster of plot twists. The storyline allows for the story to change and surprise the viewers, and create a magical experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"FUBAR, but in a good way","This movie was quite disturbing, from the first jump(the first of MANY) it'll either ensnare you or lose you. I do have one piece of advice to anyone reading this review before you see the film: Give Ashton a chance. So many people were on the forums here judging his performance based on the previews, and these were people who'd already made up their minds to hate the movie because of him, but it was unfair because he is more than competent as Evan in what was a very challenging role(calling for him to be humorous, serious and deeply disturbed all at once.) This is NOT a movie for children either, excessive swearing, some sex, drug use and heinous violence(I like my violence in movies, but the fact that many times children are committing it makes it very wrong). The movie delivers on jumps and a very good plot, though I am reminded of the Simpson's Halloween special where Homer time travels(which I know was based on something else). All in all, the movie is certainly above average in terms of overall quality, but it is DEFINATELY bizarre and very graphic and disturbing. Tremendous acting all around, nice to see Ethan Suplee back on the big(big BIG in his case) screen and nice to see that hopefully Ashton Kutcher won't succumb to Jim Carrey syndrome and be typecast until he has to make a series of movies just to prove he's more than ""the goofy actor""",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Gives you more than you expect.,"I watched this movie in 7/2012 and I have to say that this goes into my list for one of the most underrated movies. The movie has a cinematography of a teen movie which is why people underestimated it, but it worked toward this film's advantage because the audience can overlook the flaws in the premises of this film and start enjoying the what if scenarios that follows. Once you accept the basic premises, the movie is incredibly fun and at more than one occasion clever in their use of this foundation. I think Aston Kutcher was probably not the most perfect actor for this role, but he definitely fits nicely into the character he's portraying. In my opinion, this movie came out when CGI was all the craze in Hollywood cinema and people couldn't see past the lower production quality to see the brilliance in storyline. This movie is definitely unique and deserves more praise than 99% of the predictable all-flash-no-bang movies Hollywood has put out in the past decade.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Decent, Above Average Multi-Universe Movie","24 January 2004. In the footsteps of the Lath of Heaven, the multi-universe (time travel), chaos theory movie of The Butterfly Effect is an effective fantasy, sci-fi, drama containing a hard-edge of violence. This movie contains depictions of juvenile sadistic behavior and pedophilia. Ashton Kutcher does a commendable job with an intelligent, though somewhat forced script. Evan as a boy of 13 is given at times a much more harsh demeanor as well as Evan as a young man who personality seems to vary as much as his world does. There are effective psychological scenes as well as emotional tender moments. However, there are those artificial plot devices that seem to be inserted for audience impact rather than a natural flow of chaos. Eventually, the story and plot line get more convoluted to the point of confusion as to the cause and effect of changes being made. The movie had a decent ending with a message, though Evan's experiences as the move progressed seem more the product of a writer's mind than a real person's. Evan's reaction to his friend's violence seemed unnatural. Evan's relationship with his mother is never fully developed. There is also the confusion between Evan's memories and how he presents himself and also how his attempts to portray himself as somehow godlike was convincing if the new universe changed as it was supposed to have. This serious effort deserves recognition for its attempt to push the envelope along with a provocative conclusion and the meaning of sacrifice and of love.

Overhyped Trash,"Ashton Kutcher did to this film what Hayden Christensen did to Attack of The Clones. He turned a film which could have been decent into a pile of trash - yet another actor casted to swoon the young female audience irrespective of his talent as an actor.Again we see here a film with a good idea, and a screenplay that also could have been something more. But send whoever casted this film to the stocks - Ashton Kutcher... what were they thinking?Anyway, the film itself - i can imagine it wouldnt be too disappointing if the ad campaign that went with it was a bit smaller - but considering how much hype there was surrounding this film, it really was a disappointment. Compared to films such as donnie darko.... excuse me? Id compare it 10 things i hate about you - another film trying to sell an audience an hour and a half of eye candy with a plot somewhere in the background being torn apart by bad acting.By all means watch it.... but do not go watch it or buy the DVD thinking its an all time classic.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A supposed psychological thriller wasn't released, it escaped!","My wife and I saw a pre-release screening the other night,  and walked out of it about 45 minutes in. The ""director"" has taken every taboo and horror movie plot device, and crammed it into the same movie. In the first two reels we are treated to gratuitous violence, the inference of child pornography, incest, animal abuse and babies and mothers being blown up with dynamite. They all live in a special little town where everyone except the main character's mother and his therapist seem to be psychotic or sympathetic to the drek they are acting in. The scene of animal abuse drove us out, simulated or not, it did nothing to further the plot, and caused nothing but revulsion. Our film society sponsor was in tears.If Ashton Kutcher wants to be taken seriously as an actor, he should pay James Lipton a standard consulting fee, and stay out of tripe like this in the future.

Fascinating.  Dual Endings?,"Okay. So I don't want to sound crazy, but i just re-watched The Butterfly Effect on TV and the ending was totally different from the one I viewed in the theater.

The television version showed the same lead character walking the streets of New York some eight years later after he burned his journals. A kinder, gentler TV version or what?! Theatrical version was way more cerebral. Actually kind of liked the TV version a bit better. At 50, i must be getting old. Anyone else agree? Which one is better?

Surprisingly deep sci-fi,"'The Butterfly Effect' may not be remembered as one of the all-time great science fiction films - probably because it's (a) not an epic blockbuster with wall-to-wall action (b) limited star power and (c) contains a bit of a mind-bending plot that isn't necessarily as easy to follow as some of the other sci-fi films that deal with time travel. Therefore, I guess it was always destined for more of a 'niche' audience. Luckily, it's developed a reasonable cult status - and deservedly so.Normally, when I write a review I tend to use the second paragraph to give a brief summary of the film. However, I really do think that if I say too much I may give away a 'spoiler' that may well ruin your enjoyment of the film. You could say it's a love story which involves time travelling and one man's (Ashton Kutcher) attempts to right various wrongs of the past - and the consequences which messing with time brings about.Obviously, it's science fiction, but not overly so. There are no trips to space age futures or flying cars and a fair proportion of the 'whys' of how time travel is possible isn't really explained. You just have to go with it. If someone walked in halfway through the film they could be forgiven for thinking it was a 'teen love story,' but just because a relationship between Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart is paramount to the overall narrative, don't think it's a 'date movie' or will ever get too soppy for a guy's taste. In fact - quite the opposite - it's pretty damn dark!I know that Kutcher has a bit of a reputation for more goofy comedic roles, but here he plays it straight well and it's a pity he didn't take more parts like this as he's quite capable of headlining a film like this, yet these days he's pretty much dropped off the radar (as has Amy Smart!).It's probably a little longer than your average film, but there's a lot to it and, although much of the marketing for this movie centres on Kutcher and Smart, at least a third is spent in the company of their younger incarnations (who are all nicely believable and not at all annoying as some child actors can be!).Ignore what you may think of Ashton Kutcher (or 'MR Demi Moore' as he's normally heralded as). He holds the film together and there's definitely chemistry between him and Amy Smart. The plot is never a rollercoaster/action epic - it's far deeper and brings up areas of the genre designed to make you think. Definitely worth a watch when you're in the mood for a deep-dark-dive into time travel (just make sure you get the 'director's cut' - I hear the ending is very different in other versions and not half as good).",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Suspenseful, thrilling, and entertaining","This movie has so much unfair bashing, and negativity surrounding it, it makes me sick. If you're the kind of person who will automatically hate a movie because of logical errors in the plot, you should not watch this movie. That is the exact reason why mainstream critics should be completely ignored. People should also give Ashton Kutcher a chance. He CAN act, as he proves in this. Unfortunately, his presence must have also contributed to the critical failure.The film follows Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), who suffers a traumatic childhood alongside his friends Kayleigh (Amy Smart), her brother Tommy, and the insecure Lenny. Evan turns out better than any of them when they are adults, because at all the most horrifying moments, Evan would black out and have no idea of what just happened. This prompts him to keep journals about everything he does. When Evan is in college however, he reads his journal, and experiences a memory he lost as a kid. He discovers that by reading the journals, he can possess his childhood self, and stop such horrible things from happening. His quest to fix his present begins when a traumatized Kayleigh commits suicide. Evan starts going back to his most upsetting memories, and changes them. Unfortunately, the things he does in order to prevent the tragedies have a ripple effect over time, and when Evan returns to the future, he often discovers that his present is far worse than what he was trying to prevent.The story is loaded with plot holes, but don't worry about it. If you have an open mind, and don't nitpick, you can highly enjoy this movie. It's a shame that Ashton Kutcher's presence doomed the film, as the performances are all brilliant. I actually cared about his character, and felt that he did well at showing emotion during the sad parts. When he tells the hooker version of Amy Smart that she was once happy with him, I nearly cried (one of the few things in a film to ever do that to me). And while I can't help but find Ashton to be rather humorous in his comedies, I think he's far better in this film than any of his comedies. Amy Smart is outstanding in this. She is not only stunningly beautiful, but she is a comforting presence in this movie, a voice of reason among all the insanity. Her character is very likable, and would definitely be worth all the sadness and pain that Ashton goes through to save her from sadness.My only complaint with this movie, is that it feels a need to include many gratuitous, unnecessary elements of extremely harsh subject matter, only for the sake of being cool. I couldn't care less about stuff like that normally, but I felt that few shocking elements (prison rape, child porn, various sex scenes) were totally unnecessary, and just thrown in there to make people go ""wow"" this is a cool movie, and make teenagers enjoy it more. Ashton Kutcher endures a childhood worse than nearly any child you could imagine. Kids constantly endure life-changing tragedies but Ashton is molested, witnesses his dad get beaten to death by prison guards, sees his dog get burned alive, and even becomes an accessory to manslaughter. The rampant grimness diminishes the believability, but the entertainment value remains intact.If you forget the plot holes, the logical errors, and random shock scenes, you'll enjoy this fun film. Plot holes don't matter, the film is a thrilling suspense ride that will keep you guessing non- stop, and will keep you glued to your seat until the credits roll. I award the film 10/10.It is very correctly rated R for Violence, Sexual Content, Language, and Brief Drug Use. Sex: 8/10 Violence: 8/10 Swearing: 10/10 Drugs: 5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Original and Excellent,"I really enjoyed this movie.I remember it coming out in 2004 but after it got panned from virtually every critic I didn't see the film until years later. How it got such a low rating from critics I am still not sure.The IMDb rating is much more accurate - it's a good film and this is reflected in the score.The plot it very well done, thought-provoking, original and I found it entertaining.**Spoilers**If you have watched the film and don't understand it. the following might help:The reason Ashton Kutcher's character blacks out is because those moments in his life - as a child - haven't happened yet. They only happen for the first time (for his conscious mind) when he comes back to those moments through his journals in the future.The way he acts in those early moments of his life, sometimes alter his life drastically - such as when he ends up as a frat boy, or not much such as the cigarette burn and the stigmata when in prison. The film works on Chaos theory. The whole idea is that it is very unpredictable. Every time he goes back he makes changes that he hopes will be change his future life for the better - but rarely does it end up that way.You could argue a minor plot flaw is that the number of times he can go back to a time he blacked out as a child in unlimited. So he could (in theory) just go back to the same point every time and keep trying until it worked out the way he wanted. However, that wouldn't be at all entertaining for us as the audience.It was revealed when he ends up with no limbs that she and her brother stayed with their abusive father (rather than their mother) as children because she didn't want to move away from him. After hearing this he decides at the end that staying away from Amy Smart's character is the only way he can protect her and ensure her brother doesn't end up a total psychopath.When he ends up in a reality he can accept he burns his journals so he can't travel back in time due to the problems he suffered when doing so.There is also an alternative ending to this movie.If there are other elements you don't understand check the FAQ for this film on IMDb and there is a full explanation here: http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/butterflyeffect.html",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
From small flutters to big events,"Evan Treborn suffered blackouts as a kid, especially when a traumatic event occurred. However as he grew up and moved towns these blackouts subsided and seems to be a happy kid at college.When he starts reading journals he kept of these blackouts when he was a child. He finds that he is shifting in time that coincides with these blackouts and also the past and future timeline for himself and the people around him changes.This is actually a surprisingly clever time travel film and in my opinion deals with some hard time travel concepts where you enter a world of multiverses, split future events, chaos theory and whether you can successfully change traumatic events.No wonder poor Evan is left confused. If only he watched more Twilight Zone as a child or even Doctor Who he might not had made such a mess of trying to use his powers to fix the past and present.Ashton Kutcher who is more known for comedy and light romance. He tries his best to muster some acting chops but it is passable, it could had been better with a stronger lead.Surprisingly, this was a script that was knocking about for some years and it was only Ashton's involvement that gave it a green light.It starts out puzzling and sinister but leads to a satisfactory thrilling ride as the movie starts to make sense as it progresses.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

There are also many plot holes which I don't want to mention because I would like to keep the review free from spoilers.But there are also good things about this movie. Great acting. I like Ashton Kutcher as a comedian, but I also liked him now in his one dramatic role. The casting for the characters as young children was also done well. They did resemble their adult characters and for them most they acted well. Irene Gorovaia was an exception, but luckily she didn't continue with acting. I must say though that she is beautiful now.

Great idea but denies title,"The title The Butterfly Effect refers to the ability of even the beating wings of a butterfly to upset the balance of the world. For time travel, even the slightest change can dramatically alter the future. While this movie excels in creativity, much like Donnie Darko, it presents too many holes in direct violation of the premise of its title.For instance, (SPOILER) when Evan (Aston Kutcher) is trying to prove to his prison cellmate that Jesus talks to him, he goes back in time as a child and stabs his hands into two sharp points. When he comes back to the present, he is still in the prison cell with the scars on his hands. If even a butterfly's wings can alter the course of history, then surely that act could have completely altered Evan's future to where he may not even be in prison anymore.Maybe as a way to compensate for this paradoxical display, the movie goes overboard in the opposite direction by showing how Evan can alter people through words (such as his confrontation of Kayleigh's dad). And in almost all the scenarios Tommy turns out a bad seed, except for his illogical saving of a mom and her baby. He then becomes something of a born-again Christian. It's too big a stretch.Basically the concept is very creative for this film but more attention to detail could have been given to make for a more convincing and concrete story. Granted, it is hard to manipulate alternate futures to reach the best outcome, but then again, that is the theme behind the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Event Reborn,"Someone in my FB movie group recently mentioned this movie and I couldn't recall it in my memory, so I went to take a look at my own review. But there wasn't one. When I saw it again, I understood why I didn't write anything after the previous watching. I had to sleep on it, for impressions to settle, before I was able to evaluate it, even subjectively.""It has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world."" - Chaos TheoryAnd in essence, this is the basis of the film's plot. Ashton Kutcher plays a young man who finds a way to change the details of his own past, thus completely changing the present and the future. Unfortunately, every time he fixes one thing, he simultaneously messes up something else, embroiling himself in playing God more and more.It's fun to watch actors from your favorite series (""That '70s Show"", ""Daredevil"", ""My name is Earl""...) all together in the same movie. When actors go from film to film, there is not enough time to connect them closely with the characters they interpret, as is the case with actors who interpret the character in the series from episode to episode for many seasons. And when they appear in a movie, after we've watched them for years as the same characters in a series, it is a bit strange. And when there are more such actors in the same movie... confusing.For its relatively small $ 13 million budget, the film is technically great, the acting is good, and the story keeps your attention from start to finish. I mostly like the fact that the film has a mindfak charm, although it's not one, because everything's pretty much clear all the time. There are four alternative endings and both times I saw ""director's cut"", which has the most striking finale. I don't want to write spoilers, but if you saw or will see this version, pay attention to the relation between the scene where Ashton's mother tells him that she had a few miscarriages and the way our protagonist resolves the whole situation. When my brain linked these two things, the entire movie significantly gained strength.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's the little details that count in the end...,"This inventive thriller explores the chaos theory. In it, a man discovers that he has the power to travel back in time and re-act certain moments from his past, ultimately, changing the future. He finds out, however, that doing the right thing does not always ultimately end up improving the future. Where he may benefit, a friend may suffer or vice-versa. The message of the film is that you cannot play God. You cannot expect to create a Utopian future. Events unfold in life in a certain way and sometimes bad things need to happen for good events to unfold, or indeed very bad things can come of best intentions.The main character in the film experiences black-outs as a child. Later in life he discovers that these black-outs serve as the portals for where he can re-enact pivotal moments and, hence, change history. His destiny and the destinies of those around him are inextricably affected by his actions in these brief moments. This is a fairly artificial framework for the story but it allows the film-makers to explore the idea of The Butterfly Effect (i.e. the concept that the smallest insignificant action could eventually result in a hugely significant outcome). The film successfully shows that it is not so simple to change history by changing small details of the past. Often, even greater horrors are unleashed unexpectedly. This film presents a whole host of outcomes. It incorporates many horrors that life can throw up – child abuse, violence, mental illness, physical disability, prostitution, drug addiction, bullying, incurable illnesses, imprisonment and sexual assault. It also deals more generally with love and loss. These are all big issues but they are incorporated into the narrative well. The film successfully shows that cause and effect is not a simplistic thing.I was very impressed with this film. As well as having a few interesting things to say about fate, it also works very well as a compelling mystery-thriller. Well worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ashton Kutcher is Good!,"By now I assume most people who want to see this film have already seen it. It is great. I recommend the director's cut, which may be too disturbing for theaters which was why it is only available on DVD, but it's better than the regular version in my opinion.And there's great acting all around. I was surprised at Kutcher's performance, being so accustomed to seeing him play the stereotypical dumb guy in THAT SEVENTIES SHOW for all those years. But I have heard that he is actually very smart in real life. Eric Stoltz gives a great performance also, as always. Don't waste your time with the sequels though, as they were just made cheaply in order to capitalize on the success of this one. But the first one is top notch. Recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Chain Reaction,"OK, I liked the movie--it was a good piece of science fiction. But I have a slight problem with the premise. The movie only shows how the various changes effect the lives of a small group of people. But, if such changes were possible, wouldn't Chaos Theory dictate that there could be some drastic changes to everyone and everything. Isn't that the whole idea of Chaos theory? The theory that one very small change (a butterfly flapping its wings) could make a huge impact (the typhoon half way around the world) in things seemingly unrelated.What do you think? Am I way off base here?For the record, I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the Worst Movies I've ever Seen,"I love films about time travel but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Almost everything about it is idiotic. There is no sense to the way things are done. It's as if the writers decided to throw something in and didn't even think about what they were doing beforehand. The writing is probably the worst part, but it's hard to pick the worst part since there are so many things wrong with this film. The acting is terrible. The story is absurd and constantly becomes more absurd at every turn. There are numerous egregious errors throughout the film, so many that I lost track. There's a negative mean-spirited morality shoved down our throats at every turn. This movie is pure trash. Definitely one to skip. The critics were too kind to this piece of garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Absurd,"There are those who say this movie has real 'brio' - whatever that's supposed to really mean. The bottom line is that nothing measures up. And although others say one is not supposed to regard this movie as science fiction, this is exactly what it is - what it is supposed to be. And it does win a science fiction award or two. And as for those who so opine, let's just say it's their relatively low IQ coupled with their total lack of understanding that they're so singularly untalented. There are no extra points for being a nerd when it comes to this one.Not to say the movie isn't executed in a professional manner. From the direction to the acting everything is well done with Smart being the outstanding one on screen.But to the story itself. Naturally you're not supposed to understand what's going on initially, and it is this desire to figure out what you're watching that leads you on.And when you finally understand what oversimplified plot prop the writers are using you find yourself blurting out 'ridiculous' over and over again.The difficulty with this one is that it has pretensions of being so much at once - and of course that the writers have a predilection for lots of unsavoury things - so for that matter if you're experiencing an unsettled stomach you might want to try an episode of The Simpsons instead (and it will probably work better as science fiction too).If you're going to get into subtleties like chaos theory then you'd better think through things better. What we imagine, after witnessing this pseudo-piece, is that the writer(s) probably made enough money on the sale of the screenplay to have a blast of an expensive fourteen year birthday party.And that said, we're now on our way to our local convenience store. They have notebooks there and we'll buy one. And no matter people use computers today to jot things down - as do the campus cretins in the movie - we're going to write an entry about on this evening having seen this movie.And then we'll concentrate on the page, and concentrate real hard, and then suddenly everything around us will go a big blur and we'll hear lots of pseudo-impressive 'dts' sounds, and in the end we will never have seen this waste of time at all.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
original way of telling a used story,"The Butterfly Effect (2004)It seems like a story that everyone has thought of and wanted to do. Travel back in time and mess with it and it changes the future. Easy and obvious to think of and do, but the Butterfly Effect figures out a way to do it in a different way.Though it takes a little more brain work or imagination than your average time travel film that just uses a time machine, it's still a pretty easily followed movie. Creative and intriguing. It's actually more of a fantasy film than a sci-fi film because the main character travels in time using his brain rather than a machine.The Butterfly Effect has a couple surprisingly good performances. Ashton Kutcher in a non comedic performance seems like it will be awkward, like Jim Carrey's early serious roles, but he does great and you would never guess that that's not his normal style. The supporting cast also does pretty decent for the most part, but nothing spectacular. To be honest most of the younger cast does better than the grown up cast.The writing and directing are both pretty good. They did a good job keeping everything new and original and kept things in order pretty well, for the most part, which kept the film very easy to follow. I also enjoyed the cinematography.If you are watching this on DVD you will probably have the option of theatrical cut or directors cut. I have seen both and they both have their positives. The theatrical cut ending makes more sense and is easier to believe (not that the film is believable to begin with.) The director's cut on the other hand is cooler and I think has a more interesting and thought provoking ending. If you have a choice, I'd recommend the director's cut.Butterfly Effect is a new and cooler twist on a simple idea, and it's quite a thrill ride. It seems more liked by the younger crowed but I think just about anyone will like it. Anyone into psychological thrillers, or dark fantasies should try out this film. It's a fun film that most will enjoy.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not what you'd expect ... and all the better for it,"This thoughtful, downbeat tale of time travel and temporal meddling gives Ashton Kutcher the chance to show there's more in his bag of tricks than the underwhelming Dude, Where's My Car? He plays Evan, a young man whose youth has been punctuated by alarming blackouts and whose life and those of his closest friends have been blighted by several key incidents in childhood. Taking refuge in his diaries, he finds he can project his mind back into his younger self at the very point of each blackout and so alter the course of events. The Butterfly Effect is a parable of chaos physics which suggests, through the example of a butterfly flapping its wings on one side of the world causing hurricanes on the other, that tiny and seemingly trivial events can have huge and unforeseeable consequences. Sadly, Evan's evidently not much of a reader and each of his well-intentioned interventions shifts the path of his life into disturbing and dark new territory, spurring him to go ever-further back in the hope of rectifying the new wrongs he's introduced. Directors/writers Eric Bress and J Mackye Gruber explore a lot of the interesting possibilities and conundrums of time travel and merit respect for keeping the tone of their film sombre and adult  this is most definitely not a world in which a little Back To The Future tinkering can result in everything coming up roses  while eliciting first-rate performances from a committed cast, including Amy Smart and Eric Stoltz.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Do Not Remember,"Wow!! A truly original masterpiece. One of the few movies that have really kept the viewers in awe in recent times. Very commendable directing and we hope to see more from him. Ashton was really very natural, and hope that he gets recognised for his work.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not bad, but not that good either  (**1/2)","I'm no huge fan of Ashton Kutcher, but I feel sorry for the guy lately, what with the beating he constantly gets from the press. Far too many of the reviews that I've read for ""The Butterfly Effect"" make mention of his oh! so! shocking! relationship with Demi Moore, which is not only beside the point, it's petty.Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that Ashton Kutcher is not one of my favorite actors, but I think there are far worse out there (with greater ""faults"" than dating a beautiful older woman), and I give him credit for trying something darker and different in ""The Butterfly Effect"", even if the movie has a lot of problems.Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a college student who is haunted by a troubled adolescence. Many traumatic things happened to him and his friends in childhood, but he always blacked out and didn't remember anything. Now he's found that by reading his old journals he can travel back in time to the moment of those traumatic blackouts and change things, altering history. How? Don't ask me.But the reason I more-or-less liked ""The Butterfly Effect"" is because I didn't look for logical answers to questions like that. I simply looked at it as what it was intended to be, which is a ""Twilight Zone""-style meditation on how one small event can sometimes alter an entire life, and how sometimes when you save one person, you're only damning another. Evan keeps going further and further back in time to fix things, only to discover that by playing God, all he's doing is digging a deeper hole for himself and his friends.It's like a cross between a Stephen King novel (because of the childhood friends who share a dark secret...or two, or three) an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"", and ""Groundhog's Day"".I basically enjoyed the movie, but in the end there are just a few too many parts that are lame or annoying, as well as some bad dialogue, mediocre acting (Amy Smart and Elden Hensen are very good, but Kutcher is hit-and-miss), and a really dull, dreary middle section.I believe all of us can think of a moment in our lives when, had the events been even slightly different, our entire lives would be changed. ""The Butterfly Effect"" doesn't really delve into that fascinating concept too deeply, but it's a moderately entertaining and occasionally even touching film. Nothing to write home about, but not that bad either.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Amazing movie,At first it was difficult for me to get the meaning of the movie but when l watched it for the second time the point was getting clearer to me. The experience was getting bigger and bigger l can strongly say the movie is awesome and you will not regret spending your time watching it. Every seen in the move plays a huge role from the beginning to the very end of the thriller.

worth seeing for the end (not spoiler),"I don't have much to say, except that this movie is sort of messed up. It's one of those movies that incorporate the whole blackout/skip effect and combine it in a mystical kind of way; In other words, it's a movie with very broken logic. There's likely to be many loopholes in it, some obvious, many that can be justified. They also never explain how it's possible.Some people criticize with the acting, but I usually watch a movie more for it's story line and effect. Thus I don't have much to comment regarding it's acting. To me, the acting was fine. But I'm not really picky about acting, as long as it's somewhat acceptable.That being said, I would say this movie is worth seeing. Why? The end alone makes this movie alright, at least to me. It's one of those endings, where you either like it, or hate it. To provoke such a response indicates it's somewhat of a decent movie.

"Ludicrous and SOOOOO ""Teen,"" yet a lot of fun","There is MANY A SPOILER BELOW, so if you haven't seen it yet, don't read this review!This movie is very bad in many ways, yet totally enjoyable and definitely a fun, mind-bending rental. It's main flaw is just its immaturity. It SCREAMS 'teen' in how overly emotional and overwrought it all is. It screams 'simplistic writer/directors who think their movie is SO HARD-HITTING and DEEP but is really rather juvenile.' Chief among the reasons it creates this effect is the inclusion of subject matter WAYYY too dark for a film this silly. Child porn, animal torture and killing, killing of infants, drug abuse and prostitution, loss of limbs this movie is really rubbing your face in horror, cruelty, and sadism, ostensibly to make it all more 'serious.' Unfortunately the rest of the movie isn't up to the seriousness these subjects demand and I think it really does a disservice to the viewer's ability to take the story seriously.Another problem is that the filmmakers seem to mistake stupidity for destiny. The idea carried in the film is that whatever Ashton does to correct the future only makes it worse. Well, maybe if Aston didn't do such wholly stupid things, the future would have turned out better. For example, maybe it's not that great an idea to go stand right next to a mailbox you know is going to explode in a few seconds? Maybe a lit stick of dynamite in the hands of a ten year old is not the best intimidation tool against an aggressive adult? The film treated the outcomes of these situations as 'destined,' but maybe if the characters weren't quite so stupid they wouldn't have turned out that way? This makes the ending of the theatrical version all the more ludicrous as thus far EVERYTHING has gone wrong when Ashton tries to fix the past, but then at the end--presto!--everything's fine!There were other off-the-chart suspension of disbelief aspects, like that you can go back in time just be reading your journal, that Ashton's MIND doesn't change even though his whole past has now changed, etc., etc. The GRAVITY with which the film approaches all this SHEER LUDICROUSNESS only makes it that much more fun.But accept it for what it is, and it's a totally enjoyable 'Woah dude, like what if that really happened?' kind of movie. I was completely engrossed all the way through, and there were many mind-bender twists like when I realized that if Ashton goes back BEFORE he started keeping his journal, then he won't be able to change anything, and also when I pieced together that when he was blacking out as a child, that was when he was 'visiting' himself as an adult. The movie never explains why he can't just write a new journal page about the past and use that to go back, but quibbling will get you nowhere with this one.The contrast between how SERIOUS the filmmakers seem to think this movie is (and I didn't listen to the commentary, but others have described it as VERY SERIOUS) and just how TEEN the whole thing comes off as is really precious. I ADORE how in one incarnation Ashton is supposed to be a weird, not-especially-popular or fashionable college student who is best friends with the overweight goth guy, yet he is dressed at the ZENITH of hipster GLAMOUR. And then all the soundtrack selections you half expect a little shot of the soundtrack album cover to come up in the corner with a 'Now Available!' line. The whole aesthetic and execution of this film is SOOOOO MTV.The director's cut ending follows through on the seriousness the movie has been operating on until then, and actually achieves a kind of beautiful grace note at the end--provided you are willing to go along with all the ludicrous conventions the film has set up before. This film sort of makes a good contrast with 'IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE' in that the conclusion here is that everything would have been much better is the main character HAD NEVER BEEN BORN. I liked the darkness of all that, and the final show of how everything went 'right' since Ashton wasn't ever born was kind of moving.The theatrical cut ending has all the hallmarks of running scared from test audiences. Like I said, Ashton changes one more thing and then--as if by MAGIC!--everything's fine! I also like how audiences could NOT be left without a feeling of hope for the romance, so it gives the indication that Ashton might meet the girl again later in life--and everything will work out OOOOOOKAY!Overall, NOT a 'good' movie by any stretch of the imagination, but still completely enjoyable and fun to watch.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Asthon bashers go home,"Okay, so is this movie perfect....no, but close to it. I think a lot of people are sick of hearing about Ashton(like Bennifer before him) and bash him for him, not the movie. I was hesitant about seeing this movie, with bad reviews and all, but like with LOrd Of The Rings movies, the reviewers are way off. This movie is great. It doesnt show massive violence like some old hens here have tried to say. It isnt funny and I doubt the whole theatre was laughing, like the last poster. I laughed more in Return of the King, with the whole Merry and Pippin....will they/wont they get it on and make baby hobbits together. I dont really like Ashton, but he was alright here. Only one scene, wheres hes popping wheelies in the hospital, was horrible acting. Amy Smart, Elden Hensen and the others were good too. I liked the idea of this movie, and am dumbfounded on all these allegded plot holes, cause nothing made me think twice through the movie.

Genius coming out of nowhere,"The most common reaction I would expect this movie to garner would be the word ""surprising"" given the leads Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart, who had made names for themselves by starring in lighthearted comedic movies and TV shows.

I watched it so many times as a young teen and it never got old on multiple viewings.As a PSA if you have not watched this movie yet BE SURE TO WATCH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.

Keep telling yourself..It's only a movie...it's only a movie..,"I think people are coming to this film expecting WAY too much.  Come on, you can even see from the trailers that it is about TIME TRAVEL.  This should give you a clue that the audience is expected to suspend some belief.Within the context of the film the acting was credible especially considering the actors had to play the same character but in many varied circumstances.Also a lot of reviewers complain that the abuse and violent scenes were way too disturbing. This had to be because they are the catalyst that makes Evan want to endure the obviously painful process of going back in time.  A more mundane reason would give no urgency or suspense to the film.  It would not been much of a story if the reason everyone's life was in the crapper was because of a bad hair day.Granted the film is derivative of Memento, It's a Wonderful life, Twelve monkeys, (among others) but what film these days does not `borrow"" elements from other films.I found this to be an enjoyable film that actually makes you think and reflect",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie to start to the New Year,"Let's start with the title ""The Butterfly Effect"", throw in a simple cool tag line, ""Change one thing. Change everything.""  Then, throw in a killer Trailer with Staind's ""it's been a while"", and some cool sequences and you just sold your movie before the release.I went into this movie like I do most movies opened minded, yet after seeing the trailer to the movie, the anticipation was there, and that's when disappointment pokes it's ugly head in and might ruin the experience. That never happened.  Filmmaker brilliance for the architect of the trailer, gave you just enough without giving anything way.  Suprisingly, the format of the story didn't go as planned, yet there was a reason for it.  Basically the childhood is explained a lot more thorough then first expected, but all of it for a good reason.  As much as I would like to go into detail about Evan's abilities, that's for you to find out, but you will walk away understanding it.  Promise.  Another aspect of the movie that I liked, in this is in reference to time travel and changing the past, is that Evan kept trying, despite how things appeared to get worse, he kept trying, unlike the movie ""The Time Machine"", where as Alexander goes back ""one"" time after creating the time machine, and assumes he can't change the past.This movie is solid and the actors give really good performances.  I'm sure the biggest with drawl about people's hesitation to see this movie is Ashton Kutcher, but he pulls off in a really good performance.

Every actor has one GREAT performance in them. This is Ashton's.,"Let's face it, Ashton Kutcher has proffered himself to be a number of things, and a great actor is not one of them. His turns are simply not convincing... perhaps not awful, but close to unwatchable. But I believe every bad actor has one great performance to give if they struggle long enough for the opportunity, and this happens to be Ashton's.A young man afflicted by unexplained blackouts, Ashton's character Evan Treborn looks for answers in his lifelong journals, and discovers something extraordinary. The story is similarly compelling in keeping you hooked on each step, and the supporting cast meshes well into the narrative.Considering all the bad performances Ashton has delivered, and the dwindling scripts tossed his way, this will undoubtedly stand as his finest hour.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie is strange,"Semi live review:And I mean in the craziest possible way, goofy. No way Evan would have gone to prison for killing Tommy when he was attacked first.

Good story. Deserved better acting.,"The storyline is reminiscent of GroundHog Day... going back and forth to the same events trying to change things. The drama treatment did improve the topic but not to the point that it could become a cult film of sort.The love story that is the motivation of the whole movie somewhat falls flat and impairs the movie harshly. I apologize to fans of Kutcher but his acting bordered on ridicule in some scenes. I was half waiting for the laugh tracks and having never seen anything with him before I was not biased or disappointed. The kid who played Evan as a teen was soo much more credible, it's not even funny. And there was a complete absence of chemistry between Kutcher and Amy Smart that somehow just made the whole storyline pointless.It definitely would have been more than just entertaining if it had not been so resolutely geared towards the teen viewers. Most of the love story plot felt a little too much like Dawson's Creek. The story would have benefited from much better less known actors (who may not have been on the cover on Seventeen but... who cares?) who would have made the whole scheme work. Not having to go very far to find them, I think Elden Henson (Lenny) would have made a PERFECT Evan (yeah I know, he's not as 'sexy' as Kutcher... my point, exactly!) and ANYONE would have been better than Amy Smart (I think newcomer Dallas Howard would have been just wonderful) but I'm not a casting director... apparently neither was the person who gave the two key parts to up and coming teen pleaser's.Overall a meager 6/10 that could have easily been a 8!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Leaves a strong lasting impression,"Having seen this film very briefly and perhaps not the entire film around the time it was released, but now randomly watching it in full after not remember much detail about. Can agree with most of these IMDB audience reviews and ratings.The Butterfly Effect has a sort of rare and strong lasting effect towards after you finish watching the film, that very few films seem to have. And in this case, once finish watching the film, you sort of start thinking about what just occurred in the film, with its endings and start piecing things together. Also more importantly about the results of your own life (if you could have changed or altered something) and certain (and random) memories tend to come back. This film has that sort of nostalgic sense about it, which is another reason as to why it is so well loved by audiences.As for the film, critics seemed relatively harsh towards it and for many reasons could be, that the film is very quite disturbing and has some graphic content and deals with sensitive issues. However, this film is quite solid in its story, once the introduction gets over the with and we see present day Evan (Ashton Kutcher) and a feel of the film, things become more intriguing and interesting.The acting is quite well (Amy Smart shines in her role. Ashton is great- and from several reviews many people seemed to be surprised. This was released when he was still on ""That 70's Show"" and people still thought of him as his character from that show.). Even the younger versions of the characters do a convincing enough job.In the end, for the film leaving a strong impression, and being an engaging and thoughtful thriller.

good enough. could've used some help though.,"despite the fact that ashton kutcher is in this one, i actually enjoyed it. it took what was partially a cutesy teen movie, in directions that genre normally avoids like the plague: child porn, incest, prison rape, animal abuse, prostitution.this was a drawback for me, however, because i felt as if the movie was trying TOO hard to shock. the younger actors didn't exactly have the right chemistry, and the script was totally overboard for most of the movie. cinematography and effects were damn good though, and kutcher delivers a performance that is believeable.i really enjoy the fact that the word ""goth"" is not mentioned in the movie. movies that aim for this audience often try irritatingly hard to categorize their characters. the only categorization they played with was the sorority girl/frat boy scene...and i feel they portrayed that in an fairly accurate but over-the-top manner.time travel is usually a theme too sophisticated for this kind of movie, and in that aspect i have to agree...there are a lot of holes and loose ends. not at all on par with donnie darko's creepy bunny suit and the portals that come out of people's chests, abyss-style.stylish, intelligent, good premise, with a so-so execution. so, no spoilers i hope. i think i liked this one, i will see it again eventually and make my final decision.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The smallest choice could change your life in ways unforeseen,"I saw my friend watching this movie on his laptop and when I saw Ashton Kutcher in it, I assumed it would be a teen flick. Then one day, in the mood for a comedy, I put this on.And boy, was I surprised. Not only was Ashton Kutcher acting in a serious movie, but he did a good job!Ashton Kutcher plays Evan, who in his childhood used to suffer from blackouts, similar to his dad. Taking the advice of his doctor, he starts maintaining a dairy of his blackouts. Eventually these blackouts reduce in frequency until they completely stop. Then after a few years, as a college student, he chances upon the notebooks and goes through them. A powerful flashback then hits him. He later realizes he can go and change his past. But changing the smallest possible detail can have the greatest consequences, as he finds out eventually.Ever since the start, the movie grips you unrelentingly until the credits are rolling, and it leaves you something to chew on other than your popcorn. The plot is smart and intriguing with its essence (How the smallest choice could completely change your future) driven home in a convincing manner by the end of the movie.As already mentioned, Ashton Kutcher puts in a surprisingly good performance as a lead backed up ably by his cast. In fact, the entire crew did a great job on this one. The camera-work, editing and sound mixing combined to give the movie a continuity and intensity that must have been hard given the storyline of alternate realities, besides creating an atmosphere of suspense and desperation. At its heart is a beautiful love story between two very endearing characters. And the ending is beautiful, though it could have been even better.A must-watch. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Makes you think,This was a pretty enjoyable movie and with an ending thats much better compared to all of the alternate one. This film mainly focuses on evn. Played here by ashton kutcher and is enjoyable to watch as he tries to descipher what was going on. Evan relises one day that through the power of reading his journals. He can travel back to those painful meories. Frightening at first but aftera while evan relises he might just beable to change the past.we also have amy smart. Playing his friend/girlfriend kayleigh.

Should we change...?,"Past, present, future! You can't change your past, you can affect your present and you definitely can affect your future. But does it always work how you want it to work, or how you want it to be? I think this movie perfectly shows us what happens when we try to make things better that aren't supposed to be changed, but what if we succeed? But I think this movie also shows us perfectly that sometimes, if you have the right motivation some things can be changed. I think that in the end, we can see the value of love when Evan, trying to save Kayleigh, takes some decisions that affects his own life. Evan knows that something always can go wrong and maybe he and Kayleigh could be happy together, but... he knows that he can make her totally safe, by stopping their friendship in it's beginning. It is hard but it shows the true love! This movie should definitely be seen by everyone because it is truly wonderful... and realistic.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Disturbing and creepy, but very good.","I was watching this movie thinking, ""this is pretty good...but nothing spectacular.""  It ended, and I thought, ""it could have been better.""

I kept thinking about things that I thought might not make sense, but every time I thought of something else, I realized that it was all pretty well covered.  Then, about two hours after seeing it, something just clicked and I was like, ""Wow.  I get it!  THAT was an amazing movie.""  Not like I didn't understand it, just that I didn't really ""get"" it until then.  I definitely wanted to see it again to see if the plot holds its continuity (the same reason you watch The Sixth Sense again).  It's definitely worth seeing in theaters, but just realize that it's going to take a lot of thought, and you won't be able to shake some of the images from the movie for a few hours afterwards.

Nice sci-fi from the mid 00s.,"The Butterfly Effect is about regrets, and the closing sequences emphasize this. The film is engrossing enough to minimize such misgivings, however; few who enjoy unconventional pictures and see The Butterfly Effect will regret the experience. This is a compelling and intriguing movie that toys with the powers of choice and chance in a way that is not overused. Sure, there are plot holes (some of which are quite substantial), but most of them don't become apparent until long after the end credits have rolled and the film is being analyzed in a post-screening discussion. The ending is a cheat, and Ashton Kutcher is perhaps not the best choice for the lead role. Nevertheless, despite these flaws, this is a good film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprisingly Good,"Since we'd all heard negative reviews about the movie, no one would watch it with me tonight. I have to say they missed out.I was leery of Ashton K. playing anything but a dumb*ss, but he did a pretty good job (I suspect this is because a shallow, but charismatic character was needed in order to focus more on the events in the movie.)The directing is pretty good- you get to know characters in a very short period of time and can follow them through a very quick moving story.It is NOT a real thriller; it is NOT a horror movie...another example, i think, of false marketing.

"A brilliant, engaging and well balanced film.","The Butterfly Effect  What a brilliant film. It answered many questions that I had in my mind about the relationship between storytelling, script, the scriptwriter, direction and the director. This film tells a massively engaging story and tells it damned well. It has wonderful technical affects to suit the story without letting the affects overshadow the telling. It is filmed very well avoiding the trap of being too beautiful. It stays WELL AWAY from the trap of being what my grandmother would have called 'too arty-farty'. None of these excesses are present in this movie, it is very well balanced indeed. It has a wealth of one liners amid a very intelligent script. There is not a hint of ham acting anywhere in sight. This film went straight into my top ten films of all time and I am in my forties. The large group of teenagers I watched it with, a tough audience, also gave it the highest accolades I have heard. PS - Nicole (16) says Ashton Kutcher is 'hot'. Who am I to disagree. This film is a triumph of storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not as bad as you might think...,When this came out in 2003 it was doomed. Nobody could take the idea of Ashton Kutcher (known just for comedy) in a serious sci-fi movie. Predictably it bombed at the box office. That's too bad because this is actually a very intriguing (if disturbing) film.Evan (played as a 13 year old by John Patrick Amedon) does not have a happy childhood. His dad is in a mental institution; his mom has to work constantly to pay the bills and is never around; one of his best friends (Tommy) is a borderline psycho and Tommy's dad is a pedophile. Evan keeps having blackouts and keeps a journal from age 7 on to maybe help him. When he reaches college age (played by Kutcher) his life is a mess...but he finds he can go back in time (by reading his journals). He goes back and tries to change everything...but things get worse and worse. Soon he's spinning through alternate realities and losing his mind...The story itself is intriguing and it's pulled off beautifully. I'm not a science fiction fan but this movie pulled me right in. The direction really puts this across--all the different realities are shot in different film stocks so you can tell where you are and the film never stops moving. And it did make me think--would I change anything if I could back in time? The acting is (almost) uniformly great. Amy Smart plays Kayleigh--Evan's girlfriend (sometimes). She has to play different variations on her character. Not an easy task but she pulls it off. Also William Lee Scott (playing Tommy) has to do the same and also does well. As for Kutcher--he isn't terrible but he's really not up for the role. He was OK but he needs to be more than that to put this across completely. He doesn't destroy the movie--he just lessens the impact. And Amedon deserves credit for playing Evan at 13--very well done.This movie is disturbing. There are quite explicit dialogue about child abuse and Tommy's behavior as a child (brought on by his sick dad) is downright horrifying. This is NOT a movie for kids. It does have a happy ending--sort of. I'm giving this an 8--I might have given it a 10 with a better actor in the lead.Recommended--just with reservations about Kutcher.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wow!,"I was home on Sunday afternoon with nothing to do...happened upon this movie by chance, decided to watch. Aston Kutcher has never been on my A list for TV or Movies, but this movie showed me he can act! The topic of time travel always interests me and this was a unique approach to the topic. As time travel movies always seem to prove the basic rule is that you can't change the past without significantly influencing the future. It's refreshing to see that this movie doesn't give it a ""Back to The Future"" or a ""Dr. Who"" treatment ('in the end it all turns out good' and that you can change the future without ill consequences).This movie also has a jarring dimension in that you're never quite sure Kutcher is time traveling or if he's just mentally ill--in fact toward the end of the movie, I thought that was going to be the result, that he was simply crazy all the time. For some reason the book ""I Never Promised You A Rose Garden"" kept coming to mind as I watched this movie.This is a good movie to watch if you want some emotions stirred in you and if you like a plot that twists and turns all the way through...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Jon Monsarrat review: Unknown actors but A-quality film,"I went into The Butterfly Effect thinking what the hell, a B-movie with actors I've never heard of. Probably a waste of my time. I was wrong. Really wrong. The Butterfly Effect is a great combination of deep themes (making smart choices in life) and action.Similar to the films Big and Face/Off, it has a wacky premise but the film glosses over it and gets right to the action rather than fumbling around trying to explain it.The plot is as consistent and tight as Back To the Future, and it's thrilling throughout. Since the film is a series of disconnected vignettes (similar to Memento), the acting and direction have to be really good to not get the viewer lost. They are. The only critique I might make is that the themes are a little too adult to be used as a moralWho should see this film:-- Teenagers-- Everyone who's up for an action drama, it's not really sci-fiI'll give ""The Butterfly Effect"" a solid 9 out of 10.

Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart did a magnificent job in portraying their characters and they really got into it. Basically everything about this movie is amazing.

That's quite an achievement on its own!For me, it is also a thought provoking film. The obvious message is that you cannot play God. Everything is destined to be, and messing about causes unimaginable consequences. Another less obvious thought simmers below the surface though.

So, it was difficult for me not to like this and indeed I did like it but with some reserves. I loved the script and the alternate reality aspect (don't want to say too much). Ashton Kutcher was OK but a stronger actor would have made the film that much better. I preferred the secondary characters and how they changed. My suggestion is not to worry about the explanation of how things happen (because it bugged me) and take it as a super-hero movie (with no super-heroes) where powers are not logically explained.

Two Thumbs Up.,"You know, I liked 'The Butterfly Effect,' but I cannot fully explain why. Because of the original novel, the movie feels like a derivative measure through adding up to an audience who wouldn't understand it any other way. Add to the implausibility of some scenes, and this movie would simply stink. But the acting is good. Great and convincing in fact, with Kutcher pulling out all the stops. Sometimes you can tell when actors give it their best.A child is raised with blackouts during high stress moments and is asked by doctor and mother to record what happens through his diary. 13 years later, blackouts gone and working hard at University, Evan's actions in the past come back to haunt him. Through his newfound discovery and written diaries, he hopes to change all that.I particularly liked the idea behind 'The Butterfly Effect.' Chaos is tested in its utmost (and stretched) form. It works, even if the movie doesn't. Add to the acting of the movie (the child actors are just as good as the adults), and you have a solid production that works around a wonky script.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Dude, where's my memory?","The trailer didn't look too exciting, most reviews I read were unfavourable, and I had no real desire to see Ashton Kutcher ""doing serious"", so it was only after a few friends recommended it that I decided to watch 'The Butterfly Effect'. And to be honest it wasn't as bad as I had expected.Kutcher's character, Evan, has been prone to blackouts since he was young, an ailment apparently inherited from his institutionalised father. The blackouts occur without warning and he invariably wakes up in the middle of some sort of crisis, or at least considerably worse off than when he went under, with absolutely no memory of what happened. Kutcher plays Evan when he's 20 years old, and the blackouts have returned. After the death of an old friend, he manages to remember what happened all those times he blacked out, which opens a whole new world of possibilities.The first hour or so of the film is well constructed, leading the viewer through Evan's fragmented mind, touching on some delicate subjects, and intermittently shocking us to make sure we're still paying attention. However, when Evan begins recovering his lost memories, the plot takes quite a turn and the quality of the film suffers. The second half of the film lacks the cohesion and narrative flow of the first half, and any tension created slips away with the continuity out the back door, seemingly replaced by violence and an unnecessary overuse of the word 'f**kbag'.There are some good ideas on display here, some handled well, some manhandled, and the slightly bizarre ending left an odd taste in my mouth, like soap and ice-cream. It can be enjoyable but whether you'll think it was worth it after two hours is open to debate.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It is, however, a bad movie plain and simple from beginning to end; piling on so much ridiculousness and poor writing and stupid clichés one after the other that it makes you wish that you, like the movie's star, could go back a few hours and tell yourself not to watch this dribble.The whole movie revolves around Even Trebon, played by Kutchor, who finds out he can relive memories and even change things in the past by reading a journal of his he kept as a child. This movie doesn't bother explaining anything about this main facet, while it shows annoyingly in action again and again. The biggest problem though isn't that they don't try to give this aspect any depth, it's how it's used in utterly absurd fashion. It's a back and fourth film that gives very little credibility to any of its chapters.The first part of the movie, revolving around Evan's childhood, is merely mediocre. Right off the bat it's somewhat interesting, though clearly tries too hard for its own good. The next two-thirds of the film don't get any better, in fact they get much worse. Kutchor gives basically a one note and pretty weak performance of being initially shocked at how his life has changed after these flashbacks, followed by a journey to get his journal and relive the effect once again. Amy Smart gives the film's best performance, and while not a great performance that often revolves around the movies over-reactions, it's the biggest bright spot in the movie. After all the overacting, lethargic time changes, and just stupid and often unnecessary scenes in prisons, college campuses and mental institutes, it becomes clear that this film really never tried to give itself much credibility. The conclusion is as unimpressive as anything and by that time, while I was still watching, I really didn't care.I give the movie points for Amy Smart and some interesting ideas, but that's about all it has. It wasn't a dreadfully boring movie like many bad films are, but it's bad in the nature it plays out. Of all the going back in time films I have seen this is by far the worst and most ridiculous. Back to the Future and Terminator expanded the mind and intrigued the hell out of us with quandaries of effecting the future. What the Butterfly Effect does is explain nothing, and try so many things that don't work that it practically oozes as something made by someone with a severe case of ADHD. I'm shocked how well this movie has been received by IMDb voters. I think it's officially the most overrated movie ever on this site. Critics pounded the film as it deserved to be. It's not plausible, it's not even the least bit credible, and you'll do yourself a favor by not seeing this steaming pile of crap.3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't Pay Any Attention to the Critics on This One,"The reviews of this movie provide more evidence that critics have lost touch with what is entertaining to the general movie-going audience.  The reviews in my hometown paper gave Butterfly Effect a ""D+"" and Lost in Translation an ""A"".  Did this critic actually see the same movies that I did?  Lost in Translation, which has already been awarded a Golden Globe by the Hollywood foreign press, is so BORING that you can hardly sit through it.  Butterfly Effect, on the other hand, grabs you in the first five minutes and never lets go.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, especially (but not only) for science fiction buffs.  It is one of those movies like Beautiful Mind, Fight Club, or Memento that will give you plenty to talk about after you see it.  The critics seem to dislike this movie either because (a) they don't like Ashton Kutcher-actually he does a creditable job of acting, or (b) they think the movie is too violent-it actually has very little graphic violence and is no more disturbing than Mystic River, which critics LOVE, or (c) they think there are holes in the plot.  As for this last criticism, virtually every action or science fiction movie has holes in the plot.  If critics like a movie, they just ignore them.  The bottom line is that the current IMDB rating of 7.1 makes a lot more sense than the average movie critic rating of 4.8 (from www.rottentomatoes.com).",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I love it!,"Ashton Kutcher is a talented actor who was not given the right opportunities to showcase his full potential. He impressed everyone with his performance in a particular movie, but unfortunately, he chose to act in low-quality romantic comedies and even ended up in a TV show that didn't do justice to his acting ability. The movie that he performed so well in is called The Butterfly Effect and is worth watching.The script of The Butterfly Effect is excellent and demands the full attention of the viewer. The movie utilizes the concept of the Butterfly Effect to keep the audience engaged and intrigued. The story revolves around the character Evan, who is a relatable and likable protagonist. Evan is a complex character with multiple layers, and Kutcher did an excellent job of bringing him to life.The Butterfly Effect is a thought-provoking and entertaining movie that offers a fresh take on time travel. The movie is an excellent alternative to Groundhog Day and is worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Roller Coaster Ride I Didn't Want To Get Off Of,"I had the chance to see Butterfly Effect, and even thought it was Ashton, I went in with HIGH hopes.  Let me just say all my expectations were met and then some.I'm just an average Joe when it comes to the movies, so I'm not going to talk about so and so's performance compared to their last one.  I've seen a lot of movies in my time, but this was the first movie that I actually asked myself if I was going to make it till the end.  It was the same feeling that you get when you get onto a roller coaster and they put on the lap bar and you hear the worker press the button and you're off.

Butterfly Effect,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was glued to the television the whole time. I think the whole story was original.

But lets not forget the great KEANU REEVES who was in Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. Look at him now!! I do agree that he does have a long way to go. I can also say that I was happy to see him out of that stupid character that he plays on That 70's Show. The Eric Soltz character was incredible. Hes a fantastic actor. Loved him in Pulp Fiction.

Favorite. Movie. Ever.,A film that is right in all of the right ways and wrong in all of the right ways; an absolute masterpiece of a film. This movie has been with me since I was the same age as young Evan Treborn and it has been haunting me ever since. It blends such a cinematic style with its indie story that just makes the plot feel almost more than real in a way for audiences. Not for a second of my watching experience during this movie did I feel taken out of it - and that includes my ten or so rewatches as well. I will forever study this movie for its excellent camera work and its ability to get beyond deep into its protagonist's mind.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Compelling, disturbing but ultimately rewarding Sci Fi drama","If you enjoyed a film called Frequency with Denis Quaid, you'll enjoy this one even more as long as you are prepared to journey into a more darker edged and at times very disturbing depths of the worst elements in society. This is primarily an intelligently executed drama where the time jump mechanism is used to highlight the dramatic consequences of people's lives from childhood to adulthood. It is an intriguing exploration of how people's personalities and life can be determined by the events of their childhood, environment and friends. The film then projects how people's lives drastically change from the ""butterfly effect"", i.e., when an element of the past is slightly change. As the film progresses, we are pulled by the scruff of your neck into a spiral dive towards hell with our flawed hero trying to ""fix"" things. With many twists and turns in the tunnel, the pace is quite relentless bringing us to what I feel is a superb, sad, clever but satisfying conclusion. The ending provokes different reactions so you may not feel about it the same way as I do but that is the film's power. I love time travel movies and this one is placed in my top 5. Highly recommended though be warned, it may be uneasy viewing at times due to a disturbing but essential element that drives the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
schizophrenic time traveler?,"Well, I saw this interesting movie. And I found it susceptible of more than one interpretation. On one side I agree that this movie can be about time traveling and about those unintended consequences which may result after a person modifies the past, if it is possible. But in the other side I see maybe a more reality-anchored movie telling us the story of a schizophrenic young man (Evan), trapped in his mental illusions. And the movie gives us very clear clues in this direction: his grandfather and father suffered of the same illness and maybe he did inherit it after them. And it is possible that all those early very traumatic experiences he went throughout had an effect of accelerating his mental fall. Throughout the movie he is often visiting or staying for a while at the mental hospital. Trapped in his fantasies he dreams of changing the past in order to save his girlie friend from the childhood. This movie reminds me of Donnie Darko, another ""time-traveler"" with clear connections to some mental disorder or lack of capacity for approaching Reality.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Engaging plot about trying to adapt his present to his liking,"In The Butterfly Effect, we accompany Evan in his quest to make his dream come true in the present. However, Evan realizes that playing with the past can have serious consequences for his present.Storylines that use time travel are bold. I always try to put my mind blank to receive these stories as best I can. Considering the time travel rules this movie uses, I say the movie is pretty good.When stories involve time travel, questions always arise that culminate in the following ideal question: why didn't the protagonist go straight to the root of the problem and solve everything? The rules of The Butterfly Effect make the answer to this question clear. I think the rules are believable considering the context of the movieHaving Ashton Kutcher as the lead actor might seem a little out of context. Like Jim Carrey in The Number 23, Ashton is more of a comedy actor than a thriller one. I think Ashton even fits the role of the protagonist, but some scenes don't go so well with him.There are two endings to this film: the theatrical ending and the director's ending. Both are great. I prefer the theatrical ending.I recommend this movie to any thriller movie fan. The plot is straightforward and keeps us hooked in the events. I think the story tackles the main concept in a compelling way. Whichever ending you try, I think you'll be satisfied.**Spoiler alert: From this point on, I will comment on spoilers about the ending. If you don't want to read important details about the film, stop here.**The director's ending is sad. After so many failed attempts to adapt his present, Evan, now trapped in the worst reality of all, realizes that there is only one way to solve all of his problems. In a tense turn of events, Evan gets possession of videotapes that show the moment his mother conceived him in childbirth. Evan, now transferred to this event in the past, still inside his mother's womb, decides to commit suicide with the umbilical cord. The movie ends by showing that with Evan not being born, all of Evan's friends have led good lives.I don't think this ending is bad, but it's the least pleasant. After we sympathize so much with Evan, seeing that his existence is the reason for all the evil doesn't justice to me.The theatrical ending solves exactly that problem. The events that lead to the memory of the past are the same; the difference is in which moment of his past Evan returns. In the theatrical ending, Evan returns to the time when he first met Kayleigh as children. Evan understands that their friendship is what it's all about, and so, in his first conversation with Kayleigh, he threatens her so she walks away from him completely. This makes everyone grow up with healthy lives, including Evan. In the end, the film shows Evan and Kayleigh passing each other on a sidewalk bustling with people in suits, them included. They intersect. Kayleigh looks back, as if to remember who Evan is, but Evan's back is turned. When she moves on, Evan is the one who looks back with the same feeling, also seeing her from the back. They follow opposite paths.This ending for me is the most pleasant because Evan remains alive. The solution to the main problem is intelligent and doable.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Butterfly Effect at first seems to be a typical B-film,"The Butterfly Effect at first seems to be a typical B-film. The cast is weak, the main plot itself is just as simple. But after watching, you realize that the film is not so bad. There are a couple of successful scenes, the plot for the final, although it falls apart logically, has the right ending. In general, making a film with a nonlinear plot is very difficult, and The Butterfly Effect only confirms this. But the attempt is not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Dude, Where's your Talent?","I have never felt like I wasted brain space on a movie more than I did after having subjected myself to Butterfly Effect.

I was often scared and actually did care about the characters, which is not really something you might expect from a teen thriller movie. And it's not just that : ""The Butterfly Effect"" is at times moving and also has its funny moments.

Disturbing but definitely worth seeing.,"Every once in a while a story involving time travel comes along that seems almost plausible. This is one of those stories. We follow the life of a disturbed child who suffers blackouts during times of high stress. The imagery utilised to portray these moments is sometimes haunting. Thankfully, the director has employed suggestion over explicit vision in these instances. As one would expect, the tone of this piece is dark and subtle yet it still jolts you about as you watch. The sharp editing indicating shifts in time is done brilliantly.The Butterfly Effect is reminiscent of Donnie Darko (though not quite as good). Nonetheless, I recommend grabbing in on DVD and turning down the lights. Ashton Kutcher does a fine job too. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Anti-Quantum Leap,"The trailer for this film made it look like a mess. Giving us far too much information in a few seconds and turning me completely off it. I only saw it at the cinema because there was nothing else on and I'm glad I gave it a tiny chance.The concept is intriguing and the execution is brilliantly done. Set at three different stages in the lives of the four main characters we are quickly familiar with the sometimes curious, sometimes devastating events that shape their lives. The relationships between Evan, Kalley, Lenny and Tommy are very well developed and it's very interesting to watch them twist and change as Evan suffers from constant black-outs, Tommy goes totally insane and Kalley and Lenny even insaner. Almost all of them end up in the nut-house at some point.It's at this point that the older Evan (a horrifically bearded, pre-packaged, homogenised and sexually neutral 'pretty boy' Ashton Kutcher) decides to time travel back to his childhood, thanks to his incredible memory (how this is achieved is never explained!!!) and put right what once went wrong. Only each time he tries he just makes things worse and worse.The storylines involving the younger quartet are truly the best bits of the film. The young Tommy is one of the most evil and depraved characters I have ever seen and the younger Evan is far more interesting than his future counterpart. Whenever the film flashes forward to the college years I found it extremely lagging and wished for another time travel scene. Ashton Kutcher was far less expressive than his younger actors.And am I the only one noticing several nods to Se7en? Not only do they go see the movie as kids (how they got in is never explained either but I'm assuming they got tickets for Dumb and Dumber and sneaked in) but Evan's journals (his method of time travel!) are exactly the same as John Doe's and are written in the same manner. A curious bit of trivia indeed.For a film with a great story, a few scares and wonderfully (if not nicely) developed characters then seriously check this out. Tho I have one thing to ask the older Evan. What do you think is going to happen to your body if you stand in front of a mailbox being exploded by a lethal stick of dynamite???",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Entertaining but inherently flawed,"I must admit that I was intrigued by the premise of this movie: a young student with a tragic life history discovers unexplained powers that enable him to relive the past through memories, and even change history. It makes for some interesting twists, which the movie takes advantage of time and time again.But with a premise as complicated as time travel, there are steps the writer must take to keep the plot holes at a minimum. Unfortunately, the writers of Butterfly Effect are so busy exploring different possibilities for their new ""toy,"" that the plot holes are left there in abundance. Even a casual viewer can not help but notice them, and if you're one of those people who discusses things you noticed after watching a movie, you'll find that you like the film much less in retrospect.Plot holes aside, the film has a good pacing and an unmatched blend of tragedy, drama, and horror. Ashton Kutcher delivers an astonishing performance considering his history with comedies. Development of other characters is very uniquely executed, especially since a few characters have very different personalities when the main character alters history.All in all, the Butterfly Effect is an entertaining film, even though its integrity leaves something to be desired.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Proceed carefully, because everything can change","Ashton Kutcher was firmly associated with an actor who plays roles in youth comedies, but after watching the movie ""The Butterfly Effect"", I can confidently say that he is an excellent actor of dramatic cinema. Here he revealed his potential, having managed to embody on the screen the amazing Evan, who discovers in himself supernatural abilities to change time and events. Amy Smart is also beautiful. In my opinion, she turned into her ""heroines"" the best of all. A very emotional, lively performance of the actress, which makes us think that we really have a person from some parallel life in front of us.The film begins and continues in such a way that it is difficult to understand what is happening on the screen. A frequent trick of screenwriters and directors, but it works very effectively. And only then we begin to get to know the main characters closer. There are four of them.Evan, the guy who can, while reading his diary, go to the events he reads about, and change the course of history there. Kelly, Evan's good friend and love. And two friends, Lenny and Tommy, each of whom changes in an amazing way when events change. And here you can clearly see the masterful play of actors who try on completely different images on themselves. You don't even think that the actors of comedy films will prove themselves in this project.The film is very similar in its idea to the work of Ray Bradbury ""And the thunder broke."" However, here the emphasis is powerfully shifted from some global reasoning about the flapping of a butterfly's wing, to the action of such a flapping in a particular small group of friends. And the development of the plot perfectly demonstrates how dramatically what is happening can change, it is only necessary to slightly change the present.The movie makes you wonder what you would do if you could change your fate and the fate of your loved ones. You begin to imagine different options. In my opinion, if there is such a response, then the movie is great.The film has two endings. You need to look at both, because each will cause different emotions. The film ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a unique creation of people who approached the project with a soul, knew how to show an amazing story so that people associate themselves with the heroes, empathize and necessarily put themselves in their place.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
a future cult movie?,"I deeply feel that when it comes to real value and time resistance the audiences are better judges than critics. In this case, 'The Butterfly Effect' directed by two almost unknown newcomers got a good reception from viewers, including a rather high IMDb mark, while critics trashed it almost completely. I wonder what is the reason, and I ask myself if the instinct of the audiences did not see in this traumatized childhood to manhood story combined with alternate lives transitions something that critics missed.Much of the discussions were around Ashton Kutcher performance, and I dare say that in the absence of his off screen media exposure his performance would have been much highly rated. He holds this complex story on his shoulders, he does it with some doses of exaggeration at some points, but overall he is credible in the role of a traumatized young man, who is damned to change life lines more often than shaving.The theme is not easy, and the movie is not easy viewing. It can never be easy when childhood traumas caused by child abuse and their repercussions for the rest of the life are brought to scren. Due to the changes in the story line, each of the four main character goes through his own moments of ecstasy and agony. Yet, there is consistency in the story telling, there is both dramatism and magic in the search of the right path to take, there is credibility in acting and all these make of 'Butterfly Effect' a film to watch, that may last longer and better than expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Gimme a break.About a week ago, curiosity got the better of me, and I ended up renting it. The thing is, I'm almost ashamed to say it, I liked the movie. Now, I say that with a couple of caveats. First off, Ashton is nobody's idea of a dramatic actor and he performs about as well as you'd expect. The second thing that's wrong with the movie is that there seems to be a lot of ""movie science"" going on. Ashton studies caterpillars so that he can write a paper on memory loss. What? But, having said that, there is one thing that stands out about this movie. It takes some really bizarre turns for a studio film.

Quite simply one of the best supernatural thrillers ever made,"I feel like The Butterfly Effect wasn't taken as seriously as it could of been, or awarded the kind of praise it deserves because of pretty boy Ashton Kutcher taking on the lead role. I wouldn't blame people, because most of the time the acting choices he makes are asinine with a side of silly. This is a huge exception, however. He not only chose a mature, super interesting script, but put in a good effort and played his lead character with surprising skill. The film was marketed as a stylish, disturbing psychological thriller with paranormal undertones, which is exactly what it is. What it didn't plainly advertise was the core of the story, an extremely tragic romance that jerks at your heartstrings, making the otherworldly elements count for something more than just thrills by anchoring them in the simple, intimate story of two people dealing with hard lives, dangerous forces and unbreakable love. Plus, there's time travel, which automatically puts any film in my good books. Kutcher stars as Evan, a young college lad with an extremely troubled past that he's gone a long way to forget. Parts of it are harrowing, parts of it are confusing, but they're tied together by his childhood friend and one true love Kayleigh (Amy Smart), who by an unfortunate chain of events, ended up lost to him. He's constantly haunted by these recollections, and finds a vague, esoteric way to revisit them, through a mysterious diary he finds. This, however, provides a volatile link to the past, and entices him to attempt to sift back into the sands of time and try to prevent the suffering that him, Kayleigh and their childhood friends went through, by their own hand, and at the behest of other nasty people in their lives. Warned in flashbacks by his mentally troubled father (underrated Callum Keith Rennie) about the ramifications of his actions, he ventures forth into the great supernatural unknown all the same. In any film about time travel, the results of going back and meddling with the past always result in some shocking twists back home in the present. This film takes this idea and runs around the bases with it. Every attempt he makes to alter the mistakes and horror from his past only make things achingly worse every time he arrives back in his own when. The film also has a very bleak, unhappy tone that leaves you in an emotional gutter, but it's in that sadness and despair that I get a cinematic high a lot of the time. I guess I'm weird that way. Every valiant attempt at saving Kayleigh from her sick, abusive father (Eric Stoltz in a rare grimy turn that will make you shiver and want to run) turns sour, as does whatever he does to alleviate suffering brought on by irresponsible actions of himself and other two friends who grow up to be more messed up than him. The story is given way more care and attention than you'd expect from trailers or marketing, and remains a favourite of mine in the grisly sub genre of paranormal/psychological fare. It's also just a damn good story, focusing on character development and deeply reflecting on the actions of one man, and how they might ripple through the psychosphere and do more harm than the initially intended good. Ethan Suplee, Eldon Hanson, Cameron Bright, Kevin Durand, Melora Walters and Logan Lerman also make vivid impressions. There are two versions, a theatrical and a director's cut. Though considerably different in their conclusions, they both offer endings that will have you choking back tears for different, equally heartbreaking reasons. I prefer the theatrical one, as it's not quite as suffocating as the other, and just provides the perfect drop of hope in the sea of sadness that we've just witnessed, and just suits the film more overall.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Freakin Amazing,"I was pretty impressed with this movie. I mean first of you see the previews and you don't exactly see a stellar cast. but then you go and actually watch the movie and your just where the hell did this come from? I thought that Kutches movie career ended with Dude where's my car? Doomed to play characters with the substance and IQ of a sponge for all eternity. Where the hell did this come from? I mean who knew that Kutcher could really act, and act well mind you. Its really a great watch, and something that you can watch over and over again.

not awful but pretty ridiculous,"Come on, now. All y'all out there giving this movie 9 or 10 stars need to lay off the glue. This thing is nearly as juvenile as some of the bland TV remakes of Outer Limits episodes. I will toss in a crumb for the pretty boy Ashton K. Considering what he's given to work with, he does the job well enough to stave off any knee-jerk compulsions to blow taters. I am willing to run with unconventional plots and non-linear time renditions. But at least get the details to a semi-credible level if the plot is going to do the Memento thing. The prison sequences were freakin' hilarious. The whole thing wreaked of low budgetness and really bad conceptualization. It gets something of a reprieve for the ""having fun with itself"" factor. Loved the terrier. It's maybe worth a discount rental price. Other than that, immanently forgettable.

Its about Sacrifice,The movie is not about the time travel or about the powers one man has. It is about the sacrifice one has to make. Sometimes how much you love some one it just wont happen. Any power in the world wont make it happen. And only those who have faced it may know it. What Aston did for Amy in the movie is a sign of it. He loves her and always will but never have her. Even if he loves her the most. Its not a happy story its a sad story. And I really don't think 7.8 by so many people means nothing......Its just a beautiful peace of art.

So beautifully haunting,"I steered away from this movie completely, I mean, Ashton Kutcher in a drama? It seemed like some crazy alternate universe. But everyone just keeps telling me on and on about how great this movie is, so I figured why not give it a chance? I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how well this picture was made.Ashton plays Evan, a guy who has had a pretty bad childhood, but always blacks out at key moments in his life, so a therapist suggests write down as much as he can remember about the incident in a journal. But when he grows up and over all has a decent life, he bumps into his old crush and she has turned out pretty bad, she ends up killing herself, but when Evan finds out that he can turn back time by reading his journal, he can change the past. So, he does that several times finding out that the past is too precious to change and to except things as they are.Even though I wasn't as into this movie as I can see others are, I still very much enjoyed it. Like I said, this turned into a surprisingly good film and Ashton actually did a good job as a dramatic actor, he just scored some points on my list.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Misnamed and terrible acting!,"The so called ""Butterfly Effect"" is related to a mathematical discipline known as Chaos theory. In the movie there's a ""going back in time"" theme. Chaos Theory's main thrust has nothing to do with going back in time...period! No need for details here as no one would read them and there's plenty of information on the Internet, just search on Chaos Theory.Based on what occurs in the movie a more appropriate title would have been ""The Einstein Effect."" But obviously the movie's movers and shakers used an inappropriate title to gain attention as Chaos Theory has been popularized in various mass media including newspapers and television.Forgetting the above one has to suffer through some of the world's worst acting. It's so bad that getting shot at sunrise would be a welcomed alternative to having to watch this movie. Take away the fancy sets and the special effects and you have a 2003 version of Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space!"" With a far smaller budget Ed Wood's picture is funnier and has much better acting!IF you watch this movie and aren't at least giggling through most it, I feel sorry for you.

Director's Cut = Predictable Ending and Funny Moments Meant To Be Taken Seriously,"*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind Buy""The Butterfly Effect (Director's Cut)"" takes a unique concept and seems to take every step to ensure that the finished product is terrible. The movie is about Evan Treborn, a 20 year old college student who shared a troubled childhood with his friends. The first half hour is used to set up his childhood while leaving certain holes to be filled in later for shock value. Evan suffered from black outs as a child and in the hopes of recovering his lost memories he kept journals. These journals, years later, opened up his ability to travel back in time to change his childhood. What follows is the butterfly effect at work in which every little change alters reality in unpredictable ways.The script is the first to blame for this film's downfall. I found myself laughing out loud at many of the scenes that were meant to show us Evan's troubled childhood. That was only the beginning. When Evan first goes back to change his past he goes to one particular memory involving Kayleigh's father. Evan prevents the incident by yelling and threatening the man. At the time of the incident Evan was 7 years old. Kayleigh's father was suddenly intimidated by the young Evan when he began talking back to him. I found this ridiculous as the man so easily went from commanding the children to being terrified of Evan. Most of the exposition in the first half hour of the film got the same response from me.I will admit that the film did get slightly better once the characters grew up and the actual time traveling began. However, it was only a small step up. The acting improved quite a bit from the childhood sequence, but the film was marred by the complete lack of chemistry between Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart. Ashton Kutcher surpassed my expectations of his acting ability in the movie, if only slightly. His acting was still bad but it wasn't terrible like I expected it to be. He delivered his lines with little to no emotion throughout most of the film which eventually got distracting.I watched the director's cut of the film which included a different ending than the theatrical version. I have read about the theatrical ending and was happy I saw the director's cut. Even though neither ending is fantastic I prefer the one I saw, no matter how predictable it was, as it matched the dark tones that were present throughout the rest of the film. I give ""The Butterfly Effect"" a * rating. Despite the overwhelming word of mouth this movie has received I would advise everyone to stay away from it atleast until it is available conveniently on television.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Storm Butterfly!,"Imagine a guy, Evan, who wakes up with the superpower to fix the past. Well, ""fix"" is a bit of a stretch: it's like giving a flamethrower to a pyromaniac to put out a fire. The guy dives into a cleanup mission through time rewinds to save his friends and his girlfriend. The result? Every slap to the past is a punch to the present. It's a wild ride!You enter The Butterfly Effect like stepping into an escape room where each choice is more claustrophobic than the last. You try to fix one thing, and everything spirals out of control. And the film plays with this to the max: scenes where you're completely lost, choices within choices that make you want to rewatch it just to grasp how Evan can mess up so much in one movie.And beware, we're not talking about Back to the Future-style time travel with ""fun time paradoxes."" This is the hardcore version where every adjustment to the past leads to an even more messed-up future. These butterfly effects show you that every choice has a price, and it's not a bargain. The visuals are sharp, and each consequence throws you into an even grittier reality.Where everyone saw him as the handsome, easy-going guy, Ashton brings out the heavy artillery here. We're miles away from cheesy sitcoms. The guy shows he's got guts and raises the stakes like no one else. You can feel he's really living through each version of his own descent into hell. For once, he's done joking, and he makes you feel it.The film is packed with details, and as a bonus, it offers alternate endings that'll have you banging your head against the wall (like, there's even one where the hero comes back... before he's even born). So if you loved this slightly masochistic journey through time, dive into these variations. They're worth it, and you'll understand why The Butterfly Effect is still a shiver-inducing classic.In the ""messing with the past to destroy the future"" genre, this film is a masterclass. A dramatic thriller that hooks you from start to finish, Ashton Kutcher shattering preconceptions, and a butterfly effect that shows sometimes it's better to leave things alone than to mess everything up.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sometimes we just wanted everything to be ""good"" in our lives, we forgot how the goods would be emerged from the bads, perhaps it is exactly what makes life so beautiful.The movie is cleverly directed, though lots of jumping through times, the story is still clearly and brilliantly told. It reminded me of another movie Groundhog Day, a similar story about changing the past, accompanied with some unexpected future, but Butterfly Effect is more outstanding as it tells the story in a more philosophical overtone.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Scream of the Butterfly,"****SPOILERS**** The movie ""Butterfly Effect"" starts off like a deep psychological drama and then slowly turns into and finally in the last half of the film becomes a Sci-Fi adventure about time travel.Young Evan Treborn, Ashton Kutcher, has been suffering severe black-outs all his life, a condition that put his father Jason, Callum Keith, in a mental institution. Being examined at the hospital for his black-outs the doctor suggests that Evan keep a journal, which is central to the story, about what happened every day to him in order to jog back his memory.As Edan grows up and leaves for college the black-outs stop and for once in his life Edan becomes normal like everyone else. Involved in a college project about memory retention Evan dusts off his journals that he hasn't read for years and when he does read them the black-outs of his childhood begin to be filled in. Excited over this discovery Edan goes to see a childhood friend Larry,Elden Henson, who he hasn't seen for years to confirm if his new memories of the past are true or just imagined. To Edan's surprise from what he gets from Larry his visions are true but Larry unlike Edan wants to forgets about them. Edan's bringing them up depresses Larry so much that his mother tells Edan never to see or call Larry again.Edan then goes back to the town where he lived as a little boy to see Kayley, Amy Smart,who is at first glad to see him but when Edan brings up the story about her and himself being forced to have sex and being taped by her sick and pedophile father George,Eric Stoltz, she becomes very upset. It may be new to Evan but Kayley had been trying to put that terrible event out of her mind for years and didn't want it brought up again. Still Edan is so obsessed about what Kayley's father did to her and himself that he doesn't notice or realize how it's hurting Kayley and later he finds out from her outraged brother Tommy, Willie Lee Scott, that Kayley killed herself.After that movie turns from a drama about remembering past events to going back in time to change them. It's never fully explained, all Edan does is just look dates in his journal, just how but Edan somehow manages to go back in time and try to change events, that happened to him and his friends, for the better but instead they only become worse.Edan goes back in time four times and in all those times that he changes the past the future is even bleaker that it was without the changes. Edan ends up killing Tommy and then put in jail where he's beaten and brutalized. He's responsible for having Larry kill Tommy which has Larry put away in a mental ward for the rest of his life and Keyley becomes a hooker and drug addict from the shock of seeing her brother Tommy killed as a young girl.Edan loses both his arms in an explosion that leads his mother Andrea, Melona Waiters, who never touched tobacco, starts to chain-smoke and eventually dies of lung cancer at an early age. And on his last trip back in time Edan accidentally kills Kayley, by trying to stop her father from molesting her, when he's seven years-old and spends the rest of his life in a mental hospital.Even though Edan's father has the same illness as Edan has we never see him go back in time. The end of the movie is a bit of a letdown with Edan putting Kayley out of his life forever when they both were seven years-old and thus not try to go back in time to correct the damage that her father, as well as himself by bringing it up, did to Kayley that led to her suicide.As far as we know time travel may very well be possible in the future but the ability to change past events isn't. Changing the past for the better,if at all possible, is like a game of poker, you never know what hand you'll be dealt. If your able to change past events you can't know how those changes will effect the future and those effect can make the future far worse then it already is. Which is what Edan so sadly found out in the movie ""The Butterfly Effect"".",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Another ""What If"" Film that is Worth Watching","Most psychology majors have a motivation for succeeding at academia-it's their own fundamental problems which they try to figure out. Maybe they find the answers, maybe they don't, but along the way, many become successful at their profession. This movie is an incredible thought experiment, as the main character, Evan, painfully plays out several alternate universe threads, ultimately making the sacrifice of distancing himself from the person he loves the most. The beautiful thing about choosing a psychologist as the protagonist is that the viewer is left in suspense at the end of the film, even though everything is neatly explained. Though the events may never have happened (if one is to believe the linear explanation of the plot) Evan has the memories of them, and therefore is either truly insane, or a complete master of his own mind with the ability to empathize with others and understand all possible outcomes of a mental decision. If you liked this one, you may try watching or reading ""Lathe of Heaven"" by Ursula K Leguin for an older take on the same concept, but the cinematography in ""Butterfly"" is excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

However Miller would film him in pornography with Kayleigh while Tommy watch. As a teen, Evan, Tommy, Kayleigh and Lenny have an incident but Evan has another blackout. His treatment in Sunnyvale Institution doesn't reveal his blackouts. Kayleigh continues to be abused by her father. Tommy's anger sends him on a bad path and he grows to hate Evan for his love of Kayleigh. Evan moves out of the neighborhood and vows to return for Kayleigh. In college, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has left behind his past and his blackouts. He's living with wild man Thumper (Ethan Suplee). He reads his old notebook and flashbacks to moments in his childhood. He returns to the neighborhood to find Lenny as a volatile recluse. Kayleigh (Amy Smart) is a defeated girl working as a waitress. His return drives her to commit suicide. Tommy is an ex-con.

"Twilight Zone revisited gets emotional, disturbing","This movie was damn good, especially after seeing the horribly thin range of Ashton Kutcher's acting choices in the past.  I'm glad that he changed my mind about his career because I was getting pretty fed-up with this possible pretty-boy/actor thing going on with him.  The movie had me annoyed at first, for the constant foreshadowing and the switch of the plot that occurs every 10 minutes or so.  (I hate that trait which is made so popular nowadays with Memento and films like that...I personally think that mysteries could be unravelled in a different way)::PLOT RUINED:: So anyways, I was taken back by the trippy flashback/memory loss material and the fact that the journals jogged his memory to such an extent where they acted as a portal for the future to change.  This allows the movie to grow more on you because you want everything that continues to go wrong with Kutcher's character to change for the better but unfortunately...can't reveal the end now!I found myself crying (a 23 year-old man) at a few scenes because of how Kutcher handles his delivery.  Amy Smart does a touching and brilliant job as the love-interest-since-teenagehood character, transforming herself into 3 different entities with unique personalities in the same movie.  Very Twilight Zone-esque...It deserves the 8 that I gave it because of the aforementioned actors' portrayals, the brilliant tie-ins that directors Bress & Gruber wrap into this focussed ending, and the great existence of the alternate lifestyle changes for the character of Evan Treborn.

Intriguing - but ultimately this film doesn't quite do it,"We saw this film back when it came out (2004ish). We were intrigued by it then - and still are!I could have sworn that this was a film from the 1990s. But it isn't. Maybe that's the Butterfly Effect? Maybe the things we remember are NOT what actually happened? In that case, what did actually happen? Who would know it? How would it be known? Recalled? And by whom? Why? And when?There is something deeply metaphysical going on here.The Butterfly Effect attempts to consider what would happen if, as a matter of fact, we could change our choices - and change the things that happened.The intriguing pieces are thrown out through the screen for us to consider. The problem is that the story doesn't quite hang together.Our son (now 20!), who tends to be fairly discerning about his movies (I blame the parents...), discounted the movie immediately. He hated it on pretty much every level. He's young, he doesn't have so much life experience - but his comments are pertinent.The truth is - The Butterfly Effect considers the human condition in relation to memory, but does some pretty strange things with it. So strange in fact that it becomes fairly incredible.Ashton Kutchner is very good as the lead. He is working with some difficult material here and he does well. Amy Smart is also good, showing versatility and range. The others are OK. Dialogue is a bit ordinary. Overall - this is a fairly standard issue Hollywood product.The Butterfly Effect (originating with Ray Bradbury in 1952...) is a profound thing. We implicitly understand cause & effect.

Second, this is not an original idea at all. The Simpsons Halloween Special IV has an episode featuring Homer traveling through time and everything he does has an adverse affect, finally he settles with something that is close to how things were. Other movies such as Donnie Darko also use this idea, but Donnie Darko was a much better film. Thirdly, the film had too many flaws, the fact that he was so confused after his first time travel despite the fact the film showed his new memories being created. He would have known how he got there, and he was not confused the second, third, etc. time that he traveled through time. Also, the fact that he was still in prison after the stigmata holes. The dog burning? That was completely unnecessary, it really showed nothing and was just cruel. The movie would have been infinitely better had it turned out that Evan truly could not travel through time as the doctor tells him when he demands his journals, that would be an unexpected ending, and made the movie less cheesy.

And it also shows how different childhoods can make more trauma in the overall scheme of things involving parents and the friends you grow up with. To think of something so small that can have a high impact. Beautifully written and filmed I would recommend to anyone looking for a great movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It is said that the mere flutter of a butterfly can impact things halfway around the world,"Released in 2004 and directed/written by Eric Bress & J. Mackye Gruber, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a sci-fi/thriller/horror starring Ashton Kutcher as a young man who suffers blackouts during significant events of his life. In college he finds a way to remember these lost memories and, more significantly, alter bad events by supernaturally traveling to the past via focusing on the words in his old journals. Unfortunately, changing the past has unforeseen repercussions. Amy Smart plays his girlfriend and William Lee Scott her psycho (or maybe not) brother. Melora Walters appears as his mother while Elden Henson plays his pal, Lenny.This is an ambitious movie that cogently shows how changing one element of the past has a ripple effect, both positive and negative. The constant change in timeline makes the story seem jumbled at first, but the movie finds its footing and everything ultimately makes sense. Kutcher is surprisingly good in the lead role while Amy is solid in support, and fetching.Where the movie sometimes goes off the rails is the exaggerated behavior of some of the characters throughout. The way they act just doesn't ring true and it comes across goofy, like characters in a comedic slasher flick. It's as if the writers don't understand how real people act in the situations in question; even wackos don't behave as portrayed. As such, these sequences come off surreal at best. But, if you can handle this glaring flaw, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a worthwhile quasi-horror flick, although be forewarned that icky topics are breached (but thankfully only breached).The film runs 113 minutes while the Director's Cut with the originally-intended ending runs 120 minutes. The consensus is that the theatrical version is superior to the bleak, cold and grotesque climax of the Director's Cut. The locations are awesome, by the way, shot in the Vancouver area.GRADE: Borderline B-/C+",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrific movie if you're intelligent enough to understand it.,"Even though for the most part I'm merely a lurker on these boards, I ABSOLUTELY felt compelled to comment this time around simply because this movie has gotten such unjustly bad reviews by people who just don't get it. I will admit, that watching the movie was very confusing early on and for the longest time it just seemed to have no real point. Okay, so once having discovered his unique gift, this kid can go back in time and change his life's events--BIG DEAL. However, the POINT of the movie is exactly that even IF YOU HAVE THIS POWER, you CANNOT change things, no matter what. Things are supposed to be a certain way--this is determined only by the Fates--and that is something you simply MUST accept. There is no way around this fact.You may not understand WHY things happen the way they do, but everything happens for the BEST, and that is determined by the Fates, and only the Fates. Don't dwell on how awful your life is, or what terribly tragic, unfortunate thing just happened to you--everything truly does happen for a reason. In the end, the expectant mother is distraught over her miscarriage, but little does she know that is the best thing that could've happened to her, her family, and the never-born child.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
very powerful,"I saw this movie and it was very, very powerful. It made me cry tears of sadness and joy throughout the whole thing. This was a very real movie, but at the same time very sci-fi. The characters go through a very rough childhood, and because of that there lives become screwed up. The main character goes back in time to try to change the past and alter the future of his friends. The actors did an outstanding job. Ashton and Amy mad the movie feel very real and dramatized it as if it were really happening. I would definitely recommend this movie to people that like very dramatic, powerful movies. This is definitely not a family movie, and was rated correctly. A definet go and see movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Flashbacks, Disturbing Sequences","""The Butterfly Effect"", to my understanding, is attempting to achieve an effect of consternation, calamity, and ""flash-forwarding through time"", and for its credit, makes a good presentation in displaying the confusion, curiosity, and self-discovery of Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), through some of the most gritty, dizzying, and even maddening editing to ever be approved for film. This is a troubled story about a troubled soul, seeking to alter his troubled life through somehow ""rewriting his own history"". Sounds quite confusing and maybe preposterous? Well, add this seemingly inane plot to the consternation of some terribly giddy editing and include some really bizarre characters such as Evan's Gothic friend Lenny (Elden Henson), and ""The Butterfly Effect"" is virtually nothing more than a series of constant, confusing flashbacks, brazen plot and character development (why is Evan the way he is, what is the logic behind his ""unworldly epiphany""?), and a puzzling and maddening roller-coaster of editing. The purpose of Evan as a child becoming a narrator for the events at hand remains to be untold: the little boy, chronicling Evan's revisions in his journal as he reconfronts various experiences, should have merely played those experiences out, rather than analyze every tumultuous detail of his existence! This movie really offered an intriguing plot: time-warping, revising periods of blackouts and reliving and correcting certain inadequacies in life, and this would have been perfectly enjoyable entertainment, if the plot, editing, and story were coherent enough to not come across as merely disturbing and zany! Perhaps the story has a profoundly larger message that can only be conceived by the most curious and attentive of spectators who view it, yet as far as I am concerned, ""The Butterfly Effect"" offers little more than confusion, delirium, and one head-splitting headache... *1/2 out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
intriguing time-bending thriller,"Have you ever wondered how differently your life might have turned out had you taken a left turn instead of a right on the day of that fateful accident, or chosen a different college or career path, or not gone to that dance the night you met your one true love?  All of us have played this `what if' game at some point in our lives, speculating about where we might be, whom we might know and what we might be doing now if even a single event in our past had played out differently.  And how many of us would be willing to return to a key moment in our past if we knew that, by doing something different, we could forever alter the path our life ended up taking?  And what if we discovered that by undoing that event we ended up altering our lives and the lives of those around us in ways we never expected?  Would we still want to do it?This is the premise for `The Butterfly Effect,' an effectively creepy supernatural thriller that boasts a star-making performance by Ashton Kutcher.  Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a young man in college who, since his childhood, has been suffering inexplicable blackouts at key traumatic moments in his life.  And traumatic his life has been!  His father is consigned to a mental institution, suffering from an ailment that may have been passed on to his son.  In addition, Evan is friends with a young girl, Kayley, whose father sexually abuses not only her but Evan as well.  Kayley also has a sadistic little brother named Lenny, who inspires Evan, Kayley and a neighbor friend of theirs to perform malicious pranks and even sets Evan's dog on fire.  Now that he's in college, Evan discovers he has the power to transport himself back in time to many of these key moments in his life in an attempt to rewrite history and undo the mental and psychological damage they've caused.  The trouble is that Evan finds out that changing the course of history often brings a whole host of other unforeseen and unanticipated problems right along with it.Directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber have fashioned a complex, intricate screenplay filled with plot twists that continually alter the plane of the film's reality.  The story hurtles us back and forth in time, showing us what was, what is and then what might have been without a moment's confusion, all the while making us question whether Evan isn't simply insane after all.  There are a few, perhaps inevitable, plot holes, the most glaring of which is why Evan is unable to find out how a prank he and his friends committed in their childhood turned tragically wrong (Evan blacked out during the event).  Considering the fact that the tragedy was one that became common knowledge in the small town in which Evan lived, it is highly implausible that he would have to wait till his early 20's before he finally found out what had happened.  In addition, one might question the propriety of using a topic as sensitive as pedophilia for a supernatural thriller.  Still, those are minor quibbles for a story that works remarkably well at keeping itself credible and focused despite the inherent absurdity at its core.Kutcher does an effective job carrying the film.  By not being too handsome or too heroic, Kutcher keeps Evan life-sized and interesting.  We're willing to follow him through this elaborate labyrinth because we can identify with the truths of his character.  He's a young man who genuinely wants to make things better for the people he cares for, yet the mental anguish he is going through as he attempts to piece together some semblance of comprehensible reality from the jumbled fragments of his life comes through loud and clear.`The Butterfly Effect' is not your usual mind-numbing, schlock thriller.  It has intelligence and style and a very intriguing storyline.  It will probably get you rewinding some of those key events in your own life, wondering might have been.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Masterpiece...,"I've just finished the director's cut and I really enjoyed this very well thought-out plot. As a big fan of sci fi I found myself pleased with the treatment of all of the subject matter. Ashton made the main character believable and keeps you guessing as his mental state changes.  It's hard to know what is real and what is real to him.  I  highly recommend this film for fans of mysteries, time travel, mental health dramas, etc. One word of warning though, if you have issues with children in dire situations, brace yourself.

Good because of how bizarre and hyperbolic it is,"I remember watching this as a kid and I kinda liked it.Re-watching 15 years later, I can say it only got better.I love how unpredictable it can be sometimes, and the way they overly exagerrate things also works in this context, providing for some good emotional moments.The acting holds up, making you actually care for Evan and his friends. I also enjoyed the concept of how our past changes who we are and the message of the film that you can't change who people are without destroying who they were.This film is also a rare example when the director's cut is worse than the theatrical one, while re-watching I've seen the director's one and I don't think the film needed those scenes (especially the prison rape scene) and the director's ending is just ridiculous (while I understand the general idea, the execution is laughable).I didn't touch the sequels and I don't recommend anyone to see them too.P. S. I'd like to see a modern re-make of this by a director who is able to produce more subtle emotional moments, maybe like Denis Villeneuve or Christopher Nolan (in his better stories). I think a slightly different take can be interesting with a story like this, but it is still good the way it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What would you change??,"So your life isn't perfect. You've had some pretty traumatic experiences you've managed to 'block out'. It's not that unusual; after all, you've experienced blackouts since childhood, most notably when these traumatic incidents occur. Must be your brain's way of coping, or something, because bad memories just aren't that great, right?For Evan (Kutcher) a university Psych major, working on how the brain and memory are linked, and how memories can be recovered (specifically his own, perhaps?) maybe the occurrence of his blackouts mean slightly more than just a coping mechanism of his tortured grey matter. Having kept meticulous journals since he was a  kid on the advice of his shrink, Evan starts re-reading long-forgotten passages from the stacks of composition books he's taken with him to assist with his research.That's when the weird stuff starts.We're treated to nifty optical effects - the words shifting and fluttering on the page like a butterfly's wings (Meant, I suppose, to refer back to that quote from the ""chaos theory"" we're treated to at the beginning of the film - you know - the one about the beating of a butterfly's wings could result in a typhoon on the other side of the world, or whatever...) Evan is all of a sudden transported back to a time and place from his past - and he realises that what he is seeing is an event from one of his blackouts, what he thinks to be a repressed memory. Is it simply a memory he now is able to recall, or has he somehow found a way to actually physically transport himself back to that time where he can change the outcome of that event?We're never given any real reason why this phenomenon should occur - but that isn't what this movie is about. It is about a young man obsessed with creating for himself the perfect life, but in so doing either destroys the lives of those he cares about or has devastating consequences for his own. It makes us see that even the smallest event from our pasts and the choices we make then and there can have unforeseen and unpredictable results. Do we dare tamper with that if we had the ability?Top marks go to Kutcher, because he gives an incredible performance that I didn't think he had it in him to give. The rest of the cast is simply superb, and the make-up artists need a big thumbs up for making us believe that the characters could appear mousy in one outcome, glamorous in another, horrifying and homely in yet another.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Anything that can happen will happen!!!!!!,"In the film, a young man, Evan Treborn(Ashton Kutcher) who like his institutionalized dad before him,has memory blackouts that he must deal with. After several years had passed, Evan discovers a supernatural technique to alter his entire life and find his vanished and harrowing memories.Unfortunately, in order to relive these moments and recollections in his past, there are critical and severe consequences.To begin, Evan is born and raised in a small town with his hard working, single mom. He begins to develop a strong friendship with the fellow neighborhood kids and continuously seems to find himself in some kind of trouble.On top of it all, Evan suffers from these harsh blackouts,finding himself in a whole other place.After these instances, he has no recollection of the occurrences, and thus, wakes up very confused. Needless to say, neither his friends nor family played by Amy Smart and Eric Stoltz truly believe that these incidents are honestly happening.

Powerful Movie hides Metaphysical Truths,"This is a great movie everyone should see, not because it's perfect, but because the message of the movie is very deep and powerful if you are receptive to it.In the movie the protagonist has a ""gift"", but in reality it represents a gift that all human beings have. In real life it's not so supernatural or dramatic like how its portrayed in the movie, but pretty much the same thing. The gift is that ultimately we have the ability create our own reality through our choices on how we perceive it, the movie focuses on the pitfalls of using that ability. The protagonists' mistake is he can't accept the past, and keeps trying to control other people. Only when he lets go, and when he is willing to sacrifice his immediate desires, and instead use his wisdom to make a choice that he knows will create the greatest good for the most people in his life, does his world end up in a harmonious state.The end of the movie was kind of disappointing at first, it's kind of ambiguous and open-ended, I wanted a happy ending. But for this kind of movie, perhaps an open-ended ending is best.Read some Darryl Anka and Esther Hicks books and then watch this movie and make the connections, it will blow your mind!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The butterfly effect,"Fascinating movie, incredible per say. And now has earned the title of being my favourite movie. Although confusing at times the movie is a gem, good acting, unique plot and an unreal timeline. This movie is like a puzzle solving itself over time, the more you know the less to solve but also the more to wonder. I really like the way of events how at first it seems like an ordinary film but then turns into a twisted reality parallel to the main one but still differed to the first one. This movie hooks you instantly and leaves you with many questions to answer. This is one of those movies that set a new standard for the film industry movies like these make a difference and inspire other movies. However I'm not a fan of the sequels since they milk the franchise for money which usually ruins the spirit of many movies.

A young man trying to change his troubled past by filling and changing up the gaps in his memory using his journals and inherited trait from his father.,"Unlike the name suggests, Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber's movie is not something related to the chaos theory which indulge intricate realm of physics. The complex movie title is just to infer the basic fact that future gets changed if your past changes. The movie starts in an asylum with Evan Treborn (played by Ashton Kutcher) breaks from his cell and gets into a room, from where the movie goes into flashback in Evan's childhood.Deprived from his father's love as his father is a psychopath, Evan lives with her mother and has friends. Evan has a really troublesome childhood, not only due to his friends and family, but also because he is experiencing strange phenomenon of blackouts for which neither he nor medical sciences has the answers. Earlier in the movie, a lot of scenes of Evan's blackouts appear in which after the blackouts, he would not be able to remember what had happened to him. Due to his persistent conditions, his mother makes decision to move from the city leaving behind his friends and all his unanswered blackouts.The story turns into a new mold after 7 years, during which, no blackouts occurred with Evan and him leading a normal life, until when he discovers something strange with his childhood journals one night. He get his answers of his blackouts by mistake, which changes his whole life. He experiments with his past and tries to jot out the things. It is, at the least to say, complicated. The more he intrigues in his past, more complicated the situation for him becomes. Using his missing pieces of memory, he changes lives of others: killed some, reborn some, completely changed some, even blown and regrown his own hands. Like I mentioned: complicated.Even the whole movie consisted of several parts and backgrounds, it is amazing that still the whole story is woven perfectly. Considering the characters and the story background are bounced round like pinball, it is quite appreciating how Ashton keep up the same emotion traction during whole of the movie. Also it is quite a work of other characters (Amy Smart, Eldon Henson, Melora Walters) too when your role and character changed this much time as in this movie.Overall, to wrap up, the movie is very good if someone is looking for suspense and thriller. This movie is pretty unique and one of its kind. The movie keeps up the viewer expectation very strongly about what will happen next. Good acting, direction and editing are surely a plus point which could really make the viewer watch this movie again.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It is these pains that make us feel the unforgettable memories of life.,"Each of us fantasies about being able to change the past and make our current state better, or hoping to live a different life and become someone else. This movie reflects this idea and the outcome if we really do. Evan keeps changing his past choices, hoping to find a perfect future. But the opposite often leads to a more tragic ending. For a time, humans have forgotten their understanding of themselves, thinking that they are God, and ultimately will still recognize the various limitations of nature. However, it is precisely this limitation that reflects the meaning of life, choices, and efforts. When we look back, we naturally feel regretful for our past mistakes, but it is precisely these mistakes and paths that have shaped our personality; It is these pains that make us feel the unforgettable memories of life.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's also briefly and shockingly violent, but that comes in small doses and is mostly only shocking because it's surprising. The ending was also changed to be less shocking than it originally was, which makes a few previous comments and plot points not fit into the story as well.

Not to make this feel like a Personal(by the way I actually do like long walks on the beach) I am a very smart, Human Biology major and a self described ""film enthusiast"", I actually liked this film a lot. Some people that are a little bit too uptight may be mad that such a good looking kid like Asthon Kutcher got the lead part (Somone that time travels, just can't be hittin' Demi Moore) however he actually blends very well into the part of a confused young person that does not know what is going on, because if you time travel as much as he does in this film you might just have that ""dude where is my (insert lost item here)"" look. Ashton does a great job, hands down, no questions asked. Amy Smart proves beyond her ""plain-looking-cuteness"", as my frat boy friend described, that she is capable to pull of a semi-complex role and that is more than a lot of Hollywood actresses can say. The supporting cast is just that, Supporting. No one steals the role, no one shines, but they do an excellent job of just being there....no matter what life is chosen.Alright, no matter what, if you have ever been interested in time travel and you are NOT pretentious or a very unlucky bastard that wishes that everything had gone your way instead of ""pretty-boy-ashton-kutcher's"" way, then watch this film, you will enjoy it just for the concept and for the way that a fellow human beings life plays out by the choices made in life.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Kutcher, as Evan, is perfectly adequate, breaking away from his pigeonhole as a funnyman. Amy Smart also impresses as Kalley, playing several variations of herself with style and charisma, while Eric Stoltz, as her dad, is chilling.The special effects are good, the script is clever and the consequences of action are well thought out.

The Overall Effect Of The Butterfly Effect,"*Possible Spoilers!*In the movies, whenever it comes to the likes of time travel, it always seems to me that heading forward into the future is about 10 times more successful than going back into the past.This, of course, makes a lot of sense since the future really isn't set yet. (Unless you believe in fate) So, it can, sort of, be tampered with or altered to some degree. But mucking around with the past and events that have already taken place is a lot like skating on extremely thin ice.For the most part I found the Butterfly Effect to be way too disjointed in its format to be seriously considered really good entertainment. (What an editing nightmare this film must've been)I do give the director a lot of credit for making a darn good attempt at trying to convince me that traveling into the past is, indeed, plausible.But since the main character came from such a dysfunctional life to begin with there was absolutely no way in hell that he was ever going to remedy things no matter how many times he tinkered around with things.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wonderful dramatic depiction of time travel,"After suffering blackouts when he was a kid, Evan (Kutcher) finds by reading his journal he can alter the past by travelling back in time.The art of time travel has been developed in cinema throughout its entirety. In the 1960's Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke showed man's development with a fantastic cut from apes to spaceships in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Richard Kelly thrived on his Donnie Darko creation by sending the character threw wormholes to alter time in 2001.Both films astounded movie fanatics and hoping for more of the same we trundled along to see Punk'd presenter Ashton Kutcher star in another sci-fi time travelling twisting drama, and we were treated to yet another fantastic mystery.This 2004 release still sparks debates with its complex dealing with time travel and the approach to it. When Evan reaches his mid-twenties he realises he can travel back in time to alter circumstances just by reading his own notes. The shaking camera alerts us to his powers and we are soon in the heart of a complex mystery as we follow Evan in a voyage of discovery to see what really happened when he suffered from blackouts as a kid.There are shocking turns of events that unfold as we and Evan come to realise the truth. As well as conveying the concept of time travel, The Butterfly Effect aims to preach through its real life issues such as paedophilia, bullying, suicide and mental illness. It is a quite brutal piece of film making that does echo Kelly's sublime picture, but before the term carbon copy crosses your mind, there are some finer details to point out.Donnie Darko after all, whilst dramatic and scientifically able to cope with illness and time travel, is much more light-hearted with in jokes and good nature. Bress and Gruber's picture is exceptionally dramatic and a lot more romantic. The whole pictures spurts out issues of love and lust and 'doing the right thing' and because of this goal, has shimmied itself away from Darko. Plus the nature of time travel is religiously connected here, a shocking and dramatic side issue connected with mental health.The fantasy sequences for Evan when he first sees he can travel back in time are quite unnerving and surprising. The consequences of time alteration are very good. We are left guessing as to what has happened in the new world.Kutcher we know is funny and a practical person but here we see his dark and dramatic side which fits in well with the narrative. Amy Smart fits the role of romantic interest well enough whilst Henson and Scott fit their respective parts independently and uniquely to give an energy of diverse opinions to proceedings.There are 4 alternate endings and this is a review for the director's cut and after seeing this particular ending I find myself against seeing the other endings as it will take the shine off a fine debatable conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Aside from all of that, he is a better actor than people give him credit for, and he does have some acting skill. The child actors in this film are good, and they do a wonderful job. I was confused at times because I wasn't sure what Evan (Kutcher) was trying to accomplish when he goes back into his memories and also it is never explained how he could do that. I watched both versions of the film and I preferred the Director's Cut as opposed to the Theatrical Version. The Director's Cut ends on a different tone, but I prefer it as it accompanies the characteristics of Evan and what he would do just to save others. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

However, it didn't really show him as much more than a slightly more serious version of his character in 'Dude Where's My Car' (2000).I appreciated that he was trying something a bit different, but I wondered if someone else might have given the film more of an impact.It was an incredibly dark production with some very horrible things in it at times and not quite what I had been expecting, but essentially the concept was very clever, although it could certainly have been delivered with a bit more effect and I think that a lot of that was due to the fact that it was filmed in a similar way to 'American Pie' (1999) and other similar films. It didn't seem to have the right feel to its production and the cast didn't carry enough weight to deliver the heavier content.It definitely explored subjects that might be upsetting for some viewers and I can't say that I enjoyed the film, but I could see the potential.

Brilliant and incredibly compelling,"This is, if not a masterpiece, then very short of it. I don't use that word lightly; few cinematic efforts deserve to be credited as such. This is deeply psychological, not to mention rather accurate and credible in that, and complex. I can only imagine how long it must have taken to write it. Many people talk about the quality of Ashton Kutcher's acting. I think it was fine... if that's the one thing keeping you from a viewing, I'd say to go ahead and give it a chance. No one really handed in a pitiful performance... the kids were surprisingly good... and most were marvelously cast. I won't detail the concept of this here. Without being aware of it, I've only watched the Director's Cut of this. Having heard specifics on the changes... I'm happy I did. It adds a lot of vital scenes, and after careful consideration, I actually prefer the ending of it over the ending of the Theatrical(which I've thus far only read a description of), even though I was at first left emotionally numb with its nihilism and cruelty. The plot is quite interesting and well-thought out. Yes, the writers did mess it up a little by trying to have their cake and eat it too, but if you can overlook that, this can be amazing. The pacing is just about spot-on, this never goes too slow or faster than it should. So much is said with so few words and hints. This, to a degree, allows the audience to connect the dots, and doesn't presume that we need hand-holding. The cinematography is great, though there are some shots and camera tricks that reveal the makers to be new at the helm. All in all, a thoroughly entertaining and engaging dark sci-fi movie, and one to be seen by anyone even remotely interested in/fascinated by said genre, provided you are sufficiently thick-skinned for it. There are also elements of fantasy herein. The commentary track is probably the best I've heard... the two are funny, informational, and awesome on it, and I suggest anyone who likes the feature itself, and aren't turned off by language, though it isn't the worst ever, to listen to it. I recommend this film to any fan of science fiction, and/or pictures that qualify as deep and thought-provoking. Just remember to only get the version I did if you're prepared to be kicked in the stomach, feelings-wise. The faint of heart should stick with the original release... or stay away entirely. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underrated movie. I seriously question imdb ratings,Imdb is a good app to look and find out about movies tv shows and upcoming movies and TV shows. But it's ratings are the worst. People's ratings are worse. This film is brilliant interesting and new to what I would usually watch. It isn't scary but it's a brilliant Sci-fi film. I don't know why people can't see the greatness of some of the movies I have seen. I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinion though. Also I don't know why they had to make so many different endings to this film when it was at the end my dad said that it wasn't the same ending that he had seen and we looked everywhere to find the proper/better ending. The ending that I think was the best was the theatrical cut ending because they just look at each other and walk away that is the perfect ending to a sci-fi film. The oasis soundtrack was brilliant as well. I recommend this movie to people over the age of 11.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
film of the year!!!!!,"WOW oh wow, what can you usually expect from an Ashton Kutcher flick, comedy, sometimes droll, Dude where's my car springs to mind or the not too bad Just Married, but this man can actually act and the movie for me with its storyline normally would attract the likes of a far more well known intelligent actor... but... does it hit the spot, each scene vividly conj-ours up a taste for the next and when carefully dissected you can really appreciate the excellent directing and on and under the surface it can only be simplified as the FILM OF THE YEAR....With a paranormal undertone very similar to the excellent Donnie Darko but with more to keep you on the edge of your seat, this movie would not need me to tell you the basic plot of the movie, if i did it would not be worth watching, please see it not knowing what is to happen and you will totally agree that this movies does definitely hit the spot.....",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The most powerful film ever produced!,"This 2004 script of genius is no doubt the best film released with a plot as unique as itself. Influenced by the 'Chaos Theory' it has several film genres rolled up into one, it consists of drama, psychosis and thriller. The film is about a young boy who is suffering with a brief amount of random memory loss which was inherited from his father who at this point lives in a mental home because of his similar behaviour. Each time Evan (the boy) blacks out, he will come to with a terrible scenario that has occurred during the black-out.Evan is now seven years older and has move away with seven years of no black-outs so he and his room mate celebrate at a bar. Evan and a girl go back to his university room to have a good time. The girl asks Evan to read some of his journals from when he was a kid, he starts reading and blacks-out but whilst he is sleeping, he wakes up in the past just as his childhood enemy is about to kill Evans pet dog, burning it alive. Evan wakes up in a cold sweat and scared of what just happened and immediately returns to his home town to find out what he used to miss when he blacked-out. He meets his old girlfriend Hailey (Amy Smart) and asks about her paedophile father on what he did to them when they were younger. Hailey kills herself because of what Evan asked and receives a threat from his childhood enemy Tommy (Haileys younger brother). Evan returns to university upset and reads his old journals again to this time see what happens. During the film, Evan attempts to fix his life in an attempt to help everyone and live happy ever after; but with a positive must come a negative and there is someone in his life who is suffering as a result. Evan goes back in time to a time when he blacked-out talking to his 'crazy' father and woke up being strangled. Evan asks his father for help and how to fix his future but ends badly, his father is killed. Eventually Evans brain is badly damaged from time travel which is now irreversible. Evan's final stop is the beginning on the film in a mental home, just like his father. He has at this point never written a journal and he has been in the home most of his life, to be exact he has been in there ever since he took part in killing a neighbour and her baby. There is now no way back and Evans last hope is to go back to a time before he was even born and kill himself before he is even born. Once Evan has committed suicide, the future is a happy ending for everyone without him.I am currently 18 years old and I had a tear drawing from my eye at the end of this film. I strongly advice anyone who has an interest in psychotic dramas to watch this film the next time they have the opportunity.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Roller coaster of a film,"The Butterfly Effect starring Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart is a twisted roller coaster of a movie. It is about Evan (Ashton Kutcher) and his ability to look at different entries in his childhood journals and go back in time to change something bad that happened in order to save someone in his life, it's almost always to save the love of his life Kayleigh (Amy Smart). The movie plays kind of like a dumbed down version of other smarter more sophisticated thrillers. I really do feel conflicted about the film. It has it's intriguing moments and it features good performances by the actors, especially Amy Smart. But on the other hand, there are times in the movie where you just roll your eyes because it's the usual teen/college aged crap you see in stereotypical youth targeted films. The college/sorority section of the film was the main part of the movie where I felt that way, the way the characters acted was dumb and almost laughable, and it was hard to buy, but then in other sections the material was solid and I bought the whole thing. That's why this film as a whole is a mixed bag, there's some pretty good things in it, but it never really reaches greatness, and it doesn't rise above character stereotypes that dumb down the movie. Another good thing I liked was how it ended, it was kind of touching and different. Overall I'd say a 6/10 is the fairest and most accurate rating for The Butterfly Effect.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Viewer needs a degree in mind reading to follow the plot.,"Nothing in the film is explained. It is very disjointed and the hardest film to follow.It isn't until 3/4 of the way through the film that you begin to realise what is going on.The main character suffers from blackouts. When you are watching the film, you start to wonder if you are having blackouts too.It is another of those ""good idea, but badly implemented"" films.

So.....GOOD!!,"I just saw The Butterfly Effect tonight and I was so amazed. I absolutely LOVED it! It was so good. I was not bored for one moment and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I was anxious to find out what was going to happen next. Some of the scenes were disturbing and hard to watch but they were significant to the movie. Ashton Kutcher has proven himself that he can do drama. I think he did a very good job. I kept thinking to myself, was that really the same guy who was the host of Punk'd and who was in Dude, Where's My Car? (Although I do like that movie.) It was kind of unbelievable. I really enjoyed how they didn't make is character mean and sadistic because of his traumatic childhood. He was a real softie. Every time he would do something bad (mainly when he was an adult) he would have this scared look on his face and he couldn't believe what he had done. For example, when he killed Tommy he wasn't happy that he did it. He realized that it was an accident. And when he yelled at the fellow frat boy when he asked him the Greek alphabet he truly felt sorry for what he had done. That made me enjoy the movie even more. I did get kind of puzzled because there were so many jumping-back-in-time events and the sound in the theater would get so loud every time that they would happen I would have to cover my ears. But this movie was just great. I couldn't explain it to anyone if I had to. I'd just have to tell them to go see it for yourself! I'm glad Ashton took this role. It was a good change for him. The Butterfly Effect is now on my favorite movie list. I will own it when it comes out on video. I wish I didn't have to wait 5 months though! But it's worth it. Anyways. Thanks for reading my review.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprisingly Deep and Powerful,"From the opening scene to the brilliantly powerful conclusion, The Butterfly Effect grips your heart and mind and takes you through an enthralling journey that will keep you guessing throughout the movie, and leave you bewildered at the end. The writers boldly explore the effects that childhood experiences have on a person, and how small changes in these experiences can cause a ripple effect to change that person's life. They also simulate the emotions of a man so lost that he doesn't even know himself, or his own past. But most importantly, they reveal how important sacrifice is in love and in life.The film is a journey through the psychologically disordered mind of Evan Treborn and the lives of people close to him when he was young. Early on, a few specific traumatic experiences are revealed that shape the lives of Evan, his mother, and his childhood friends- except each incident has holes in it where Evan himself cannot remember what happened. After the prologue of Evan's childhood, a college aged Evan begins to find ways to try to regain the memory of these holes. In some ways he is successful, but as he tries to alter the past it just creates more problems in the present. As Evan unfolds the mystery of his own life, some pieces come together and others fall apart, but all of it grips the audience to what unfolds.Although the acting is not exceptional on the whole and the story has a few minor plot holes, the film is easy to enjoy for the concept behind it and the power of the story. In the midst of Evan finding himself, a love so strong is revealed, and his passion for Kayleigh remains constant throughout the alternate realities created. We can truly learn about life and love from watching Evan's choices and how they create a ripple effect in his life.If you are looking for a typical teenage comedy starring Ashton Kutcher, then look somewhere else. This film is for mature adults and deals with child abuse, prostitution, rape, psychological disorders, suicide, murder, and brief but strong unbridled violence. It is not a happy film that will make you feel good about yourself, but rather an experience that should really touch you in a deep way. I've heard a lot of negative things said about this film, but I strongly suggest that if you are interested you should check it out for yourself, because you may be quite pleasantly surprised. I know I was.I give it an 8.34",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Run, Butterfly, Run","I don't think it was conceived to spawn a series of movies. Especially if you consider the fact, the other movies were direct-to-DVD fodder. But here with the first one, we have a clear winner (I haven't actually watched the third part of the series yet). It's the story, it's the actors and everything else.And with everything else I'm also talking about the extras on Disc here. You have to watch the deleted scenes (if you liked the movie that is). It opens quite a few new view on things. You might not be a big fan of Mr. Demi Moore (aka Ashton Kutcher), but he's really good in this. Forget about his MTV show and if you didn't like the 70s show, forget about that too ... just because it has nothing to do with the movie and for the fact, that he is playing something completely different here.The movie was successful (why else the ""sequels""), but I do think it could have been even more successful.

Great movie!,"The Butterfly Effect (2004) has a very interesting and thought provoking plot that tells the story of a man named Evan (Ashton Kutcher) who has the unique ability to go back in time to specific moments in his past and alter events which in turn changes the future in his present. Evan discovers that by reading his old journal's he is able to go back in time and relive past events written in the pages. Evan uses this new found ability to go back in time to an incident that took place in his youth which event's changed not only his life but the life's of everyone around him. However Evan quickly discovers that by changing his past he has inadvertently created an entirely new future not just for himself but for everyone around him. Evan tries desperately to right his wrongs and create a future where everyone is happy but with each attempt he finds the outcome only becomes worse than before.The Butterfly Effect is definitely a unique Science Fiction movie, one that stands out from the rest in the genre with it's own interesting take on the consequences of time travel. Most films that involve time travel are usually Comedy's, Drama or Sci Fi Action movies, The Butterfly Effect however has a more serious and often very dark tone that somehow feels very relatable despite obviously being fiction. I found myself asking what would I do if I had the power to change the worst moments in my life and how would it have affected my life and the lives of those around me.I am usually not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher but I was honestly very impressed by his performance in this movie. Kutcher usually stars in romantic comedy's like Guess Who, A Lot Like Love and What Happens in Vegas. Kutchers performance in The Butterfly Effect is arguably one of the best performances in his entire career it's a shame he didn't take on more serious roles earlier in his career.I watched the director's cut of the movie which has an alternate ending. I personally would recommend watching the director's cut with the alternate ended which many people have found to be weird to say the least.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best Movie ever seen in my life,"This was an outstanding movie, I honestly think this movie is a rating of 10, but I have to give it a 9 because the first time watching you really don't get everything.

Rented it one night LOVED IT, went out next day purchased the movie, and watched it several times, The first time I didn't really understand the movie to well but had a general idea. After watching the movie this 2nd time I noticed somethings that I didn't notice before. When movies can make you watch them more than once to catch what you have missed, its a top seller. I must say I highly recommend you purchasing the DVD for 2 endings to the movie, because purchasing the VHS doesn't give you access to the ""directors cut"" which is a MUST SEE ending..

Pay proper respect to Ray Bradbury,"This was a surprisingly good movie, despite staring kucher. My one complaint is this: The name of the film is an idea borrowed (stolen) from a Ray Bradbury short story called ""A Sound of Thunder"". That story was recently made into a time travel movie which is, unfortunately, not as good as the this movie. The short story, though, blows them both away. I checked the m=film's official website, and there is not one mention of the Title's origin. That's just not right. The site even features quotes from notable sci-fi authors about time travel and altering the present/ future, but nothing about or by Bradbury. Just wanted you all to know the truth.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Time travel stories are often disappointing. This one's pretty good. Evan, the protagonist, discovers that he can alter the past by possessing his younger self at certain, key times during his childhood. His attempts to improve the lives of his friends backfire in unpredictable ways. The rules of time travel in this movie are refreshingly consistent: 1) Only Evan remembers the unaltered timelines; everyone else thinks he's delusional. 2) He is unable to remember the events of new timelines. 3) He has no childhood memories of the times when his older self is in control of his body.There are a few times where the events of the movie seem a bit contrived but they are at least consistent with the internal logic of the story. The writer created a world in which certain rules apply and stuck to it. The rules are never broken in order to advance the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply amazing..can't believe I only just saw it!,"I can't believe I have never seen this movie, its JUST the type of movie for me and its actually a well done one at that, which a lot of these movies in my experience don't seem to be. This one was flawless, the acting, I was surprised at Aston Kutcher, he performed flawlessly and so did all of the other main characters! It simply makes me think..a lot about everything, I think that in order to understand this movie completely, it would need to be watched a few times, as there are so many hidden aspects and details that you would miss the first time unless your paying very serious attention to detail. The first part of the movie, was so strange in my eyes, I was really confused and shocked at the brutality of it all. Then I started to understand what the plot really was, and I grew to love this movie like I do now.

OK,"The first 30 minutes are OK, then it just crumbles. Entertaining story based on a Bradbury story, and recently done in a Simpsons halloween episode.I cant seem to take Asthon Kutcher seriously, I cant help thinking he'll eventually break into Kelso and ruin the moment. Amy Smart looks good especially during the frat scenes, she even has the chance to show off her acting skills in a later scene when she plays a crack whore but isn't very convincing. It seems as though some studio head watched Donnie Darko, and thought, ""WOW, we haven't made a teen angst time travel movie"", but it doesn't have the replayability that Donnie Darko has, doesn't have the soundtrack, and has no interesting characters.

Better than I expected,"I saw the trailer for this film a number of times, since newline ran it with The Return of the King. The trailer made it look not very interesting, and I thus never bothered to see it in the theater. But I decided to rent the director's cut from NetFlix to give it a try. It was much different -- and much better -- than I expected.The whole thing fits together rather well, and the ending is powerful  though rather upsetting.My only compliant is that there is a bit too much extraneous violence in a couple of spots for my tastes (sometimes only little things, but rather unnecessary things, like stupid frat boys throwing beer on pledges). A few minutes less of that would have been just fine.But overall this is a much better film than I anticipated. It was clever, well written, and overall well done",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Depends on your perspective,"i'll begin this review by assuming that the person reading this review has not actually seen the movie yet, and that they are trying to make a decision as to whether or not.First issue I'm sure is bugging a good portion of the potential audience in limbo is the fact this movie features Ashton Kutcher as lead role. Surprisingly, he doesn't ruin the movie, and even more surprisingly he plays his part good enough to make the viewer forget its actually Ashton Kutcher playing the role. Meaning, the actor doesn't overshadow the character. Something that's considered hard to do, and virtually impossible for a 'name' actor to do. Ashton pulls this off very effectively. Only one sentence at one point in the movie does he even sound like 'Ashton Kutcher' when he speaks, and he sinks himself into his role convincingly enough to not ever 'act' like Ashton Kutcher. If this is your biggest pet-peeve with this movie, I would suggest you go see it.Next aspect is probably the premise of the movie, which in many cases is the main aspect actually making most consider seeing this movie. The premise, although not mind-blowingly original, still manages to be interesting and entertaining. I'm sure most are at least vaguely familiar with it, as it has allusions in many other works. To summarize as easily as possible without spoiling any part of the movie; the idea is the hypothetical 'what if' you could go back in time and change the past to affect the present, however be careful what you wish for as even the slightest change in the past can affect the present in drastic ways.The execution is the other half to this. A constant dark tone, characterized early on from some startlingly unforeshadowed warped scenes and generally down-beat character moods set the stage for a movie about mystery and the unexpected. The mood-setting and tone are good, above what most movies manage to depict, and definitely manage to work emotion out of the viewer to match the actions going on on screen. The first 60% of the movie is virtually perfect in its execution, captures all it aims for with captivating intensity.But later on movie inconsistencies and redundancies occur that are bad enough to make a movie that otherwise could very well keep you up thinking all night into something that's easy to discredit. Character actions later on in the movie (without spoiling anything) that are so unrealistic and virtually impossible to identify with that it almost completely undermines many key scenes and points of the movie.Now this isn't an acting problem, the acting in the movie is great. Like I stated earlier as to Ashton's role in the movie, the supporting cast does a wonderful job as well. And in a movie all apart radical change, the cast fills their different shoes as well as anyone could.The problem is (sadly) a script/writing issue. And its so sad because it could have been fixed so easily if just given a couple more months of work.Now I rate this movie 7 out of 10 not out of impulse. Don't think I'm rating this movie out-of-scale to try and dictate a bad rating. I may have emphasized its flaws a lot, but it has more than enough positive points to work its way back up the scale. If its writing was given just a little more effort, this could have easily obtained a 9 or 10 out of 10.In conclusion, this movie may bug you, but mostly because it gets so close to perfection that its a sad thing it couldn't have been pushed those extra steps. This movie is certainly thought-provoking (I'm not talking about particular complexity, but the hypothetical is powerfully-executed enough to make you think), emotionally-moving, and all-in-all entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A wannabe Donnie Darko?,"I watched this film on DVD a couple of weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised by both plot, special effects and theme as well as Ashton Kutcher's performance as Evan Treborn - who would have guessed he could actually act? I think the film might have been marketed wrong, because it appears to be much more of a scary movie in the trailers than it really is. It has got much more depth than I was brought to believe when watching those trailers, which may be why I was surprised in such a positive way. Had it been marketed as a 'deep' or 'thought provoking' film, I think it might have led me to expect more and thereby disappointed me.The most striking thing about it was however the film's obvious resemblance to Richard Kelly's fascinating Donnie Darko (2001). First of all, there is the time-travel theme, which I think The Butterfly Effect juggled surprisingly well but not in as thought-provoking or entertaining a way as Donnie. Secondly, the graphic presentation of TBE is absurdly identical to that of DD. Try and compare the two film's black&blue, creepy-themed layouts. You'll find them almost identical. Coincidence? I don't know, but I know I thought ""Wow, someone's been watching Donnie Darko!"" when I first saw TBE.Overall, I must say that much prefer DD's cast over TBE's, although Ashton delivers his first real performance as an actor, he just has not got the same inscrutable way about him than DD's main character Donnie (Gyllenhaal) has and that special feel, a sort of air of mystique that surrounds Donnie is only half-heartedly portrayed by Kutcher. It is as if he (and the entire film) cannot really decide whether to be dramatic, thrilling or provocative and the sci-fi/fantasy element becomes secondary. For example: those theories behind time-traveling in the film ... not so believable. They don't seem to have been thought through or given deeper consideration, resulting in the time-travel to be less believable and easier to brush aside. Donnie on the other hand, keeps you wondering for hours and is a great movie to watch with like-minded and discuss afterwards.I rewarded The Butterfly Effect 7 points here on IMDb for its entertainment value and overall interesting plot, but no lingering effect.I gave Donnie Darko a 9 for its excellent actors, composition and feel. The musical score is also a bonus, it's simply amazing. All in all I would suggest you go rent Donnie Darko instead of The Butterfly effect if you're in the mood for a mind-boggling and beautiful sci-fi flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

a real seat-gripper right from the beginning.,"when my friend bought this movie first i thought it's a waste c'oz i hardly knew any of the cast. but as soon the movie ended i was an instant fan to every artist of the movie especially Ashton kutcher and Amy smart.A special round of applause for J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress for writing and directing such a film. I must say the strength of the movie is it's screenplay which helps in understanding the complex storyline of the movie. though the main plot of the movie is somewhat old the directors of the film did such a wonderful job in making it so interesting. First i was a bit disappointed as the ending is not what i expected but after sometime i was convinced that it was the best climax this film could offer.This film is sad,haunting,dark,happy,thrilling and entertaining in it's own way. I would recommend you this film if you are planning to watch anything different. For me this is one of those films which you can see with your heart rather than your eyes because this is mainly based on human emotions rather than some unexplainable sci-fi crap. this is a must watch films and don't neglect it because it has not too many big names.the only problem with the film is that it's sudden transition into a different film when you are expecting something else. but it's the best.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

But that's beside the point, because talent doesn't always come with fame. And I don't even need to give an example for that. The world is filled with those kinds of people. Anyways, my point is these two directors are putting tremendous effort into writing and directing this movie and I give them credit for that. And now let me get to the actual film and its pros and cons.The butterfly effect is far from being a bad movie. It has its fair share of thrills with a somehow enjoyable plot. But it fails to be a stable and centered film. One thing I couldn't stand in the film was its redundancy. The scenes were a replica of each other. Kutcher's character would go back in his thoughts and fix something and he would do that a million times in the movie. What I am saying is show me something new. Also show me something orderly. It was hard for me to tell where the climax is and if it already happened or if it's yet to happen. In other words it was hard for me to keep up with the film.Another thing was the casting; I mean come on Ashton Kutcher I mean after such a comedy as Dude where's my car I didn't expect to see him in a psychological thriller. Not that I'm saying he was bad in the movie but I could see somebody else playing the role a whole lot better, (Edward Norton would have been my first choice if I was the casting director, or maybe Jake Gyllenhaal), anyone with the capability of setting a dark tone, but Ashton Kutcher is best fit for a comedy role. But whatever.Although I say all these negative things, I did like the movie to some extent. One thing I did like was the fact that the film is filled with high tension and constant chills. Not knowing how Evan's life is going to turn out is the best feeling I had in the movie. And till the very end that's what I wanted to know. Is Evan going to fix the mistakes he made in life? Is Evan ever going to live a stable life? Or is Evan going to share his father's destiny? Those were the questions I asked while watching the film. The questions were partially answered but the film remains to be a watchable but not a wonderful one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nothing to do with the butterfly effect (or chaos theory),"If you like violent thriller stories based in (and limited in scope to) small-town USA, this might be a movie for you. But if you expect insights into the theory of the butterfly effect or chaos, go look elsewhere, because - contrary to its title - this film has nothing to do with these things. The plot jumps back and forth in time, exploring different pathways in the lives of the main characters, but the implied effects small events have on these lives are hugely exaggerated and completely neglect the fact that a change in the human personality is also a dynamic process that takes time and is generally influenced by a lot of factors. Instead, in order to drive the whole story, the plot is stuffed with a hefty load of cliches and stereotypes, and the same characters in the alternative scenarios are often portrayed like very different people. The result is that the presented versions of events are hardly believable, differing essentially in who kills (or otherwise harms) whom, or whose life is completely ruined, in which of them. The movie had a few interesting twists and not too bad an ending (in the director's cut), but this doesn't change the fact that I was looking at the watch every two minutes or so for most of the time, wondering whether I would have enough strength and patience to see it to its end.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I like movies that makes sense in the end.,Every 2 or 3 movies out of a hundred you see a movie that doesn't go for the Hollywood ending. They play out the logical consequences and see where it takes the characters.If you accept the premise for this movie then you have to respect where they took it. I bet there was some lame producer out there fighting for some crap ending and not wanting to accept the ending they did in fact go with. As the movie plays out you see the consequences of the Evan actions. They make sense and are not far fetched. SO... if you buy the premise of the movie then you will have to buy the ending.

A big butterfly shows up...,"Characters are not well built-up, so you can hardly go inside of them to feel the story. The movie is overly plot-driven so that I found myself thinking of the plot throught the entire film. It is not sure if it is a sci-fi or psychological movie. It tries to be both, but misses both of them. It tries to be psychological as Evan tries to remember his traumatic memories, and it tries to be sci-fi as he can change his life as he goes back in time. Trying to hook sci-fi and psychology at the same item (memory of Evan) of the story makes the movie ambigious, and plot is already complex. Trying to follow both pathways in that complexity makes the audience fall out from the movie. I spent the entire movie trying to figure out what the movie is about, could not enjoy watching it. If the movie worked on the characters I would at least feel identification with them, then the other things about the movie would be a lot easier and enjoyable.This is a film that tries to be a movie. Such as a butterfly that tries to get its both wings and loses them all and fails to be a butterfly, this film tries to be both sci-fi and psychological, at the end, it ends up having neither of the components, and fails to be a movie.The most enjoyable thing was a big butterfly showing up while I was watching!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It sad people honestly find this clever.,"I've written at least five reviews explaining why sci-fi movies everyone finds oh-so-original aren't original. Everything from 12 Monkeys to Déjà Vu, it seems there isn't a single sci-fi movie that can stand on its own two feet anymore. They all use tired, unoriginal plot lines that have been used over and over again on The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, if not both. It's just sad. The Butterfly Effect follows their example. But what makes The Butterfly effect even worse is that it it isn't clever like it thinks it is; there are so many plot holes, it's simply laughable to anyone who has enough intelligence to understand the plot of a children's cartoon. And I've seen plenty of cartoons that are insanely more intelligent than The Butterfly Effect.The Butterfly Effect opens with a cliché ""hook"" that your 9th grade English teacher taught you about. A guy can change his pastI'm sure if I hadn't seen it a hundred other times, I'd be interested. From there, the entire first half hour you're force fed clichéssuch as a little kid drawing bloody picturesas the movie sets up the further clichéd plot . . .Boy tries to save girl. Who would have guessed? If he changes the past, he changes the future. If it were something that only a hundred other movies have done, not thousands, I may be slightly less sarcastic when I say: how creative! A ""psychological"" undertone with no more intelligence than saying ""crazy people are crazy"". What movie would be complete without one these days? The problems I just mentioned are enough to earn the score it did from me, but from there the movie only gets worse. Minus Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart, there isn't a single actor in the movie who doesn't act with such an over-the-top vibe I laughed more than once. The cheesy dialogue brings the unintentional comedy even further. The cinematography is very amateur. What did the two directors do all day? It takes two directors to direct this terribly? Now for a taste of the major plot holes: - In more than one case, if he were to go back and change ONE variable to what he just did (ie: not stand by the mailbox) everything would have been fine. The writers must have realized this but thought it was too anti-climactic, so they decide to have him to contentiously try different pasts to get one right. Am I all the only one who finds this laughable? - Then there is the times the movie just downright lacks logic. One character is thrown in jail for . . . self defense? And there are plenty of other scenes just like that. Are the writers really that stupid? Did I mention the movie has the overall entertainment level of watching a tree stump die? Disregard whatever you thought this movie was going to beit's a stale, cliché drama and nothing more. The movie moves along at a medium-slow pace, and at some points it may even seem somewhat fast . . . until you realize it's just repeating itself. There is no entertainment value. Yes, I guess I can say it is somewhat compelling at points, but in the end what does it matter? It's forgettable. I watched it for the first time a day ago and I've already forgotten everything that I didn't write down in my notes to write in this review.Yet ANOTHER problem was the immaturity of the entire movie. Sure, I give it props for at least trying to be anti-politically correct, but it's done in a fashion that is just immature. Instead of actually making the anti-politically correct scenes a part of the movie, they're there for cheap shock value. I, personally, love shock valuebut when it's a part of the story. Not to mention none of the wannabe shocking moments (that didn't shock me) are off-screen because the directors obviously don't have the balls to actually make a movie that lives up to the R-rating this film received.Overall, I just see no point in watching The Butterfly Effect unless you were deprived of cartoons as a kid, because I've seen this plot used on every show Nickelodeon has aired. That's how immature and unoriginal it is. Some people will find the cliché boy-must-save-girl plot compelling, but, to those people, can I ask why? Maybe it's because you prefer safe, tired plots that have even less audacity than a cliché metal band writing lyrics about the nonexistence of God. As if we haven't seen either beforecountless times. And what bothers me so much about movies like this is how they always think they're so original, or so punk.The Butterfly Effect = pointless.0/10",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It is well acted, and completely preposterous, and I found myself entertained. The ending was not what I expected and the film is all the better for not being totally predictable. Ashton Kutcher proves that he can hold a storyline convincingly but I felt that Amy Smart, as the doomed/happy/doomed/happy love interest stole the honours for impact. She had a way of looking totally downbeat in one scene and stunning in the next. I really cared what happened to her character. The film pulls no punches, and some of the scenes are very dark, but I was glad they were not watered down, as this really added to the human interest of the storyline.

It also made me think so much about this concept.It is definitely Ashton Kutcher's best role, and he performed very well in it.The acting in general is all top-notch. The plot is amazing. The story is perfect. The movie is mind numbing.This movie is about a complicated story of imagination, some real events & pure fantasy. It is not very hard to understand so if you are young, you can still give it a shotAnother movie that is similar to this one is Donnie Darko, but I liked this one more. Donnie Darko didn't have as much depth as this one.Like Donnie Darko, this is psychedelic fantasy, science fiction,horror story. This type film is rare & very hard to succeed.I also recommend Memento. If you liked The Butterfly Effect and Donnie Darko, you will like MementoThe concept of this movie is truly phenomenal and it's the best idea for a movie. This concept is called The Butterfly Effect. There is a theory, called the chaos theory, which suggests that a butterfly flapping its wings can cause a typhoon in another part of the world. This means that a small change can cause such large consequences, and thats what the movie is about.Ithink it was underrated because the leading actor was 'punk' Ashton Kutcher, who never did any drama movies before, but he was brilliant.

The Butterfly Effect,"""Evan"" (Ashton Kutcher) has had a troubled existence thus far in his young life, and is prone to blackouts. These seem to take chunks of his day away from him as he comes back to a consciousness unaware of what has just taken place, or even where he is! He tries to fill in the gaps by writing in his journal what could have happened then miraculously finds himself back at that exact time and place. It's almost as if these memory lapses were just missing pieces of his jigsaw puzzle that he must go and relive, retrospectively, and infill. The thing is, though, he doesn't readily consider the impact that these additional experiences may have on future events. Basically his actions could change the course of history. It's really his beloved ""Kayleigh"" (Amy Smart) he is determined to keep safe - and that's quite a task as their childhood antics have frequently caused quite a few tragic events and his attempts to reverse these merely seem to create others... Can he square the circle? This is quite a cleverly constructed story that allows Kutcher to prove he's not just a pretty lad. His characterisation of ""Evan"" gradually develops from someone lost in a sea of confusion to a man whose realisation of his predicament is becoming a little more enabling. The nature of the story allows the film to adopt a loosely linked portmanteau style to it - with each episode in is life introducing different characters and scenarios which, so long as he can access his journal, he can escape from should the dangers (and there are quite a few) threaten to overwhelm him. It's not an easy watch - there's violence and bullying a-plenty, but it's a quirkily presented look at the domino effects of human behaviour that does merit a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What Butterfly Effect will this review cause?!!!,"The movie starts with quoting the chaos theory - Small change at one place can cause big ramifications somewhere else. It is an interesting concept and makes you think what butterfly effect have you caused in somebody else's life. For good or for bad. Just like in physics, butterfly effect has its place in social life.Though movie is based on chaos theory, in a sense it showcases the order that is present everywhere and how an unwanted element can cause disaster. Evan is that unwanted element in this narrative. He is a miracle child, but has his own flaws. He suffers from blackouts at life defining instances. Once he figures out the cause of those black outs and strange power that he has he tries to play God. He tries to change things around him to make them perfect but fails every-time until he figures out who is the cause of those problems.Movie would have been much better but for its weak script and narrative flaws. Some scenes have been forced just to make way for the story to continue. At the end the movie seems rushed. The climax normalizes the way life around us works and it hurts the moviegoer's experience.Apart from Evan's character no character sees any growth. It was not possible either. Ashton Kutcher is good as Evan but he has shown lack of range in emotional responses especially for a person who is playing God.This movie resembles Mr.Nobody but it is a better version of it.

Best film I've ever seen.,"What can I say, there are no words for what I want to express about this film.  The Butterfly Effect is the best film I have ever seen, and I have seen thousands of movies and published several movie reviews.  The Butterfly Effect is such a diverse film that it's hard to catagorize it, although it's primarily a psychological mind bender, it could also be labled as a ""tear jerker"" or drama.  The acting is also superb in this film, character interaction is flawless and Ashton Kutcher certainly delivers some surprising acting skills.  Although the film starts to lag halfway through it picks right back up immediately and does not take from the film's caliber.  Even though the film is amazing, I must give a lesser review on the ending, although the ending was good and suited the film's plot, I think viewers would've wanted something more satisfactory.

Interesting...,"There is no denying that ""The Butterfly Effect"" is a good movie. The plot is captivating, the story line delicately and intricately made. The thought of being able to change the past through the journal entries was very clever. The cinematography was fairly good, particularly the transitions between the flashbacks and real time. The soundtrack was nice, and the young talent was not bad at all. However, where this movies downfall occurs is in it's casting. Ashton Kutcher's desperate attempt to be taken seriously, in my opinion, belly flopped. Throughout this entire movie, the possibility of Ashton Kutcher (Evan) popping out and saying to Amy Smart (Kaleigh) ""Guess what, you've been punk'd!"" was a reoccurring thought. Although Mr. Kutcher's performance was above what I was expecting, it still took away from the movie, which is a shame as this movie truly could have been phenomenal.

"Authentic concept, well developed script, nice idea with alternative timelines and endless possibilities, though not recommended for young ages","Dramatic/fantasy film.

Only when he grows up will he realize that he has the unique ability, like his father, to travel back in time, his consciousness going back to his younger self for a limited time and for as long as that time lasts, his younger self is completely absent and therefore has a memory gap. Knowing the past he can change something small, a fact, to fix the future and make things right. This is also the phenomenon of the butterfly, everything is connected to each other, a small change somewhere, can change everything. Only every time, the changes he makes, correcting something, he ruins something else. Eventually he has to choose what to sacrifice to fix everything else.

Best episode of Punk'd ever,This has to be the best episode of Punk'd ever produced.  Seeing Ashton getting duped into thinking that he can actually act in a serious film is hilarious.  What is even more amazing is that audiences have been duped into thinking that this is an actual movie. A self-reflexive punk on the viewing public. Curious why they did not show his reaction to getting so beautifully punk'd.,1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Donnie Darko?  Give me a BREAK!!!!,"I just rented Donnie Darko based on people saying The Butterfly Effect can'tcompare. Well, I just wasted two-plus hours of my life on that crap. Donnie Darko is the kind of movie people watch and force themselves to enjoy to think themselves ""deep"" and intellectually-superior to everyone else. That movienever MOVED. The Butterfly Effect NEVER STOPPED MOVING. It had a point -there was emotion - strong emotion - you actually felt something for theprotagonist who, despite all his best intentions, just couldn't have his cake and eat it and have everybody else have their cake and eat it, too. His life was TRAGIC, and he had to sacrifice the one thing he loved most to save it. I don't know what this movie DIDN'T have. The one thing I couldn't find on discussion boards was WHY exactly people liked Donnie Darko. Interesting... I mean, the comments I find that slam TBE could be applied to any movie a critic wanted to slam. And the filmmakers did all this with not the biggest budget. All I have to say is I was thoroughly entertained and think this is the first DVD I've rented that I couldn't stop watching until I'd watched ALL the versions and ALL the special features.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mediocre minds may not fully appreciate this film.,"The Butterfly Effect is written in such a way that to fully understand the ideology behind the film you must have a working concept of quantum theory. If you think that Evan is having these blackouts as a child because of anxiety, or a way to cope with the stresses of the situations, you are mistaken. In the future Evan takes control of those situations and because of that future timeline event, it changes his perception of the past so he does not remember what happened in the past because his future alterations take place. This concept very poorly implemented in the Back to the Future series, constructs the basis of the film. I thought it was a well thought out film delving into this concept, and smoothly executed with twists and turns to keep the viewer thinking during the entire film.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Intelligent people like thought-provoking movies,"I have no idea what movie the critics who panned it and the reviewers who rated it poorly were watching. I thought that the overall premise for Butterfly Effect was quite fascinating and very thought-provoking. We've all thought about how the decisions we've made have shaped our lives, and how if we could go back and change some of them, how they would change our lives. That said, I fail to understand how anyone watching this film failed to at least identify with the basis of it. And many have been quick to say that it was unbelievable because they had three different actors playing the parts of each of the characters, one for age 7, age 13, and the adult versions. The child actors they cast not only looked exactly like the adult versions, but they put in some excellent little acting jobs as well. That said, we'll move on to the biggest reason many people did not give this movie a fair chance. Ashton. How can we take a guy who said, ""Dude, sweet!"" numerous times in a movie seriously? Quite easily. He put in an impressive acting job here. Not only was he convincing, but he proved he can hang in dramatic roles. Every big actor started somewhere. Jim Carrey wasn't always a blockbuster actor. He did some horrible 80s movies like ""Earth Girls Are Easy"" and went on to do a few silly movies. But he also did some very serious, drama-based roles, some of which have been pretty ballsy and creative. ""The Truman Show"", still one of my favorite Peter Weir movies, was an incredible piece of social commentary. And then there's ""Man On The Moon."" Johnny Depp has taken some odd roles in his career, and continues to do so. His unique choices for roles are what has shaped him as an actor. Every single big time actor has paid his dues. ""Dude Where's My Car"" and ""Just Married"" were stepping stones. They served as vehicles in order to allow Ashton to move on to something meatier. Or maybe it was just that too many people don't feel like going to a movie and having to think in order to understand it. Look at ""Fight Club"" and ""Memento."" Two very serious movies that required some very serious thought and attention to fully understand and appreciate, but both of which are tremendous pieces of cinema art. That said, if you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and possibly a bit thought-provoking, give ""Butterfly Effect"" a chance. It hardly disappoints.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great Movie, if you can keep up, bring thinking cap!!!!!","I loved this movie because I was able to keep up with it. The plot makes its twists and turns. I believe most people can keep up with it because of it simplicity. Some critics didn't like it because of how complicated it got to them. These are the idiots that couldn't keep up. The story sticks to the theme and any science fiction fan should be able to keep up with it. I also like the ending mainly because it doesn't stick to the normal Hollywood ending.

This is one of the greatest movies ever,"This film is the only movie I've seen this year that I actualy considered my favorite movie for a while.  It has a very negative and dark feeling to it, and you will not be able to stop thinking about it.  The Plot is undiscribibly brilliant, and it doesn't reveal and elements untill it first happens.  Do you know the feeling you get when you are about to go on a roller coster for the first time?  Imaging that awsome feeling for the whole length of the film, and about a week after it.  It has a lot of sad points, and parts where you will be left wide-eyed.  The acting is probably the best acting you will be able to see in a while, Ashton Kutcher may very well have a career in Both Comedy, and Thriller movies.  If you go there, to the theater, and decide to see it, there are only two opinions that you will have about it, you will either really hate it, or really love it, there are only 3 people that i know that thought the movie was so-so, and pretty much everyone else except my friend that has very bad taste in movies, loved it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Adult-themed BACK TO THE FUTURE,"The Butterfly Effect (2004) D: Eric Bress, J. Mackye Gruber. Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart, Melora Waters, Elden Henson, William Lee Scott, Eric Stoltz, Lorena Gale. A young man who blacks out traumatic events in his life discovers a way to supernaturally alter his past, but eventually discovers that changing one minor detail completely screws things up. When he tries to change it, things get screwed up even more. A more adult-themed BACK TO THE FUTURE has some disturbing scenes (i.e. Stoltz's pedophile father character is reprehensible) and a good performance by Kutcher (who also executive-produced). Thankfully avoids the clichéd Hollywood shootouts, twist endings, and obligatory teen movie rock music soundtrack and concentrates instead on the story and performances, both of which far exceeded expectations. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated R for violence, profanity, nudity, adult themes.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not what I expected; in some ways good, in others not so much....","This movie was so much darker, bleaker, and more depressing than I could have imagined. However, it did at the same time seem to have a relatively hopeful message and theme that seemed to build up. Without spoiling too much, a theme seems to build up as the movie progresses, becoming even more and apparent...or so I thought. The conclusion happens and it was like the whole theme and message took a 180 and left a stupid, in cohesive end, about a relationship that was not so well fleshed out. Still, I give the movie credit for making me think and reflect upon my own life, and for it's emotional impact, and yes, even for the way it was shot (yes, I'm a sucker for the nostalgia and look of early 2000s film). Worth a watch but make sure you're prepared to be potentially left disappointed (in more ways than one)...6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The performances by the actors, both child and adult, were outstanding. Elden Henson and Amy Smart did a great job in their various roles and Ashton Kutcher proved he could be an actor outside of the comedy box.

Butterflies,The Butterfly Effect is such an interesting and original movie that is based on this chaos theory. The story and idea itself are much better than the movie is but somehow it still works and is entertaining. The acting isn't fantastic and there's certainly in the story but it's still enjoyable. It has a nostalgic early 2000s feel which I appreciate. I hope and wish that they come back around to redo this movie with a better cast and writing because it is such a cool a promising concept. Definitely worth the watch. IMDb needs to relax with these character minimums for movie reviews though. It's annoying.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The concept of the film whilst not entirely original (but what is) was intriguing and utterly enjoyable. Movies that make you think a little after the curtain closes are the best. Ashton was perfectly cast in this role and should do more serious movies. All the other films I've seen him in, I thought he was a talentless, vacuous idiot, but after seeing this I must admit how wrong I was.

The best movie I've seen in theater in a long time..,"I saw this movie the other night with my unsuspecting girlfriend. She is the type who dislikes violence very much. Well, within the first twenty minutes she was visibly upset and shaken. I asked her if she wanted to leave, but she could tell by the sparkle in my eyes and the skip in my walk (which is amazing, since I was obviously sitting) that I was thoroughly enjoying the movie.I enjoyed every moment of this movie. It's the first movie in a long time that made me feel uneasy, which last happened during Event Horizon (although I didn't like that one too much). Not to say that's a bad thing, though. If a movie can evoke some sort of feeling of distress or fright in me, then it's doing a great job.The acting was decent. I didn't expect an Oscar winning performance from Kutcher, but he did a nice job. The supporting cast was on par as well. After seeing this, I'd consider seeing Ashton's other movies.As far as the story, it couldn't have been better. I enjoyed every little twist that happened, and the cut scenes made me jump a little in my seat.By the end I was incredibly happy by what had just happened. I sat through the credits and just stared in awe while Oasis played. Couldn't have asked for anything better.Hell, even my girlfriend liked it (although she was rather disturbed).My rating - 9.5/10.I too will be purchasing this on DVD when it comes out.So, yes, go see this movie. Do not listen to the critics, who are obviously blind in their ratings because it's Ashton Kutcher. They're too 'high and mighty' to give it an honest rating. They fear by giving it a good rating, they'd lose some sort of credibility, which in my mind, they never had in the first place.Definitely a must-see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What if this what if that what if,"BUTTERFLY EFFECT is a thriller with alternative realities and past changing as subject. It is suspenseful, fast paced, thrilling and has a lot of imagination; however, it falls into a serious problem: the ""what if"" matter! And if I changed that moment, how would it be? And if that instant was changed, it would be different This film is a constant roller-coast of ""what if(s)"" that turns it unrealistic beyond unrealistic!What I mean is that the film ""forgets"" about one important detail: our lives and this reality where we live (I won't even discuss the time and space matter, and possibility of time travelling, which is also brought up in this film) is a constant of ""what if(s)""! So, even if he could change a moment, in a very distant past (all the changes he does are from a distant past, when he was a child or a teenager) nothing could assure that this distant future would only depend of that particular change! That's what I find more unrealistic in the movie! He changes a lot of years based just in some particular moments when he was a child or a teenager. And in those years, nothing happened that could have changed his life? There's a kind of a hole between when he's seven, when he's thirteen and when he's twenty! Nothing happened in his life during those years?!However I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie. I think it has a good premise (in spite of being bad explored, by the reason I up-mentioned) and it definitely has a suspenseful and entertaining plot. And I did appreciate the ending I must say! In fact I think that was one of the fewest logical modifications he could makeThe acting is also good, especially by the actors who have changed characters, and in particular, Amy Smart. I think she did a very good job!Globally it's a nice film, I just think it has an unnecessary lot of ""what if(s)""",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I lasted fifteen minutes the first time and was unable to let my guards down.

The Butterfly Effect: 5/10,"Ashton Kutcher is one of the most, if not the most, overexposed ""celebrity"" now. Most people can't even name a movie he was in. I'm not a big fan of That 70's Show, where he made his name known, but after he made Dude, Where's My Car?, I don't think anyone thought he could ever be a credible actor. And The Butterfly Effect proves it. From a story that has been floating around Hollywood for years (it took someone with the star power and epic acting skills of Kutcher to get it greenlighted), The Butterfly Effect has a great idea but is executed in such a mixed bag kind of way it's hard to like it.Evan (Kutcher) has gone through a troubled childhood (filled with the stupidest kids you've even seen on film), and had experienced numerous blackouts. He's better now, but finds a way to go back in time to change the horrifying events of his past. What he doesn't realize (until the end-most people would've caught on as soon as possible) that everything he does affects his whole life ahead of him. It seems to affect Kayleigh (Amy Smart) the most in each one, where she goes from sorority girl to waitress to prostitute. The like happens to everyone else Evan knows. But no matter how much he screws it up, he keeps on truckin' so that his life is perfect.This story is much like Donnie Darko (as it has been said multiple times), but Darko knows where its going and has a purpose. In The Butterfly Effect, it takes itself way too seriously. The first half of the movie is basically Evan's past, where troubling events take place. The second half is Evan going back to fix his mistakes. The worst part is, Evan doesn't even think of helping others with these powers of his. There's a scene in a movie theater (where they're showing two New Line Cinema movies, obviously), and some people unrelated to him get hurt. Why not go back and stop that? Also, when Evan goes back to save a mother and daughter, he does it for himself, not for the people that would be killed. And we're supposed to feel along with this selfish character? In a movie as dark and serious as this, it deals with silly topics, like time travel. Time travel only works humorously (Back to the Future) or when explained properly (Donnie Darko). Neither occur in The Butterfly Effect. I had been told many times that to like this movie I couldn't take it seriously. I tried not to, but the events that occur in the movie (including child porn and animal abuse) are impossible to take lightly. At least the movie deals with them in a serious matter.The concept is a pretty cool concept, but once again, it's destroyed by the actual dialogue written. It's all so basic and clichéd I could basically guess what they were about to say next. Also, why must they have begun with a scene of the climax? Movies always do that, often for a purpose. There was no reason here. The whole movie was uneven-half of the movie was basically revisited over and over again in the second half, which unnecessarily spends much of its time in a prison. On another note, I liked the way that everything tied together (I'm not talking about the ending) and that the unanswered questions from throughout the movie were eventually taken into consideration, such as the purpose of Evan's blackouts. I watched the director's cut, and the alternate ending seemed gutsy, but I really liked it. I read about the other ending, and I prefer this one.This almost seemed like a typical teen movie (more so than it already is) by the acting. Kutcher can't act worth beans, and Amy Smart isn't exactly Katherine Hepburn either. The only two remarkable people in the cast were Eric Stoltz (as the aforementioned child pornographer) and Ethan Suplee (as Evan's Goth roomate), who always put in great acting jobs. But this movie, which is sure to wow the MTV generation, has a great idea at its fingertips, but can't seem the right way to execute it.My rating: 5/10Rated R for violence, sexual content, language and brief drug use.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sharp script...acting could use a whetstone. :),"I snagged this film via good IL Netflix, and I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised. The concept and the script for this work is extremely clever and well mapped out. I've watched both the theatrical release, and the director's cut...both of which offer a solid story, with a lot of intrigue, and very clear resolutions. I do find that my preference lies with the Director's Cut on this film (always good to see what the director really wants...not the test audiences).The look and the direction and the writing are all top work in Butterfly, but as I said above, the acting could use a whetstone.Ashton has definitely displayed some chops in his role here, but the heaviness of the Evan character would might been better handled by someone with a bit more flex. I found myself often taken out of the experience of this film when Ashton went into ""Scared Face"" mode or the generic ""Where Am I?"" rolly eyed panic.His awakenings, and many realizations were very forced. These are pivotal and horrifying moments in this man's life, but the reality of these events seemed played as opposed to ""experienced"" (no fan of 'method acting' here, but there are things that happen when one is really connected to their material properly...they get Oscars).This isn't to rule out Ashton...he wasn't horrible...and this is definitely a huge step in the right direction to avoid the potential career trap of being ""Forever Kelso"". Kudos for breaking barriers like that...look what it has done for Johnny Depp!This is surely worth the time to scope out. It will spark discussion (though not remotely as much as somewhat similar film, Donnie Darko...oy!), and certainly entertain.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

You should not ask for more detail than ""it's the story of a boy who has mysterious blackouts"" when stressfull stuff happens to him. As he grows up he remembers some of the stuff and acts on it.Overall, quite a good plot that kept me on the edge of my seat. I enjoyed it. It is well constructed and flows very well.

I don't know why I was unaware of this, but I was. I actually own the DVD, I liked it that much. I had not commented on it, but after seeing for the tenth time, I decided I should.OK, so Ashton Kutcher can really act. Anyone who says he can't must have had their eyes closed during this film. I could care less about his personal life or Punk'd or anything like that. The truth is this movie is quite original and he did a fantastic job. The rest of the cast is great too. Although the movie is unrealistic, it's only a movie. The truth is that the story is interesting and the movie ends quite nicely with a twist.I won't comment on the particulars for those who have seen this.

I really liked it!,"I love these types of films. A movie of alternate realities where each small shift in the past causes a completely different present. Each time you watch in anticipation of the twist for the new reality.Kutcher is a troubled youth who was molested along with a young girl, by the girl's father and later is bullied by the girl's brother. The girl ends up committing suicide and Kutcher's life is haunted by his past. Kutcher is told by his analyst to keep a diary of everything that happens. In his college years, Kutcher finds that when he re-reads his diary, he is suddenly transported back to the actual events depicted in the diary. Each time Kutcher tries to make some adjustment to that event, to try to make things turn out better. But like the story of the butterfly that caused a tidal wave to occur, each little ""adjustment"" for the good has a ripple effect on the future that causes not necessarily pleasant results.I was riveted by this movie until the end.

Couldn't Get It Right,"I enjoyed the ""What iffery?"" aspect of this movie. I've seen variations of it in other films and fantasy TV series - in ""Star Trek"" for one, it's the Prime Directive, where the rule is that even if you could and even if you meant to do good and even if it's just a tiny thing you alter, you don't mess with events that happened in the past. Aston Kushner's Evan character actually has the power to do just that, a trait which he's apparently inherited from his institutionalised dad and his dad before him.We're immediately dropped in on Evan on the run in a hospital where he's being treated for his condition. He's frantically scribbling down the latest in a lifetime's worth of similar experiences even as time literally runs out for him. How did he get here and what will happen next in his life of extremes, where one minute he's luxuriating in the love of his pretty young childhood sweetheart Amy Smart's Kayleigh, the next he's fighting for his life in a maximum security prison. We also see the contrasting levels of devastation and consolation his time-hopping wreaks on those with whom he comes into proximity as Kayleigh herself goes from being a blissful girlfriend in one timeframe to addled crack-addict in another, their chubby friend Lenny, played by Elden Henson arcs from a catatonic loner to Kayliegh's happy boyfriend and Kayliegh's brother Tommy, (William Lee Scott) from violent psychopath to the best boy in school.Rather like Evan's tumultuous state of mind, it was a lot to keep up with as the past continually rewrote iitself with every well-intentioned intervention he makes. His problem is that the law of unintended consequences keeps coming into play as what may be good for one individual means something goes wrong for another, usually catastrophically so. As time circles in on itself at the end and if you've been paying attention to all the Easter Egg prompts from earlier, you arrive at the natural inevitable ending.I'll admit I struggled a little at times to keep up with all the tumult and of course if Evan's life had turned out to be a quiet, uneventful one, he wouldn't have had to go back at all but then of course there'd have been no movie at all.The special effects as Evan crashed his way through each regression were effectively rendered and I thought all the young leads were well played, in particular I thought by Smart. I get that the movie probably wasn't aimed at my own demographic but this literally mind-blowing feature certainly connected with me although I doubt it will stop me or indeed any of us thinking, to quote Cher of all people ""If I Could Turn Back Time""...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
