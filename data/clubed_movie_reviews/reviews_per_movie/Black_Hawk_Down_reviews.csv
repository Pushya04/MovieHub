"The Extended Edition has not been seen by many, but is the definitive version to see","While the theatrical cut still resulted in a meaningful film, it irked me originally in the theater and then again recently upon seeing it again that very significant moments from the original Philadelphia Inquirer articles were left out. It was as if someone hadn't just forced Ridley Scott to cut the film down for time, but to de-emphasize the disparity in training and personalities between the Tier One units and everyone else. Was it because they wanted the Rangers to do interviews and go on the talk circuit to help publicize the film? Regardless, the Extended Edition adds back footage I had no idea they bothered to even shoot. The only big thing missing is that Delta medic Earl Fillmore isn't a character, but I assume his family wasn't interested in him being portrayed at all, which is unfortunate. In the Extended Edition, Wolcott instead serves the Fillmore role of reassuring someone and then himself becoming an early KIA. In fact, Fillmore was killed while moving to Wolcott's crash site. So, this was a very smart and fitting proxy. The theatrical cut is, frankly, an inexcusable version that no one should be watching when the extended exists.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A very American war story directed by an Englishman,"I've been watching this movie and its accompanying extras on DVD this week for the first time and I thought is ironic that this very American war story should be directed and produced by an Englishman (Ridley Scott) and have a large number of British actors cast as the American servicemen (Ewan McGregor, Jasson Issacs, Hugh Dancy, Euan Bremner, Orlando Bloom.) I suppose it's the equivalent of Steven Spielberg directing a film about the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War and casting Americans as members of the Parachute Regiment.Scott's movie is quite brave in that it has no major stars and no central character (unlike, say Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or Mel Gibson in WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS). It's also largely free of the clichés of the genre: no soaring John Williams score accompanying shots of the flag fluttering in the sunlight; no scenes of the families back home. Instead its all about the logistics and the absolute horror of battle. This is the best combat footage since ZULU way back in 1964, a film which it resembles. In Scott's commentary description words, it is 'Anti-War but pro-military'.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"It`s An Account , Not A Statement","I vividly remembered the news reports in October 1993 of the body of an American serviceman being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu following the battle there . A couple of years later my interest of the battle was rekindled by an edition of the BBC`s excellent history show TIMEWATCH  that spoke to the survivors of "" The biggest firefight involving American troops since Vietnam "" , so when Mark Bowden released his book BLACK HAWK DOWN I opened the first page and found myself unable to put it down , and when I heard Ridley Scott was going to bring Bowden`s book to the big screen I was looking forward to seeing itI did enjoy the movie and have to take issue with some of the comments raised . First of all people complain about events and incidents being changed , I know how you feel but with any adaptation there`s bound to be bits condensed , the only real criticisms that can justified is that this film version totally negates the Somali point of view ( For those of you who haven`t read the book Mark Bowden writes his account in a similar subjective manner Corneilus Ryan wrote his trilogy - two of which THE LONGEST DAY and A BRIDGE TOO FAR were made into blockbuster movies - dealing with the last months of the war in Europe ) but Bowden`s book is an account of the battle of Mogadishu , that`s what it is - An account that doesn`t really concern itself with wider issues like politics or anti-war sentiment , so it seems churlish to complain about concepts like character development because that`s not what the story is about . I`ve also heard teenage girls complain that Orlando Bloom doesn`t get enough screen time and that they found it too violent . I`m sorry to hear that girls , hopefully next time you go to the cinema you might like to find out what you`re letting yourself in for . As for the rest of the screenplay it is accurate right down to the friction between the Deltas and the Rangers and the fact the Americans were actually rescued by a UN force composed of Malaysians and PakistanisRidley Scott rightly deserved an Oscar nomination with BHD . It`s his movie and he surpasses anything Spielberg achieved with the overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN . War is hell and this is a film of stark and haunting imagery of victims of famine , of mutilated soldiers and civilians . Both editing and cinematography are superb with many great scenes like the small stream of American soldiers walking up the street while on the other side of the houses a massive torrent of armed militiamen are walking in the same direction . My only real complaints of what`s on screen is Ewan McGregor`s awful American accent ( It`s especially so when you stop to consider that most of the cast aren`t played by American actors )and Hans Zimmer score resembles that of most of his other movies , but I shouldn`t nitpick because I found this Scott`s best film alongside GLADIATOR",8.0,Anonymous,History
We were soldiers AND made a great film...,"Black Hawk Down is first and foremost an immensely effective war film, but beyond that, its one of the most subtly differently made war films ever. Most war films usually either have a single hero through whom we see everything (i.e. Platoon), or present us with a squad of soldiers, all of whom are identifiable ""types"" (i.e. Saving Private Ryan). Black Hawk Down takes a different approach, instead giving us a very wide array of characters, none clearly singled out as a hero or type to command the audience's attention. The general effect is to create that feeling of a team army that George C. Scott so ardently expounded to us at the start of Patton. Furthering this feel of military professionalism, the film never cheapens itself by putting too much emotional weight into one moment. The plot moves ahead at a constant pace, cutting from location to location, without slowing down to focus too much on individual soldiers. The effect is of watching documentary footage of a real military operation gone wrong. While the effect of this scripting approach may produce some detachment among viewers on the first viewing, it makes the film all the better on subsequent viewings.And you'd better believe there will be subsequent viewings, because Ridley Scott has created one of cinema's all-time great pieces of eye candy here. The editing, cinematography, grading, scoring and visual effects all combine to leave a viewer just as drained upon leaving the theatre as these soldiers were on leaving Mogadishu. The intensity of this film's combat is easily equal to Saving Private Ryan, and leaves such pretenders as We Were Soldiers behind in the dust. Black Hawk Down lacks the former's emotional resonance, but unlike the latter, it thrives on the fact, creating a final product as mind-challenging in its construction as it is mind-blowing its visualization.",,Anonymous,History
One of the best war movies of all time,"When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.For whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After ""stirring up the hornet's nest"", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, ""Leave No Man Behind"".Needless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells ""RPG's!"" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.While the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn't take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you're not sure which side is more disorganized. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.It's pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can't imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play ""Dead Somali with a Gun #354"".Although characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn't have the problem of some war movies, where it's sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best lines in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.As expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood. He also uses animals and non-military personnel well in some of the shots to show that this firefight is happening in the middle of a populated market district.A big deal has been made out of the blood and gore in Black Hawk Down, but what is any true war movie without it? Though most of the graphic violence on display is not far beyond Saving Private Ryan, there is at least one visceral sequence that will make most people squeamish, unless they watch those operation shows on The Learning Channel for entertainment. Black Hawk Down is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.In a genre that has brought out some of the best in directors and actors, Black Hawk Down is easily the best war movie ever made, and it has replaced A Beautiful Mind as my candidate for Best Picture and Director.Rating: 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,History
one of the best ACCURATE war movies,"Unlike most of the war movies of our time, Black Hawk Down sticks to the facts about what happened in Mogadishu and doesn't romanticize the story. To support this observation, the viewer will notice that there is not really one main character. This shows that the film focuses more on what happened in Somalia instead of on the characters personality and/or struggles. Another important aspect of the film that makes it so great is the cinematography. Not only was the setting of the film accurate to the real thing, but the way that the movie was filmed is great because it seems like someone is running along the battle scene getting everything on tape. In addition, the film contains small aspects that one may not notice that are important to the situation in Mogadishu. For instance, the bullet shells that fell from the firing helicopter fell into one of the soldiers' vests, and he scrambled to get it out because of how hot it was. This small detail makes the movie that much more realistic. To conclude, Black Hawk Down is a great movie that is both an eye opener that sticks to the facts as well as a quality film. I recommend this movie to any war-film fan, as well as anyone that likes watching movies in general.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Black Hawk Down is a competent, confident and chaotic war film.","It tells the true story of a raid in Mogadishu that lead to the first battle between the Somalian Militia and American Rangers. As the title suggests, a Black Hawk does indeed go down. This is a mighty difficult flick to rate. As a representation of modern warfare, it succeeds substantially and sits in the elite group of visceral war films. But as a complete movie? Questionable. Firstly Ridley Scott is such a consistent director in terms of tackling a genre and producing a film that defines that genre. Black Hawk Down is no different, his eye for technical technique and production is second to none. A war torn Mogadishu, practical explosions and effects, utilisation of real Black Hawks and army equipment. It's authentic, and that is a real important factor for a war film. The narrative subtly explores the cost of war on both sides. The US army losing valuable soldiers and equipment (which financially would set them back quite largely) and the Somalian families who are living in ruins. There will always be one view point that towers over the other, but there is the gritty imagery of war and the aftermath that it leaves behind which proves to be effective. This has a massive ensemble cast, with Josh Hartnett being the lead I guess (he is on the cover, sooooo technically...he is the lead). He doesn't deliver, in fact many of the actors don't. That's not their fault though. Scott purposefully chose to focus on the aspects of war rather than glorified American heroes. Even so, there is such limited characterisation that any loss of life delivers no emotional impact for the audience. It's no spoiler that many succumb to their wounds, and yet we're supposed to feel saddened. I physically cannot feel emotive towards someone who I can't relate to, or even care for. That is what prevents this from being an outstanding war film like many classics before. Jason Isaacs was probably the stand out performance for me. Still a decent war flick, it's powerful imagery just about saves it from being lifeless.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I Felt Like I Was in that Black Hawk,"Black Hawk is quite simply the best movie of the year (2001) and the best war movie I have seen.  It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.Ahh emotions, a subject of much debate where this movie is concerned, at least among some critics. While the reviews for Black Hawk Down have on average ranged from ""Good to Excellent,"" there has been persistent and growing criticism over the lack of clearly drawn out characters that the audience could connect with, the lack of historical context,  and the fact that movie is all action, with no heart, with no point-of-view. Well I think those who criticize the movie on these grounds, have completely missed the point of the movie, and are flat-out wrong. It is a movie told from the soldiers point-of-view, pure and simple. This is not a political movie, this is not a movie that needs cheap sentimentality or conventional emotional ""hooks"" for the characters.  As much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, the overly sentimental framing device used by Spielberg, really annoyed me. It felt like he was pandering to the audience just a little bit, and it wasn't necessary. Well, there's no pandering here, no cheap sentimentality in Black Hawk Down, just the horrible, gruesome, disorienting reality of modern combat. I didn't know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center, but I was moved to tears by what happened to them on Sept. 11 and that's the way I felt today in the movie.As far as I am concerned there was plenty of emotion in Black Hawk Down, plenty of ""choke-up"" moments, or moments when I was moved by the unbelievable courage shown by the soldiers as they faced an almost hopeless situation. I'm not sure how anyone could not be moved by seeing these 18-25 year-old men trapped in the horror of a Civil War that had no bearing on U.S. National Security. As portrayed by the amazing ensemble cast, these men (really boys in many cases) showed the full range of emotions that our soldiers must have gone through, not to mention the fear and confusion of their situation. To me the cast standouts were Josh Hartnett (boy has he got BIG FUTURE STAR written all over him) as Staff Sgt Eversmann and Australian actor Eric Bana as Sgt 1st Class ""Hoot.""Black Hawk Down is a great movie, and it is an important movie. It is the story of courage and heroism against nearly insurmountable odds. What happened in Somalia was a foreign policy failure for the U.S., but the actions of the soldiers sent into battle that October day were anything but failure. That there were not more casualties is a credit to them and ultimately a credit to all of us.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Chaotic,"This film has a massive ensemble cast, and every actor played their part well. The action sequences are superbly choreographed with realistic fight/bullet wounds, and practical effects such as explosions. The score by Hans Zimmer adds tensity in the action that's taking place. The cinematography and color choices are good for the film's setting and story. However, I had a hard wanting to care for the characters. They are barely developed and indistinguishable. It's hard keeping track of who's who. The story is simplistic and one-sided. A bit insight into the Somali's point of view of the event would have help the movie to be much more intriguing. Overall, a well-made movie with great production value and good performances but that aren't enough to redeem the trite plot.",6.0,Anonymous,History
So many elements combine to make this movie good.. especially the music,"I've just got this movie on DVD - I did see it on the big screen and it blew my mind.  Being from Australia we had practically no idea of what was going on in Somalia, and after seeing this movie and then reading the book - it is an eye opener.Now that I've watched it a few more times, I've noticed one thing with this movie.  The music.  Aside from the story and the cinematography and the editing which all are so well done that you feel like you are there with them; the music is a big contributor to the feel of the movie, and in my opinion, more so than in a lot of films.It is very subtle, it has taken me 10 viewings to even notice there was music there.  It really helps create the atmosphere, going from lighthearted, almost fun in the beginning with various rock/pop tracks into deep and moving operatic styles as the story progesses into the war and further.It is the top of my list of favourites for many reasons, but I think mostly it is the way the whole package comes together to tell the story of what happened that makes it so good.Well worth viewing many times over.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Fantastically filmed war movie(inspired by true events, which makes it even more unbelievable)","Black Hawk Down(2001) is truly a great war movie. Filmed extroirdinarally with gritty action scenes, this movie is (one of) the best war movies I've seen since Saving Private Ryan.The movie is based(noticed BASED, which the director admitted they filled in A LOT of gaps they had no info on)on true events of a small force of soldiers going into an african town to take out a leader and his men, whom are blocking all food from a close town. Even food America sends over, we learn, they take as theirs. So one bad thing leads to another, and the ride they came in on, crashes, hence the name Black Hawk Down.While I thought the film was a little of a copy off of SPR, with the camera movements, to the filming style itself, did not hinder this movie's effect on audiences at all. The pain, and whole torturous hours those soldiers were without help was shocking. It leaves you sitting in your seat after it's over, thinking what it must of been like, every second they were in theiir, always fighting. Getting this movie will pay off.

Top-notch war film and one of Ridley Scott's best,"Gripping, exciting and downright dramatic, this war drama from Ridley Scott is another notch in the director's blossoming career (following on from the disappointing HANNIBAL). Scott handles both the drama and action with flair and skill and the result is an epic-feeling movie which, following on from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, shows you what war is really all about. Forget the long-gone days of cinema where soldiers never got dirty and war was glamourised to the extreme; this is a film that puts you right into the thick of the action, making you feel like you're actually taking part in the battle. The realism is thick and at the end of the film you feel exhausted so you know the work has paid off.Technically, the film is excellent, with fine action choreography and some great camera angles that are up close and personal. The various CGI effects are used to heighten the realism of the drama, but the main thing is that you never feel like you're watching CGI, so they are effective in the utmost. The film is bleak, violent and also extremely gory in places, so only strong stomachs need apply. A cast loaded with faces fill out their roles respectively and make you feel for the various characters – in particular William Fichter, Jason Isaacs, Kim Coates, Tom Sizemore and Ewen Bremner give fine performances, as well as the more famous leads. BLACK HAWK DOWN is a classic and exciting war film, utilising state-of-the-art technology to make it even more intense than before. Check this one out.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A War Film for the Senses, not the Heart","""In the end, neither the appealing cast nor the force of Scott's stunning imagery is enough to make us understand why these men died."" - Manhola Dargis, writing for L. A. Weekly.It's a great summing up for what makes Black Hawk Down, like many war films, feel less weighted with impact and cinematic viscera as it should be. There is little holding back on the action here, no guts are left unspilled and no shootout is sprayed without consequence. On a purely visual level, it's incredibly visceral and has the kind of raw kinetic energy that usually fits for war films. What troubles it is, for as affecting as it is on the eyes, that unless you're a person of deep empathy, most of the soldiers being gunned down then wantonly killed off do not strike much of a dramatic chord, because there's about 20 of them.For all the development that goes into the select few characters, ones played by Ewan McGregor (in an accent that's 80% there) and Josh Hartnett, it becomes pretty clear pretty quick who is going to make it through the day still breathing, and then the characters who get a total of five lines are telegraphed on the chopping block. True to life as the order of death may be, the way the events are plotted out makes the ""docudrama"" tag come off much more blockbustery than you'd imagine.Black Hawk Down has got the structure of a horror movie. It even does that thing most horror fans enjoy where you're given little information about antagonists, besides whatever atrocities they commit. If you're lucky, you get an interrogation scene, or some seconds spared to sympathise for a child soldier raised in these bullet hell conditions, but for the most part, the ones fighting our named heroes are faceless, shifting in the background until they creep out a wall with an AK-47 attached to the silhouette. If Ridley Scott wasn't so good at being a ""blending in"" director, maybe the parts where the characters are ambushed with a surprise attack could be more disaffecting, but as it's made, all the action in Black Hawk Down blurs into one.",6.0,Anonymous,History
An unashamed propaganda piece,"I read Bowden's book by the same title. All of those who claim that this movie follows the book closely clearly lack in reading comprehension. The book took a balanced approach to the conflict. We learn about the events leading up to the Battle of Mogadishu. Bowden interviews both Somalis and US soldiers and we learn about their motivations.In the Scott's work all of the characters are flat. They're cookie-cutter ""American heroes"" who are completely indistinguishable from one another. The Somalis are depicted as crazed hordes who are inexplicably hell-bent on US blood.I could go on, but the opening ""background"" text says enough. It suggests that US soldiers were merely there on a humanitarian mission to rescue the population from a genocidal warlord. What they don't tell you is that shortly before the events in BHD, the Habr Gedir clan elders had met to discuss the peace proposal put forth by Admiral Howe the previous day. Due to lack of intelligence Cobra helicopters armed with TOW missiles attacked massacred 54 people. With this act they succeeded in making enemies of the entire Somali people. Note that military advisers were with the film crew and able to veto every decision.Read Bowden's book or google the Battle of Mogadishu for more.

Excellent War Movie (very realistic and true account of War),"I have seen many War movies and I am myself a very die hard Military Technology Enthusiast but I have hardly seen any movie which is as correct as this one. This movie simply gives you the feel of the actual action which went on during this battle.Everything from the way the soldiers moved, took their position, fired from covered positions, gave covering fire to each other, the use of Explosives including grenade and the way they captured strategic places even without much help from Air Force gave a true and absolutely realistic view of Real Time Urban Combat. It shows that Humvees are not impenetrable and the Soldier manning the machine gun post is extremely vulnerable from Roof Top Fire. Again the way Small Arms like the LMG & UMG were used were impressive and the tactics used by Special Forces to fend off attackers and secure the perimeter was true to all my knowledge.I appreciate the Director and actors to carry out this War Movie with such accuracy.

"A big budget, low substance war film","If you read other reviews of Black Hawk Down, people praise the realism of the conflict in Somalia, along with the accurate portrayals of the American forces against the rebelling usurpers. However, these people seem to 1) have no idea what the conflict in Somalia was actually like, and 2) be completely blinded by the film's huge budget allowing a lot of dramatic set pieces.Without a doubt this is a good war film: a cast ahead of its time (such as relative unknowns Orlando Bloom and Ewan McGregor) dropped into a war zone very different to those often portrayed on the big screen. Beyond this, however, not a lot more is on show - the fight scenes are predictable and simplistic, and a script isn't really required in between the bursts of gunfire. Black Hawk Down also leans fairly heavily on the trope of ""down but not out"", as every squad seems to be afflicted by someone who is a magnet for shrapnel and bullets, but continues to push through the swathes of war.The production value salvages a lot for this movie, creating an atmosphere of legitimate danger often missing from action films. Furthermore, the use of aerial combat shows a degree of confidence from the producers (often avoided when budgets are slightly more restrictive). Black Hawk Down doesn't quite exceed the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but certaininly is above average on the merits of its hectic battle scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A gritty and good acted war movie,"Black Hawk Down, co-produced and directed by Ridley Scott, is based on a true story taking place in Somalia, Mogadishu in the early '90s. Elite forces were sent there to participate in a UN peacekeeping action and the task was to abduct two of Farrah Aidids, a Somalian warlord, lieutenants. But it proves more difficult than they previously had thought after two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and in turn led to a fiasco, a failure that has devastating consequences. Starring as Eversmann is the well-known actor Josh Hartnett, from Lucky Number Slevin. Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan) plays Danny, a tough and fearless sergeant, and as the comic relief is Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting).The actual script is based from a book by Mark Bowden, a soldier who wrote it while he was in Somalia and it explains partly of why we get to see the U.S. point of view, which to me tend to be somewhat patriotic in these cases. When the bullets whiz past helmets, and the grenades explodes in the battlefield, you feel very much that you are there without getting hit. Elite units stood side by side when hell broke loose, and together achieve their goal - to overthrow the dictator. The idea to leave someone on the battlefield did not exist, it was one for all - all for one.From a realistic way the film works very well, like when guts and body parts fly off from bodies, but I am slightly hesitant about the way Somalis was portrayed. Were they really a faceless evil enemy through and through? I got the impression that Somalia was ruled by criminals, drug addicts, drug dealers and murderers. In one scene the Somalis attacks one of the helicopters and they looked like a horde of ants looking for their prey. If it was a Somali film instead, it would probably look quite different compared to this American bias. Sure, all the historical facts is not always easy to get in a reality-based film and I accept that.Some scenes are very daring and are nicely assembled. The color has a mostly somber gray tone, and the barren, cold realism that the film shows is great executed. The war ""only"" lasted in hellish 15 hours resulting in 18 dead and 73 injured U.S. soldiers and hundreds of dead Somalis.",7.0,Anonymous,History
True Shock and Awe,"Based on the real events of the disastrous Somalia raid on October 3, 1993 where US Army Rangers attempts to capture Somali warlords. This mission was going well until the first Black Hawk helicopter got hit by a rocket and crashed. The Rangers would end up fighting their way to safety.Ridley Scott has given a ultra realism to the movie. This is truly Shock and Awe movie-making. The action starts relatively early and doesn't let up. The impressive cast really delivers. There isn't any glaring deficiency. The only part missing is the Somali side of the story. This is not that kind of a movie. What you get is a Band of Brothers story.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good War Flick, But A Little Too Much To Take","If you like war action films, this one is for you! After a slow start - about 40 minutes to set things up - it's almost non-stop action the rest of the way as American soldiers fight in the streets of Somalia.Frankly, it was too much action for me, but I'm not a kid anymore so non-stop action gets a bit tiring after 20 minutes. This thing goes almost non-stop for 100 straight minutes. After awhile you want to just say, ""Enough already! Let's take a break!I don't know how much of this story is true. When they say, ""based on a true story"" that could mean as much as 90 percent of it is fictionalized for dramatic purposes. However, reports are that it is pretty accurate. Regardless, the film has some good things going for it.First of all there is the military credo:: ""Never leave anyone behind."" That message certainly is demonstrated here even at the cost of about 20 American lives and who knows who many Somalis as soldiers go back into action to rescue men after a helicopter (named Black Hawk) goes ""down.""With today's filmmakers and special effects capabilities, you get Saving Private Ryan-type realistic action scenes. That also means you get some gruesome scenes, too. This film is very bloody. It's intense and visually unique, I think, for a war film. Speaking of that, with director Ridley Scott, you get stylish visuals: lots of them. In this film, you see bunch of interesting orange-ish colors, great lighting and great facial closeups. The sound also is excellent with bullets ""flying out"" of all the surround speakers.In the end, a little too much but still a good military movie that does justice to the unselfishness and heroism of the men in the military.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great excellent war film,Black Hawk Down is a movie that really shows the brutality of war. It doesn't feel like a fake movie about war. It feels as if I'm there watching the reality of what is going on in the battlefield. It is a perfectly edited film with some really amazing cinematography. The score/soundtrack is outstanding. This film is filled with tearjerkers. The movie really brings you on to the battlefield and you feel what the characters feel. The film doesn't really have a main character like other war films. This is saying that war doesn't have a face. All the soldiers are in it together and they all feel the same pain. It is truly a masterpiece! Bravo!,10.0,Anonymous,History
Only The Dead Have Been The End Of War.,"Ridley Scott directs this excellent war drama. America Elite soldiers, Delta Force, Army Rangers and the 160th SOAR are sent into Mogadishu to remove the warlord Aidid and his lieutenants hopefully to restore some order in Somalia. A Black Hawk is shot down in the middle of the combat zone, and now it is a rescue and extraction mission full of confused misdirection. The viewer is up close and personal and F/X are superior. This movie is hardly emotion free and is not easy to forget. John Hartnett leads a notable cast that includes: Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepard, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana and Jason Isaacs. I especially got a kick out of Elvis' ""Suspicious Minds"" as the mission took flight. There is not a lack of action or drama. BLACK HAWK DOWN will reinforce pride in those that put their lives on the line for freedom.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Worst piece of propaganda ever to come out of Hollywood,"If you are young and don't care, you will probably classify this movie as 'cool'. You may even call this the ""best war movie ever made."" For others, who do have some critical sense left, you will quickly notice that producer Jerry Bruckheimer, once again, tries to rewrite history. Yes, more flagwaving, explosions, patriotic rhetorics and bullets flying all over the place, but no character development what so ever. Is this how war should be portrayed?I guess showing which psychological and emotional effects war has on soldiers is not an option in this one. Instead the audience is bombarded with more than two hours of action-galore nonsense, which looks more like a computergame. Maybe if I had a joystick I would have liked this movie.So we are led to believe that the US troops were there to carry out a mission in good faith? If you took time to read about the background about what REALLY happened, you will feel disgusted after having watched 'Black Hawk Down'. This movie was partially sponsored by Pentagon. Doesn't that tell you something? As a matter of fact, Pentagon dictated that the name of Ewan McGregor's role (the coffee-drinking John Stebbins) should be changed to 'John Grimes', because he in real life is serving a 30-years sentence for raping a 12-year old. In the movie he is, of course, as heroic as the rest - an all-american hero.Don't be fooled.",1.0,Anonymous,History

This is not a movie to be entertained by,"From reading the comments by others who have posted here it seems that people were actually ENTERTAINED by this film?  Correct me if I am wrong but to me that seems rather sick.  This movie was a lesson.  It was meant to tell the story of the brave men who fought and died in the third world hole of a town in Somalia.  Anyone who calls this film racist, or that it makes the somali's look like savages is ignorant of the facts and uneducated as to the situation in Somalia in 1993.  The reason there was only one black ranger, was because Kurth and one other who did not figure into the story as well, were the ONLY black men who were members of Task Force Ranger.  The percentage of blacks who apply to Ranger School is very small, this is not because of any race thing,  many blacks serve in the combat arms, and other more specialized groups such as the 82nd Airborne and 101st Airborne.Yes this movie was well done, but to sit there and talk about how it was wonderfully done and exciting and other BS like that is sickening.  This is also upsetting that something that happened so recently in history can be so quickly forgotten, or called BORING and that the viewer was checking their watch halfway through... Disgusting and arrogant.You don't have to like this film, but do not insult the memories of those men by speaking as if this movie was made for your entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,History
What puzzles me the most...,"I was thrilled by this film in the theater when it first came out, and I've subsequently watched it, or sections of it, dozens of times at home. Each time, I admire its brilliant direction, editing, sound, music, the rhythm of the action, and the sheer beauty of many of the shots. Ridley Scott has made some classic films and (more recently) some disappointing ones. This, I think, is his best.But it's definitely confusing as hell, and even after all these viewings -- even after having read Mark Bowden's book (which the film follows very closely) -- I have trouble keeping track of all the various characters: the Deltas, the Rangers, and their complicated movements around war-torn Mogadishu.Most confusing of all -- something that puzzles me each time I see the film (and which the book fails to clear up) -- is why this poorly planned military operation was ever okayed in the first place. As depicted on screen, it seems the most harebrained scheme imaginable, because it's so ridiculously vulnerable, just one tiny step away from utter failure.All it takes to screw up the mission is a lone RPG fired at one of the low-flying helicopters. And hovering in the air just above the rooftops, the choppers make the easiest of targets; a single strike with a rocket can bring one down, and when one goes down (followed shortly afterward, of course, by a second), the entire mission turns into a colossal disaster.Sam Shepard, playing the general in charge, is, as always, an impressive figure, but you want to shout at him, ""You idiot! What were you thinking?""",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Technical masterpiece, historically selective","As always Ridley Scott delivers an audiovisual feast. I would expect that the on-set ex-military advisors ensured that the scenarios and skills, including the language and tactics were as authentic as filming and military policy would allow. The DVD extras shows that the cast was sent to taste boot-camp (McGregor, Bloom) and Ranger training (Fitchner) so the commitment to realism was evident. For all those reasons: six stars.Many people, however, rightly dispute the film's casting of the soldiers as a peacekeeping force. No government in the world uses special forces people for peacekeeping operations, by which I mean: restore order. It's entirely opposite to what they normally do, i.e. be used as a top-grade scalpel: only when ""necessary"" surgery is needed.Decaptiating Aidid's regime would only create a power vacuum. It would not help the UN peacekeepers. Without a long-term commitment to the region, it was simply a period of upheaval that cost thousands more innocent lives. If only Somalia had oil reserves...As a film, it's beautifully done. As propaganda, it probably hit the mark for people (i.e. Americans) who didn't bother (or want) to look too closely. Watch it for its beauty and its (at the time) groundbreaking tight camera shots and skillfully choreographed and executed events.",6.0,Anonymous,History
It was my favourite before I even watched it,"This film is unlike any other that I have ever seen. I don't mean that as in its the greatest movie in the world. It's not. I know there are other movies that may be better and that there are some people who dislike this film. But I'm gonna ignore all of that because this film is something else. It's kinda like a documentary of what happened in Somalia which I think is a key part of history and I didn't even know happened before I watched this movie.Firstly people who are saying that the story is rubbish obviously don't know what the story is and maybe they should rewatch the film and show some respect to the soldiers that actually lost there lives. It's not about trying to capture the Somalian warlord which is what there mission is. It's about the bondship and hardship of fighting by the man next to you. It's about struggling through hell and back and still looking over your shoulder to make sure your friend is following you. That's what this movie is about and that is what this movie means as Eric Bana said at the end of the movie.The cinematography is incredible and really is moving. Each shot has its purpose and is there to demonstrate the reality of war. The beautiful shot of the black hawks flying over the beach is immaculate and a marvel to behold.The sound is beautiful and every snap of a bullet in the distance or whisp of a round flying past a soldier comes to life and sinks you deeper into the film. The rumbling of an explosive or the shatter of a shell brings the movie out from the screen and draws you toward the thrilling but emotional action.After about the first ten or twenty minutes it is mostly non stop action. This may sound tedious but when you watch the film it cleverly ties action with story-telling and allows you to enjoy the action whilst deepening your insight into the film.Josh Harnet, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Tom Hardy, Orlando Bloom and many others put there soul into this film.Ridley Scott thank you for directing a masterpiece and putting out a brilliant masterclass film.This movie should've been at least nominated for best picture without a doubt.Favourite film definitely.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Super Six-Four,"Ridley Scott directs a muscular retelling of the ill fated mission in the Somalian civil war in 1993. Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid declared war on the remaining UN personnel and US forces were deployed to capture Aidid.As always Scott assembles a multi-national cast and future rising stars to tell his story without resorting to war movie clichés. This is a full on assault with bullets flying as the crew of the downed helicopter stave off the Somali militia as their comrades try to extract them whilst other US soldiers try to reach the safety of the UN safe zone.It very much tells the story from the soldiers view and gives a more realistic impression of conflict. It dwells little on the politics but focuses on action but also mixes this with humour even if it might be of the bleak kind. Eric Bana, Josh Harnett give the best performances and good support provided by Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, William Fichtner and Orlando Bloom.This is a strong film, not for the faint-hearted.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Ridley Scott's harrowing film is a revelation,"Black Hawk Down premiered in December of 2001, a mere three months after the world had faced the harsh reality of the September 11th terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C. I vividly remember a small controversy brewing at that time, questioning the film's release in the wake of the attacks. Apparently, some critics felt that the film was arriving too soon after the attacks and that audiences weren't ready to see a film that dealt with the realities of the military and terrorism. Despite those concerns, the film was heralded as an instant classic; moviegoers responded by turning up in droves. Perhaps the reason behind Black Hawk Down's success lies in the strong sense of optimism the film displays, in spite of the tragedy that it portrays on screen.Somalia, 1993: A small team of Army Rangers and Delta Force Troops on a peace-keeping mission in Somalia, attempt to help avert mass genocide and to protect Somali citizens from barbaric acts of violence and the various militias that occupy the country. When one hundred American soldiers are sent into Mogadishu to arrest a handful of particularly sadistic militia leaders, they find themselves in the midst of an international incident with deadly consequences. Each soldier will be confronted with the realities and horrors of combat as they protect innocent civilians and each other from the surging ranks of hostile forces. Black Hawk Down is a relentless, harrowing and true story of bravery, in the face of the horrors of war.Black Hawk Down can be a seriously difficult film to watch; its hyper-realistic portrayal of battle and in-your-face violence drive home the almost impossible adversity that the soldiers are faced with. The film is nothing if not extraordinarily unnerving. By situating the viewer in the line of fire and in the midst of the battle, Director Ridley Scott achieves the effect of rendering his audience in a near state of panic. It's an unforgettable, exhausting and purposely unpleasant experience.One of the most amazing things about Black Hawk Down is that in spite of the seemingly random confusion represented on screen, the film brilliantly maps out the soldiers' strategies and tactics. There is, indeed, a method in all of the madness. Being a true virtuoso, Mr. Scott frames the action so precisely, and through such perfect camera angles and placement, that we are able to follow all of the action on screen as though we are participating in the battle. With just about any other director, this kind of controlled chaos could have led to a very confusing film experience for the viewer. It is clear that every last detail of this film had been thoroughly choreographed and intricately planned. Mr. Scott's under-appreciated skills as a visual storyteller make this film a success. Ultimately, Black Hawk Down is a painful film that shows us the realities of war and the horrors of the situation in Somalia. Whatever your political affiliations or opinions might be, this is an important film that deserves to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Battle minus script or plot details,"Over-hyped, under-scripted and over in Somalia, this long, fairly anonymous 1993 battle scene has still picked up four Oscar nominations. Ewan McGregor and others slug it out as part of a U.S. peace-keeping force in Mogadishu. The locals rise up more or less en masse against them and reassure us that the episode was one of America's foreign policy `mistakes'. Quite why they are so unwanted is not really explained. A bit more convincing than, say, Pearl Harbor, but I personally am unable to share the enthusiasm that many feel for this noisy action piece.",6.0,Anonymous,History
War is hell,"This film is more realistic than the tepid pictures that were produced  in the Hollywood of World War II. You have to give credit to the director, Ridley Scott, to come out with a winning movie that is totally engrossing and that keeps you at the edge of your seat all the time. The only sad part is that we never get to know the feelings on the Somali people that battled the American power to the bitter end. So in that sense, this film is a one-sided account of what went on, told to us from the American viewpoint, which is well and good, but we never get to hear from the other side, except the short scene from one of the Somali warlord and General Garrison.This film is released right smack at the height of the Afghanistan conflict in which Americans are facing ""the evil enemy"", according to our president. In the case of the Somalian involvement, it was supposedly to help the Somalis regain peace from the warlords that dominated the country. The parallel with the war in Afghanistan is somehow similar as we are still battling the same type of enemy in a divided country, dominated as was Somalia by warlords that are more interested in the domination of the poor and defenseless people than in achieving democracy and freedom for the people of the country.What doesn't make sense at all is why didn't the Black Hawks attack from the air the thousands up in the roof, thus providing cover to the troops on the ground. In fact, the whole nature of the fighting is a bit of a puzzlement because if the intention was to kidnap the kingpins of the conflict, we only succeeded in putting our troops in harm's way and to have 19 men killed, when maybe they would have had a better chance if they had better cover from the same Black Hawks the enemy keep downing.The cast is very good. I never did like Josh Hartnett, and frankly, he is not a good actor. He doesn't show any emotion. The rest of the cast is great with actors of the stature of Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, William Fitchner and the rest. As an ensemble they interact very well and you believe they are the people involved in the original conflict.The gory details of war are realistically handled. The script by Ken Nolan serves the director very well even though, as pointed out at the beginning it's only one-sided, since the enemy then, as it is now is composed of people, as presented in the film, so horrible, they're very easy to hate.In spite to these misgivings, the film is so fast paced that almost 2 hours and a half pass by so quickly, we don't even feel it's that long. Mr. Scott gives us here his own take of the Somalian conflict in very cinematic terms.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Flat Perspective,"The consensus of opinion on Black Hawk Down is that as an action film depicting the reality of a battle it is extremely well executed.But that the personalities of the film's characters are mostly vacant, that they simply react to events without any real engagement with the wider issues of life.And that, even though it is clear from the film's portrayal of what happened that the raid on Mogadishu was badly handled, that the film somehow makes heroes out of the Rangers.That even though we are clearly told that over 1,000 Somalis died, that the film ignores their plight.It seems to me that the film is working. The soldiers personalities are largely vacant. We get enough to show that they are distinct enough to be real people, but that they mostly lack depth. That's all we need.The wider issues are there. Not exactly hidden. Not exactly in the background. There, clearly in black and white. In every frame. You can't escape from what is happening. We are shown and we are told. And the balance of opinion, as with the balance of weapon technology, is tilted very strongly in favour of the American soldiers.We are given the flat perspective - just like the aerial pictures of the battle scene the generals are staring at - and we make of it what we will.I saw an honest and brutal film that depicted quite clearly the imbalance of the battle in terms of numbers of people killed and weapons technology used. I saw the fear and thrill of the American soldiers. Some wanted to go back into the fight - other's were less keen. I saw the mess and the confusion. I saw angry Somalis, intelligent Somalis, violent Somalis, and lots of dead and dying Somalis. I saw the whole complex issue played out in front of me with astonishing clarity given the constant action of the film. I saw points in favour of the Ranger's philosophy of looking after your own.

high beams in a thick fog,"I find it ironic that many of the comments being circulated from outside (rather luckily, I'd say) the hornet's nest of U.S. news media are doling out the most thoughtful and reasonable opinions on why ""Black Hawk Down"" is such a rank slice of flag-waving propaganda.  Those who say, in so many words, ""leave your politics at the door"" are the ones who are missing the point of a democratic society--even in something as simple as film criticism, dissent is not a privilege, but a right for all people who disagree with the preset opinions of others.""Black Hawk Down"" is a film that offers up an indistinguishable cast of characters, Army men devoid of personality but all trailed by gold haloes (heavy irony here, as one reviewer mentioned, one soldier is presently in prison for rape), as they carry out a rescue mission that goes awry (although the plot becomes a moot point even before the troops arrive), which turns into the type of loud, exploitative, and soulless bloodbath we've come to expect from the prolific, oh-so-patriotic Jerry Bruckheimer. (At least ""Con Air"" had John Malkovich for comic relief.)Inking his soul over to the devil, Ridley Scott employs the mandatory, quick-edit style of pretentious music-video directors the world over, and rather than drawing interest into the almost nonexistent story, instead makes the film bomb even harder.  The shameless cliches that are trotted out do nothing to build the characters (the phone call that came one ring too late; the 'kissing of the family picture', etc.), therefore it is impossible to relate to or care about anyone, even more so when they choke out the typical ""Tell my wife and kids..."" line.On the other side of a particularly one-dimensional, racist ""script"" are the Somalis, who are presented with even less personality than the soldiers--their video game objective is to yell, wave automatic weapons, and act like utter psychopaths.  What better way to establish the Good Guys, eh? Just give the Bad Guys even less personality!  Personality is overrated, anyway--especially when the gory consequences of war are shoved in your face with unflinching horror!  BHD piles on the gore, mostly for dramatic effect, but since the characters are such cliches, it becomes pure shock value...gore for gore's sake.  I've seen better, more justified use of the red stuff in Lucio Fulci films.Unlike ""Apollo 13,"" this is not a ""successful failure,"" but became a success (financially, that is) by being such a typical exercise in Hollywood sensationalism.  Riding high on the wave of nationalism, revenge, and general intolerance brought about by the 9/11 tragedy, BHD arrived at an opportune time, and gave audiences exactly what they wanted--a sink-your-claws-into-the-armrest propaganda film where the U.S. Army's angelic duty boils down to blowing away foreigners (a testament to this film's racial and nationalistic bias is the fact that 19 American soldiers died in contrast with 1,000 Somalis).  As if this shallow exercise in war pornography couldn't attest to its own ulterior motives, many critics hailed BHD as ""the best war movie ever,"" among other ostentatious remarks, right as the full-speed ""War on Terror"" campaign was gripping this country (makes you think, doesn't it?).  As for myself, I could only raise a skeptical eyebrow at the proceedings, as I pondered U.S. foreign policy, racial stereotypes through the years, and Hollywood's ability to make a mint by ignoring history.  This forum seems divided--as is the case in America right now--between gung-ho 'patriotic' comments and dissidents.  To disparage the flag or this film is unpatriotic--but is it patriotic, then, to accept everything you see and hear without question?  Or is it more patriotic to bask in the jingoistic arrogance of BHD?  If you believe that to be true, then by all means see this movie.

Outstanding,"When you break it down and look at it both honestly and cynically (assuming that that is possible for a minute), there are really only two kinds of war movie: pro and con. The underlying theme of virtually every war movie - particularly since APOCALYPSE NOW - generally comes down to an analysis of the 'value' of war, of its worth. It's pointlessness, or its need. Is the action of battle warranted because of the attempt to find peace, or is war never justifiable, no matter what the intention?Pro or con?What is interesting is that since the Second World War, this underlying message that is found in nearly all war pictures has slowly changed from the former to the latter. This again is generally shaped in two ways. Either we see the play-by-play results following the issuance of what appears to be a bizarre and foolhardy set of orders from high command (i.e., APOCALYPSE NOW or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). Or we get a glimpse of being right in the action as it all falls apart: hearing the bullets whizzing past our noses, reeling from the impact of RPG's and gazing blankly as the bodies begin to mount (PLATOON, say). BLACK HAWK DOWN, directed by Ridley Scott and accurately following the true story of the best-selling book by Mark Bowden, very much adopts the latter perspective.On October 3, 1993, a small unit of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force troops were dropped by helicopter into hostile territory in Mogadishu, Somalia, with what is perceived to be a straightforward mission: the capture of two lieutenants of the Somali warlord, General Aidid. The unit is under command from Major William Garrison (Sam Shepard), and headed by Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) in his first direct experience of frontline leadership. He also has a personal goal - to ensure everyone comes back alive.Yet, these things are never as easy as they appear - hence the development of the book and the film - and when 18-year old frontline rookie Todd Blackbird is injured early on, the entire mission begins to fall apart. More U.S. troops are injured, and when Somalis down two Black Hawk helicopters, the mission changes completely: it's now a rescue operation.And for about ninety minutes, you are subjected to some of the most intense, disturbing, graphic, violent and chilling pieces of conflict representation that you will ever see. Remember the Omaha Beach scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? That was about half an hour long. Think of something three times that length, yet more 'realistic' and with (thankfully) no flag-waving. That is the gist of BLACK HAWK DOWN.Ultimately, one hundred-and-twenty-three U.S. troops were involved in the Mogadishu conflict. Nineteen were killed, and one thousand Somalis also perished.Unlike RYAN, BLACK HAWK DOWN doesn't build up a core group of characters, focusing on their emotional makeup and depth. No. Instead, we barely know our 'heroes', with very little time devoted to each characters motivation or purpose. And this is a good thing. At first, you find yourself a little bewildered by the sizeable cast, and this isn't helped by the many distant POV scenes that found this reviewer wondering just who he was seeing living and dying. But surely that is an important and crucial element of war - you're involved in these suicidal missions with men you barely know. You don't have time to share your life-stories. You may have only met that week, that day, or within the last hour. And then it's full on.We get snippets of character data: Eversmann's entire focus is on not letting the team down; Specialist Danny Grimes (Ewan McGregor), for so long tied to his desk simply because he excelled at typing; and Delta Sergeant 'Hoot' Hooten (Tom Sizemore, soon to be playing Bruce Banner in THE HULK), wise despite his years, somehow making more sense of the nonsense than anyone else.But any characterisation is underplayed and to the point, which is how it should be. The fresh-facedness and naivety of the troops is key to the success of the film, and of the emotional impact therein. As the errors and bodies mount, we get to see the horror of the conflict - the carnage and devastation, relentlessness and never-ending waves of Somali forces - directly through the eyes of the U.S. Rangers and Delta Force squad. I was somewhat stunned by the impact of the movie, both in the way the action grips you and shakes you violently until you want to let go, and in the occasional and very touching soft moments. Indeed, the action is so intense that I found myself at times glazing over, thinking of something else, and with hindsight I put this down to some kind of need for an emotional release; certainly, I cannot fault the film in that sense. It was simply a case of 'too much.'Throughout the movie both the acting and direction are superb; Ridley Scott has an eye for detail and filmography that is probably unmatched. Even his lesser efforts like HANNIBAL are beautifully shot. And BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of his best efforts to date.The musical score is also superb, and I was encouraged to hear the Stone Temple Pilot's CREEP near the beginning of the flick. I believe this is the first time I have heard a STP song in any movie.What is also very welcome is the lack of U.S. nationalism in this picture. Of America saving the day. Unlike, say, brother Tony Scott's TOP GUN - which yes, was making a different point entirely (i.e., let's make some money and recruit some boys to the Navy at the same time) - this isn't about the might of the U.S. There is no wake-leaving in BLACK HAWK DOWN. Real people made mistakes, and real people died.Speaking of Tony Scott, however, my only minor quibble was Sam Shepard's performance. He was probably in the wrong movie, as all his mannerisms (especially the way he took off his sunglasses in that quick-draw kind of way that stereotypical military types always seem to do) appeared to me to come straight out of TOP GUN. He was a little too 'bleh' for my tastes. For all I know William Garrison could have been exactly like that, but it still seemed a little Hollywood.I also wasn't completely comfortable as to how the Somalis were portrayed; this movie wasn't really about good versus bad in my opinion, but on the face of it the U.S. are the bad guys here. At least inasmuch as they were at fault. Comparisons are made with Vietnam both in the unnecessary involvement of the U.S. in the Somali civil war, and in the end credits of the film where we learn that the Medal of Honour was awarded to two U.S. soldiers for the first time since the Vietnam conflict. Yet, throughout the film the Somali are seen in only two ways - either a relentless force of bloodthirsty killers, or a simple people trying to stay out of the way. Now yes, this may be what it really was like - I cannot say because I wasn't there - but the overall message didn't fit well with me. They seemed too one-dimensional, a bit TOO bloodthirsty, and that left a bitter taste.Also as mentioned above the film is often confusing during the extended battle scene, and warrants more than one view. As the blood and dirt begins to pile, you will find yourself wondering who you are looking at, particularly when the perspective is on several soldiers from a distance. But that can be forgiven. This isn't PREDATOR, and while that film is outstanding as a piece of science fiction, it made a great effort to separate the marines so that the viewer would have an easy time following each one.That, of course, isn't real life, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is, perhaps, as close as we've come yet to an accurate capture of the true feel of war.Rating: **** 1/2 (out of five)",,Anonymous,History
"One of Scott's best films, but not quite on my top 10 list for 2001","Ridley Scott seems to have a knack for high intensity in movie-making (Gladiator, Blade Runner, Hannibal and Thelma and Louise among others come to mind) and Black Hawk Down, a war picture set in Somalia, is another prime example of his knack. Black Hawk Down is a war movie that does something I haven't seen much (or dare I say haven't seen at all) which is not going directly into the battle scenes, but instead keeping the audience in check with how the soldiers are reacting and feeling and never diverging much from the action. It is a daring move by Scott.In ""Down"", a somewhat large group of soldiers are sent to the heart (or mindless brain) of Somalia to capture 2 lieutenants in regard to a civil war going on in the country that has taken 300,000 lives (""it's not war, it's genocide"" comments the major general played by Sam Shepard). At first notice it seems like they can get in and out of the mission in a few hours...but then everything goes wrong. The Somalians start a near unstoppable attack on the U.S. soldiers, shooting as many as they can and sneaking out from roofs and sides like cockroaches. It becomes a chaotic day and night for the soldiers as they try to stay alive while waiting for extra troops to come in to rescue them that could take time to get there.Outside of the couple of flaws in the film (at the end it tells that 18 U.S. soldiers died in the attack but if you don't keep exact track it will seem more/the cinematography is alright however the editing cuts too much in the action and tension), Black Hawk Down is quite the war picture, one that will be memorable in years to come as the most accurate depiction of what went on with us in Somalia in 1993. Kudos to Scott and the cast; Ewan McGregor gets the highest praise from me if only for giving an amazing American accent. A-",9.0,Anonymous,History
Black Hawk Down,"In October of 1993, in an effort to secure the Somali town of Mogadishu, Task Force Ranger, comprised of Delta Force soldiers and Rangers, are sent in for a mission that is supposed to last no more than half an hour. But when two Black Hawk helicopters are downed by insurgents with rocket launchers many of the members of Task Force Ranger are left stranded in the city. The ensuing battle lasts for 18 hours.The Battle of Magadishu (also known as The Battle of the Black Sea, Black Hawk Down, and for the Somali's The Day of the Rangers) was both a disaster and a success depending on who you talk to. It was a success in that when all was said and done Task Force Ranger accomplished their main objectives. At the same time, it was a disaster because originally the mission was only supposed to take 30 minutes, but in the end lasted 18 hours and cost the lives of 19 American soldiers and somewhere in the range of 500-2000 Somali's. How do you adapt an 18 hour battle into a two and a half hour movie? Very carefully, and had the movie been placed in a less capable director's hands than Ridley Scott's (Alien, Gladiator) this movie could very well have been a disaster. Ridley Scott, though, along with first time screenwriter Ken Nolan, do their best to capture the battle in a truly authentic light, and they do an amazing job. From what I hear (I have a lot more to learn about the battle) this is possibly the most accurate depiction of a battle ever put to film. I would also argue that it's the best example of modern urban warfare put to film as well.The performances in this film are amazing as, despite a hugely recognizable cast (something I might just be saying because many of the actors in this movie have become huge since, and weren't as big at the time) there is no vanity amongst the actors. Their lack of vanity only adds to the realism, and also builds up the feeling of brotherhood as they act out the battle in the field.All in all, if there was going to be an argument against this film it would really only be the fact that there's not much character development. In the end, though, it's not as much about the characters as it is about the units. It's not as much about the battle as it is a reminder that there are still soldiers that carry the DNA of bravery and brotherhood that we saw in the World War II elite. And it's not so much about Somalia as it is about the war fronts we fight on throughout the world whether in Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc. If you haven't seen this movie yet, definitely give it a shot.4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""One hundred caskets to fill""","After the success of Saving Private Ryan in 1998, the war movie was rebranded from the moral fable of the Vietnam era to something that was essentially an exciting experience for its audience. Black Hawk Down was perhaps the most extreme example of that approach, a pure video-game movie that pares down all the camaraderie and humanising to just a handful of brief exchanges, and puts almost all its attention upon the actual business of killing each other.However Black Hawk Down differs from a lot of modern action pictures in its pacing, as orchestrated by director Ridley Scott. Eschewing the usual frenetic overkill, Scott takes a relatively relaxed approach. In the first Lord of the Rings movie, which was released the same week, the average shot length must be something like two seconds. In Black Hawk Down the average shot length is more like three to four seconds, and it makes all the difference. There is time to savour expressions and notice tiny details, making up for the lack of rounded characterisation earlier in the movie. Scott allows the interplay between the men to come out, not in the script, but in glances, grimaces and carefully-placed props. The earliest scenes are eerily calm, providing a moody build-up for the action that is to come.And it's all done with such grace and smoothness. The timing of shots is rhythmic and the images are beautiful. Scott and his cinematographer Slawomir Idziak create some extremely stylised colour schemes which evoke temperature as much as mood. When we move from Garrison's meeting with Atto (browns and yellows) to the hanger with his troops (blues) you can practically feel a whoomph of cool air hitting you. Add to this mix a musical soundtrack that dances from the power of contemporary and classic rock tracks to the haunting sounds of Denez Pringent and Lisa Gerrard. Black Hawk Down has an aesthetic quality rare in war movies.Although this isn't really a movie about deep performances, it's worth making a few points about casting, which seems to follow types rather than talents. For example, Tom Sizemore was then your go-to man for mean-faced sergeant characters. It seems unusual to cast Scotsmen Ewan MacGregor and Ewen Bremner as US soldiers, especially as MacGregor in particular can't really do the accent. However I think the fact that they are outsiders among the rest of the cast feeds into the impression they give of combat virgins.The trouble with Black Hawk Down is that it actually needs to be as visually sumptuous as it is. There isn't really much to go on here, dramatically; apart from a little chitchat in the first half hour, the whole movie is essentially one very long battle scene. When there are talky scenes, all we get is bland, one-dimensional dialogue – the usual trite ""A man's gotta do"" stuff. The only way it actually really conveys anything meaningful is through putting us into that combat zone and giving us a little taste of the terror and the exhilaration. And perhaps, for this, it is a stronger war movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Say again... Why is this movie bad?,"In my opinion, this is the best movie about war ever made. It surpasses even such masterpieces as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan or Stone's Platoon. Reading comments on this website, I came to conclusion there is no middle way (there are exceptions, of course) with this movie; or you love it or you hate it. Well, I love it. I can't agree with arguments given by people who hated it, furthermore, I can't even understand most of them, which mainly are:A - Movie is too one-sided. Now, I never saw a war movie where both sides would be equally presented. In Saving Private Ryan we don't get to know Germans. In Platoon we don't get to know Vietcong. In Thin Red Line we don't get to know Japanese etc, etc. In a battle, you take care about yourself and your comrades, not about a person who is shooting at you, whether you will make his children orphans or not. There are complaints that Somalis are presented as angry, blood-thirsty mob. Well, according to the book, they did act semi-suicidal, without any knowledge about combat tactics, so on numerous occasion they ended up shooting their own people. No wonder why number of their casualties was so high.B - Movie is flag-waving, recruitment ad, pro-war. First, to let you know, I'm NOT an American. Sure, it's patriotic, but what's wrong with that? I always thought patriotism is a value. If someone is confusing patriotism with nationalism, that's his problem. Some say it didn't address bigger picture, why Americans went in Somalia in the first place. But BHD didn't have these ambitions. It's about brotherhood in arms, not political thriller about US foreign policy. Like Bowden stated in his book: ""Soldiers cannot concern themselves with the decisions that bring them to a fight. They trust their leaders not to risk their lives for too little. Once the battle is joined, they fight to survive, to kill before they are killed."" It seems some people refuse to realize the movie is telling a story of America's elite soldiers in that particular event, from their point of view. However, there is a subtle message about uselessness of US engagement in Somalia, it's just not in a form of some angry speech, given by a bitter soldier. I also don't understand how this movie is pro-war. Don't know about you, but I wouldn't put images of Rangers being blown to pieces in a recruitment ad if I would be making one.C - Poor character development. Now, I can partly agree with this statement, but it's necessary to point out, movie isn't a character study. Sure, Hartnett has a leading role which should be more developed, but movie is more focused on course of battle in Mog as such, on showing a perspective of many involved, so there really isn't much room for detailed personal portrait. Some say, it's hard to identify with characters when we know so little about them. In this movie, this doesn't seem to be the case. I found BHD very emotional movie.  Acting is very good, facial expressions and acts of soldiers showed us anxiety, fear, courage, sacrifice, grief etc. For many, Eric Bana as Hoot was too Rambo-type, but his character is based on real-life Delta who really was a tough guy (read the book). The music was also excellent to spur on emotions.Of course, movie isn't perfect, but show me the one which is. US soldiers are just too nice, you-gotta-love-them types, dialogue is poor. But apart from that, it's visually perfect, as realistic as it gets, pure chaos and confusion, just like war really is. Most of the time it's like documentary. Sometimes images say more than a thousand words. Here, they say more than enough.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This is why the rest of the world will never understand the U.S.,"I have always found it interesting to see how films get hyped through the Hollywood machine.  This is an event that no one cared about when it happened.  Vietnam was an event that the majority of Americans didn't care about and it took the U.S. years to commit themselves to WWII.  But now when you watch films made by Americans all you get to see is events that surround these times that are told through their eyes.  And I guess that only makes sense when you are spending millions of dollars making the film and more millions marketing it.  I mean, who would want to see a film where another country either does more than the U.S. does or at least helps them out?  You can look at one of the great AMERICAN War films like Saving Private Ryan for example and poke holes in the entire beginning of the film ( were the Americans really the only ones on the beaches of Normandy?)  But Hollywood can make jingoism like this and sell it to their patriots because this is what everyone wants to see.  Rocky Balboa is not only spoke of with reverence as a character, he symbolizes the great American struggle, the good guy vs. the bad guy, the underdog vs. the favourite, David vs. Goliath. Black Hawk Down is a film that I'm sure has many accuracies to them, but you can't tell me that this is the whole story.  We only get to hear things from an American point of view.  That is always how it is.  And that is fine, again, is any true patriotic, flag waving American going to want to see a film where the Americans aren't the heroes?  Even though they are the big bad Americans, for some reason it is prudent for film makers to present them as the underdogs, the Davids, the Rockys.  Now think about it, how funny is that?I mention this in utter futility because I am Canadian and I realize I will never understand the true spirit of what it is like to be American so this film perhaps is not really made for me.  But when people comment that a film like this is unflinching in it's realism because it shows us how the government betrayed it's soldiers and this is why so many died that day. Well here's a news flash for all of you.  That theory has been going around for years and this is the not the first film to suggest that.  But when it is mentioned in popcorn movies like Rambo, people just brush it off like it is just good entertainment.  But mention it in Black Hawk Down and it all of a  sudden becomes some hidden dogmatic like piece of information that we have never heard before ( let the soldiers do what they do best and all is right with the world, but once the politicians get involved, it is FUBAR). Does this sound familiar?  I think Chuck Norris even had that theory in Missing In Action.I do not really want to say to much more about this film.  It served it's purpose, especially in the wake of 911.  But it is films like this that upset the rest of the world at times because although this is an accurate depiction of what happened on the streets of Somalia, it is not a true depiction of why the U.S. was there and this is a microcosm of how sometimes the U.S. sticks it's nose into everyone elses business and how sometimes it can go wrong.  But as one of the characters in Mississppi Burning said ""Your in Mississippi now, the rest of the world don't mean s**t"".""  I'm sure that is how most Americans feel about the rest of the world.America and American's need something to feel patriotic about and this is the perfect climate to stir up those feelings of patriotism and it let's the rest of the world know that you really are the home of the brave.  I just don't know if this film is all that it is hyped to be.Ridley Scott is a masterful director and he has made a good film, but, I guess me not being American, I just have a few more questions. Look at the positive reviews on this page and look at the not so positive reviews.  Most of the reviews that praise this film are from Americans.  Most that are like mine, are from people that don't live in the U.S. and will never understand what it is like to be American.  That is not a good thing nor a bad thing, it is just what it is.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Realistic,"This movie is a factually based, and done in a way of a real life documentary.  My friend Tony told me about the book, and its pretty close to the movie.    There is a mention(very lightly) about not having heavy armor, from what Tony told me because it would look bad on CNN, and if I remember right this event cost Bill Clinton about 17 points in the polls, he would have lost the election if it was called right away.  I don't think CNN will affect foreign policy again, when they called for the US to help out a country, and Bush being ex CIA chief just wanted to convoy some food and get the hell out.  This movie shows why.  It's not a action movie I would call it more of a war/horror movie.  We see what army life is about, how well trained the special forces are, and the confusion, and horror of war.  The film is one constant feel of fear.  It was accurate, but according to Tony left  some of the grimmer parts out.  Where the troops got lost because the city has no street names, a lot of women and children died because the war lords used them as shields, and spotters.  You really feel bad for the men, and it must have been an eternity for help to arrive.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A 2 hour version of the start of Private Ryan,"I was very much alive in 1993, and yet the Mogadishu incident only comes to light in my mind now. That's the thing with these films - they highlight things that people may not be aware of or remember.My first impressions were of sheer awe (as usual) at Ridley Scott's visual control and pace, the battle scenes being among the best I've seen, easily comparable to the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan - only longer. The action was well handled, and the events accurately recreated. I have to say that the beginning was a bit timid, and felt like more of a chore to try and establish characters.The amount of work that went into recreating the battle as accurately as possible is perhaps this film's main downfall. At the beginning we are really only given faces to recognise rather than characters, and I for one couldn't remember any of the names of the guys we were watching. Eventually I just gave up and enjoyed the view. Also, had I not heard the general plot before seeing it, I might have forgotten why the marines went into the town in the first place. The dialogue was the usual, cliche ridden macho marine talk, you know, like ""Go go go!"" etc., but the brotherly nature between the soldiers is very evident. There are other war movie cliches involved, the ""Tell my kids this that and the other thing"" when a soldier's on his death bed, and the guy tending to him going ""No, you can tell them yourself, you're gonna be OK"". Of course, this scene has been done so many times with the same outcome you have to really wonder why they still do it. My final gripe is that the 'War is Hell' motif has been done to death.This is by no means a subtle film, and that can either be a strength or a weakness, depending on your point of view. I reckon that it's a strength in that it brings the reality to light of what happened in '93. I was amazed that they managed to cosily fit in some comic relief in this hellish battle. I reckon that things like that are a mark of a good director (or writer for that matter). To be able to make the audience laugh through such a serious film is quite an achievement.Overall, I would say that this is an excellent chronicle of what happened in Mogadishu, with the biting, gory reality well depicted, and shot by a master artist - Ridley Scott is a pure photographer. However, where this film succeeds as a chronicle is maybe where it fails as a movie.7 / 10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bad Intel + Poor Policy = Dead American Soldiers,"Blackhawk Down exploits the tragic events of Somalia for use as a platform to unleash some of the best extended fighting scenes of any war movie. The scenes, at times incredibly life-like, are shot with outrageous depth and scale; missiles seem to come right out at you from the background, shots of helicopters feel so close you almost feel you're there, inside, and of course, a whole lot of bloody injuries, gunshot wounds, and lost limbs to bring it all home.The reasons for why the US found itself there are presented in terse fashion, the historical component being largely set up in the opening few minutes of the film, including on-screen comments explaining the situation leading up to the loss of American lives.  After this point though, what we get is a highly stylized ""get to know the characters"" session, with a lot of male bonding and competitive angst between Army Rangers and Delta Force team members.  After thirty or fourty minutes, I feared the worst for ""Blackhawk Down"", it was looking like, despite Ridley Scott's involvement, it might seriously fall victim to the typical Bruckheimer shlock element seen in Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, etc.  I just didn't need the fluff, the male bonding-Top Gun testosterone crap.  What would have been good is a serious treatment of the political blunders and foreign policy conundrum that led up to the events.  But then, just when I let out a sigh, the fighting scenes kicked in and, almost as if the makers of BlackHawk Down knew it was precisely the right time to shift gears, I get swept up in the action.  If you've seen Private Ryan, you have some idea of what level of graphic violence Blackhawk down presents.  This film banks on its audience desiring action over answers, death of documentary, and it delivers.  Scott's direction, as usual, is fantastic.  But again, this is a film that serves as a catalyst for a war movie, the sad truth is that it really didn't matter what the historical reasons are that created the context for Blackhawk Down. Blackhawk down's war scenes could have been from any of a number of wars past and present.  Obviously, it does bring back into focus the tragedy that befell our American troops in Somalia a decade ago.  And the timing, of course, couldn't have been better.  But we really don't learn much about the real behind the scenes story of what went on back in DC, and the aftermath of the tragedy.  Now that I've seen the bloody but stylized battles of ""Blackhawk Down"", I'm hoping to see a quality documentary on this tragedy.",,Anonymous,History
"Okay, this one truly blows you !!!","Let me tell it straight- One of the greatest war movies ever created (well, read it like - greatest war movies i have ever seen).There is everything that one expects from a war movie, everything in the right mix, and of course we have somethings that many other movies don't have. The most authentic style of story telling is one among that prominent highlights. You will see that solider hit with a bullet at the most unexpected time and in the most realistic manner. And this style helps to make that emotions of the cinema go deeper into you.That wonderful script forms the strong base, in the building up of this classic. To write a screenplay upon a true WAR incident like this one, is no easy job. Well ken Nolan has done it flawlessly. And to make a movie out of it is still harder and uh... Ridely Scott has done an awesome work. The whole complexity of a military raid, involving many different troops and hundreds of soldiers,is told with great clarity (with no confusion) and simplicity. Hats off to that. The background score also worth a mentioning- it is in some unknown language (somalian?) but still sounds meaningful! The emotion, the pain, the uncertainty, the fear everything connected with a war finds a place in the movie. The emotional side to the story is also worked up quiet nicely.By the end, while the troops are shown retrieving, you see an old man crossing the roads, holding a dead kid in his hands. There is no emotion to be seen in his face. You hear a music at the background. And with the single scene you are convinced about the brutality of a war. This single scene discloses the greatness of the cinema,reveals the talents of a film maker and greatness of an art form.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"All too realistic, with some disturbing elements","No doubt about it, the battle scenes are very realistic, and the actions of the soldiers are much more realistic than the usual bunch of cliches (an obvious one was making sure weapons/vehicles were destroyed behind them).But, but...The waves of Somali soldiers (oh wait, they're not good enough to be soldiers? Died for their country/beliefs didn't they?) getting gunned down systematically was pretty sickening after a while. I kept thinking, no goal could justify this SLAUGHTER.Secondly, I thought it demonstrated very well the stupidity of the ""no one gets left behind"" philosophy. Because of that they went from (possibly) just one soldier captured, to 19 dead. Sorry, but that's how you lose battles and it plays right into the hands of anyone who knows that wounded is better than dead.Well, I'm not really saying those are bad things about the movie, just things it made me think, that I hope others would think about too.Difficult to rate this one. For realism, it would be high, but it really wasn't that great a movie, because it restricted itself just to the combat experience. 7 I think.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Sonic and Visual Masterpiece,"Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" is not just a visual spectacle but also a sonic journey that resonates with the soul. The film's soundtrack, curated masterfully, adds layers of depth to the portrayal of the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu. Hans Zimmer's score oscillates between hauntingly beautiful compositions and pulse-pounding rhythms that mirror the intensity on screen. Each track enhances the emotional gravitas, making the heartbeats of the soldiers almost palpable to the viewer.Visually, Scott's craftsmanship shines. The battle sequences are raw and immersive, juxtaposed beautifully with the evocative melodies in the background. With a stellar ensemble cast, including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, and Eric Bana, the performances are elevated by the atmospheric music that complements their on-screen struggles.While the film offers a comprehensive look at the U. S. military mission in Somalia, it leans towards a Western viewpoint. A deeper dive into the Somali perspective would have provided a more rounded narrative.Nevertheless, ""Black Hawk Down"" remains a masterpiece of both sight and sound. It captures the essence of the Battle of Mogadishu with unparalleled intensity, transporting viewers right into the heart of the conflict. The soundtrack and visuals meld seamlessly to provide an unforgettable cinematic experience. A deserving 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Don't Be Fooled,"Despite many reviews attesting to the greatness of this film and many awards and nominations it has and will receive, this movie is shallow, tawdry, Hollywood trash that profiteers off the lives of 19 American soldiers and over a thousand dead Somalians. It is no more an anti-war movie than Gladiator is an anti-Gladiator movie. I will hand it to Ridley Scott (who is English, if that matters) he has found a way to turn violence and death into Hollywood gold. He is an excellent director, and here he steals from Kurosawa's playbook using maps, diagrams, and aerials to keep the troop positions coherent, while at the same time showing the bloody chaos of war. I suspect this film will make a lot of money and will rake in the Oscars, which is sad. Aside from it's direction, it has little value. The writing and acting are poor, the film is riddled with cliches, out of place comic relief, and attempts at subtlety that beat you over the head. The subject matter has been covered much better in other films. I suggest the John Sayles film 'Men With Guns' for a better depiction of the perpetuation of violence in the third world. What bothered me most was the phony sincerity with which the film depicts death and war. Unless you enjoy seeing people get killed there is little entertainment. The film begins with a quote from Plato, which, contains more truth and depth than the entire film that follows it.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A cool action movie disguised as a war movie,"I'm pretty sure Black Hawk Down was the first war movie I ever saw not made by George Lucas. As such, it left quite the impact on me; I simply had never seen a film so raw, pulse pounding, and intense. Watching it years later, it still stands out amid a sea of films in the genre that focus on the important but tired ""war sucks"" message. While there is still some focus on that, the primary focus is on the camaraderie built between the characters, and the determination and courage under fire everyone showcases in the heat of battle to either rescues their comrades or ensure those who don't make it get proper send offs, which is much more interesting in my opinion. The characters aren't really that interesting, but the excellent performances and the genuine bond between characters make up for it.The combination of Ridley Scott as director and Jerry Bruckheimer as producer delivers pretty much exactly what you expect: a heart stopping non-stop action extravaganza. Granted, the action doesn't start until almost forty minutes in, but when it does, it doesn't stop until the end and just keeps amping up the stakes, tension, and brutality of the situation. The camerawork and editing are fast paced and frenetic, but never to the point where it's hard to follow, and it does a great job of allowing the audience to keep track of where everyone is at. There are plenty of shocking moments, like Orlando Bloom falling from the helicopter, and plenty of heck yeah moments, like them getting hold of the giant missile launcher. One thing I didn't care for, though, was the overly filtered lighting that makes all the colors look garish and ugly. This is sadly a trademark of Bruckheimer's films, even the good ones.Overall, Black Hawk Down is a very fun, very heart pounding film that, for people like me who may be tired of the formula of these films, is a breath of fresh air. It's not quite Saving Private Ryan level, but for what it is, it's an easy recommendation.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"For being a captivating story, the movie was boring","I was somewhat familiar with US activities in Somalia before watching this movie, so I was ready to enjoy it as a historical drama.  However, I found myself to be bored throughout this film.First, and perhaps most importantly, I just didn't care about the characters.  By the end of the film, I couldn't tell you what their names were; only who the actors were that played them.  In short, I didn't care if they lived or died.  Sure, as an American, I didn't want to see the soldiers die, but as a moviegoer, I didn't buy into it.Second, I was disappointed by the lack of any cohesive story going through. Being familiar with the history of the event, I knew what the overall goals were for each team that was on the ground and in the air, but my friend who was watching it with me was totally confused throughout the movie.  Perhaps this was done to portray the ""fog of war,"" but to my friend, it looked like the whole movie was a bunch of people shooting for no reason, and going nowhere.Finally, why did they not elaborate on and finish the story of Durant, the helicopter pilot who was captured by the Somali's?

"Big budget, small script.","A good war movie can be one of the most moving and involving experiences of a movie lovers life. Nothing can quite encapsulate a male's need for violence, patriotism and comradery as a good 2 hours of explosions and war induced brotherhood.Black Hawk Down unfortunately is NOT one of these movies. What, in the the first 20 minutes, starts as a promising illustration of western might and morality overcoming an evil third world dictatorship, turns into two and a half hours of unengaging battle and bland characters.None of the large and talented cast are given enough screen time to truly shine (and even though I am a huge Ewen McGregor fan, his accent was laughable). It is this lack of individual screen time that leaves the audience feeling detached from the actors and ultimately not caring what happens to them.The film is not without its touching scenes however, and the direction is so fast paced that you are left no time to be bored. Overall an alright movie that could have been SO much more. Do yourself a favor, read the book instead.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Blackhawk Down Left Me Speechless,"After watching this movie I was in a daze for about a 1/2 hour. So graphic, so real, so tragic. I had seen Saving Private Ryan and I was shook up by that movie but I rationalized well, that was a Great War...past...out of sight, out of mind...not real.But when I saw Black Hawk Down I thought, wow so this is what war is really like. Brothers in arms, dying in each others arms. Professionals (like the Delta operators), wanting to do a good job and sometimes failing and sometimes paying the ultimate price...On another level, I can say that I admire these young men (and some old ones there too!) for fighting proficiently while being out numbered, surrounded, cut off and in a seemingly hopeless fix. Especially I will always remember Sgts. Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon for their bravery and professionalism. If I was the downed pilot I cannot think of the emotions I would have felt if these two guys came to stand by me and possibly die with me.To me the question being raised by this movie is not ""Do we avoid situations like this in the future?"" but ""How do we do it right next time?"". I recommend it most highly!",10.0,Anonymous,History
brutally realistic battle,"Ridley Scott once more shows that he is the ultimate director to stage-manage a battle of this scale. Don't expect an elaborate story, the few story telling elements are limited to the usual war movie sapiences such as : ""war is a bad thing"", ""don't mess with things you don't understand"" and ""we leave no man behind"". Don't expect either any critical reflection about the motifs or the moral side of this conflict and the dealing with it, you will simply be disappointed. You will get two hours of impressive, brutal, bloody, funny, messy, (in the end unnerving), loud, stupid, nerve-racking battle-, war - and fight sequences that make ""Saving Private Ryan"" look like a Disney-film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
American Military Propaganda,"Another movie about another ""Vietnam"" type of war. This time it is in Somalia and US GIs are getting wiped off by civilian soldiers from Africa.Lots of shooting. As usual US soldiers are depicted as the nice guys while Somalia people are the badies. But the scenario doesn't go very far and one has no idea why this war (genocide ?) is being fought. What are the political reasons behind that ? What is the real reason of the presence of the US in Somalia ? The only conclusion that can be made is that they leave very soon after this 'battle' (probably because there was no oil to exploit).The movie is well filmed and actors are doing a good job, there is no denying that, but this is not sufficient to make a good movie. Indeed, the story is too superficial with more shooting than anything else. So much shooting that one is looking forward to the end ASAP.As such and in the current context of the Afghanistan bombing this movie looks more like a propaganda movie to rally American public opinion and shows that if the US weren't there the world will be out of control. It also shows the stupidity of war and how expandable human lives are.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Considered by combat veterans to be the most accurate war film,"Firstly I can NOT believe that some of the silly haters here are complain the the cast is all male. It is set in 1993, and the US order of battle has rangers and even more élite troops. In 1993 that is going to be all male.
Then we have ignorant complaints here about the Pakistani troops not hihglighted. Well Operation Restore Hope in Mogadishu had a series of battles and incidents, and the ""Black Hawk Down"" incident was the result of the US being asked by the Pakistanis to help after 20 or so of their solders were killed in an ambush by Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The film does not pretend to tell the whole back and forth of all the battles but specifically and only the Oct 3-4 part of Gothic Spear op. Lastly a few deluded PC people are whining the film is racist, because, well Somalis are, well, Somali looking. That is absurd.",,Anonymous,History
"Lavish Jerry Bruckheimer production with all-star cast recreating in cruel detail the Mogadishu battle, 1993","This misadventure deals with American Delta Force and rangers undergoing a dangerous mission in Mogadishu, Somalia 1993, in a contradictory and complex political context and under command a general played by Sam Shepard . Troops transported by helicopters under command of officers (Jason Isaacs, Zeljko Ivanek), sub-officers (Josh Harnett, Eric Bana Tom Sizemore, Kim Coates) and numerous soldiers (Ewan McGregor, Orlando Bloom, Ron Eldard, Ewen Bremmer, Jeremy Piven, among others)descend on a fortress to snatch underlings in General Aidid's clan. But the disastrous assignment during 15 hours turned out to be a flop in the deaths of eighteen US soldiers and by hundred African rebels. This is an accurate portrayal, second-by-second , of the bloody bath of the Black Sea battle.Ridley Scott helped immeasurably by superb cameraman Idziak and an excellent creative team has created the ultimate vision of war as hell on earth, a nightmarish firefight, winning deservedly Academy Award for Film Editing and Sound. Stirring and emotion of the film is aided by an exciting musical score by the master Hans Zimmer. Conventional elements in the screenplay as heroism, comradeship, are based on a story devoid of sentimentality by Mark Bowden and balanced by a genuinely complex examination of courage in the field. It is overpowered by one of the most relentlessly and realistic harrowing war footage ever committed to a fiction film. This credible , accomplished motion picture about the dramatization of the famous disaster is perfectly directed by Ridley Scott as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film(Gladiator) and others(Someone to watch over me, Blade runner,Duelists , Legend) in which his visual style is impressive. Rating : Very good, above average and not for the faint of heart, for that reason ¨Black Hawk down ¨ results to be an extraordinary work by Ridley Scott.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Riveting action with actors that look the same,"Blackhawk Down.By the sound of the title you probably think it's a movie about some Native American tribe fighting the cavalry or something else. But it's about American soldiers unexpectedly fighting endless hordes of armed local people in Somalia.On October 3, 1993 a group of elite soldiers consisting of the top secret Delta Force, Rangers and the 160th SOAR helicopter squadron conducted their mission of capturing Mohd. Farrah Aidid's important people in Mogadishu, the capital city of (if there is a capital) Somalia. The fighting was supposed to have lasted only an hour, but two choppers (well, in reality four but the other two made it back) were shot down and the escape vehicles they were supposed to use got lost. They had to stay over for the night and got 19 men killed in action.If you have read Mark Bowden's book of the same title, you probably have a general idea of what the fighting is like and what the city is like. And Ridley Scott managed to visualize it in such manner that the scenes are pretty much exactly like you pictured. Except for the first helicopter crash site, which is very wrong.The cast is pretty good, especially Tom Sizemore who is always natural in a uniform. But it is the ensemble which stood out. If you look for individual performances, you may be disappointed.If you haven't read the book you're probably confused with the characters under fire. You can only recognize them by the names on their helmets, but not all of them put their names on it. You'll probably have trouble putting names on faces, but as the story rolls it can be overlooked.The movie shows a lot about the US Army elite units, the camaraderie within them, the rivalry between them, and their relatively new creed, which is ""leave no man behind"". I take it this is born after the experiences of Vietnam...All in all, this is a good movie especially that it is based on a true story. I have been interested in US special units, and after watching this I grew more respect for them. You probably will too. Go see it, it's worth every penny.7 out 10 stars for matching this readers' visualizations and -3 stars for discrepancies in reality.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Sweeping, gutsy, eloquent, astonishing, moving...yeah","Black Hawk Down (2001)As much as this is a nerve-wracking, non-stop, high intensity war film that leaves you exhausted, you know that this is barely a whisper of a hint of the skim of the real thing, being there, being shot at and shooting, facing death on both sides.But what this means more than anything is the movie comes as close as a normal movie can to the intensity of being there. Black Hawk Down is a director's nightmare, and Ridley Scott pulls it off, minute after minute, with lucidity. When the layering of images, the pace, and and the kinetic motion of the camera seem overwhelming, Scott (and his crew, notably Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and Italian editor Pietro Scalia) make this completely absorbing and sensible. The cutting and the multitude of images interwoven for scene after scene would overwhelm most people, but there is becomes poetic and logical without ever becoming easy.The acting? It sometimes seems to tip toward a hyped up, grand version of archetypes that we know and sometimes expect in war movies, but each of the many main men are intensely believable and realized. The music, too, might threaten to be manipulative, but it never draws attention to itself. And so on. Meaning only that this is a Hollywood movie, for sure, but a really really good one. It plays up the cinematic drama that makes movies movies (and not documentaries) but it is so thoughtfully and artistically considered, it rises above.Is it a masterpiece? Well, it lacks what you might call utter originality or invention, or even insight. When you finish, you sigh with relief that you've survived, but there is no inner searching left to do. This is partly because this is the truth of war, based on real events. And it's intention is to submerse you in that world, and hold your head under until you are screaming for air.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Favorite War Movie,"I just want to weigh in on a few issues...Lots of people are giving 1 star because the movie, based on a true story, skipped some historical context. First of all, show me a ""based on a true story"" without spin; good luck finding one. But moreover, many commenters seemed to leap to the conclusion that due to its absence this film tacitly supported US actions and that US could do no wrong. That's a very different film than I saw which depicted a blundering general feigning sophistication. If you're of this mindset, I challenge you to consider what people would say if the Somali militias were made to be the heroes. Do you think the US was there for no reason at all? They just showed up and started bombing everyone? Of course not, there's a whole long chain of cause and effect, and the fact that the writers selected a particular point in time because they thought it would make the most compelling movie doesn't make them blameworthy for not cataloguing the totality of human history. Moreover, there's nothing particularly nationalistic about this movie. Everyone is acting based on necessity, not some kind of patriotic urge. The mission is about rescuing a downed pilot and the perils involved with that mission. There really isn't any flag-waving, very little back- patting (and what there is doesn't last long) and no discussion about the enemy being barbarians or whatever else other reviews would have you believe. The Somalis were very adamant about fighting off the American intruders, but they weren't depicted as fighting each other, looting, pillaging, raping or anything else like that. Nor was there ever a time where waves and waves of them were being mowed down, and if anything, given the resources depicted in the film, they acted quite cohesively and effectively for a poor militia against the greatest military in the world. You might want to check your own assumptions before saying they were like barbarians or savages or whatever.I also don't agree with users who think the characters were shallow. The characters were not all cookie-cutter facsimiles of each other. Josh Hartnett was a green platoon leader, sympathetic to the locals in the face of jocular ridicule from most of his platoon. The Captain was a stubborn SOP junkie with ridiculous sports metaphors, the general, as mentioned feigned sophistication, cracked jokes in the TOC, and ultimately came to understand the consequences of his actions, Tom Sizemore was a fantastic gung-ho major (I think) with some of the my favorite one-liners (""Nothing takes 5 minutes!""), Orlando Bloom was a wet-behind the ears nervous, anxious newbie hoping to prove himself, Tom Hardy was just trying to make it through, Ewan McGregor was resentful of his lot in the army and then jumped on the opportunity to be all he could be, and on and on. Moreover, if you've actually served in the army, you'd know that most of these guys are basically kids and don't really have much character chiseled into them yet. As a veteran, it FELT like they were soldiers. When they were prepping for the mission, ribbing each other, and generally chewing the fat, THAT was where it was MOST real to me. I can't attest to the combat because we never had an engagement of this magnitude in Iraq (mostly chasing snipers and dodging rockets, mortars and IEDs), but the characterization of the soldiers was spot on. It also made a lot more sense that the general and the major had the most depth, the special forces guys (who were obviously older) had some gravitas to them, and the rangers were mostly nervous, youthful and similar.So if you buy all that, then even the detractors admit that the acting, directing, production, sound, etc. were all amazing. I'm not a huge war buff, but I've seen a healthy share, and for me this tops them all. I prefer it over Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Heartbreak Ridge, American Sniper, Full Metal Jacket, Zero Dark Thirty, We Were Soldiers, Three Kings, and slightly but surely even over Hurt Locker and Glory. I think Jarhead is comparable in terms of realism, but that's not really a war movie. Hope this was useful!",10.0,Anonymous,History
My least favorite war movie ever.,My least favorite war movie ever. Well I sympathize with all the soldiers who fought and died in Somalia. It was a worldwide conflict in 1992 I get it. With so many great actors in this movie's story plot is horrendous. All there is is a bunch of action sequences with fights and gun fights. Obviously ridley Scott is great at doing movies like gladiator and bodies of lies. But a movie like Black Hawk down just doesn't do it for me. It's like watching Armageddon except a military movie. Just because call of duty modern warfare copied every scene in this movie I don't think it's that good.,6.0,Anonymous,History
A movie of wishes,"Whilst this is an undoubtedly well made film which gets into the heart of battle in the same way the opening to Private Ryan does, it is spoilt only by the insertion of far too many ""gung-ho/emotional"" comments from the soldiers themselves. A kind of Oprah Goes To War.The simplistic heavy-handed way in which American forces fight is shown (and the consequences thereof) but despite the way in which the film tries to turn around the mistakes it does leave them in a bad light. The shouting, the poor training, the mistakes and wrong decisions are all displayed.The final credits begin with a display of the name of 19 soldiers killed in the event. It also mentions in passing the 1,000 Somalians who died and it is typical of the film that they are anonymous and far, far less important. Americans are worth more than Africans it seems.",6.0,Anonymous,History
good action movie,"It is an action-war movie. Unlike the other war movies such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line or Platoon, Black Hawk Down focuses on short period of the modern war in Somalia. Instead of the essential character building sequences, movie starts with the action and never it stops.In the movie sound effects and cgi effects are outstanding. the movie has also a powerful editing style which creates very realistic and intense feel its audience.Amazing cinematography, great direction style and atmosphere are also important elements for the movie.Technically, Black Hawk Down is a good movie. Scenes perfectly manage to give realistic impression of the soldiers. But I believe that the real victims of war, civilians, more important than two or three American soldier's life. In addition, all Somali soldiers are shown as ruthless killers and the Americans are shown more humanitarian.In that point of view, Black Hawk Down loses its point as a war movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"""Saving Private Ryan"" in Somalia.","This movie uses the exact same gritty style as used in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I don't mind it, I welcome it! For me it's wonderful to see that ""Saving Private Ryan"" set a whole new trend for war movies.Just like in ""Saving Private Ryan"" this movie tries to shock the audience, sometimes it succeeds but sometimes it also simply fails because the movie tries to hard to shock with as a result that some scene's feel forced. The characters and the event fail to get me emotionally involved, so for me this movie is more successful as an action than it is as a war movie.Like many more people my major complaint is the use of characters. They really stay just uniforms with persons in it for me. I have a hard time to remember all of the names mainly because of that they all look the same to me. The only one's I can tell apart are the one's that are played by famous actors (Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Jason Isaacs, Ewan McGregor etc.) I really couldn't feel for any of the characters, also thanks to it that there are some over-dramatized scene's involving some of them that just don't work for me.I was also told by a Somalian friend of mine that the presentation of Mogadishu is not completely fair. The real Mogadishu is much more modern. He also of course complaint that none of the Somali's in the movie spoke actual Somalian. But this are of course simply things that wouldn't bother any of the ""normal"" viewers.I admit that I expected very little from Josh Hartnett after seeing ""Pearl Harbor"" but I was wrong to do so, he actually can act! It's too bad that some of the other actors are miscast such as Jason Isaacs and Orlando Bloom but biggest miscast was Ewan McGregor. He and his character really felt out of place.I'm beginning to sound extremely negative about this movie, while in fact it is far from bad!The action really is top class!

Among top tier war movies,Nice shot and pretty accurate war movie that leaves you breathless. Some shots are traumatizing and hardly to watch. Ridley knows how to make a spectalcular movie.

Black Hawk Down sucks! What?,"Black Hawk Down is a great movie. It has remarkable special effects, awesome cinematography, etc. Although it is small, there is one problem with the film which is that it is difficult to keep the characters straight.

It will not disappoint you. However, if you a part of the large community of people who enjoy character development, this movie is not for you.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Fine, but not as clever as it might think it is.","Despite the ensemble cast, there are only a couple of interesting characters here, mainly the ones whom the film spares time to focus on. Eversmann is the obvious protagonist, a reluctant leader who keeps morale up but feels guilty when some of his men die. There's also Grimes, who can feel overly comedic at times, but it's nice to see him grow from the out-of-his-depth coffee boy to a reliable team member. Most (not all, but most) of the others are recognisable only because their name is scrawled on their helmet, so really this is a movie about the situation, not the characters.It's pretty detailed in that regard. The jargon-heavy dialogue and cold radio chatter set the tone, and there are some very memorable moments like when Blackburn falls from the helicopter or when Othic pockets a severed hand he finds on the ground (the movie literally pauses for a second in surprise at that one, which is a nice touch of editing). It's a shame that so much of the runtime is people shooting at each other, which lost my interest when it wasn't moving the characters along through the plot.The score blends typical elements like synthesisers and drums with traditional African choruses and instruments, which is cool, though some of the guitar-driven rock music would feel more at home in a video game cutscene. Visually, there are lots of sickly greens making the very environment look unwelcoming, but the cinematography isn't too memorable otherwise, and there's too much headache-inducing editing and camerawork. The soundscape, overall, is very nicely designed.Repeated throughout is the message that ""no man gets left behind"", but that patriotic sentiment is contrasted with horrific injury detail (poorly imitating ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998)?), as well as dialogue from Somali characters criticising the Americans for getting involved in their civil war. It all feels like an effort to mask the otherwise nakedly patriotic portrayal of Americans and unsympathetic portrayal of Somalis, whose militia come across like a savage horde of zombies. I do like the symbolism of Garrison mopping up blood in the hospital.I guess you're supposed to come out of this film feeling like you've just witnessed a tale of true camaraderie, but to me it felt more like the tale of a cock-up of American interventionism. It's mostly well-made, but it's not as heady or insightful as it thinks it is.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History

great battle scenes; wafer-thin characters,"In October 1993, Americans watching their TV sets at home were shocked to see the bodies of a handful of American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia.  What had begun as an effort to bring humanitarian relief to that war-torn country almost a year earlier had somehow turned into a political quagmire out of which it was becoming more and more difficult for the U.S. forces to extricate themselves.  `Black Hawk Down' is Ridley Scott's nightmarish vision of that fateful day when the mission turned suddenly and hopelessly wrong.Based on the novel by Mark Bowden, `Black Hawk Down' is a technically astonishing look into the savagery and horror of modern day warfare.  Rarely have the resources of filmmaking been used so effectively in conveying the intensity and brutality of life in a combat zone.  It's small wonder that the film received Academy Awards for its extraordinary editing and sound. Using every technical trick at his disposal, Scott has managed to plunge us right into the heart of the action, making us feel every explosion and hear every bullet as it goes whizzing past.  Like the characters, we often find ourselves disoriented by the confusion of the scene, yet Scott also manages to keep the action geographically coherent most of the time.  This he does by providing aerial views of the scene that let us know where the men are in relation to their surroundings.What Scott is not able to do quite so well is to keep the characters themselves sufficiently differentiated to make them matter as much to the viewer as they probably should.  We tend to lose the men in the mass of confusion, with each character looking pretty much like the next and being afforded very little opportunity to step to the forefront of  this massive canvas and distinguish himself.  In all fairness to the filmmakers here, one should note that this seems to be a trait peculiarly endemic to war films in general (the fact that combatants are all dressed alike doesn't help this situation much either).  In the last decade or so, special effects artists have come so far in being able to recreate the graphic realism of the battlefield setting that writers no longer feel the need to provide much in the way of characterization to go along with the action scenes.  More and more the fight sequences are being asked to carry these pictures alone. This was the case with the recent `We Were Soldiers' and it is the case here as well.  Perhaps because of the nature of the true-life events being depicted here, Scott felt no need to ease up on the accelerator much in getting his story told.  However, we do feel as if it would be nice to be able to distinguish his characters from one another and to get to know them a bit on a personal level.  In a way, one appreciates the fact that the filmmakers have chosen to feature less well known actors in most of the roles.  That heightens the realism factor since we don't feel as if we are watching movie stars playing the part of common soldiers.  In that respect, the anonymity works well.  Yet, I wonder if using familiar faces might not have helped a bit in allowing us to focus better on the characters as individuals, permitting us to catch our bearings a little more frequently so that we might be better able to distinguish who is who at all times.This is not to say that `Black Hawk Down' does not provide a number of emotionally stirring moments throughout, particularly as we see the young men dying heroic deaths.   Even given the minimal dialogue and character development, we do come to understand the sense of camaraderie that drives these brave men to do what they do.As a result of this imbalance between the dazzling special effects and the wafer-thin characters, `Black Hawk Down' is a great technical triumph but a less-than-great (though still damn good) film overall.",,Anonymous,History
The Best War Film Since Saving Private Ryan,"Black Hawk Down is one of the best war films ever made. It is intense, action packed, and disturbing. Set midst the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, Black Hawk Down follows 39 U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force Operatives through their fight against the Somalian militants. Black Hawk Down boasts a fantastic cast which includes the likes of Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, Jason Issacs, Ewan McGregor and others. It also hosts many future stars such as Orlando Bloom, Hugh Dancy, Tom Hardy, and Ty Burrell. Their performances were very good, but the real star here is the fantastic direction of Ridley Scott. His atmospheric style is in full effect here and it provides unrivaled intensity. No movie will be able to immerse its audience into its action as well as Black Hawk Down until Gravity in 2013. Adding to this immersion and intensity is Hans Zimmer's fantastic score which resonates the setting and themes of the movie. For as visually stunning as Black Hawk Down is, it lacks character development. This however is expected with so many characters and so many stories to follow. This negative is not enough to warrant giving Black Hawk Down anything less than a ten. It is an experience that very few other movies can rival.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Superficial Shoot-'em-Up,"I went to ""Black Hawk Down"" mostly for the line-up of hunks, and it had even more than the highly advertised ones, including Sam Shepherd as the grizzled general and a bunch of guys who I recognized late in the film, such as Ron Eldard and Jeremy Piven, and some whose names I only recognized in the credits.Ewan MacGregor was on screen for a few minutes and director Ridley Scott should have yelled ""Cut!"" when his English accent painfully came through, but as a Brit himself I guess he didn't notice.Eric Bana kept his Ozzie accent under control after awhile (and I wonder if his character, one of the few memorable ones, was the guy who we are told at the end is now in jail for severe wife abuse or if I'm projecting from his staggeringly violent role in ""Chopper"".)But this is no ogle-fest: it's a problem that the guys are completely unrecognizable as I simply couldn't keep anybody straight, especially once they put their helmets on and the shooting started. Couldn't they have bent reality a bit more and given each primary character different, non-buzz-cut hair cuts? Or at least have a few more with their names on their shirts or helmets? ""Band of Brothers"" was easier to follow than this troupe, like ""Thin Red Line"" as well.While many critics have complained about the short shrift given Somalis and overall tactics and strategy, what I thought was even more of a problem was the Army's blithe neglect that these guys are not trained to counter urban guerrilla action. Maybe riot cops would have been better prepared, or maybe that's the future of peacekeeping actions that needs to be prepared for.And all the laser gizmos can't replace understanding of local politics. There's fleeting reminders when we suddenly see a schoolteacher huddling to protect her students and a father/son attack team.This is mostly just a shoot-em-up. Lots and lots of shooting.

A Great War Film but one not based on facts,"The battle depicted in the film is a superbly done heroic depiction. However, as stated somewhere here on the film's web page, Scott nearly did not get the Black Hawks he wanted from the Defense Dept. because they feared the story would not be favorable to them -- and the truth is they had a lot to be worried about. Our incursion into Somalia was not based on helping the hungry people get the food they deserved. Once again, we were trying to interfere with the internal politics of a foreign country, were seen as unwanted interlopers, and thus were treated with contempt by the locals. This is not to take away from the incredibly brave men who gave their lives. Eric Bana's character ""Hoot"" sums it up when he tells the Josh Hartnett character that he is simply fighting for the man next to him and not any political idealism.The fact is we (the U.S.) was very interested in Somalia's oil reserves and its strategic location in proximity to the Middle East. You have to ask yourself if we were being so heroic why was the entire city against us? Hmmmm.The film is a great example of how Hollywood promotes propaganda by offering undeniably touching screen heroics as a distraction from failed foreign policies. That was why the Pentagon almost withheld the Black Hawk choppers, equipment that is ironically named after a race our military committed genocide against to the point of wiping them off the map.For additional context read an on line article by Allison Kilkenny,""Al-Barakaat: The Little Charity That Could Have Saved Somalia""at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ allison-kilkenny/ al-barakaat-the-little-ch_b_204270.html.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Black and White (5/10),"(I saw this in the theater, YMMV)I had heard how great this film was, that some people called it the greatest war film ever.  Although I knew that was very unlikely to be true, I was shocked at how bad this movie was.The first, and largest, problem is the latent racism of the movie.  As has been pointed out numerous times there is a creepy racist feel about the film as wholesome, All-American white boys mow down savage, thoughtless black men.  Not a single Somali is portrayed with any depth.  Adid and his followers are relegated to props for the army to shoot.  It is difficult to appreciate this point without seeing the movie.The next problem is supposed to be it's strong point.  The violence is so stylized, it has no depth.  I never felt anything for any of the characters. For one thing, except for Tom Sizemore and Ewan McGregor, I had a difficult time telling the actors apart once they were covered in blood and grime.  In addition, I never felt the frustration of the soldiers as they struggled to find the crash site.  There was just one firefight after another.  One part of the movie that does work is when two army snipers make a request to guard the wounded pilots of the second Blackhawk helicopter crash (erm, yes there are two Blackhawks that go down).Finally, the script is just bad.  This movie jerks the ""get the boys out"" and the ""leave no man behind"" chains throughout the entire movie.  In the few parts of the movie where nobody is shooting at something, the writing is so corny it's painful.Skip this movie.  There are much better war films to rent.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Best modern day War film.,"Fantastic movie that attracts you to the characters and into the battle with great realistic scenes!.There are some really memorable moments in this movie for me, like with the choppers flying over the ocean or with Smith dying on the table after his mates couldn't save him or even when the the young kid sprays down his father by mistake, small things that stick with me like this are rare. A lot of modern day war films really fail to capture what this does. Absolute masterpiece!The soundtrack was another thing that really made this movie for me. Hans Zimmer done a great job... as always .Great Acting, Great realistic battles, Fantastic soundtrack!.

Masterpiece,"This is the best war film since Coppla's Apocalypse Now.  Take the first 35 minutes of Saving Private Ryan (the only truly great sequence in that film) and multiple it by 100 for 2 hours, and you have Black Hawk Down.  The film isn't trying to develop characters, because it isn't needed.  The film isn't trying to explain the politics of the situation, because half the soldiers there didn't even know what was going on.  The film is simply there to put an audience right in the middle of a combat zone, and it succeeds where no other film has.  This film is unforgettable.  Ridley Scott has conquered yet another genre.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The best and most realistic war movie ever made.,"As you may know already, this movie is based on facts. A faction of Somali militia that was hostile to foreign presence in Mogadishu murdered 24 UN peace-keepers. The starvation would kill 200,000 people.The UN could only call for help to the USA, and at that time, Bill Clinton sent US Special Forces like Rangers, Delta Force and Navy SEALs to capture the leaders of the hostile militia.When the US General Garrison had reliable information about Mohamed Farrah Aidid local allies' location, American soldiers went for them.In the most brilliant direction work, Ridley Scott portrays a band of brothers overwhelmingly outnumbered, who end up fighting for life in the worst moments of the raid.When you watch this movie, you cannot avoid feeling a deep connection to those young men, who keep heading forward to complete the job. Every detail in this movie is awesome. There's a time when you realize what heroism means- I'm talking about Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon. These two brave men payed the ultimate sacrifice just trying to rescue a pilot who's chopper crashed in a hostile area. They made it- Mike Durant, the pilot, is alive today. This is what I call American heroism.After watching this movie I was speechless, stunned. Now, I respect more than ever American servicemen. Thankyou for all the good causes you have been fighting everywhere.",,Anonymous,History

the comradeship is so real.,"i agree with you. special forces all over the world is a brave kind. I'm in the Norwegian army (most people laugh at me when i say that, because they don't think Norway got an army), and I'm a Sergeant in a mountain/MOUT special unit. last year, we helped to train US NAVY SEALS in winter combat. they are a good bunch. and they showed us some desert tricks in the summer. we soldiers have a special bond. i hate when people hate a nation because of their military. eg : they like when a US soldier gets blown up in Iraqi, because they have seen that damn Moore movie. that *beep* pisses me off. its not the soldiers fault. you cant hate a whole nation because of the choices the leaders make. all my respect goes to squad, my TMB brothers in Iraqi, Afghanistan and the Balkans. i myself joined the army when i was 17 and a half. we got a non voluntarily military in Norway, and i joined a half year before, because my life was *beep* after one year i made it to special forces, i served six months clearing caves in Afghanistan in the mountains. its all about the comradeship. i almost started to cry when i watched black hawk down. its my favorite movie for sure. it may sound silly to you guys, but you wouldn't know before you experience how *beep* war really can be. last time i heard it still *beep* down in Afghanistan. i hope I'm not going back. but if i get the call. i wouldn't even hesitate. the delta force guys did a good job down there. the same as i did. make peace in a shattered country. helping others. what other non selfish acts are there? give 10$ to World food programme and actually think your doing any difference to the world? thats so naive. the ones that makes the big sacrifices helps others. not the ones on the bench watching. so this movies feels real in that way. you can feel the sacrifice in your bones. at least i did. my tears go to the heroes of all soldiers around the world. the ones that made it, the ones that will be remembered and the ones that suffered for the peace of all their neighbors.best regards Jannie",10.0,Anonymous,History
Sweeping but small in scope at the same time,"I have one problem with ""Black Hawk Down"", and that is that it spreads itself a bit too thin. There are a LOT of characters in this movie, and while some of them do get fairly deep motivations and backstories, by the end of the film, I still had difficulty telling them apart. So if this review is light on specific character names, I want you to know why. Part of the difficulty of making a movie about a real-life story is figuring out just how accurate you can make it without losing the audience. For the most part, this film succeeds.Ridley Scott is a brilliant technical director and visual stylist. He knows how to stage action that is thrilling without being glamorous (can you imagine what Michael Bay would have done to this material?), and the editing and sound on this film are absolutely spectacular. The film deals with a failed U.S. military raid on a Somalian warlord who was preventing U.N. food shipments from reaching the poor and the needy. The time frame of the film is only a few days (I think), and that lends the whole movie a you-are-there quality that is essential to this kind of storytelling.There are a lot of recognizable faces in this film, but this is not a star-driven movie. Josh Hartnett gives just what is probably his best performance ever as an idealistic young squad leader. Ewan McGregor plays a glorified secretary who gets promoted to a proper foot soldier when the crap hits the fan. Tom Sizemore plays a no-nonsense commander who gradually watches the whole mission fail from a distance. Eric Bana shines as a seasoned soldier who, to some, seems to take almost too much pleasure in his work. Rounding out the cast are plenty of other talented people: Tom Hardy, Jason Isaacs, Ewen Bremner, Sam Shepard, William Fichtner, and more.This is a film that shines in its little moments. One soldier fires his gun too close to another's head, deafening him. Another steals through an occupied house where a mother sits huddled with her children to get away from the fighting on the street. A donkey wanders through dangerous territory, still hitched to a wagon. This is not the deepest war movie I've ever seen, but it makes its points with a relative minimum of speechifying and jingoism. (There are a few of those moments later on, but they feel mostly earned.) It stands up to repeat viewings, too, which is kind of rare for a movie based on real events.There are moments where I wish this film had dug a little deeper under its characters' skin, but then again, it might have sacrificed tension in doing so. And if there's one thing that this movie is, it's gripping. I was not in the least surprised to hear ""The Minstrel Boy"" over the end credits. That song sums up the movie fairly well.",7.0,Anonymous,History
this is what war is like,"Black Hawk Down really surprised me. No, it shocked me. I expected the usual patriotic we're-heroes-and-we-love-it stuff, but I was wrong. BHD tells the story from the soldiers point of view, how they suffer, how they are overrun and how they die. We get to see everything, whether it's Jamie bleeding to death, a dying Ruiz telling Captain Steele not go out without him or the horror in Eversman's eyes when he sees the Black Hawk going down. Through all the bullets and blood the film is asking: well what did you expect? This is what war is like. And in combat not everything goes the way it's supposed to go (they actually can't find the right way). Other movies give the impression that soldiers are no human being, like they don't have feeling, they are never scared and so on. But the nervousness shortly before the mission starts corrects that. The scene in which Blackburn falls out of the helicopter is a good example that even the excellent training can't prevent mistakes from happening. No supermen in the army, ""just"" normal people.The film is not into politics and this is what makes it so incredibly good. Like Hoot says ""once the first bullet goes past your head, the politics go right out of the window"". And once the first bullet goes past our head (you really get the feeling you're standing in Mog) we stop thinking about whether it was wrong or right or too late to send troops to Somalia. During the film this is only background information, but as soon as it is over, the knowledge of the fact that this really happened and that even the names of the characters are authentic comes back with all force.You want to see a good, believable war movie? Watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good action and not much else.,"There is a trope for which American action movies have become infamous: white main character guns down a legion of faceless incompetent enemies, usually of non-white variety. The main character will be given some great cause as an excuse to kill all those people. Black Hawk Down has good action and presentation, but it is also a textbook example of that type of movie. I am not complaining. These kinds of movies are fun. But it seems that Black Hawk Down presents itself as being something more than that, and I don't think that it is.The movie opens with a message about Mohamed Adid using hunger as a tool of terror (Somali Civil War from 1990s), but the struggle of the local people and the mission at hand is just an excuse for our gun toting heroes to shoot some stuff. Once introduced, that setting has little to no significance. The rest of the film comprises of hostile situations in which the US soldiers find themselves and shoot their way out of. Towards the end there is an attempt at some message about brotherhood. It rings incredibly hollow.In the real battle of Mogadishu this movie is based on, the US operatives were supported by the foreign UNOSOM troops from Malaysia and Pakistan. This is a good opportunity if you want to explore the theme of brotherhood, but the movie doesn't incorporate it.There is a scene in this film where the US soldiers are surrounded by a group of Africans and these locals are jumping backward and forward, angry and loud. They are made to look like a bunch of incoherent gorillas or pack of hungry rabid dogs, as the cornered US soldier bravely defends himself. That's what this movie is actually all about.The cinematography is raw, chaotic, and most importantly, so very cool. Helicopters land almost on your head, with every possible angle and viewpoint being utilized, including from outer space. The smoke and dirty textures come at you through the screen. Everything's on fire and rockets are flying around, captured with shaky cam for extra realism. The film has a characteristic look of black silhouettes against the yellow dusty background of Mogadishu, which computer games and other movies have since tried to copy.The presentation is made all the more effective thanks to Hans Zimmer's score. The action music has Arabic influence but also has some Western distorted guitar mixed in. The sorrowful singing of Baaba Maal, Denez Prigent and Lisa Gerard tcuts into your soul and breathes life into the score.There is a load of high-grade actors in this film, which seems to be in line with other big war movie productions like the Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan. This shows the movie's aspiration, except Black Hawk Down lacks the same epic setting and themes as those other war movies have. Therefore, the value of these actors is questionable when they spend so much of the movie's time covered in helmets, goggles and dust while shooting at things instead of talking, and when they do talk, they are just yelling out army lingo or mission-related information.Black Hawk Down is pretty good action movie, as long as you do not expect it to be more than an extended male-dominated gun fight.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"A 6/10, but that doesn't mean I hate it","Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" is a rather brutal and unrelenting war film.  It certainly does paint a realistic view of soldiers in battle.  I don't know how much the film remains faithful to the book, so I won't bother with a grievous comparison.  This is not Ridley Scott's best film; that credit really goes to ""Gladiator"".  It has some really good isolated moments, but none that really are spectacular.  But I want to point out some things, both good and bad.1) I personally do not think that this film glorifies war since as one previous viewer already mentioned, it shows horrible things happening to both American soldiers and Somalis.  A soldier is blown in half, a Somali person is shot dead in the street while a child frantically tries to figure out what happened, another Somali is blown apart by a stray rocket, and an American soldier is killed when he's impaled by a rocket.  So you see, it's horrific, unrelenting war.2) I do not consider this to be by no means an excellent war film, but an endlessly watchable one; Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is clearly the greatest war film ever made.3) The British actors who are trying to speak American.  I'm sorry, but I just cannot buy Jason Isaacs speaking with a southern accent.  Ewan McGregor seems to be the only one that sounds reasonably convincing.4) I'm African-American and I do think that this film is sort of racist, since I've heard that a substantial portion of Mark Bowden's book had been omitted from the film, which detailed the Somali cause.  From what I've heard, it had been omitted for apparently no reason, other than to really give a sense of soldiers fighting bravely against impossible odds.  All the soldiers are white (there is a black soldier amongst them who only speaks a few lines) and are shooting at hundreds of Somalis.5) I think that this film presents an unfair portrait of the Somalis. With the exception of a cab driver who has been coerced into helping the Americans and another Somali man who was arrested, there are no other signs of the Somali view.  Thus, this gives ""Black Hawk Down"" a one-sided view of a battle that should never have happened.6) I did feel sorry for the American soldiers at certain points during the film.  Such as when the three soldiers are in the helicopter and are defending it from oncoming Somalis.  Another instance would be the one soldier who gets separated from the rest and has to eventually find his way back to the group.So as you can clearly see, I have many mixed feelings about ""Black Hawk Down"", but I did thoroughly enjoy myself while watching this film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Good action. But...,"...what is really weird about this movie is that it´s just American. In the end, you read everything about every US-soldier killed in action in Somalia. Oh, yes, and there were a few dead Somalis, but they don´t matter? Perhaps I can´t understand it because I´m not American. But I don´t know why any film can show a war as a battle between heroes and villains. Surely, theses Somalis didn´t want to die. And surely, most of them didn´t want to fight in a war they could not win. Furthermore, who was the real agressor in this war? The action in this film is alright, the actors are, it´s just alright. But the whole story is wrong. Even in times the US are fighting, movies should not be as one-faceted pro-American as this one is. Quite sad that these American patriot-movies are very succesful in Europe.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Visceral reality,"After reading the NY times review (which slammed it for not being emotional enough and 'racist'), I need to mention that this film is probably the most realistic and honest war film ever made.Other works like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan all have a 3rd context, whether its the man vs man, man vs himself or man vs. barbarity as seen in the conflict between Sgt.Barnes and Elias in Platoon. But Black Hawk Down offers none of these and does not dwell on a 'higher meaning', which is this film's greatest strengths.As one of the Delta characters, Hoot says ""once the bullets go flying past your head, all the politics and all that sh-t goes right out the window"" This film captures the raw, visceral intensity of a group of men trying to stay alive in a hostile city. There is no emotional or philosophical wondering, only a fast paced, gut wrenching fight for one's own life. Ridley Scott masterfully puts the viewer into the combat boots of US Rangers and uses color and scenery to add the depth and character to this situation. Reality and accuracy dominate over philosophy or politics in this film. All your philosophy and all your conflicting emotions go right out the window when a heavily armed mob starts shooting at you.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A way too realistic war movie,"I saw this movie with my girlfriend.

The only minus in the movie is that it's so tragically realistic that most people thinks it's only another Hollywood action movie. Maybe the movie would have been easier to understand and comprehend if it was less ""foot soldier"" on the ground and more political or moral, like trying to watch the incident from the opposing side too.",9.0,Anonymous,History
does anybody know?,"while i was watching black hawk down, i was thinking that the movie was very pretty, very pleasant to watch. afterwords, though, i'm feeling a bit dissatisfied. i remember as we were leaving the theatre my friend was crying and that made me angry because i felt as though she was crying for the wrong reasons. the movie did have a strong emotional effect, but i believe it was very selfish. there were 19 american soldiers who died, and that is terrible. but a thousand somalians died. the movie listed all of the americans who died, and glorified their efforts to do...well... something. but what about the somalians? some died with no memory of them whatsoever. and what did the soldiers die for? after the movie, the reason wasn't really any clearer. it reminds me of sept. 11th, because so many people have an emotional reaction, but so few really know why or how or what. they just see death and feel sad. but there is such thing as injustice, and fault, and cause. this movie did a wonderful job of portraying the confusion of war. perhaps the fact that i don't really know what it was all about was the point, the point maybe being that war is pointless, meaningless. but i still will feel dissatisfied. the film should have tried harder to educate in my opinion.",,Anonymous,History
African ALIENS,"BLACK HAWK DOWN is visually spectacular with good performances from some fine actors, but the superficial script lets it down badly.  By athletically avoiding the politics of the conflict, it treats the Somalis as motiveless monsters, so the movie feels more like ALIENS or a video game than a serious film.  The implicit racism is highlighted by the depiction of the Pakistanis, who are depicted as comedy relief rather than rescuers.  Much of the dialogue seems to have been cut-and-pasted from old war movies and recruiting ads, and characterisation almost disappears amid the explosions, helicopter shots, and showers of spent cartridges.  All that's left in the end is yet another siege movie with new hardware - a rather routine depiction of courage under fire, without the courage to examine other issues.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"""Black Hawk Down"" dodges all the potential schmaltz with a grit the historical event truly deserved.","It always surprises me how little Ridley Scott films I've seen. I guess with Alien and Blade Runner as firm favourites, I feel a little more knowledgeable on him than I should be. Black Hawk Down feels more like an exercise in technical skill than storytelling. With an assortment of celebrities and an abundance of characters, it never gets a chance nor tries to whittle them down and study them. But it's not concerned with these people beyond fleeting personality traits as the characters feel as if they come and go and you don't see them again. Perhaps they're simply used an excuse to show as much of the battle as they possibly can with three dozen perspectives. The film doesn't prepare you for what it's about to show. They say specifically, ""we'll be home before dinnertime."" What I didn't expect was the entire film thereafter devoted to the telling (or experience) of a nearly 24 hour battle. It's a deliberate assault on the senses, building on from what Saving Private Ryan's opening started with a constant clatter of bullets and blood gushing to the point where it feels like the movie within a movie ""Nation's Pride"" in Inglourious Basterds.Although I can't really be one to judge, no film has truly displayed the chaos of war like this one. It highlights the vulnerability of man in a profoundly moving way as American soldiers are stripped and paraded around a crowd of Somalians. While the editing, sound, cinematography and production design are very impressive, it can get tiresome just watching combat and bloodshed without any clear development or feeling for specific characters. There's empathy, but there's no overwhelming emotional urges. While the first half hour focusing on the soldiers pre-battle feels like trivial conversation in place of set-up, it's clear these scenes were designed to be just as generalised as the Somalian civilians, with subtle parallels drawn to their treatment of order, food and the land. It has interesting pieces of symbolism, such as near the end where a Sergeant attempts to mop up blood from under an operating table and just smears it further, showing how intervention in war can't help. It's a directors film. And although lots of trimming in the middle, a greater resolution and payoff and actual character development could have made it greater, it dodges all the potential schmaltz with a grit the historical event truly deserved.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
"a dangerous, dangerous movie...","I didn't really had any expectations for this flick to begin with, I merely went because I loved some of Scott's earlier features like Alien and Blade Runner. Black hawk Down wasn't nearly as bad I expected it to be... it was much, much worse! As a modern action film it worked descent enough, I guess. I must admit though that i'm getting really tired of computer generated fx - unless it's used to express something new (like in Cronenbergs eXistenZ) it just ruins the action and make things dull. Anyway, the action part was quite well made.This is what made me disgusted and angry: this movie is described by the director as a documentary-style war movie, that doesn't take sides and just show the truth of what war really is like. Ridley is either the biggest liar alive or simply unaware of what signals the movie is really sending out to it's viewers. It's a flag-waving morale-booster/recruiting film for the American public. It tells us that all American involvement in foreign affairs is good and honest, and that being a soldier equals being a hero. The Somalies are portrayed in a very one-dimensional, and in a way racist, way. The movie was partly funded by the pentagon so i'm sure it doesn't take sides I'm not saying that patriotism is a bad thing or that America is a bad country (it's in many respects a great one), but i'm positively sure that this movie is not the movie that should unite Americans after 11 September. It will only add to the already dominant American view that ""we are the best & we're always right"" that I think is very destructive (both for America & the World).So if you're really want some flag-waving see American Beauty again and rediscover the America we all love. If war movies are your genre, I recommend Three Kings, a fun and human third world-war movie that shows a more complex view on modern warfare and humanity in general.But avoid Black Hawk Down by any means necessary.

Top-Tier War Movie and Top-Tier Ridley Scott Movie,"Just got done watching Black Hawk Down (2001) for the first time ever and this is another top-tier cinematic epic from Ridley Scott.Positives for Black Hawk Down (2001):
The direction and execution from Ridley Scott is done masterfully in this movie. The movie has an atmosphere filled with this sense of tension, brutality and a visceral nature to the story that you can feel while watching the movie. The movie's cinematography also enhances that atmosphere to where you feel like you're watching real people in a real situation in this mission. Then, you have the musical score by Hans Zimmer which adds another layer of grittiness to the movie as if there wasn't enough of that already in the movie. The performances from everyone in the cast are all top-notch S-Tier and they all manage to come off as real people here. I also have to give credit that we send time with these characters before their mission to where we can identify with all of them and care about them when they eventually enter the battlefield. The action sequences are masterfully choreographed and again it feels like you're watching real stuff happening on screen. And finally, this is one of those movies epics to where you feel the runtime, but in a way that goes perfectly with the tone and approach to the story and this movie earns every single second of its lengthy runtime by the time the end credits start rolling.Overall, Black Hawk Down (2001) is one of the best movies in the war genre and it is one of the best Ridley Scott movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History

There, he drew the audience into a loathing of the coliseum audiences while attracting us with the same gory excitement. Then he stalked us, ate our brains by leaving his hand in the project.Now he works through Sam Shepard, as the deviser of a this mission. For those who might not get it, Sam is a great playwright famous for self-referential works. Then he got into movies, writing and intending to star in Paris, Texas, a film about film. Recently this was reinvented as ""Don't Come Knocking""He is such an icon of self-reference, he was cast as the ghost (Shakespeare's part) in the Hawke 'Hamlet' last year.Its no mistake that he's created what we see. Watch how Ewan deals with his being willingly commanded -- precisely like his fearlessness in 'Moulin Rouge.'",,Anonymous,History
Relentlessly tense and realistic war drama,"From the first scene to the last, 'Black Hawk Down' never lets up. The non-stop battlefield action, complete with relentless gunshots, explosions and bloodshed, makes for a very tense two and a half hours of viewing. Rather than focusing on a particular character or event, 'Black Hawk Down' gives a wider perspective of war - a realistic and hard hitting account of the horrors that take place on the battlefield.It's far from the perfect war film, however, and it's relentless pace means that not everything that takes place is totally clear. As it jumps from one frantic situation to the next with virtually no respite, it can be difficult to keep up with what's happening and to which characters, especially since the film is largely shot from the ground. That said, the film as a whole functions well as a war account and makes for a tense and absorbing viewing experience.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good classic modern warfare movie,"I feel like not many films are made about wars that happened in the 90s and if there are, they're not well known to the world. This is definitely a good movie because it shows us the intensity of what it was like in Mogadishu 1993. Although there are so many historical inaccuracies, this is still a good movie. It has a phenomenal soundtrack, variety of cast and characters, well except for one and I think we all know who that is (hint: Grimes was not a real character at all, and unfortunately based on someone 10x worse than one could possibly imagine). Anyway, I also love the 90s aesthetic and the military equipment and gear and weapons used by both sides. It's because of this movie that I got into the history of Black Hawk Down, Somalia, Delta Force, the 70s and 80s and 90s in Africa, and the Commando rifles used by the Delta guys (everyone calls them CAR-15s but whatever). I'm definitely glad I saw this movie and be able to be open more to it and history too.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A must watch war movie,"I am sure this movie would have been an inspiration for all the war movies that had come after this. This is a definitely one of the best war movies I have ever seen. Something that had come close to this is the movie ""13 hours"" By Michael bay, but that movie came out 15 years after this one and looks highly influenced by this movie. Just look at its set design and the way they establish the geography of Mogadishu it's just incredible. Watching this movie in 2022,I don't feel it's dated or looks old. This movie is like apocalypse now done right. You can just see the immensity of war but the movie never feels pro war. The camera work is amazing. It gives us a experience of being in the war and also there are many top angle shots wich gives us a distance from the war and makes us look at its impact on a city. This is definitely one of ridely scotts best movie. He is definitely one of the most visionary and influvential film maker. Something much more interesting is the writing. It's not the usual 3 act structure, we get introduced to a lot of characters and the movie tries to keep track of pretty much all till the end,that did not make me lose track of what's happening in the story. I didn't find a particular hero in the movie. That was intresting.Definitely a must watch war movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""Black Hawk Down"" is so virtuous, megalomaniac and endowed with very expensive doses of adrenaline, that there is not much time left to get to know the characters","Like every Jerry Bruckheimer production, Black Hawk Down is beyond reproach in its technical part: mounted with stunning vigor and relying on deafening sound effects, this new film by Ridley Scott simply throws the viewer into a bloody confrontation in an incredibly realistic way. Inspired by the book by Mark Bowden, the screenplay by Ken Nolan narrates the events related to a failed (and true) military maneuver promoted by the American army in Somalia, in October 1993. Conceived by General William Garrison, the operation aimed to capture two important members of the government of the dictator Mohamed Farrah Aidid, who had been promoting a long massacre in the country. However, by underestimating the strength of the local militias, US Military Intelligence placed its troops in a vulnerable position, resulting in the crash of two Black Hawk helicopters. Determined not to leave any comrades behind, the soldiers try to rescue the wounded, only to be surrounded by a hostile (and downright terrifying) mob of guerrillas. As a result, a maneuver that was supposed to last just thirty minutes dragged on for several hours, resulting in the deaths of 19 Americans and over a thousand Somalis.In general lines, the film would be something like the opening twenty minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", those full of realism, extended by two hours of projection. Even Scott confesses - his goal was not to tell the disaster in the most faithful way, as a historical record, but to recreate the experience for the audience. Thus, it becomes redundant to detail the plot. Played by young (and photogenic) new talents such as Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor and Orlando Bloom, the soldiers must risk their lives in the face of dozens of missiles and hundreds of angry Somalis. As Africans fall in a heap, America's families say their prayers. If the outcome seems predictable, the way to it reserves ""bombastic"" surprises. This, however, in addition to being its greatest merit, is also its most serious defect. It is interesting because it manages to convey to the viewer an intensive lesson in military techniques about what it must be like and how those who face this situation in real life must feel. But, just as the soldiers themselves must find a situation like this hell from a certain point on, so does the individual in the audience feel when he senses that nothing very different will happen.Another aspect that bothers you is the philosophy of ""We won't leave anyone behind"": in theory, this is an admirable and inspiring posture, but in practice, it ends up sounding a little different: at a certain point, the military takes three hours to recover the body of a pilot, thereby risking the lives of dozens of soldiers - something that can only be explained by the American obsession with the hero figure (this always reminds me of Die Hard, when Hans Gruber asks if John McClane is "" another orphan from a failed culture who saw too many movies as a kid and believes he's John Wayne""). Incidentally, it is curious to observe that these brave soldiers are capable of anything to rescue a corpse, but do not hesitate to leave half a dozen soldiers behind due to the ""lack of space"" in their means of transport.On the other hand, Black Hawk Down repeats the feat of ""Saving Private Ryan"" by illustrating the repulsive brutality of war, bombarding the viewer with strong images that reveal the fragility of the human body in the face of its weapons (there is a sequence involving a surgery that is sure to shock the most sensitive members of the audience). In fact, Ridley Scott spares no effort to give the film a dramatic veracity, which never sounds like a ""Hollywood adventure"" (as happened in Pearl Harbor). It is no wonder that, at various times, the filmmaker photographs the action with the camera on his shoulders, as if we were watching a report taken on the battlefield - an impression enhanced by the excellent use of Morocco as a location.The great driving force of the feature film is its direction. Ridley Scott manages to sustain an incredible level of tension for at least two-thirds of the work. He does everything that the grammar of the genre asks and offers: with the camera in his hands, always shaking, he maps all the chaos of the battlefield in the midst of shots with no certain origin, deafening explosions and pieces of bodies scattered in the streets. One of the director's great merits is that he took advantage of extreme but believable scenes, such as that of the soldier split in half and babbling a request in his death throes, and, above all, the young ranger fainting from pain while the doctor tried to stop the bleeding from his femoral. I think the direction is right to let the drama arise spontaneously from these scenes, without resorting to an easy emotional appeal or trying to transform human tragedy into moments of deliberate mawkishness.The soundtrack and the sound mix appear perfect. The battle scenes are almost always accompanied by melodies and rhythms with an African accent, with great emphasis on percussion. The sound work of Black Hawk Down fits well the combat on Somali soil. Another important technical highlight appears in Slawomir Idziak's grainy cinematography, which dyes the planes with saturated tones predominantly in green and yellow. If the film's point of view is to portray that young North Americans were sent to sacrifice in an absurd mission in Somalia, part of that is the work's own photography, which makes the environment hostile, unhealthy and morbid. The color palette intended by Idziak inserts the American troops into an authentic nightmare. Black Hawk in Peril seems to bet on the figure of the US soldier not as a combatant of chaos, but as one of its participants.Ridley Scott's film is pretty straightforward in its form and content. I don't think I'm advocating that Somalis are just barbarians, fighting the white civilizer from the First World in disarray. This is one of the most thoughtless criticisms that always arise about the film, since little is portrayed of the Somali soldier besides his desperate acts on the battlefield (something that is easily found on the American side too). What seems essential is to note that the film assumes the point of view of the American soldier thrown into hell all the time. The film never deviates from that. It doesn't change lenses either to portray the vision of the enemy soldier, or the local population, much less the US government. Black Hawk Down could descend into the most scoundrel patriotism, treating rangers as heroes to be applauded. But none of that happens. The portrait that is made is of lives that are worthless and are slaughtered in a useless battle. Between its lines, the film seems to me to hit hard on government foreign policy.Precisely for this reason, the lean script openly chooses not to carry out major character developments, since their brutal sacrifice is the motto from beginning to end of the work. The scriptwriters just brush some traits of their personalities and their biographies. There are those who have been displeased with cliché phrases (such as the soldier with his body torn apart) or with commonplaces that appear here and there (such as the ranger who clings to the family photo on the verge of a lynching). But I think it's worth asking: wouldn't any of us have said or done exactly what those soldiers did in their last moments? It should always be noted that not every cliché is false. In addition, briefly inserting some human traits amid the incessant chaos of battle seems to me a good way to show the emotional devastation of the soldier - treated as a cog in the war machine, which in the end only collapses his humanity and shatters his biography.Black Hawk Down is so virtuous, megalomaniac and endowed with very expensive doses of adrenaline, that there is not much time left to get to know the characters, who makes or suffers with the war that is about to unfold before our eyes. We remain impassive in the face of the unfolding of events, without it being possible to identify with those involved in the episode. At the same time that we see Americans once again trying to save the world, as world sheriffs, we note that they are the ones who make the decision to start a suicide attack using an urban area as a battlefield, a city full of civilians, men, children and women who suffer like puppets in reckless hands.In the end, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a competent recreation of a terrible battle - a recreation that completely ignores the human drama involved in the matter. Incidentally, it is regrettable that the film demands our compassion for the 19 Americans killed in the face of the more than a thousand Somalis who perished in the conflict - which leads me to the following question: if the lives of these Americans are so precious, why does the US government don't you get tired of sending your young soldiers to their death in different countries of the world?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent War Movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Black Hawk Down"" (2001) is an excellent war movie. Its brutal, raw, down to earth and shows the war as it is. This is great film make by a legendary Ridley Scott, and one of his best. I have seen this movie more then 3 times, and its one of those films that are done so well that you can't really tire from watching it from time to time. A recent release on 4K UHD was the way i was watching it recently, and its a blast - audio and video is top notch and truly puts you in a middle of action scenes.Overall, ""Black Hawk Down"" features a stellar cast, but it doesn't focuses on a main soldier or squad, and that was a very refreshing thing to see in a war film back in 2001 and a bold move by creators. Because its a story about the event itself. Cinematography, editing, sound design are very impressive in this film and directing by R. Scott was truly what elevated this movie from a bunch. Its an excellent war movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Black: Moody: Brilliant.,"Black Hawk Down is filmed eight years after the event of the Battle of Mogadishu, the capitol of Somalia in North East Africa. Based on the book Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War by Mark Bowden and directed by Ridley Scott.The true story of American soldiers, during October 3rd and 4th, 1993, who, having been sent to the heart of the City, an enemy stronghold, and to capture and return the warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. In the exercise of their duty, two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are shot down in the middle of the City, an extremely close combat battle then commences.Being one of the rarer and finer American war movies, that does not play on the clichéd ego trip, that we have come to see during the last twenty years or so of this genre. Could this also be because the cast here consists of a mixed bag of internationals, such as American, British and Scottish actors, even with their poor American accents to boot?The cinematography on Black Hawk Down is aesthetically clear and concise; with fine detail to colour, temperament and texture, that really does set the mood of the environment. The pacing of this movie is neither too fast nor does it leave you looking at your watch. With the right ingredient for character build up and development, we can feel an empathic understanding of these unfortunate souls.This is a very well shot movie too, of tight battle scenes that draws us into and unquestionably involves the viewer at ground level. We are left with a guided tour of duty in the comfort of our Cinema and living rooms, the atmosphere is well articulated and we are left with camaraderie that has over spilled into our hearts and mind.Black Hawk Down is a movie not of ego but of comradeship and the partnership of one man equals all men; this is a very good movie indeed, with very little bad language, it really is not needed. This movie relies on the sometimes graphic and the sentimentality's that war can bring, to deliver home that one can watch a good movie as well as make them.Black Hawk Down is a unique and refreshing war film, knowing that is it is a real event and seeing what the Soldiers had to endure is captivating. With the help of Ridley Scott at the helm, it will make any war movie genre fan want to pin it down and watch with an understanding that the ego does not make the Soldier, but the Soldier makes the Man.A different way to make a War movie..",7.0,Anonymous,History
An intense experience,"Black Hawk Down is an intense, raw, documentary-like war movie; it's as if the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan just kept going....and going. Most of the film is a series of brutal, heart-pounding firefights between heavily outnumbered American special forces and wave after wave of Somali, machine-gun-toting brigands.  The film is exhausting to sit through, as the relentless attacks fall one upon another, the Americans pinned in shattered buildings, or in the cockpits of crashed helicopters, or inside their own Armored Personnel Carriers.  The movie doesn't just depict war as hell, it is hell itself... endless carnage served up without meaning or reason.The film isn't a masterpiece.  It doesn't offer much in the way of story, or a cogent point of view.  Actually, it could have been a masterpiece if it had deliberately and consistently avoided all efforts at classical storytelling and adopted a strictly clinical approach.  It is the occasional attempt at turning the film into a classical Hollywood movie (i.e. Castaway or Saving Private Ryan) that keeps it from achieving the kind of single-minded artistic purity of the best war movies, like Das Boot and The Thin Red Line.  Its efforts at organizing the carnage are too cursory to turn the movie into a well-crafted drama, but they do spoil its chance at being a different kind of war movie, one that presents war as pure experience, without narrative.The movie is not helped by the careful touch director Ridley Scott takes with the image of the U.S. military.  Certainly the U.S. was on a heroic mission in Somalia, trying to ameliorate the terrible famine that Somalians were suffering at the time, yet the film seems too self-conscious about avoiding any negative images of the U.S. military whatsoever, whether it is incompetent officers (the usual standby, of course) or grunts committing questionable deeds.  Amazingly, though the U.S. soldiers are being assaulted seemingly at random in a dense urban environment, not one accidentally guns down a civilian, or even shoots at an assailant who is in a non-aggressive posture (i.e., running away).  These guys would have to have supernatural powers to differentiate immediate threats from false alarms in such an environment, and it simply isn't believable, in a movie that places all its bets on being ""realistic"".I had the good fortune to see the movie in Hollywood with the director  and producer (Jerry Bruckheimer) in attendance.  In their remarks after the screening it was clear that the movie was made with substantial cooperation from the U.S. military.  While the pyrotechnics in the film might have suffered without this cooperation, it's fair to wonder what sort of substantial compromises were made to the story to accommodate the military's cooperation, and neither director nor producer seemed to recognize the inherent problems with such a relationship, and it shows in the film.Nonetheless Black Hawk Down is an exceptional film, one of the best war movies to come out of Hollywood in the past 20 years, and one that at times illustrates a fresh if brutal approach to the genre, and as importantly takes us deep inside a nightmare that has receded into memory as a minor if unpleasant international incident.  This film shows that, if you're on the ground, there's no such thing as a ""minor incident"".  You're either behind a desk, or you're out there living in hell, and what you see on CNN ain't the half of it.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Technically magnificent, but otherwise lacking.","It's funny how a film like this can provoke such aggressively political critiques; it isn't a particularly political film, after all.  Yes, you could argue that it has propagandist tendencies, but that is just a hazard of the genre, even with the most well-meaning films.  Yes, the emphasis on 19 American dead seems rather disproportionate to the 1000-odd Somali dead; but then, the film is the story of the US soldiers, not the Somalis.  It is told from a Western perspective, and it is entirely natural that the story - which is in any case an adaptation of a book - should focus on the US forces.  Critics with an anti-American agenda should perhaps note that not only did an Englishman direct this film, but it features two Scots, a Welshman and a couple of Kiwis in significant roles as US servicemen.One of the primary intentions of this film appears to be to relate events as they happened.  That is, the film is not about what is good, or what is bad, but simply what IS - was, I should say.  In this the film appears to be reasonably succesful, conveying the chaos of modern battle in a way that I can imagine is very realistic.  (Not that I'd know.)This does not excuse the film's many flaws. I shuddered a little when I saw Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore and Ewen Bremner all together again - not that any of these three is an unwelcome presence on screen, far from it - but rather that I was immediately reminded of Pearl Harbour - a film which presents the viewer with an operatic mythologising of warfare and real events, comparisons with which Black Hawk Down would truly be best served by avoiding.This was not helped by moments such as when a soldier rips a cast from his arm in hyper-macho fashion, or when a dying soldier actually says 'Tell my mom I done ma best', or words unbearably similar to that old cliche.  These may well be real for all I know, but in the context of a film which has pretensions to seriousness, they simply feel crude and obvious.I actually went into this film expecting to enjoy it - I enjoyed nonsense like Pearl Harbour, and my expectations of a Bruckheimer film had led me to believe that whatever its flaws I could enjoy BHD.  Tragically, BHD commits the greatest sin for an action film - it isn't actually very exciting.  This strikes me as a terrible shame as the story really is a gripping one, and a BBC documentary of a few years ago conveyed this very well.  However, the battle scenes in this film are, if anything, almost too routine.  As an exercise in verisimilitude it is a technical feat to behold; and yet, there is a feeling of detachment from the events.  Perhaps it's the blandness of the characters, perhaps because they're TOO real, but there's a feeling of general anonymity about this bunch of bald guys that I haven't really felt in a cast since Alien 3.  Only Eric Bana really is memorable as the quiet soldier who demonstrably knows his job.And what does the film actually give us in its discussion of war (if discussion it is)?  There is a good moment concerning an accidental shooting, another concerning the simple bad luck that can befall a soldier before he even sees battle, and an appropriately horrible scene with a wounded soldier... but these are perfunctory and even that last is undercut by the dialogue which is stilted and cliched.I suppose ultimately this film provokes indifference in me.  It's difficult to enjoy as an action movie because it's too serious.  It's difficult to appreciate as a 'serious' war movie because it's not quite serious enough. If anything, it's like playing a computer game... and that's not the feeling I would like a film about armed conflict to provoke in me.",,Anonymous,History

Confusing but once it slows down it really hits you,"Set around a mission the US carried out during the Somalian Civil war in 1993.

But once it slows down half way through it really starts hitting you the things the characters are going through transforms some men into children and some children into adults.

This movie is a history lesson contained within a war movie.,"While this is a tense and realistic war movie with a great deal of action and suspense, it also demonstrates that military valor is of little value when there is political ignorance and arrogance. The backdrop is the U. S. military operation in Somalia in the early nineties. The government of Somalia had collapsed, and the country degenerated into zones controlled by various warlords and civil war. They all used intimidation and starvation to tighten their hold on power and the U. S. led an operation to try to end the civil war and stop the mass starvation.
It was a mission that began with the best of intentions yet was based on a lack of understanding of the situation in the country. In many ways, it was based on the misbegotten belief that the Somali people would be grateful, and the Americans and UN personnel would be hailed as benevolent heroes. When there was some pushback, the U. S. command came up with a foolish and arrogant plan to kidnap General Aideed in the capital city of Mogadishu.
This movie is a well-done depiction of that raid, from the initial arrogance of the American troops to the disaster that followed, where the American soldiers demonstrated incredible valor and sacrifice. The Americans believed that it would be so quick and easy that some didn't even bother to don their body armor or fill their canteens. Furthermore, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin turned down the request of the U. S. military for armored vehicles including tanks, fact not well explained.
As battles go, it was a victory for the American forces, 18 American soldiers were killed while over 1,000 Somalis died in the fight. Yet, it was a defeat, demonstrating that even people starving in a civil war will take up arms against an invasion force and leading to the American withdrawal.

"great action, but with typical Hollywood ignorance of the truth","If one could watch Black Hawk Down strictly for its entertainment value, it should rate 9/10 or 10/10 for anyone who likes action or war movies. But unfortunately, as usual Hollywood takes a very complex historical situation and turns it into a ridiculously simplistic good vs. evil battle that completely ignores the entire context of what really happened in Somalia leading up to the events depicted in the movie.By seeing the ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette on the DVD, you learn that the Pentagon provided unprecedented cooperation for this movie. It's no wonder that Black Hawk Down, stripped of the Hollywood veneer, is essentially just a very entertaining, very expensive 2+ hour reel of U.S. military propaganda that attempts to portray our involvement in Somalia in the very best light, when in fact there were all sorts of ulterior motives.For a much more balanced perspective of what really happened, read this article about the movie: www.onlinejournal.com/01-03-02_Chin.pdf",9.0,Anonymous,History

One of Ridleys Best Efforts,"Ridley Scott is an amazing director with over 3 decades worth of movies to his name and Black Hawk Down is not only one of my favourite war films it's also one of my favourite Movies by Ridley Scott. For one despite the fact that the story being told in this movie is quite gruesome and ugly it's very entertaining I could watch this movie anytime it's able to honour to suffering of its characters while still being able to entertain the viewer and make them want to come back and watch the movie multiple times. The way they tell the story is by just showing the brutality of war not putting focus on a romance or one character in particular but showing them all just showing what the war has done to these men and the people they are trying to protect. This is one of the best directed movies I have ever seen it cuts at just the right moments the framing is perfect the action sequences are all perfectly handled and should have gotten Ridley Scott an Oscar for his efforts. While you probably couldn't tell all the characters apart the actors who play them all given terrific performances with Ewan McGregor and William Fichner probably being the standouts. You've still got Tom Hardy here in one of his earliest roles he's not in the movie for long but does the best with his limited screen time and the same goes for Orlando Bloom. My next point is one that is both a positive and a negative for the movie, the lack of character development. This adds a bit to the movie for what Scott is trying to accomplish he just wants to show the brutality of war and having to spend time developing its many characters would subtracts from that greatly. But it detracts from the movie as well as this movie has got a lot of characters and because of there lack of development as I previously said you can't really tell them apart. If your hoping for subtlety Black Hawk Down is not the movie for your u but if you love War movies or just Entertaining movies Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down is definitely the movie for you it's one of his finest films and one of the many for which he will be remembered for.

Superbly made war film but pure propaganda,"I love Ridley Scott's work, he is truly one of the best and most artistic directors working today. This is an excellent, very well made authentic looking war film that will pull you right into the intensity of a firefight. Unfortunately this film is pure propaganda and got lots of ""co-operation"" from the US government. It is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts surrounding this event, the motivations of the Mogs, and the real background of our presence in that part of the world. It is once again showing the USA as altruistic defenders of ""freedom"" and coming to the aid of these poor starving oppressed people. This is pretty nasty propaganda designed to keep us Americans ignorant of our governments' military ""adventures"". If too many people start asking questions about the real reasons why we were in Somalia (or Afghanistan, or Iraq, or the upcoming Iran and Saudi Arabia) it could prove uncomfortable for the powers that be. Ridley knows better than this and I'm disappointed that he would go along with this misleading flag waver to bolster enlistments and garner support for this militaristic government.As a Vietnam veteran helicopter pilot I was impressed with the technical accuracy of this film, it's as good as I have seen in a major commercial film. The underlying message however is a lie.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Ridley Scott's Best Movie.,"I have seen a handful of Ridley Scott's movies(Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, Exodus Gods and Kings, etc.), and this one is my favorite! This fact based movie captures quite effectively what it was like to be at the attack on Somalia.Despite being 2.5 hours long, I found this movie to have a very fast pace. I checked the time bar a few times and I was amazed to be 40 minutes in(or whatever) because it seemed like half that! It can be slow at times, but it doesn't overtly feel like it's dragging.A main reason for Black Hawk Down's R Rating is it's violence. If an alcoholic took a drink for every shot fired in the movie, they would die before the movie hit the hour mark!If you don't want to see a bloody hand on the ground 68 minutes in or a man with blown off legs, this is NOT for you! I have a feeling Ridley Scott saw Saving Private Ryan and thought: ""You know, I could one up that!"" And he does-I mean that in the best way possible.BHD by definition is not entertaining, but it is very enthralling. To sit back and see history brought to life through this is astonishing , even if it's hard to watch. It's a simple movie, but that's where it's power lies.If you are a fan of war movies, this is a must watch! For anyone else, this is still a very high recommendation! It's a great war film, and my favorite one after Hacksaw Ridge!Note: Due to time zones, my reviews of this and The Matrix both say May 16th, 2019. I actually wrote them the night before. I also saw this movie on the 11th but waited 4 days to write this!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent, but my gawd, it was brutal!","Brutal in every sense of the word. Realistic and disturbing, the film left me feeling sick at times and I honestly could not stomach some of the scenes. The film actually brilliantly depicts the horrors of war, and a very good cast ensure credibility. This is one of those films (like Saving Private Ryan) that is so well made that I only want to see it once, since I won't stomach it a second time.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Masterpiece,"Ridley Scott's best achievements (""The Duellists,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Thelma and Louise"") are great and this is the fourth greatest war movie ever made, IMO, right behind ""Paths of Glory,"" ""The Bridge On the River Kwai,"" and ""Play Dirty."" Like the others, it has a cynical view of war and focuses on command structures for an explanation. It's fascinating to watch what people will do ""fighting for freedom and democracy"" or whatever they think they're fighting for. ""Black Hawk Down"" goes further than realism: it's naturalism. Watching this movie is an education in what combat can become and, like the others, should be seen by anyone contemplating a military career. Watch this movie and stay safe.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Bruckheimer's best movie... but still a Bruckheimer movie...,"I think I've always avoided this movie, until now, because it's a Jerry Bruckheimer flick, and there's nothing that guy can't dumb down. I really can't think of another producer who leaves such an indelible mark on a film that it's instantly recognisable as his. What other producer is mentioned as often in the marketing of a film than Bruckheimer, often more times than the director? He's become a brand, attaching his name generally means you're gonna get a certain kind of movie, no matter who's behind the lens (this time out, it's Ridley Scott, who received his third Oscar nomination for his work here). So my question going into the film was could Bruckheimer leave his usual brand of tricks behind for the serious subject matter at hand, or would it look like Armageddon in Somolia, or another Pearl Harbour? Well, it's not Armageddon in Somolia, and I'm assuming Black Hawk Down is better than Pearl Harbour (which I've never seen, and probably never will). But... it's still a Bruckheimer flick. He still has to have his slow motion epic shots, complete with swelling score, that just screams ""HEROES. THESE ARE MEN DOING MANLY THINGS AND YOU WILL CHEER"". It's that dedication to aestheticism that prevents what is a pretty good movie from becoming a great movie. It's self-reverential in the worst way, and little more than one large battle scene.It's a pretty impressive battle scene, I'll give you, but it all exists without the proper context or heft that would give it's subject matter the treatment it deserves. The action is furious, the battles feel authentic, the explosions are loud. It's all terribly exciting and engrossing, but empty. Everything that occurs before the battle occurs is tired, clichéd and ordinary. Scott sets up the quirks of the men we will soon see in battle so that we shall care when they are placed in peril. But it feels stunted and obligatory, and not all that different than the montage of characters offered in Armageddon. Particularly weak is the opening of the film, which treats the viewers to six or seven pages of subtitled exposition, explaining the Somolian conflict and what our heroes are doing there (complete with poorly written, ham-handed commentary).Here's the thing about movies: they're a visual medium. Use one or two pages of subtitles to begin a movie if you must, but this is a bit excessive. A simple rule is show, don't tell. Even a hackneyed device like having the soldiers watching the news or discussing the newspaper would have been preferable. The whole thing feels so much like an afterthought, that I'm convinced it was one. Test audiences were too confused about what Somolia was all about, so they threw that in there instead of re-shooting a sequence.Bruckheimer can't bear all the blame for the film's short-comings. Ridley Scott is just as prone to sensationalism and aestheticism as is his production partner. As with his recent Kingdom of Heaven, it appears too often that Scott is more interested in setting up a unique and beautiful shot than finding the reasoning behind the sequence. He's all craft with no poetry. As a result, the film looks amazing, the battle is outstanding, but the whole thing leaves me very hollow, and not just because of the ""war is hell"" theme that always surrounds such films.While recognising the flaws of Black Hawk Down, I still felt it to be a pretty good movie. And that's because while Scott may be lacking as an artist, he is a master craftsman. The battle is unrelenting and enthralling, and one of the best I've seen for modern combat. While most of the characters are little more than archetypes, I found a few members of the cast really stood out with their performances, particularly Eric Bana as the charismatic Delta Squadron member and Tom Sizemore, who could basically play army guys his whole career and not go wrong.All in all, despite its many flaws, the superlatives out-weigh them. I enjoyed the flick for what it was, while still wishing the story was put in better hands.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Sad & pathetic,"I know that war exists, I actually lived through a civil war for over a decade (lebanon).  Before going to the movie, I knew that it was about war but maybe I expected to also see something intelligent and a human side to it instead of simply people shooting.  All I have to say is that I can't understand why someone would enjoy this movie.  If you tasted what war is in your life, you would hate the movie, find it sick & spit in on it.  From the beginning of the movie until the end, all you hear and see are weapons being shot and people getting killed like some video game.  There's not 1 minute in it where there isn't violence.  It's as if the point of the director is: shoot & kill as much as you can!!  I didn't find it entertaining and after a while I didn't care who was dying anymore, the whole time I was shaking my head thinking to myself that we humans are the most pathetic & sick creatures on earth.   The only refreshing thing about the movie is seeing a couple of DOGS and a DONKEY.  It reminded me the true value of life & that at least the animals do know how to appreciate it.  Watching people kill each others each second shouldn't be entertaining, if you had lost some of your loved ones in a war, you would DEFINITELY NOT FIND THIS MOVIE ENTERTAINING, YOU WOULD FIND IT SICK, no matter what the political reason is!  I really hope that they stop promoting war, there's another way to deal with problems.  Take out the weapons and everyone would be forced to sit down and talk.  Believe it or not, most of the weapons of those terrorists in the movie were actually BOUGHT from countries including the USA.  How pathetic is that?  Anyways, I'm not reviewing the movie about it's technical part and how well it's done, some people are even saying it could win oscars, but to me this movie is sick & not watchable unless you enjoy seeing us humans killing each others.  You may not agree with my view but I hope that you will at least understand.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Highly Overated Spectacle Driven Drivel,"Quite a long time ago on opening weekend my friend and I went to see this film.  We both had High Expectations of it hearing so many great things.  However when the credits started rolling we both had major problems with this film.  Problems that could not have been fixed by simple time spent in the editing room. One review I have read declared this film amongst the pinacle of other great films such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and Saving Private Ryan (He forgot Three Kings, Platoon, and The Deer Hunter but Oh well.) back to my point the difference those films have that this film is lacking are the two most important aspects of story telling.(Film making at its core is storytelling remember.) Plot and Character Development.  Black Hawk down is missing both of those. It has a little bit of Conflict Exposition, then just crashes into an hour and a half battle scene.  Believe me I enjoy battle scenes as much as the next film buff.  The invasion of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan took my breath away.  But when it just carries on to make up the bulk of the film as this does there is no way someone can follow a story because there is no story line to follow.  There is a guy that gets captured and that went no where.  There are people just running and shooting a the Somalians with loud gun fire covering over any possible dialogue making none of the characters worth remembering.  It basically has the plot and thematic equivalent of a Steven Segal movie and that is far from a complement.Many people talk about how realistic it is, but film making is not realism, it is supposed to be heightened realism, and you should be left with something more than just an visual memory of a guy holding a wound shut as blood spills on the floor.  This did not deliver.  Like most of Scott's other Indeavors he just does not have what it takes to be a distinguished director.  Though I guess his movies can be pretty fun to watch at times.",,Anonymous,History

The GOAT war movie.,"I grew up watching this film, as a kid being amazed by it. I later watched all of Ridley Scott's films and fell in love with them. Today in 2022, I can still safely say this is still the GOAT modern war movie. Nothing comes close. It's not the story that is great, but it's the masterful way it's filmed. It's realistic, gritty, and the cast is large but memorable (many future A-list actors). Oh and the soundtrack is by Hans Zimmer. Just COME ON. 10/10. No modern movie ever came close to this. 1990s-2000s were the golden times of American cinema, period. After 2010 and mass advent of digitalisation & special effects, the level of quality was never the same.One point about the film versions. I watched both the extended and original version. Whilst the extended version is good, I believe it adds lots of filler which is frankly unnecessary. I recommend the original version.For example, the extended version adds relatively useless scenes of the soldiers jogging back to base at the end of the film, which drags on a little uselessly.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Highly overrated propaganda film,"Black Hawk Down would be a good movie if it was a fiction such as Rambo. But it is based on actual event and it is highly one sided. It even neglected to portray the Pakistani and Malay allies who fought and bled for rescue operation of the US soldiers. But instead, it put a big spotlight and wasted screen time with Somali Ali Atto who had absolutely no significance to the story and did nothing. Doesn't even explain why we were there. Bad bad direction.As for the event itself, it romanticized a failed mission with ""No man left behind"" catch phrase. Well, they did leave a man behind... many men behind. When they refused to send in the 3rd medevac because it would go down too, they refused to save the dying soldier at the risk of putting more soldiers at risk. Which was the right decision. But if they are going to leave a man behind eventually, they should've done it in the first place with the first chopper and save all those lives. It's about the soldiers? Really??? Eric Bana's character at the end says he's going out there again because there are still men out there. But he was the one who said ""if they send another chopper, it will go down and we'll be defending it again""?? He's being realistic at one point and romantic at another? Doesn't fly.This movie showed how stupid and naïve the chain of command was and in real life, the army did learn a lot from this incident. What NOT TO DO to be exact.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Waving the Flag is Easier Than Thinking,"Black Hawk Down comes, at what seems to me, to be a crucial time in the development of American Democracy. As a nation we have been through a great deal over the past five months. In many ways we have passed through this time with high marks. We have not interred innocent Muslims, Afghanis, Saudis, as was the response in 1942 to the ""parallel"" events at Pearl Harbor and the World Trade Center. We have not yet (except for Afghanistan) bombed anyone back to the Stone Age.  For that, I am a grateful Human.The film Black Hawk Down makes me worry though, that any sense of reasonableness may last. Despite the film craftsmanship of Ridley Scott, this is a very flawed war film philosophically. It is jingoism at a time when this nation and its citizen's need is thoughtful reflection.I came away from this film deeply disturbed by its need to resort to ""war film clichés."" That there is only one ""token"" Afro American US soldier, and at the same time the Somalis are portrayed as nothing but a swarm of angry bees is inexcusable. See The Thin Red Line to see a thoughtful portrayal of enemy.  The one character we get even a minute amount of information on is obviously the first casualty. The speech at the end about ""Why we do this"" (soldiers fighting battles) is nothing but an echo of the Tom Hanks' speech at the end of the ""anti-war"" film, Saving Private Ryan.Mr. Scott is not just any filmmaker. His gratuitously violent Gladiator won an academy award (sic). Like Mr. Spielberg, who has nothing but room to take chances to make the World a better place, only communicate to the lowest common denominator.I've read an IMDb user's comment, ""I was there - where were you?"" My answer, I wasn't there thankfully. For a more honest version of what went on in Mogadishu, I suggest the PBS's (yes, the petroleum broadcasting network's) Frontline report, which was much more disturbing than this Gollywood version of ""War is Hell.""",1.0,Anonymous,History
I think my ex still has scars on his arm from my nails...,"This movie blew me away. Literally. I staggered out of the theater. It has everything I think a war movie should have, and nothing that it shouldn't. No love story. Very little background. No apologies. Most of all, I didn't feel like I was being yanked in one direction or the other. I didn't feel like it was horribly anti-war, or pro-war. Rather, it simply showed you what war is like. Not a lot of character development, but that's how it is. You realize quickly that what matters is not whether that guy over there has a mom, cat, and girlfriend back at home who are going to miss him, but simply that he is a human being, and he is putting his life on the line for something that he doesn't really understand. I would say more than anything, this movie is pro-solder, pro-human. These guys are shipped to a country they know nothing about, to fight in a war they didn't choose to start, with people they don't know very well, and they get killed for it, and the only thing that matters is right there, right then, living through that moment, and saving the guy next to you, even if you just met him.

A new type of war movie,"Like `Behind Enemy Lines', this is a movie rushed out in the aftermath of the World Trade Center horror, apparently on the assumption that it will make Americans feel better about themselves. It would seem that, in the US, there has been a `Let's kick ass' response but, to this British viewer at least, such a reaction is hard to fathom. Certainly the film is a celebration of comradeship and heroism, but it reminds us of an appalling military misjudgement by the Americans and a lack of political will by the international community.It depicts in savagely graphic form the outcome of an October 1993 operation in the Somalian capital of Mogadishu when an attempt to detain henchman of the local warlord gave rise to a 15-hour  `firefight' in which 18 American soldiers lost their lives and more than 70 were injured, while something like a thousand Somalians  men, women ands children  were killed. Elite soldiers of the Rangers and Delta Force regiments go in, supported by Black Hawk and Little Bird helicopters but, from the start, it is a mess, as one soldier falls from Black Hawk, resulting in it being downed by the local militia. This is war as we have never seen it before on the big screen: brutal and confused combat in city streets and houses where the enemy does not wear a uniform or fight by the rules and rescue is far from hand.This was always going to be a better work than `Behind Enemy Lines' because it is helmed by one of the finest directors around and presents a very much less gung ho' depiction of war. Fresh from his success with the wonderful `Gladiator', British Ridley Scott  the son of a Royal Marine - has taken locations in Morocco and used magnificent camerawork to produce a stunning visual and visceral record based closely on the book by journalist Mark Bowden. Indeed such is the verisimilitude of Scott's action that one can't always hear what is said or understand what is happening.As I left the London screen where I saw `Black Hawk Down', I found myself in conversation with the cinema attendant who incredibly happened to be a Somalian who was there in 1993. He assured me that the events were worse than shown in the film  we didn't see (fortunately) the parading of the dead Americans through the streets - and the situation is just as bad now as it was then, with four clans controlling different quarters of Mogadishu.A year after the disastrous American intervention in Somalia, the Taliban took control of Afghanistan and we all looked the other way until the appalling events of 11 September 2001. If Scott's film serves to remind us that we cannot forgot the injustice in Somalia  and other parts of Africa  perhaps it will have served a higher purpose than entertainment.",,Anonymous,History

"Much That's Brillant, Far Too Much That's Problematic","As the credits roll at the end of Black Hawk Down, the names of all the American servicemen who died in the events portrayed so viscerally are listed. We are also told that 'more than 1000 Somalis' were also killed. None of them are named.Therein lies my main problem with this film as I revisit it for the first time in a very long time. When Ridley Scott get things right, he gets them very right; he has made at least two films which are immovable from my all-time favourites. When he gets things wrong, they tend to go quite badly wrong. Black Hawk Down is not a total disaster; in terms of cinematic portrayal of war, there are few better sequences. The fighting is brutal, nasty, and hard to look away from. The first 40 minutes or so are effective in setting the tone of the units involved. Once the fighting starts it's hard to tell the difference between the soldiers, but this matters surprisingly little; few people can direct action with the narrative clarity Scott brings. The problem is that this could be happening anywhere, against anyone; we don't understand anything about 'the enemy' or the city and country they're fighting in (despite the usual banal on-screen explainer at the beginning). They are bullet-fodder; civilians are non-playing characters with even less dialogue. When the Americans are fleeing on foot at the end, they are surrounded by cheering locals for no real reason. It's the same with the Pakistani UN troops the Americans are waiting for; the delay in their arrival is only mentioned as as a source of anger, the fact that the Americans had failed to mention the mission to their colleagues skated over. When they do arrive, you barely have a chance to lay an eye on them. At the end one soldier gives a banal, insulting speech about not choosing to be a hero. Hero for who, exactly?In the current political climate, this sort of film does not age well; it's far too 'America first', America as global policeman, Africa as a white-man's playground. There's much that will grip you and sear itself into your memory; but really Western filmmakers have to do better than this with these stories.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Final Score:  ""Good"" Guys 1,000""Bad"" Guys 19Game Over","There are Two Ways to Approach Analysis of this Ridley Scott Film, One is on an Artistic Level and the Other is the Comparison with the Actual Events and the Based on Actual Events Depicted On Screen.The ""Entertainment"" Value Contained in this Rousing Rah-Rah War Movie is, Despite the Tragic Consequences and Wholesale Slaughter and Loss of Life, is Undeniably a ""Good Time"" for those that Enjoy Shoot 'Em Ups and Video Games.The Scenes of Battle on the Confined and Unforgiving Streets in Such a Hostile Situation are Precisely Pictured and the ""You Are There"" Feeling is Present Throughout.

There wasn't much character development and the plot was razor thin.  I had heard so much about this film being ""great"", ""best movie ever"" and like statements--I just didn't find that being the case at all. It was boring and found the portrayal of the U.S. Troops comical at best. Has anyone counted how many times the soldiers tripped all over themselves? I have--they fell out of helicopters, they tripped while exiting a doorway, they tripped while running--if the Somalians didn't kill them they probably would have shot themselves anyway.  The movie also lacked credibility which was much needed in this movie given the lack of storyline.  Com'mon, 1000 Somalis dead and only 19 Americans lost in battle?  Yeah, right--I too have a bridge to sell you!  I don't think I ever routed for the bad guy in a movie, but in this movie I made an exception.

A Must See!,"'Black Hawk Down' is a terrific cinematic experience.

It was an act of disgusting behavior. 'Black Hawk Down' correctly executes the topic it chooses. The gruesome violence is ruthless, the atmosphere is repulsive, but, the courage beneath the anger, is incomparable. The Screenplay is captivating & arresting. Ridley Scott Directs this War/Drama with utmost interest & dedication. The Cinematography is pitch-perfect, while The Editing is razor-Sharp.Performance-Wise: Josh Hartnett is superb. Ewan McGregor is terrific. Tom Sizemore & Jason Isaacs are hugely effective. Ewen Bremner & Eric Bana are good. Tom Hardy is another topper.

Simply Refreshing,"When I got out of the movie theater on friday the 18th, i had a complete different view at wars in today's world.The best wars movies out there( full metal jacket, platoon,apocalypse now, the thin red line, or even spielberg's very average film, saving private ryan) all concentrate on events that happened 60-35 years ago.  But Black hawk down wasn't in 1945 but in 1992, the soldiers fighting during that movie aren't old or deceased but are in their thirties.  In this war, there are no ""bad guys"", the soldiers only shoot when they get shot at in the first place. But most importantly, this movie will give an idea of what the american soldiers in Afganistan are doing right now.  Like in this film, the ennemy is hiding, it comes out diguised like a normal citizen, and HE always strikes first.Of course BLack hawk down isn't perfect, the movie can be very loud at some times and the action confusing.

Anti-War movie AND fun action movie???,"I think BHD wants to be two sorts of a movie:1. An action movie for the entertainment of the audience. In this point it does very well and any action fan won't loose his money on this flick.2. An anti-war movie. It really tries to be an anti-war movie, showing the misery of modern war and in many scenes you're well reminded of Saving Private Ryan.BUT!!!A movie just can't be a good fun action movie AND a good anti-war movie. These two kinds of genres bite each other and BHD kind of gets ridiculous with that. In the beginning of the movie all the M-60s, AKs and MGs are shooting around and, of course, no one of the Americans gets hit. But, of course, the bad-black skinnies (that's really what they are called in the movie) fall down like rabbits. Really cool to watch! About after the half of the movie you see a lot of American blood, which is a plus for the realism, and the crappy, scary feeling of war comes over you. But then there are two major things missing to be a real anti-war movie like Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan: A story and some characters. They just didn't have time to be set up in the other half of the movie. So when you leave the theatre don't really know anymore what you've seen.Hey! You there! Hollywood, yes you,PLEASE do not have directors of great movies like Alien work with producers of crappy movies like Pearl Harbor.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The DVD extras were almost better than the movie,"When it comes to DVD's there's nothing more annoying than renting a 2 disc movie(which is becoming a standard with the block busters) and then realize the movie sucks which means there's no point in watching the 2nd disc because it's usually about the making of the movie. Well this movie wasn't bad on its own, but it was quite a bad war movie. All the remarkable and beautiful photography(the scene where the hawks are hovering above the sea is forever burnt into my mind)the brilliantly done special effects and Zimmer's score couldn't fully compensate for the poor story and lack of character development. If you watch the extra disc you actually hear the screenwriter and some other people say that they excluded a majority of the actual characters from the original events in order to give the viewer a chance to understand and feel with the important ones. They failed miserably, I couldn't care less for the people portrayed in the movie. War movies usually have some meaning, a moral ending, an abstract ending, something to show how terrible and useless it is. This movie was more like a documentary, but who cares if 19 American soldiers died in some war where so more innocent people were killed before the free world actually did something about it. They didn't have to go to Somalia, they certainly weren't forced. And how does Ridley Scott honor the fallen men. Well, the note at the end speaks for itself. A disgrace, that can only be surpassed by that dear dear movie entitled pearl harbor. It seems that when Jerry Bruckheimer doesn't produce excellent action movies he makes terrible war movie with excellent directors instead. What a waste, because the production value, the acting, the visual and sound effects and photography, even the score(which sounds suspiciously like Zimmer's ""The thin red line"":) ), all is sadly spoiled by the story.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

Poor Film That Could Have Been A Zombie Epic,"Ridley Scott has made a mess. Much like his later effort ""American Gangster"", Scott throws the viewer into a world with no introduction and you are left to pick up the pieces and catch up. Either that or he assumed the audience knew it all before going in. That might explain his use of tiny illegible subtitles to convey information, just like in ""American Gangster"". The actors were almost all wasted. You couldn't tell who was who. They all looked the same. You don't care about them at all. To drive this home, Scott portrays the interchangeable soldiers as arrogant, ignorant cry babies who run when the going gets tough. The American command is portrayed as an electronic age Custer, and the Somali and the Mujahadeen who came to fight the Americans are portrayed as Indians in a 60's western. The whole film is whites vs. black stereotypes with sunglasses and guns. What a terrible film that goes on way too long. Just wasted effort.",2.0,Anonymous,History

"Gritty, powerful, and intense war movie masterpiece","Ridley Scott, director of Gladiator (2000), takes the audience into an intense and realistic re-imagining of an ill-fated mission that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia back in 1993, with gritty performances by a strong ensemble cast and spectacular combat action-set pieces. Set in October 1993, Black Hawk Down tells the story of 123 elite U.S soldiers sent to Mogadishu on a mission to capture Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aided, who has lead mass starvation to the country. Before too long, the mission goes terribly awry when the two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down, leaving the U.S army in a brutal fight for their lives against the Somalian army. The film features a stellar cast including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, Willaim Fichtner, Ewen Bremmer, Jason Isaacs, Orlando Bloom, and many others.What I expect from a war movie is for the horrors of war is to be demonstrated in a strong and authentic manner, and this movie sets a great example of how they should be portrayed. This movie does an incredible job on depicting the harsh reality of soldiers in combat. The plot follows the story how these soldiers are caught in a highly stressful situation when their helicopters are shot down and how they struggle to survive with no help on the way. The combat scenes are absolutely amazing, the camera work and sound editing are very well done and as you are watching these scenes, you get the feeling that you are actually in the middle of the battle. The combat definitely does not hold back in terms of intensity, they are extremely bloody and graphic, and can be tough to watch for those with weak stomachs. At the same time, they are very realistic and give the scenes a gritty atmosphere.While the film does an amazing job on portraying the realism of active combat, the only thing I think it struggles with is the character development. While few of the characters like Josh Hartnett's character Sergeant Matt Eversmann is well constructed and easy to remember, the lot of the characters feel a bit thin, and therefore, not very comprehensible. However, if you really get into the plot and the action, it will be pretty easy to forgive the flawed character development.Black Hawk Down is certainly one of the most realistic and powerful war movies Hollywood has to offer. Ridley Scott did a magnificent job with this movie, and I am proud with the awards it received. This film does get extremely intense, but it is a must-watch for those who have yet to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Uncompromising,"I'm used to typing fairly lengthy comments on IMDb by now (nearly 500 at this point), but I can't think of much to say about ""Black Hawk Down"". I can't really express in words how this film made me feel- it's brutal, tough to watch, unpleasant, completely captivating, stunningly well-shot and edited, quite well-written, and ultimately one of the most uncompromising and unromantic war films ever made. Ridley Scott is an inconsistent director but when he's on form he's really on form, and ""Black Hawk Down"" is a great film. I don't care for the cast all that much, but this is still an absolutely stunning film. After half an hour of introduction to the characters and situation we are thrust into battle. The effect on the audience is tremendously powerful in how sudden and explosive it is, and aside from the near-constantly playing music, ""Black Hawk Down"" is pure, unadulterated carnage which seeks to accurately depict the events in Mogadishu and succeeds. Not an easy film to watch, but genuinely worthwhile.9/10",,Anonymous,History
a bit too much,"ridley Scott, director of the excellent ""gladiator"" the previous year comes back with black hawk down, a war movie reminiscent of saving private Ryan.after finishing this movie, i thought it was not bad. Scott has crafted a vision of war unique to his own style but draws from many other sources. this movie, for me, was just too much. it seemed to be one long battle for the entirety of the movie, with no breaks whatsoever. of course, i realize that's probably how it played out in real life, yet i think that if that is the case, why turn it into a movie? the ending especially seemed to have tried to hard to redeem the rest of the movie for its lack of personal sense. those final moments and scenes, where the idea of war and fighting are discussed, and a fallen soldier is given a final goodbye, bring the movie to a good conclusion, yet seem to not fit with the rest of the film.i also thought as i watched this film how stupid (sorry) the whole movie seemed. they rushed into a dangerous war zone to find a few dead bodies and maybe one or two wounded at risk to the entire squad. why risk the lives of many, maybe hundreds, to save just one or two? sorry, but i really think that it was not worth it for the casualties they sustained in this battle.this movie, though, unlike saving private Ryan, stops not to examine each character individually. instead, they are revealed briefly in the bookend of the movie- either at the beginning or very end. saving private Ryan, on the other hand, begins with a bang and pulls us into the story, then pulls back and crafts the characters realistically and with time.all in all, a good film, though. recommendable, yet not one of my personal favorites.*******/********** (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,History

Good but not Great,"Well, if you want action, this one has it. About two hours of action and that is the major strong point. However, what this movie is short on, is script and emotion. The scenes not involving the actual gun battles are just flat. It had the feel of a Bruckheimer film, create a series of detailed action scenes and then slap a story around it. Part of this might be the fault of the actual story as told in the book, but I don't think so. I am probably being too negative here, because it was a pretty good film. However, some of the action scenes were in desperate need of some other scenes in between. At some points in the film there is action for at least 30 minutes straight, although realistic in a combat situation, it grows tiring in a movie theater setting. Moreover, there were no real standout performances. I believe that the Academy really would have liked to have given a nomination to one of the actors, but nobody really was that strong or stood out. Man, I was too negative. This was a pretty good film. Good but not great. A solid 7.5 on a scale of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"In my opinion, this is one of the best war films ever made","Many people may disagree with this but in my opinion, this is one of the best war films ever made. Sure, it's not a masterpiece but in my opinion, it's very close to being one. This movie is a highly well-done experience.123 U.S. soldiers are dropped into Somalia to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and they find themselves in a desperate battle with a large number of heavily-armed Somalis.Ridley Scott has created one of the most realistic war movies ever. I actually felt that I was in the middle of the war-zone as it was going on. Because of how much it felt like the actual story, the movie creates a high amount of tension and it makes the viewer realize what exactly went on when the real event happened. The movie does an especially superb job on this because of the realistic environments, shots, and acting.The score is fantastic. When certain scenes happen, it draws emotions out of us. Unlike a lot of movies, Black Hawk Down's score works with the movie. This means that without the music when a certain character dies off or when another important scene happens, it will have an impact on you regardless. But the score makes that feeling you had more massive.Many people dislike the fact that this movie didn't have much character development. It is true that it's light on it but this film isn't focused on developing the characters, nor does it have to. It's completely dedicated to providing us with a first-person perspective of being in the middle of combat.This movie does have a lot of suspense but it can be a bit mundane getting to the good parts. The opening is quite overlong and dry. It is full of military jargon and diagrams. But despite this, this movie is definitely worth seeing. After the opening is over, you're in for a big treat.So in conclusion, this is a truly outstanding movie. Even though the opening is slow, this movie will impress you because of how realistic it is. It has realistic environments, shots, and acting. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest war films ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Sorry but it's the wrong type of black...,"The extras seem to be incredibly miscast in this film. Anyone who lives in the UK, well in any of the major cities, will soon realise that people from Somalia just do not look like the people shown in this film. Presumably all American's assume that anybody from Africa (and Somalia is in Africa so we got that right) look just like African Americans ie they can claim their descent from west Africa? Thats a bit of a fatal error for Sir Ridley Scott, who hails from South Shields (my home town), which has had a Somali community well before he was born.While those ""mosques"" look more like those you would find in Morocco. Did Ridley do a ""bulk"" location deal with the Moroccan government on his way to shooting ""Gladiator"" too?Watching the film now in 2005, perhaps one can view it as a bit of substitute ""reportage"" for what the Marines'are actually up to in Iraq or what they have to put up with? As we never actually get to see what they ""do"" on TV or what it is actually like to be an American soldier there, only the aftermath?

One Of the best War Films Ever,"As a war film, ""Black Hawk Down"" is first rate. It's exciting, well paced, and full of lots of action. Director Ridley Scott proves to be at home with the adrenalin rush of modern technological warfare, piling on the firefights, helicopter crashes, and bloody carnage. Continuing the visceral tradition of war films post-""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Black Hawk Down"" scatters body parts round the screen like confetti.The problem is that its subject - American soldiers fighting Somali Muslims - is too close to the current world situation to suit a no-brains action story. In a belated attempt to mould the film to suit the post-September 11th climate, the film makers have added a series of opening and closing titles that desperately try to say something about the Battle of Mogadishu's wider significance, but these simply seem hastily written and ill advised.""Black Hawk Down"" doesn't so much lose sight of the political factors behind the action, as never actually notice them until after the event making it less a film about the American experience in Somalia than a patriotic airbrushing of what was actually America's worst day of combat since Vietnam.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Raw,"This film is just about the closest Hollywood has ever done to creating a war documentary, which can make it a bit difficult to rate as one might a ""regular"" war movie. Unlike films like ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"" which created a fictional tale set in a larger, factual context, this movie shows us the actual men and actions over a hellish 15 hours in Somalia, the well known debacle in which 19 men were killed after a raid designed to capture some of Somalia's worst warlords went awry.First off, I want to address a few criticisms leveled here, most of them coming from left wingers and assorted Euro-trash who seem to have a knee-jerk negative reaction to pretty much anything the American military does. One, though made in co-operation with the Pentagon (like, Duh!, where else are they gonna get all those expensive helicopters?) it is hardly a propaganda piece, if anything, the incident was a major embarrassment to our military, so much so that then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin was fired because of it. The men were sent in unprepared (bad Intel) and without the proper equipment (which was more of a political decision). The men themselves comported themselves bravely (this being no more than historical fact) yet their leaders were often indecisive, vacillating over how to react as one, then a second, chopper got shot down. I myself was practically screaming for additional helicopter gunship support for the beleaguered men, yet for some reason it was used very sparingly even as the guys on the ground were being cut to ribbons.Next is the ""race"" issue. True, far more Somalis were killed than Americans, but as the film shows, the vast majority of these were the warlord's armed thugs, not helpless civilians. Unlike the Viet Cong, the Serbs or even the Nazis, these men were not fighting for any sort of cause other than simply satisfying their own greed. The warlords and their armed mobs (they are not worthy of being dignified with the title of ""soldier"") got rich by plundering the relief supplies that were supposed to go to famine victims. The film accurately portrays these people as the vermin they are, and I must admit my favorite scene was when (finally!) American gunships popped in that night and hosed them down by the dozens with rockets and miniguns. Harsh as it may sound, it was morally satisfying to see these human scumbags exterminated like a bunch of roaches. And the people who can't see the difference between these parasites enriching themselves at the expense of their own people and the ordinary Somali civilians are simply not playing with a full deck.Anyway, that aside, this film succeeds pretty much on every level. People may complain that the characters are not developed enough or that the larger geo-political issues are not explored further, but the movie was simply not intended to do either. Instead, its principal aim is to give a raw, visceral look at the actual events that took place on that fateful day. As others have noted, it takes the approach used in Pvt. Ryan and extends it over almost the entire film. If you want to experience modern close urban combat on a gut level, this delivers the goods in spades. At times I found it confusing, trying to figure out which guys were where, but that merely reflects the reality of the actual confusion. At one point, two soldiers are simply left behind, they'd been completely forgotten when their unit was ordered to move to the first crash site. Really, the only objection I can come up with is that, on a few occasions, Ridley Scott relies excessively of SFX and `artsy' shots, which I found to detract from the otherwise compelling gritty realism.In the final analysis, I cannot really give this film the usual 1-10 scale rating, though it would rank at least a 7 if I did. Mr. Scott and his team of actors, cameramen, and effects guys do a fine job, but it's the story itself that makes this movie what it is. And, for that, we have a bunch of brave American soldiers to ultimately thank.",,Anonymous,History

Black Hawk Down is a knock-out war movie.,"In 1993, American Army Rangers were in Somalia, participating in the OPeration Restore Hope, where they were to help out the people of Somalia gives fresh food and water. Within minutes, all of that was ended up in war. Ridley Scott directs the war epic, Black Hawk Down. Josh Harnett plays one of the soldiers, who participates in the mission. The mission was a raid to contain the people in the raid as the Rangers seal up the area. Soon enough, the raid turns into a disaster as one of the helicopter is shot out of the sky. The raid turn into a rescue and survival mission. While watching Black Hawk Down, I felt the rush of action and war fill up completely. Black Hawk Down is about the mission failure of taking down a Somalia warlord during the 1993 Mogadishu raid. 19 American soldiers died during this raid and over 1000 Somalis died during this event. I really was hooked by this movie because it was loud, yet remarkable and outstanding. The director, Ridley Scott, filled the screen with buckets of blood and gunfire. I salute the 19 American soldiers who lost their lives during this raid and they will never be forgotten. Winner of 2 Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, Black Hawk Down is a knock-out that will blow you off the edge of your seat. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Intense action!,"This is certainly the most intense movie in quite awhile. It is pure and simply a war movie without any frills whatsoever. We don't get to know much about anyone, which I think forces the viewer to look at the total picture's view of war and not get stuck on rooting for individuals.The action scenes are realistic and so gritty that they frankly terrified me. I know I do not have the courage it takes to be a soldier. Added to that is the senselessness of the cause, and the stupidity born of arrogance to assume that Americans are super heroes and Africans are just another incapable enemy.It chooses to look one sidedly at the conflict, which again forces the viewer to experience the hell these poor guys went through rather than be conflicted by objectivity (in a telling footnote we find out that 1,000 Somali's lost their lives to 19 Americans, and we're kept clear of the hell they went through).This kind of an approach reminds me of the old Cowboy and Indian movies, where we root for the outnumbered white guys and the Indians are portrayed as layer after layer of killing robots. We never learn about the enemies rationale for hating us; we never see their heroism; we never see their humanity. We are now finding out what that kind of subjective view of the World can lead to.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good movie,"I just saw this movie last night, and thought it was an excellent movie.  I liked it for many reasons, but mostly I felt it was an accurate depiction, and especially in that they did not try to make any of the rangers or delta force guys out to be some supernatural hero, but instead displayed them as they are more likely to be - human and vulnerable, and perhaps because of that, even more heroic.I also felt like posting because I just read the last review (by Shea someone - forget now) and had some comments about that.  The first are nitpicky - Tom Sizemore did not play the Delta Force character you mention - Eric Bana did (who later played in Hulk).  Sergeant Matt Everston did not lead the raid by any means.  He wa sin charge of one of the 4 Ranger Chalks, which think are kind of like platoons.  An Army Ranger Captain was over the 4 Chalks, and a Lieutenant Colonel was in charge of the ground mission as a whole (both of whom participated in the mission, not just from the sidelines).I also wanted to comment on their comment about it as well taking a negative stance on war (pro vs. con).  I didn't think that it did.  And there was also a statement that this was a war they should never have been involved in.  I think that is a difficult thing to say.  Perhaps the wrong move was to take them out when the going got tough.  It wasn't that they were interfering in a civil war.  It's that they were standing up for human rights.  Warlords were hording food and hundreds of thousands were dying. Certainly that justifies some intervention, but we could debate to no end whether war is justified of not, and so I won't even go there.  But it is easy to say they never should have been there, but also not fair to say that.  I personally think they should have stayed, but this is my opinion, and not a fact.Anyway, in short I thought the film was good, and based on documentaries of the same event, it seems to be fairly accurate in protraying the situation as it was in Somalia in 1993.

"Good, but not excellent","Basically I agree with the majority of the critics, a good movie, but I didn't find it to be as outstanding as most claim.I missed the background information at the beginning, then a lot of necessary info regarding to the why's and how's of the various battlefield decisions and situations. The movie was sometimes difficult to follow. Another thing that puzzled me, and I don't know if this is true, but the film portrays the Rangers as a bunch of idiots, or better said a bunch of ordinary soldiers, ""cannon food"" as the Germans would put it, not in any way the elite troops they are supposed to be. Only Delta is portrayed as an elite force, it's members are seen as self confident, knowledgeable and experienced, and the difference between the two in the movie is mind-boggling.Furthermore, I found a lot of scenes, dialogs and ideas (especially at the beginning of the film) have been ""borrowed"" from films like 'Apocalypse Now' and other Vietnam classics.

The hypocrisy...!,"Not just of the movie, but also of its defenders.""Save your political commentary for another website,"" says one reviewer, who goes on to add, ""Don't dishonor the memory of those who fought and died in an attempt to stop bloodshed and starvation among the Somalis"" and ""the personnel of our armed forces secure our freedom day in and day out"" and ""I'm grateful to our soldiers that have sacrificed for our nation so that I can type these words"".  (I presume this last reference is to the US soldiers who fought in the Second World War, rather than the ones who fought in Somalia, but you never can tell with someone who believes with apparent sincerity that the United States army is securing ""our"" freedom ""day in and day out"".)Actually, political commentary (yes, even the sort of stuff quoted above) IS appropriate here.  This is a movie that opens with the words ""based on an actual event"" followed by a series of statements that purport to give an accurate history of what had been going on in Somalia at the time of the events the movie depicts.  It closes with a statement of fact and a list of names.  It's a hybrid work, NOT pure fiction, and not automatically immune to charges of inaccuracy in the way that pure works of fiction (like ""Star Wars"") are.  Some charges of inaccuracy (or confirmations of accuracy) will take the form of ""political commentary"".  There is just no way around this.One can't even say, in defence of the film, that we should ignore its documentary pretensions and enjoy it as if it were a work of pure fiction. It can't be so enjoyed.  Almost all of the footage is in the form of a music video montage of gore, explosions and rushings to and fro; if this were a movie about an imaginary war between two made-up countries, nobody would give it the time of day.  (Contrast this with something like ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", which is further removed from reality, but less likely to deceive - and in addition, thoughtful, imaginative, even-handed, suspenseful, well crafted, etc.)By the way, my impression is that the majority of people here who object to the film on the grounds that it's deceitful have not only read the book, they object to the film BECAUSE they've read the book.  That's because the book was written in an honest attempt to enlighten its readers and tell the truth, while the film was a flimsy excuse for two hours of cool-looking (in a Ridley-Scottish kind of way) war porn.Also by the way: if speaking the truth about America's involvement in Somalia involves ""dishonouring"" American soldiers who fought there - not that I have a clear idea what this word means - well, tough luck; we should speak the truth anyway.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Review,"Black Hawk Down: Good Movie Ian Cook 10/28/06US Military Forces had been in Somalia outside of Mogadishu for six weeks in October of 1993 in an effort to capture two top officials in the Aideed regime and restore order in the wake of civil war when the events of Black Hawk Down transpired. Black Hawk Down is a film based on a book that takes the viewer through an intimate perspective of the prolonged mission that went awry as a tribute to the Americans that died during the conflict.The screenplay provides a good and thorough description of the Rangers and the mission from beginning to end, but fails to develop the characters fully. The film does, however, demonstrate incredibly well the comradery between the troops in the grim face of war. The action remains overwhelmingly engaging for the entirety of the movie without unnecessary drama that is common in war-like action movies.The film also manages to successfully include more political issues surrounding the conflict including general US involvement, the seizing of food distributions, the interaction between the US and UN forces, and the disruption of civilian natives. The faceless acting also demonstrates how strongly the Somalis feel for their cause as many armed and unarmed people emotionally and bravely storm the crash site, or as children run with the exiting Rangers.The cinematography in itself is quite impressive, but moreover compliments the special effects incredibly with the integration of medium and over the shoulder shots, which provide an intimate interaction with the viewer without losing realism or context of the scene with tight shots. While the opening track is a little distracting and misleading along with the visual portrayal of Somalia, the tonal music beds throughout the movie set the emotion of the scene effectively when necessary. The sound work is also quite well done because it takes a realistic, not emotional, approach to convey most scenes.In conclusion, Black Hawk Down provides a detailed chronological perspective of the operation as well as some background to the conflict in well managed entertaining manner. Well worth seeing, even to write an essay about.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Insubordination?,"I Really loved the movie and want to read the book but haven't had a chance. Perhaps one of you who has or has some insight could answer a question of mine.The only part of the movie that shocked me was when Hoot came back from the ""tax-payer funded, Delta safari"" and basically showed a really disrespectful attitude toward a superior officer (No, I didn't say HIS superior officer). You know the part I'm talking about. It's when the Captain (I believe his name was Steele) berates him for not having his safety on when they were feasting on the roast boar...mmmm roast boar... I remember saying to myself: ""There's no way an ultra-elite member of the military would address a higher ranking officer that way."" If only for the example it would give the other men. And I don't give a rat's ass how long it had been from his last meal. Don't misunderstand I really thought the character played by Bana was cool but I had a hard time swallowing that. Your thoughts would be appreciated. Any Ideas?P.S. Does anyone else have a problem with Josh Hartnett's casting as a Ranger Sergeant. I think Josh Hartnett is a fine actor but he just didn't convince me he was a Sergeant. I could have seen him as one of the Privates though. He just didn't have that Hollywood Sergeant persona...if you know what I mean. He seemed too young and idealistic.",,Anonymous,History

"Some where there to kick ass, others to try to make a difference","This film is about a simple mission that is supposed to take an hour maximum. That soon changes into a full blown battle when a black hawk is shot down. At that moment the U.S. forces loose their initiative and complete chaos breaks out in the streets of Mogadishu as the soldiers are heavily outnumbered trying to stay alive and most importantly keeping their friends alive too. The only advantage they have is their training although many lack the experience.But what is it that makes this film so good? For me it's the reality. Although I have never seen war with my own eyes this film is what I think comes the closest to showing the brutality of warfare. Ridley Scott is a genius in making the perfect atmosphere and that is not lacking in this film.But why is this film more realistic than most other war films? I noticed one thing while watching which takes a huge part in this films excellence. In the battle scenes, everything happens very fast. There are no pausing moments even though something tragic happens there are no close ups of the soldiers faces or emotional music in the background. The battle continues in the same speed as before much like in reality. Now you may be thinking ""but what kind of a war film doesn't have emotional scenes?"" Well this film has emotional scenes and lots of them. They just don't happen in the heat of the battle but instead when the battle slows down or when the soldiers are in a safe place for the time being. It's then when they have time to take a breath and get their minds straight. Thats when they realize all the horror that has taken place. That has a lot of effect on the viewers as well because now we have time to think about the previous events. If you have ever been in a tough situation where you are suddenly in a danger of harming yourself you would know that you don't really think about what to do, you just do it. It isn't until it's over when you realize what has happened.Another thing that helps to make this film so real is that there is no main character. You get to know a few characters but none of them is more important than the other. Ofcurse some have more screen time than others but I think it's very well balanced. Having many characters and no hero that tells the story makes it much easier to connect to them and place yourself in their steps.I think this is the best anti war film ever made. Yes this is an anti war film although it tells a true story about a ""successful"" mission. First of all because the amount of reality as I have talked about, and secondly this mission wasn't really that successful. The tragic truth is that 19 men died in vain. Aidid was still in command. Although he was not the key to the crisis because if you look at Somalia today 20 years later it's still pretty much the same.This film isn't about the mission itself or whether it was successful or not. It's about the men that fight the battle. Even though I think those men died in vain, they are no less heroes as other brave soldiers who die in war. They are heroes because they always look out for each other and leave no man behind. Hoot describes it very well when he explains why he is always on the front lines. ""They wouldn't understand why we do it, they wouldn't understand that it's about the man next to you."" And for me that is what this film is all about. These soldiers are trying to make a difference, to watch out for each other, make sure every one gets home alive. It's just that you don't have much luck trying to make a difference with a gun in your hand.I said earlier that I haven't seen war with my own eyes, but this I know well. My fathers older brother worked for the red cross in Afghanistan 6 months before the battle of Mogadishu. He was shot down trying to safe wounded men. He is the only Icelander that has died working for the red cross. Although that is 3 years before I was born I fully understand this event. He knew the risks but the will to help people who needed it badly that is what kept him working there. It's pretty much the same for those soldiers fighting on the streets of Mogadishu watching out for each other. But their job was not to help people, their job was to fight back. They were all trying the best they could to help but that doesn't really work well with a gun in your hand.In the end this film tells the true story of the soldiers fighting the battle of Mogadishu. No Hollywood style action and no unrealistic events. It tells the truth.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Violence does not make a movie,"I had high expectations for this movie, especially since it has the Ridley Scott name on it. In short, it just turned out to be a very violent movie without any good story. Don't get me wrong, I like action and war movies a lot. Sure, it beats the world record for the number of lost limbs and balls shot in the head (there's barely 2 minutes without any shooting), but it's so patriotic and stupid at the same time. Where can you see a guy cut in 2 pieces with bowels all on the ground say something like ""tell my wife and children I'm well"" the same way you'd tell someone how's the weather. It also gets so repetitive it all comes down to how many bad Africans die. The biggest problem is that it does not even try to explain the problem and how it came to this. Oh sure there's a little introduction but who cares. I did not want a Pearl Harbor in Somalia. With all this said, the action scenes are still very well done, even if the characters are all the same and you don't care about any of them. Is our society so sick this kind of movie gets praised?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good realistic battle sequences,"Not quite as realistic and soul searching as certain scenes within Saving Private Ryan, but the sheer length and ferocity of the battle scenes within Black Hawk Down make it well worth viewing. In my opinion the lead character Josh Hartnett is slightly lacking in personality and is outshone by Ewan McGregor and Tom Sizemore (both of whom provide an amount of humour within the battle). Not giving any of the plot away here (the film title tells you), but the moment the first Black Hawk is downed is atmospheric and tension drenched, and still sends a shiver down my spine when I watch the film subsequently.The film does clearly show how horrific war must be, and with surround sound and large screen, you can almost imagine being there on occasions. If the film has a fault, it is the way that the ending seems to peter out to nothing, but otherwise it is well worth the video rental.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Brilliant Arrogance,"Brilliantly directed and technically perfect illustration of American arrogance.Going in to battle in the middle of enemy held territory without at least 50% reserve is phenomenally stupid.In an operation like that, for every 2 men on the ground they should have had at least 1 waiting in choppers in the air above to be inserted when and where they became needed.That General Garrison accepted responsibility for the outcome only confirms that he was fully aware of this.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A great was movie,"Black Hawk Down is based on a real event in Somalia in 1993. It shows one of many mistakes made by the US Military and it is obvious as the movie progresses, you realize how utterly stupid the higher ranks were when it comes to resources needed to carry out a military operation and when it comes to ensure you have necessary backup if things doesn't pan out as planned...which is usually the case in the military. The commander of the Task Force Rangers had requested light armor and an AC-130 Spectre but Washington did not want to allow that as it would be ""too high profile"". Man...I think someone regretted that crappy decision. What you should probably do is ask the man on the ground what he needs and then give it to him.None of the characters in the movie is really developed, which is a positive attribute. We are shown the military as a team where people care for each other and cover each others' back at all time, and even ready to die for their comrades as we see happen. It is actually amazing that some people can be that unselfish. The cinematography is just great and it goes very well with the music score. I find that Ridley Scott usually has a very good combination between these two elements of a movie (with Prometheus being slightly off to a certain extent).The acting is top notch in all cases and the direction is very good. I have seen the movie a couple of times and I can actually mistake the actors for military personnel. Well, you have certain parts of the movie being a bit too much Hollywood (one of the reasons for the score of 8 and not higher), but overall the acting is very good. I remember when I saw this movie the first time...I just had to finish watching it and once the unit move into the city to get the job done...it is action sequence after action sequence...and it does not feel like too much. The build up in the beginning is a perfect prelude to what is coming later.Too bad though they didn't have the equipment and resources they asked for...if they would have had, the ""skinnies"" would have stayed inside.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A definite must-see for anyone who has just a hint of interest in war films,"After having taped this film off TV, me and my father(who is about as anti-war as you can get, partially due to having a little experience as a soldier) talked about seeing this at some point. It didn't take much more than a few weeks before we decided to see it, and from the moment we put it on, we didn't regret the decision one bit. This film currently holds the record as the best war movie I've seen(before held by titles as Full Metal Jacket, and after that, All is Quiet on the Western Front). It's by far the most realistic and intense war movie I've ever seen, and up there as one of the most effective. Contrary to what I had expected, the better part of the movie is action and intensity. I was under the impression that most of it would be build-up and there would be one or two relatively short war scenes near the end. Or worse, half the movie would be the general and colonels talking about how to get out of the situation. Instead, most of the film is action, and almost all of it is realistic, too. This perfectly illustrates how intense and chaotic warfare is, particularly urban fighting. While this doesn't have the beautiful symbolism and strong message of All is Quiet on the Western Front, it does have the more accurate and disturbing portrayal of war. The plot is good, and apparently mostly true(though I don't know how much is shortened and such to make for more dramatic sequences at the cost of realism). The pacing is incredible. Never before have I seen so long and yet so captivating film. Even more so than The Godfather, I was glued to my seat, barely ever even glancing at my watch. The high level of intensity is kept through pretty much the entire film, from the beginning of the war-scenes that take up almost all of the film. The excellent editing and cinematography also contributes to this. The acting was great. The characters are well-written, though I suppose there are a bit too many to keep track of(though this is because we are introduced to all of those who played an important part at this battle), and not all of them get enough character development or screen-time. The effects and action are fantastic. Amazingly accurate to the real thing, as well. The details, however, are what make the film the nearly perfect piece of war film history that it is; you'll see so many things in this that happen in real life war that are usually overlooked or ironed out, for the people supporting war to keep face. Friendly fire, underrating the strength of your enemies, ignoring a blind angle for even a second... however, the film also has a sour aftertaste of Hollywood and mainstream film to it. This film isn't completely free of the ever-popular and completely ludicrous slow-motion shot of the heroic soldier running from one point to another, while under fire of several automatic weapons at much too close range, and coming through without a scratch. It doesn't hold true, it doesn't happen in the real world, face it. Near the end there is also a dramatic silence, despite the ease with which the enemy could attack our heroes... again, most likely done for effect, rather than realism. There's not much of it, but it still hurts the experience far more than it adds to it. I didn't see this film to see heroic, American soldiers do impossible feats; I saw it to see what by many is being referred to as the most realistic war film ever made. In the end, this still stands as at least one of the best war movies out there, despite some shortcomings. I recommend this to just about anyone who can stand the violence in it, which is quite uncompromising and real. If you're able to see this, and you're not deterred by the reasonably high level of graphic violence, you really should watch it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

Batten the Hatches Down,"What an extraordinary production BHD is, the attention to detail is everything that you would expect from a Ridley Scott film, and is astounding. It's an extensive and interesting cast too, with Sterling work from Eric Bana, William Fitchner and Josh Hartnett; although arguably it is Jason Isaacs (Hello Jason) who has the most to work with in terms of his character. Clearly the groundwork for BHD was laid by the likes of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Thin Red Line', each released three years earlier, and BHD is more of a frenetic onslaught of near-constant combat than either of those game changing war films. It is also the most jingoistic of the three, managing to paint the ill-fated raid in the colours of victory despite the fact that it appears (I admit I'm no expert) to have been misguided and ultimately fruitless, and required the UN to bail the US troops out. In my opinion BHD is every bit as one dimensional as 'The Hurt Locker'. BHD lacks the questioning stance of films like 'Syriana' and 'Body of Lies', although it is a different animal, and being a historical piece BHD perhaps has to be forgiven for that lack. For all its failings BHD remains highly watchable if you are not put off by the constant tinkle of shell cases.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Mission into chaos,"Graphic, full throttle account of the fatal mission into Somalia in 1993 where two US Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by improvised Somali rebel forces. What starts out as a seemingly straight-forward (though not without risks) mission to abduct two high ranking rebel soldiers under the expert guidance of Sam Shepard, soon turns to rubble forcing a number of elite special forces soldiers to risk their lives to retrieve the survivors and casualties as the local population turns against them in droves.Eclectic cast is a bit of an ensemble without a clear headliner, each top-line cast member essentially starring in his own vignette from a different perspective of the battle. Ewen McGregor drops his trademark Scottish brogue as a sheepish, inexperienced marine who's suddenly thrust into a recovery mission more deadly than he anticipated, while Eric Bana also parks his familiar Aussie accent to play a gung-ho urban warrior who lives and breathes firefights. I don't think Bana conveys the swingers to pull that character off, but fortunately the supporting cast of William Fichtner and Tom Sizemore have more than enough testosterone to leave no doubt they're hard-boiled.It's a cut above the more recent offerings, doesn't do pathos and while there's a modest amount of jingoism reflected in the dialogue, it's not over-bearing. Some of the stunts are impressive and the raw and realistic manner in which the Somali rebels are played, is a pretty terrifying enemy to contemplate, despite their apparent lack of resources and professionalism (in this respect there's shades of the embassy battle scene from ""Rules of Engagement"", though more relentless). Hard-hitting, highly entertaining modern war movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History

It's the only thing apart from the TV series Band of Brothers', which really shows you the true meaning of war. All the characters are played well, and Ridley Scott has produced another masterpiece.

A very impressive war movie!,"I usually despise war movies.  My older brother convinced me to watch Black Hawk Down with him.Wow, was I impressed.  This is the most amazing war movie ever filmed.  It's not a bunch of talking generals, planning out their war strategies.  It's about actual combat, and the combat lasts for an entire day in this movie.Basically, Black Hawk Down is a survivor movie.  The characters are flung into total havoc in a hostile area in Somalia, and must battle for their lives and return to base.  Usually survivor movies appeal to me (such as Jurassic Park), and I was so surprised to see just how good Black Hawk Down was.The characters are kind of shallow, however, as there isn't TOO much dialogue in the beginning.  But it's not really necessary, because within fifteen minutes of the movie, the action begins... and never ends.But it's not a dull action.  It's suspenseful (and sometimes comical).

"What I wanted ""The Siege"" (1998) to be.","Remember that small hit (if it was one) in 1998 with Bruce Willis and Denzel Washington about New York being attacked by an terrorist force. I was disappointed in that movie because the 'force' laying 'siege' to New York was just a bunch of crazy loonies with TNT strapped to their chests running around and blowing stuff up. Boom!With a title like ""the Siege"" I expected an invasion force rolling off at NY harbour and starts running through buildings, people running in panic and entire buildings being toppled. Then the US army would come in, try to take control of the situation and run around, trying to chase the invasion force out of New York after much have been destroyed. But I didn't get that. The closest I came, that year, to that sorely missed movie experience was GODZILLA!Then, out of nowhere came Black Hawk Down to rid me of a movie I had wanted to see back then! Not that it had toppling buildings, demolishing tanks, and Mogadishu remained as intact as what it was before the battle depicted in the movie. But instead of the US army chasing around the invades it turned out the US army was the invaders and the Mogadishins were trying to chase them out and that was good enough for me!On a more serious note BLACK HAWK DOWN wasn't as much as an anti-war movie (which it is) as a warning to America that said ""keep your noses out of nonsense that did not involve you!"". After September 11th this idea, which was indirectly caused by operations such as this one.All the acting is superb, the location was excellent and breathtaking and looks like a warzone. The action is grizzly, the pain is practically real. It will make you laugh, it would make some cry, but it is definetly the best war movie of the new mellenium and all others, especially those in a modern setting, would have to be compared to Black Hawk Down.And if Black Hawk Down doesn't take your fancy as a warmovie you could always view it as a comedy of errors.",,Anonymous,History
"Historical, but confusing","I know this post is long after the movie was released, but now that I have watched it a few more times and heard an actual account straight from Eversmann's mouth, I feel ready to post.As for the historical accuracy of the movie, I thought it was rather good. This opinion was reinforced when I heard MSG Eversmann himself give a talk at my school, Johns Hopkins, where he now works in ROTC.  Of course there were things that were embellished and Eversmann himself feels that he was given too much credit and occasionally put in a situation where he wasn't present (like the clamping the artery scene), but he thought that it was extremely good at portraying the intensity of a battle.  If someone wants to know what modern day urban warfare is like, this would be an excellent reference.  Eversmann also feels that the portrayal of the Somalis was accurate.  Many were on drugs during the battle, and he can only guess at how many Somalis were killed by other Somalis (since their tactics often had them at ground level on opposite sides of the road shooting at Americans in the road).  So for themost part, the movie was good at depicting the battle accurately.As for the movie from a movie standpoint, I had some trouble with it. The first time I watched the movie I occasionally had difficulty figuring out who was who and where everyone was in relation to each other.  I know that is just a side effect of the uniformity within the military and the complexity of the battle itself, but it was still a problem I had at first. It is always hard to put so much into a movie and I think this movie did as good a job as it could, but that still left me a little confused.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
'Only the dead have seen the end of war',"'Only the dead have known the end of war.'This is the statement by the classical philosopher Plato with which the film commences. And it is well chosen for this is the theme of this magnificent and thought provoking film.I don't need to say any more on the excellent cinematography and pacing of Black Hawk Down, as so many of the threads have noted. It is a Ridley Scott film after all. His eye never fails him but he is always reliant on a good script and his failures have been films lacking them but here the script is for its subject spot on.I wish to make my own personal, political observation, which is what the film provokes in me, beyond, of course, its excellent entertainment value.In the jargon of geopolitics, Somalia was, and today tragically still is, a 'failed state'. Without preaching at you, Black Hawk Down gives you the visceral experience of what fighting in a failed state is like, from both the American and the Somali perspective. The film hints at the limits of American power with echoes of the previous American defeat in Vietnam but also at the idealism which brought American soldiers into the country in the first place, trying to bring peace, justice and food to the desperate, starving and cruelly exploited Somali populace. The fate of the West, and perhaps the fate of the world, now more than ever will depend upon a hundred more such missions as depicted in Black Hawk Down and whether we win them or not; indeed, whether we fight them or not. This is the ultimate test of humanity, to be borne by both civilians in the midst of a brutal civil war and the peacekeeper soldiers brought in from outside whose story is told in this film.This entertaining but also harrowing film provides the cue for the more thoughtful of us to reflect on the human condition. Given the perfect geopolitical storm, is any country on this earth, , entirely immune from the risk of becoming a 'failed state'? We should not arrogantly assume that any of our countries could never, ever descend to the level of Somalia, with brave but stressed soldiers struggling to hold the ring and civilians caught in the murderous crossfire. This is what Black Hawk Down means philosophically to me, a warning for the future for any country, however prosperous and peaceful it may presently be, and a warning for the future of humanity.With regard to the performances, I thought that Eric Bana was particularly good in the film as a reflective, quietly competent, decent and brave American soldier. I wish we had subsequently seen more of him.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Focus is the reason Black Hawk Down is a really good movie,"Black Hawk Down **** One of the best movies of 2001.A story about a moment; a story about a feeling, a story about an accomplishment can be really good or even great when focused. Black Hawk Down does this brilliantly. The moment is 16 hours, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia. The feeling is confusion. The accomplishment is doing the job you are trained to do. Black Hawk Down stays focused for 2 ½ hours on the lives of couple hundred U.S. soldiers that are ordered into a very dangerous situation to arrest two men that the United States and United Nations believes are stopping the distribution of food to Somalia civilians. The men to be arrested are in a market district of Mogadishu that is very heavily defended. The firepower provided to accomplish the mission is restricted by Pentagon or Washington D.C. directives.Given their orders, the U.S. soldiers move in for what is planned to be a 2 or 3 hour mission. The arrests are made but then two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down. The soldiers are ordered to secure the crash sites and wait for the rescue units to come in and retrieve them. The well-armed and organized Mogadishu fighters that control this part of the city, hold down the U.S. soldiers. The U.S. convey that is moving in to rescue and retrieve is lost on the narrow and unmarked streets of the city. Roadblocks have changed the planned route of entry and egress. Overhead cameras on surveillance helicopters are sending pictures to the command post. Routing instructions are useless because the convoy passes the turn points before instructions can be relayed.  All the while, the men in the convoy, the men moving toward and at the crash sites, and the men with the prisoners are under intense and constant enemy fire.Even after watching for 2 ½ hours it is impossible for me to imagine the fear and confusion that must have been weighting on these men.  Ridley Scott uses all the special effects technology available to him as a filmmaker to make bullets, rockets, blood and guts seem real or at least terrifying.  And after 16 hours (the real time for this battle) these men stayed true to their mission.  They accomplished what they were trained, asked, ordered to do.  Only sixteen Americans died which seems amazing when watching this reenactment of the battle.The best line of the movie comes at the end when one soldier explains to another that he doesn't even want to try and explain what he does and why he does it for the people back home.  `They won't understand.'  I know he's right.  This movie knows he's right. And that's what makes Black Hawk Down a good movie. The movie stays focused on the 16-hour battle and the U.S. soldiers doing their job and the conditions under which they had to do this job.  Focus is the reason Black Hawk Down is a really good movie.On a side note: whether you see the movie or not, I highly recommend the book by Mark Bowden.  Bowden's book relates the same confusion, fear, and resolve that we see in the movie.  While focused on the 16-hour battle, the book is able to go beyond the fight and tells us about some of the men.  It also sets up the political situation that contributed to U.S. soldiers being put into this situation.  The epilogue to the book is a fascinating, yet brief, telling how Bowden was able to find this story and learn what happen so he could write the book.Read the book.  Go see the movie.  Both are ****.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"All together, a really good film","I thought this movie was very good. Although, my parents said that they didn't like it because it was thought out to be this heroic story, and there is nothing heroic about this story. And they even left out a lot of information about the actual characters. But I don't think it's really supposed to be about the characters so much as the story.The story of these men going into battle to capture two warlords. It's not supposed to be heroic and it's not necessary that you know everything about the characters past. If you see this movie, and don't look into much about it, I think you will like it. I looked into it and still liked the movie. So it really just depends on how you rate your movies. I wouldn't miss this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Technically well-made but strangely lifeless.,"Black Hawk Down is a technically well-made film that left me feeling strangely unsatisfied and empty.  For all of the hype that I heard concerning the movie's battle scenes, I found them to be incoherent and for the most part, overrated.  Some have said that this film deserves comparison to Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan.  I feel that Apocalypse Now is in a far better category, and even though I had some problems with Saving Private Ryan, it still packed more of a wallop.The problem with Black Hawk Down is that it seems to be a cinematic void. It doesn't really have much of a direction, other than almost two hours of gunfire spraying the streets of Somalia.  As an accurate representation of what happened in Somalia, I am sure it is superb.  However, I go to the movies to become involved in a story, although not necessarily through identification with the characters (Apocalypse Now and The Thin Red Line are good examples of war movies without lovable characters that involved me). However, Black Hawk Down was void of any real connection for me, so that by the end, I was just staring at the screen.Part of this is due to the way that Scott chooses to present the horrors that happened on October 3, 1993.  By consistently barraging us with gunfire and RPGs exploding, we are actually desensitized.  There is none of the surprise or suspense of Saving Private Ryan.  I understand that this is a film based on a true story, and not an action film designed to deliver cheap thrills, but it comes across more as a nonstop shooting gallery.  Some of the best moments in the film are the quiet ones: the helicopters flying over the beaches before what is supposed to be a routine mission, the eerie sight of an empty city in prayer for only a few fleeting minutes, and the silent running of the American soldiers back to their base.  But these moments are few and far between, and they only offer glimpses of the truly chilling war picture this might have been.Some have complained that this film is racist because it does not present the views of the Somalians or explain why some of the civilians acted the way they did.  This is a legitimate complaint, but it did not bother me, because the movie makes it clear early on that it is about the soldiers and what they went through.  I was really looking forward to a film which actually contemplated what it was like to be a soldier, not knowing what to do next or whether you had been abandoned.  Unfortunately, the film, while offering glimmers of my hope, also provided ample war movie cliches.  By the third time a dying soldier said ""Tell so-and-so so-and-so"", I almost rolled my eyes.In a film with hundreds of different actors, only two really left me with any memory whatsoever.  Josh Hartnett (who I'm usually not a big fan of) was excellent in his role as the meditative sergeant who is actually afraid to be where he is.  The other actor is the always reliable character actor Tom Sizemore, who creates a strong character out of only a few lines. Unfortunately, other strong talents like Ewan MacGregor are largely wasted. I understand that this is not by nature an actor's movie, and I wasn't hoping for cliche caricatures, just some human connection to make me care when the bullets started hitting the soldiers.To the film's credit, it does delve into some of the fears felt by the soldiers in a situation like this.  The film gets better as it goes along, as nighttime falls, we feel an eeriness.  Scott does an excellent job of actually taking us to this city with all of its chaos and fear.  But as with most of Scott's films, the technical brilliance is overshadowed by a curious lack of any connection to anything.  Even the impressive camerawork left me with only fleeting memories of memorable shots.  And I still can't think of one scene that I could call great in the movie (by contrast, Apocalypse Now is virtually one stringed after another).  Black Hawk Down, for all of its technical superiority, could have been so much more with just a shred of spine.  Instead, we have a film that is better than most of what Hollywood offers, but still very disappointing.Rating: 58/100.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Some argued that Somalis are depicted unfairly throughout the film.2. Critics assert that the film lacked realism since Somalis were portrayed by African Americans, as opposed to actors from Africa.3. Leadership for both the Malaysian and Pakistani military argued that the film significantly downplayed their contributionsOverall its a very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
I never thought I'd call a Jerry Bruckheimer production the best film of the year.,"**** out of ****To call Black Hawk Down the best film of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's career might not say much, considering he was responsible for silly action thrillers like Con Air, Gone in Sixty Seconds, and Bad Boys,  but that would be short-selling this amazingly crafted war film, brilliantly helmed by Ridley Scott, a director who's on a critical and commercial streak unlike any filmmaker since Steven Spielberg.The opening scenes, played over the haunting sight of dead bodies, recounts the events that led up to the disaster in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. In 1993, warlord Mohamed Aidid is more concerned with keeping power than feeding his starving people, claiming the food brought in by the U.N. as his property.  Once Aidid starts attacking American military personnel, U.S. American rangers and the Delta Force are sent in to deal with the situation, namely by capturing two of Aidid's top aides.The mission was estimated to last only an hour, but everything goes horribly wrong when a ranger misses his jump and is wounded.  A black hawk is then shot down, and eventually, the rangers and Delta Force are stuck in enemy territory, engaging in a fierce firefight with thousands of Somali militia that would last 17 hours and claim over a thousand lives.Black Hawk Down is an interesting war film in that it never pushes and force feeds us any moralization or blatant, patriotic flag-waving.  It's not necessarily concerned with giving us the political background, only the chaotic warfare, because let's face it, these soldiers didn't give a damn about politics once the fighting began.  All that mattered at that point was survival and keeping the men next to you alive.There have been plenty of complaints about this film's political stance, that being that it's pro-American all the way, but I can't entirely agree. One of the film's major strengths is the unbiased, neutral manner in whichit views the situation (something that was also accomplished by Steven Soderbergh's Traffic).  After all, the film also shows how the plight affects Somali civilians.  True, the militia is almost a faceless mob, but to the soldiers, that's exactly what it was.  Another strenght is that Ridley Scott never tries to tell us how we should think or feel about United States' foreign involvement.  He simply presents the facts at hand, and lets us resolve everything else with our own opinions and deductions.  To some, that will seem like lazy filmmaking, but I find much to appreciate in a film that's open-minded and willing to respect its audience's intelligence. True, whatever opinion you held about America's involvement in foreign nations may not change, but it says a lot that Scott's film makes you think about it.But for now (meaning the duration of the film's running time), forget about politics.  Where Black Hawk Down excels (and magnificently so) is in the battle scenes, and Scott choreographs some of the best action sequences I've ever seen.  For nearly ninety minutes, we're bombarded with over a dozen firefights, all of which display a gripping intensity that rivals Saving Private Ryan.  The fear of being outnumbered, outgunned, and being killed is presented in a harrowing, all-too-believable fashion that makes this film an effective emotional powerhouse.  Despite frequently going back and forth between several groups fighting in the city, it's a credit to Scott's direction and Pietro Scalia's editing (which received an Oscar, by the way) that the battle scenes remain intelligible and clear, even if it's confusing and hectic for the soldiers.  Scott's aim to show the hell a soldier experiences in combat leaves nothing to the imagination, so be prepared for graphic, realistic violence.Another critical backlash against the film is the so-called lack of character development, with many critics and viewers pointing to We Were Soldiers as a better film overall because of its rich characterizations. I also disagree on this matter, since I found Soldiers' characterizations often corny and unbelievable.  If anything, Black Hawk Down never loses sight of the characters.  It may be a bit unusual for some viewers to see that Scott wasn't striving for a star-driven vehicle, but a team effort, because it was as a team that these rangers and Delta Force fought for their lives.  Even then, there is attention paid to several specific individuals.Coming in top-billed is Josh Hartnett as Sgt. Matt Eversmann, an idealistic, young soldier who's first taste of combat leaves him reeled and conflicted. Hartnett has never been a great, or even especially good, actor, but he's fine here.  Tom Sizemore is excellent as Danny Mcknight, the colonel heading the convoy as they make their way through the streets of Mogadishu.  Ewan Mcgregor brings some humor to the role of Grimes, a coffee-maker who's suddenly been plopped into combat.  He's shaky at first, but never loses his confidence.  As good as those performers are, for me, the best performance of the film belonged to William Fichtner.  Fichtner, always a solid character actor, is simply superb as the take-charge, courageous Sgt. Jeff Sanderson.  With each tense situation, he keeps his cool and strategizes he and his men's way through each firefight.  If I were in battle, this is the kind of soldier I'd want fighting beside me.  The film also plays a developing friendship between Sanderson and Grimes, and Fichtner and Mcgregor have good, palpable chemistry together.The rest of the cast is good, with Jason Isaacs as a strict, but well-meaning captain.  Ewen Bremner plays Nelson, one of two soldiers who gets left behind by the convoy.  His barely contained panic is so effectively conveyed, you almost feel like you're right there with him. Eric Bana is good as the Delta Force soldier trying to retrieve his comrades, and Ron Eldard is fine as pilot Michael Durant.There is much technical merit to be lauded, with Slawomir Idziak's atmospheric cinematography conveying the haunting, tragic mood. Hans Zimmer's score is among his better work to date, even if parts of it feel a little too derivative of his own work in Gladiator.By the end of this 144-minute experience, it's unlikely you'll ever view modern warfare the same again.  This is a clear display of the fact that the U.S. is not a perfect fighting force (though they certainly, as Roger Ebert put it, ""gave better than they got""), but even more importantly, this is a film that delves in important issues such as foreign involvement, fighting for your mates, and more importantly, the horrors and reality of combat, without ever insulting the audience's intelligence.",,Anonymous,History
The war movie fan's dream.,"It's clear that what they wanted to do here was the longest action sequence in movie's history. Everything else is irrelevant. They found a real story to back the razzle-dazzle action, and off they go. The fact that this is a Ridley Scott movie actually saves this from being completely boring and uninteresting. Because frankly, the premise is too thin. You can experience some emotion when the movie is building up to the military offensive but then when it actually comes, it is so long that you only the die-hard-military-movie-fan will not be eventually bored by the constant sound of bullets, gunshots, explosions and the occasional gruesome violence. In other hands, this would turn out an atrociously awful turkey. But Ridley Scott has surrounded himself with the experts, and thus it is explained all the oscar-hype around the movie. His talent manages to save the script and make this slightly above the standard war action fest. But don't be cheated about a movie that is way too long to sustain such a simple story. They should have been more modest. Anyway, the production values are top-notch, specially the cinematography. A well-decorated mess.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Kicking ass for a good cause - no kidding,"This movie is fascinating and interesting for two reasons. It is fascinating because it is a 100% pro-war, pro-American propaganda movie in the style of Dr. Goebbels, and it is interesting because it is obvious that that kind of bold propaganda still finds an audience.This movie tells the story of some American soldiers who are trying ""to kick some ass"" in Mogadishu - for a good cause as the movie tells us, leaving an uninformed audience with a wrong premise and doing an excellent propaganda job for all those who believe in what they are being told. On top of that, the intro tells us, that it all is based on a true story. False premises and alleged authenticity are mixed into a dangerous cocktail, typical for propaganda.Then, the movie develops into a bold good-guys-against-bad-guys-story. All the American soldiers are shown as good people, they all have hobbies, play chess, basketball or draw children's books (no kidding). They make jokes and laugh, they are happy, good people who happen to be in the army because they want to fight a war for the good. The bad black guys all look gloomy, pray to Allah and shoot their machine guns for fun. The do not smile unless they do something nasty. When the Americans move out, rock music is played in the background. When we see the ""enemy"", you can hear some weird Arab music or threatening noises.And so on. The reason for why the Americans actually are there is never questioned. They are there, apparently for shooting the bad guys in order to teach them that shooting is bad. Interesting.Some reviewers claim that this is a good war movie. Well, there are two kinds of war movies: pro-war movies and anti-war movies. This is a pro-war movie. It shows glossy, beautiful fighting scenes with rock music in the background. It does not show what war does to the people. It does not show mushed heads, brains, bones, pus and horror. It shows fair, chivalrous and over all heroic American soldiers who remain fair no matter how unfair the enemy might be. It shows a clean war, where not too many civilians are hurt and where the US Army only hits those who ""deserve"" it.I despise movies that propagate war like this one does. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a prime example of how the US film industry creates bold propaganda in a time when the US government needs it. It is a shame that a director like Ridley Scott does such stuff. And now I have to correct myself: it is not propaganda à la Goebbels, because even the propaganda made by the Nazis was a great deal more subtle than this homage to American imperialism.If you want a good anti-war movie, pick ""Das Boot"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"". Even ""Platoon"" shows you more of the cruelty of war. This movie shows nothing of it, on the contrary. It should be banned for lying so hard about such serious issues. A shame.",1.0,Anonymous,History

gritty & realistic,"whereas saving private ryan introduced the hand held camera mode, this film is its culmination.there is a great deal of shooting in this movie but for once it is an integral part of the action. war and combat are very violent and you need to properly portray that in a film like this, especially one based on true events. if you don't know, an RPG is a rocket propelled grenade, and there seemed to be a lot of them in the hands of the somali warlord's camp. by the way aidid, was a real bastard. there seems to be a type that, given the opportunity, will use conflict to make an advantage for themselves and sacrifice the freedom and lives of their fellow citizens to maintain that advantage. collaborators during WWII, east bloc dictators, and office politickers are counted in this group. aidid used the famine in somalia to establish a private army which would confiscate the food aid meant for his starving countrymen. the U.S. under clinton stepped and sent delta force soldiers to establish some order and capture aidid. this attempt ended in tragedy and this film depicts the circumstances and events of the raid.I remember the news about the failed somalia mission and to this day I feel that blacks in Africa have no one but themselves to blame for the fact their continent is the most backward, undeveloped and violent today. rwanda genocide, civil war in congo, massive corruption in nigeria are a very few examples of the situation. you try to help them and all that happens is they drag your soldiers' dead bodies behind a pickup truck to shouts of glee.

7 on a scale of 10,"I give this movie a 7 somewhat begrudgingly. The reason is because I didn't particularly enjoy it. In fact, after the first hour I was much more interested in the amount of time remaining than I was in the movie. It was constant action, but it was also sort of boring. The reason is because the action was so constant and so consistently the same thing, that it was tiring long before it was over. Minus 1 point.I also deducted a point for the fact that not one single character was even remotely developed. You could EASILY have watched this movie without knowing a single name or a single personal characteristic about any character and you would have lost nothing. The reason is because there was virtually nothing to lose. Far too impersonal. It seems to me we should have been much more aware of at least what was at stake for several of the characters. Instead it was one constant blitz of bullets - the result of which, we really didn't care who got hit since we knew some would get killed and some wouldn't. Minus 1 point.Lastly, I am sick and tired of movies that have the same ludicrously unrealistic scene. Well, in this case, scene after scene after scene. Close your eyes. Imagine 50 soldiers in the street. Now imagine another 50 of the enemy (all with automatic weapons) in the windows and roofs surrounding the soldiers. Now imagine all of them shooting at each other with little cover. Thousands of rounds per minute. OBVIOUSLY, the 50 in the street would be dead within 30 seconds. Well, there you have it. There are numerous 5 minute scenes just exactly as I described where instead of 50 soldiers in the street getting killed, perhaps 3 got hit and they were successfully carried off. Completely ridiculous. Minus 1 point.If you just want to watch blood and guts, you got it - perhaps the best blood and guts movie ever made.

Black Hawk Down is a well produced and directed war film that immerse you with its authenticity - My Ultimate Review,"Black Hawk Down is both produced and directed by Ridley Scott, he's a talented visionary director. Ken Nolan wrote the screenplay and it's based on the non-fiction book of the same name. The story is about the US military's raid in Mogadishu. Fans of the war genre, this film is entertaining because of the realistic battle scenarios and how authentic everything feels. But you could also call it an anti-war movie because of the psychological part of the film as it goes deep into how heartbreaking and bad war is, yet war never changes. Ridley Scott captured the horror of war perfectly.The film features a large ensemble cast, including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Sam Shepard, Kim Coates, Ewen Bremner and Tom Hardy in his first film role. It's truly a large ensemble as there's characters that are apart of 75th Rangers, Delta Force and 160th SOAR (Night Stalkers). The performances each actor does is incredible, even the lesser known actors at the time did great. The huge amount of training, both at the gym and the boot camp they went through. Remarkable.Black Hawk Down won two Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Rightfully so as the sound is truly epic and realistic, I love the editing too. The film was also nominated for Best director and Best Cinematography, both worthy nominations but the cinematography is incredible. I also want to praise the musical score and the choice of songs. Every single detail of the production that makes it more authentic, they did. Seriously a quality production were everyone was at their A game.I have watched this film more times than I can count, but never the extended cut. For this viewing, that changed. I bought the 4K edition and everything looks amazing, sound incredible and it's the perfect experience except for cinema. The vivid colors, everything is so sharp and colorful. The extended cut is worth a watch but the theatrical cut worked for me on DVD and bluray, but the extra scenes was nice to see. Now if you're looking for a war movie that is 100% historical accurate then this isn't for you, it has its inaccuracies. It isn't meant to be a documentary and I'm glad it wasn't, it's cinema, the dramatic liberties they took are there for the better if we're talking film. I think they did a great job at portraying the events, it's an incident that needs to be remembered.Black Hawk Down is a war film that I have watched numerous times and will continue to do so, I find every single moment excellent and hope you do too. The sound editing will blow your mind.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"I left the theater feeling ""exhausted""","This was a good war movie, period.  As usual, Tom Sizemore did a good job. And Tommy Lee Jones Jr. (Josh Harnett) did a good job and didn't have to be a ""pretty boy"" to pull off a convincing roll as a SSGT.  I noticed many good things in this movie.  The key theme was that ""nobody get's left behind"". This was proven when that one soldier placed a hand in his bag.  Let's face it, this is war!  Lots of men died in a very violent way.  This movie was true and it wasn't sugar coated.  Ridley Scott didn't use too much of his SKIP FRAME PHOTOGRAPHY which was a relief.  However, he did use some strange techniques.  Like the hand in bag scene.  I guess he's trying to come up with some new techniques that will place him in a unique catagory along with Marty S and Stanley K.   Oh, I was surprised that Ewan McGregor pulled off such a good act.  He is good at changing his accent.  There is a scene at the end where an old African Man is carrying a baby and walks RIGHT BY THE CONVOY.  I thought for sure that the old man had a bomb inside the baby or a gun hidden behind him, but no.  Ridley Scott wanted to keep true to this story as possible.  One thing I did wonder is what they ever did to that POW.  That guy was really messed up!  The Somalian that was interrogating him said it all when he mentioned that war is just a way of life for his people.

Intensely Realistic War,"If you are into war movies then this is the movie for you.  As a war movie it captures the essence of war.  It is not political it is about war and the brutality, the senselessness, the utter chaos that can be a battle.  Black Hawk Down comes down to a fight to stay alive and to keep your comrades alive.

A riveting and deeply disturbing movie,"As a lietenant who has undergone two years, albeit compulsory, military training, I can identify with the reality that such a war scenario in ""Black Hawk Down"" will someday surface in my life.Should we return for a rescue mission?  Can we live with the fact that we had sacrificed soldiers for the safety of others?  How many need there be before it is justified to return?  Can we live with soldiers who fight for us knowing that should they be down one day, their own troops may not come back for them?  If so, can they be psychologically prepared to still fight?These disturbing questions rattled through my head as I watched the rapid escalation of violence and loss of life that accompanied the decision to return.The first vivid scene of the apparent death of the first soldier after he fell off the chopper rifled home the psychological shock of the closeness of death that no amount of simulated military exercise can bring.  The following two scenes that were to me the best two were those of the realization of the team of two soldiers that they Humpheys were not coming back for them, and the scene when the Somalian mob descended upon the soldiers in the chopper.The feeling of being alone in a violent crowd, just waiting to die, must be unbearably lonely and desolate.  ""Politics are immediately forgotten the first moment a bullet whizzes by your ear"".  Well said.A good war movie to show those political leaders what not to put their citizens through, and to think very carefully over their decisions before the dreams and hopes of bright young men perish amid the violence of war",9.0,Anonymous,History
It's about the man next to ya...,"With stunning visual movies such as BLADE RUNNER and GLADIATOR, Ridley Scott brings us yet another spectacular film.  This time, it's in the form of one of the greatest depictions of war ever to be brought to the big screen.The film is based on actual events in Mogadishu, Somalia, 1993.  At the time, Somalia was a nation conflicted with civil war.  Somalian warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid, commanded a militia whose methods of control led to genocide.  Elite American soldiers, Army Rangers and Delta Force, needed to extract Aidid's two top lieutenants.  Major General Garrison, played by Sam Garrison, scheduled a raid that was to take no longer than an hour.  What was supposed to take an hour, resulted in a 24 hour firefight in which 19 American soldiers lost their lives.A major objective in the mission was to not leave any man behind, and the soldiers certainly obeyed and were discipled to that rule.  The actors were familiarized with how the Army Rangers and Delta Force trained by participating in a week long training demonstration.  From learning how to properly hold a gun to blowing up doors, the actors learned a lot.Great performances from all the actors, especially Eric Bana. This film, and the Australian drama, CHOPPER, catapulted Bana to international stardom.  A true depiction of what war is like and what soldiers go through out on the battlefield.  ***1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,History
A great *war* movie,"I recently took in Black Hawk Down, a film chronicling a US special forces mission in Somalia in 1993.   Originally scheduled for release in March of this year, the studio decided to try and capitalize on the recent peak of patriotism in the States and moved it to January.They also did something else unusual for a war movie, and opened it in LA and New York for Oscar consideration.   Having seen the movie now, I believe it truly raises the question ""What makes a great movie, rather than just a great genre movie?""There is no doubt that Black Hawk Down is a great war movie.    Hell, with Ridley Scott directing (Blade Runner, Gladiator) and Jerry Bruckheimer producing (Top Gun, The Rock, Pearl Harbor), you were almost guaranteed a great war movie.    After a brief 20-minute introduction to the situation in Somalia and the mission assigned to the soldiers, you are thrown right into the middle of war.   Not as a spectator, but as a participant.For the next two hours, your senses are assaulted by a barrage of automatic weapon fire, explosions, helicopters crashing and people dying, and you are right there along with them.   This is no small feat of directing.   Even Saving Private Ryan, which opens with one of the most incredible battle scenes ever put to film, never managed to draw you right into the fight -- there was always that feeling of being a horrified observer.Nor do you feel overwhelmed by flag-waving patriotism.  The film certainly chronicles some moments of true bravery and heroism, but the entire mission was a disaster, and the movie pulls no punches there either.  The efforts to retrieve two top henchmen of a Somali warlord quickly turns ugly when one of their Black Hawk helicopters gets shot down.  This small group of soldiers was grossly outnumbered and seriously got their asses kicked all over the screen.Filmed in Morocco, in and around a US military base, the movie maintains its' gritty third-world feel, and I'm certain Bruckheimer used *every* last ounce of pull he had to get the US government to lend four real Black Hawk helicopters to the production, and I'm certain that much of the cool technology we see on display was also straight from Uncle Sam's storehouses.Yet despite all the attention to detail, despite creating an incredibly intense movie-going experience, I still can't bring myself to call it a great movie.  A truly great movie would have done everything above, and still managed to teach me about the conflict in Somalia.   A truly great movie would have made me care about at least a few of the men who risked, and lost, their lives, rather than assuming I would empathize with them just because they are soldiers.  Quite simply, the movie lacked the heart it needed to be elevated to the next level of greatness.Then again, with the level of mediocrity in Hollywood these days, just being a great type of movie is still an impressive accomplishment.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A RAW REAL TO LIFE SURVIVAL WAR STORY, EXCELLENT.","""Black Hawk Down"" was a huge hit way back in early 2000's & i loved it from the first time i rented it from Blockbuster on video!!!
I was already a Josh Hartnett fan from Halloween H20, The Faculty & Pearl Harbour & yes i like those films & think Hartnett is a very good yet way underrated actor, he's a solid intense actor who proved himself once again as a great leading man with his excellent performance in 30 Days of Night (2009) & here in Black Hawk Down he's great once again but this time he's part of a big ensemble cast.
Actor Ron Eldard actually steals the show here in my opinion or is my favourite character here, Eldard plays Mike Durant a rescue copter pilot who ends up crashed right in the middle of the ""Hot Zone"" & it's the scariest sequence as he's injured & gets out & lays in a room of crumbled old building with his rifle taking out tons of enemy street soldiers until his gun is empty & then things get really scary!!! A great actorThis shockingly violent & gritty real to life true story of survival war film is set in a hot zone war torn part of Somalia, a group of US Army Rangers get caught in an extremely violent conflict of war in the most dangerous hostile part of the city & basically have to run & fight their way out to safety, it's an intense & scary situation with bullets wizzing by not stop & angry violent Somalia warriors everywhere hunting down our soldiers.
The huge excellent ensemble cast has lots of good actors & know the face types, we have of course Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Orlando Bloom, Tom Hardy,
Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, Kim Coates & more!!!
This is also excellently directed by legendary Ridley Scott & boasts fast paced intense action & exciting edge of the seat moments, the cinematography is sharp & raw that shows the grittiness of the broken war torn city, this is one of the greatest war films ever made in my opinion.
The fact this actually happened is very scary & makes everything even more intense & emotional.
Just a fantastic survival tale in a deadly savage place where killing is common everyday acts.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Almost completely action oriented war movie with amazing camera work but little elements which go beyond immediate battleground,"I've almost forgotten how patriotic Americans are before seeing Black Hawk Down again. There's almost no scene where natives are being portrayed as human beings. And that's my main concern with this movie. I think real war horror would have felt much better if killings of all those thousands and thousand of natives brought more emotion. Instead, this movie has a great replay-ability because it's fun and cool. Other than that, everything else is very fine; be it production, sound design, effects etc. I have to mention amazingly done camera work; camera is very dynamic and shaky hence putting you straight into the combat. Bad camera work was my main problem with David Ayer's Fury. So to conclude the first part: this movie is not similar to Schindler's List, but is more like Saving Private Ryan with almost non-stop action.Let me remind you that Ridley Scot produced Blade Runner (1982) and directed Alien (1979). Blade Runner was nominated for special effects and Alien won one for special effects. It's no wonder than that BHD feels so great and fast paced. If only I had seen it in the cinema! Acting performance was convincing and solid be it American soldiers or Somali people. In my opinion latter ones out-casted American soldiers. Their role was to play savages and they did a great job. And no matter what other claim, this dichotomy of savage-soldier is pretty obvious.I think directing and producing war movies is the toughest of all genres. Here you stand in front of a phenomenon which is much larger than anything else one person can comprehend. All those tears and pains, angers and reliefs, all those ""quite human"" reactions and behavior has to somehow be presented to a viewer. I don't think BHD does that very good. I love, for example, scenes where American soldiers joke around in their base just before leaving for battleground. But this alone is just not enough. There's a scene where and old man bears a dead child in his arms in the territory where bullets fly around. All those attempts to present real war horror where overshadowed with focusing to much attention on one side only. Yes, I know plot was written to tell a story about those 123 American soldiers who had to fight someone else's war, but ten minutes would've been enough to make this much more emotional movie.In conclusion: if you're in for a lot of action accompanied by amazing camera work that will make you feel like a comrade, you won't find few movies as good as BHD. If you're looking for true war horror which goes beyond battleground, look for something else.",7.0,Anonymous,History

An effective but incomplete depiction,"The following is more a critique about the film compared to the book, than a review.  I give this film 3 stars and a thumbs up.  This is what Pearl Harbour should've been like.I'm sure people who read the book will react differently from those who didn't.  The book is excellent in cranking out the many details that transpired,  making the reader feel like they are right there.  So many anecdotal events occurred,  it seems strange that a 2 hour and 20 minute movie could not show them all,  even though the actual event lasted a little over 12 hours.  Most people have already seen `Saving Private Ryan'.  We were all shocked by the brutal reality of battle,  and the film deservedly got many Academy Award nominations.  So this time around,  when the blood splatters on the camera lense,  it feels somewhat familiar.   'SPR' also worked because many of the cast were fresh faces,  allowing us to see them as their characters,  not as familiar actors.In 'BHD',  we see Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, and others from Bruckheimer's 'Pearl Harbour'.   That cast,  along with the battle,  is fresh in most people's minds (since it was mandatory that everyone see it).    So this time around,  we, the audience,  feel like we've got combat experience going into this film.   Also,  Ewan McGregor,  now quite familiar as a Jedi Master with a Scottish accent in `Star Wars',  does a poor job with an American accent.  One thing that both 'Private Ryan' and 'Pearl Harbour'  did NOT have during their battle scenes was music.  Without music,  the battle scenes feel like documentary footage.  With music,  like in 'BHD',  it pulls us out of the immediate surroundings,  and reminds us that it is a movie. I was quite surprised how much of this non-stop battle was underscored with a Hans Zimmer soundtrack.  Perhaps the decision to go heavy on the music was to pump up the patriotism,  post 9/11.All that said,  `Black Hawk Down'  is a smart, unflinching,  realistic, and unapologetic film.There are periods during the battle where events seem incoherent,  which realistically depicts the confusion that really happened.  But it stops short to show the whole story behind some of details on screen.  Near the beginning of the film, we see a short clip of the film 'The Jerk',  where Steve Martin is being shot at.  The gunman misses and hits some cans.  In the book,  this scene is referred to later during the battle,  where bullets are puncturing a piece of metal,  demonstrating how poor a shot most of the Somali shooters were.  `It's the cans!  He hates the cans!'  the soldier declares.  It is a telling piece of humour that helps relay the sense of disbelief the Rangers had while it was happening.  Many of them said it was like a movie.Another such moment occurs when another Ranger stops when he sees a hand sitting on the ground.  The movie literally stops when the soldier stops to pick up the hand and put it in his jacket, (I almost thought that something had gone wrong with the movie projector).  We learn later in the book that the hand was matched up back to the soldier who lost it.   Then there is Mike Durant,  the most memorable part of the original incident in 1993. The book gives more detail about him being held captive and how he was eventually released.  The movie merely supplies some post-script about his fate.There is some obvious foreshadowing at the beginning of the film,  and Capt. Steele,  trying to corral his troops,  goes against Hollywood type by showing his vulnerability.   The movie doesn't quite effectively show the Delta troops' influence on the Ranger's behaviour.  It is an important sub-context in the book.  Delta soldiers are trained to be very independent, and the Rangers are trained to stick together and go by the book.   My guess is that the Delta side of the story could not be told, since officially they are not allowed to reveal anything about themselves.  This is unfortunate,  because the movie could have done a better job in setting up the relationship between the Deltas and the Rangers.   It would give more depth to the clash between Capt. Steele and the Deltas later in the film.Those are my gripes,  but everything else Ridley Scott does is right on. Scott said he wanted to show things how they really happened,  good or bad. For that,  this movie allows the good guys to do not-so-good things,  and gives credence to the fact that the men in charge don't always make the right decisions.  Other than the wall to wall music,  the movie puts you right there,  with very few of those glitzy TV commercial style shots that Bruckheimer is infamous for.   I felt that futility and desperation of the lost convoy was less effective when the film jumped back and forth between them and the pinned down Rangers.  The lost convoy, as it reads in the book, is a trip into pure hell,  the reader wants to scream in horror as much as those that were there surely did.  By cutting away from convoy,  the audience gets a chance to escape,  where there was no escape from the hail of bullets and RPG's in real life.If you are trying to decide to see this film,  it is up to you whether you can handle the graphic violence,  and the somewhat one-sided point of view of the conflict.   If you can,  you will be rewarded with a gripping story, a thoughtful narrative,  and 2 hours and 20 minutes of film that will never leave you bored.  Few films have done that.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Yet again, American codwollop masquerading as 'real' 'gritty' entertainment","Americans would like to know why the world hates them, not so? This movie proves why. It's (again) a case of 'experience how the poor little Americans die', shame, isn't it terrible. This time, however, unlike 'Saving Private Ryan', we're dealing with Somalia, a so-called 3rd world, dirt-poor ntion, not war-torn Europe. Let's face it, the attempts to show the Somalian plight are more or less perfunctory and in done in the name of political correctness, not genuine care. As usual, the main focus is the American male and his plight (in the midst of the butchery and savagery of Africa, this time). I'm not going to discuss the artistic merits of this movie, so what, I don't care. Suffice to say, American's are (generally) pompous and ignorant. This movie proves that (again).

Ridley strikes gold again!,"How does this sound: intense war film directed by Ridley Scott. Not bad, ay? What about this: intense war film from the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Not so good anymore. Luckily the second part has understood to give the first free hands. I admit that action has always been Bruckheimer's strong point, but when it comes to drama.. well, witness Pearl Harbor (= not good). Although BHD is based on a true story, it doesn't mean that the combat happened exactly like the film describes it. That aside, this is still a very strong piece of material that is only straightened by the great cast, supreme effects and most of all, the lack of any romance. I'm not saying that romance is a sure thing to bring any film plummeting down, but it's so fresh to see a film where it's not present just to suck up to the women in the audience. One thing, though.. there's one tiny problem with the fact, that because the soldiers are in full combat gear and most of them are wearing the goggles, it's VERY difficult to recognize them from each other. You often just don't know who's shooting and who's getting hit. The filmmakers have tried to solve the problem to some extent by writing the characters names on their helmets. It doesn't work well. But these are just minor problems and by the time the end credits roll on, you know you've seen a kick ass war movie that does not stop much to draw breath!**** / *****",8.0,Anonymous,History
Technically excellent - but flawed.,"Well, I have just seen it on rental.I remember the reviews... Did I expect a glorious presentation of the way America fights battles? - a sort of 'We teach the World - OK?' kind of movie? Or a 'We f****ed up - we all learnt' kind of moral tale?Well it wasn't either of these. I'm still not quite sure what it was...The fear/desperation/futility was clearly there - men dying, men fearing death, equipment & lives lost to careless errors and ignorant leadership. It is certainly a war movie, like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. It is actually anti-war - but not simply putting flowers in gun barrels - it is about real life and death.Just who were the people they caught? Stooges? Warlords? On my copy the credits were too small to see - and besides most people would have left by the time they came up.How many of the 19 deaths resulted because 'We don't leave anyone behind'??? Is this really the way war is fought by America? If so - be afraid - be VERY afraid. How do you score a result against the Satan USA? Hit a few of their men - the others will be sure to come back to get them - even if it is only bodies. It is better to claim bodies and lose more than it is to cut losses and get out? `Well, Mrs Robinson, I can tell you that we got your son's body out, we are proud of that. Excuse me if I don't stay to chat, but the parents of the 20 people that died getting him out are here too...'I know this isn't an artistic point - but hey, your enemies watch these films too! I don't have reason to doubt that this is what happened - but it spoilt the film for me.As for characters in the film - well, my Blue Burmese cat has far more character. By the time the grunt with the photo of his family died I had no idea if he was a pilot, crew member, a cameraman or whatever. The moment in the film that conveyed the most to me was of  a Somalian carrying his injured infant son across the line of sight. This is real life in war. This is what war does.

Technically excellent but little more than that,"""Black Hawk Down"" looks and sounds superb as it tells of the incident by US forces to try and take out members of the Somalian warlord Aidid's cabinet. It's dark and gritty and, with the help of cinematography by Slavomir Idziak, the viewer is launched very effectively into the chaos of the battle. Ridley Scott chose to use tight, sharp sound production values which helps add to the intensity - there's a welcome sparseness of pointless noise and music in the movie.And so the movie looks and sounds great... but that's not quite enough.Complaints have been made about the lack of characterisation - and they're entirely justified. None of the personnel are given any depth - at most they become one line summaries such as ""the joker one"", ""the idealist one"" (Josh Harnett), ""the excited rookie"" (Orlando Bloom) and the ""never-seen-combat-before-because-I-am-deskbound"" (Ewan McGregor). Now Scott may be banking that this is enough because we should care for the characters seeing as how they were real people - but that's not a good enough excuse. The script should have decided to either ignore characterisation entirely or deal with it far more adeptly (as other war movies have) - instead it makes such weak attempts that the characters seem one-dimension and hardly a credit to the real men. Anyone who writes this off as saying how men don't stand out in combat may have a point - but for a cinema audience this is not an acceptable response because if we don't care for the people on-screen then the impact of the pretty-explosions matter less and it becomes a giant video-game on screen.I enjoyed ""Black Hawk Down"" because of the pretty-eye-candy and directorial work of Ridley Scott (who may actually deserve an Oscar nomination for making the movie look as good as it does). However it is disturbingly akin to a computer game in that we never face the true pain of the characters involved. It's left to superior war movies such as ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" to deal with the emotional spectrum of war as well as the violent. In the end we have a nice very and very hollow movie - 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

Black Hawk Down,"""Black Hawk Down,"" released on 4K by Sony Pictures, is a gripping and intense war film based on a true story that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Directed by Ridley Scott, this film takes you into the heart of the chaotic and harrowing Battle of Mogadishu, where a group of elite U. S. soldiers is sent on a mission to capture a militia leader in war-torn Somalia. What follows is a harrowing tale of bravery, survival, and the harsh realities of modern warfare.The film does an excellent job of portraying the soldiers and their struggle in the midst of a relentless and well-organized militia waiting for them in the hostile streets of Mogadishu. With a star-studded cast that includes actors like Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, and many other familiar faces, the performances are solid and convincing. Each actor brings depth to their respective characters, helping us connect with the soldiers and feel the tension and danger they face.The 4K presentation of ""Black Hawk Down"" is visually impressive. The high resolution and HDR support offer great detail and clarity, even in the film's darker scenes. It's a visual feast, and the filmmakers' use of a yellow filter gives the movie an interesting and gritty look, immersing you in the chaos and tension of the battle.However, it's worth noting that the film does have some intentionally grainy and gritty scenes, which might not be to everyone's taste. While this adds to the movie's overall atmosphere, some viewers may find it a bit distracting or odd.Overall, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a powerful war film that effectively captures the intensity and brutality of modern combat. The outstanding performances, the immersive 4K presentation, and the gripping narrative make it a worthwhile addition to your collection, especially if you're a fan of war movies or historical dramas. Despite some occasional graininess, it remains a visually impressive and emotionally impactful cinematic experience. I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars for its compelling storytelling and impressive 4K presentation.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Fast-paced, action-packed but flawed.","World War II, Vietnam, The Gulf War. The great conflicts of the second half of the 20th Century, and for many years the constant focus of Hollywood War movies good and bad. The 1993 American incursion into war-torn Somalia however, does not fit into this list - more American soldiers were killed by friendly fire during the Gulf War than during the incident which is the focus of Black Hawk Down. This was basically a massacre, in which a botched US mission led to the deaths of over 1000 Somalis. That Ridley Scott can turn this into a story of the bravery and courage of the American armed forces is incredible.Watching this outside the US and therefore immune to the post-9/11 patriotic onslaught lends a far more objective analysis to this film. Despite the obvious American bias in the movie's point of view, I was never convinced of the Americans' cause, either in the mission focused on or the Somalia conflict itself. No doubt the book explains it better, but the film does not even try, and we are given only the briefest of mission overviews at the beginning, leaving you wondering just what they were trying to achieve.My initial criticism aside, as a war movie this often excels, and its breakneck pace leaves you no time to stop and think. The feel of it is classic Ridley Scott - an urban wasteland, with decay and ruin apleanty. Almost immediately it becomes futile to try and keep track of all the characters, so you simply sit back and immerse yourself in the action. Though it lacks the plot of the classic War movies, Black Hawk Down does offer action on an unprecedented scale, and hardly slows down over the entire two hours.The fact that we so quickly lose track of the characters effectively makes the 45 minute introduction sequence entirely pointless, and you can't help but feel that a quick 15 minute introduction would have served better.Don't get me wrong, Black Hawk Down is not a bad film, but is is by no means the classic that many make it out to be. You cannot help but feel that if Ridley Scott had picked a more suitable subject for a heroic war film then this could have been very good, however when the post-9/11 effect finally lifts, and this is compared to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now, it will not stand up to them for a second.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Two-thirds glamourised carnage, one-third whitewash","""It tells the story from the soldier's point of view""; ""It shows us what it was like to be there"" ... at least, that's what we hear from people who want to excuse Ridley Scott's myopia and shallowness.  Not so.We aren't told the story ""from the soldier's point of view"", because we aren't told the story, period.  Nor do we really get the soldier's point of view.  Scott shows us ample footage from the point of view of the odd Somalian sniper, and from the point of view of command central, and (albeit rarely) from the point of view of a civilian, and from no particular point of view at all; he focuses just as much on what the soldiers aren't looking at as he does on what they are looking at.  There's an unmistakable attempt to pull off a god's-eye perspective.  It doesn't succeed.  Actually, it's more as though Scott found himself in the middle of a REALLY COOL war, and he photographed all the REALLY COOL stuff around him as though he were shooting a beer commercial, making a mental note to edit it all later.  Then he edited it as though it were a beer commercial.  And who's surprised? That's how he makes all his movies.That's why the movie fails on the second count, too - showing us what it was like to be there.  There's no ""what it was like"" anywhere in this film. Actual soldiers who fight side by side can, at least when staring one another in the eyes at a distance of half a metre, recognise one another, which is more than we can do without straining our eyes and struggling to remember if this is the guy who makes coffee or the one who made that phone call earlier, you know, the one next to the pin-up - assuming the coffee guy and the pinup guy were distinct, which isn't certain.  Besides, ANY real life event has a continuity missing here.  Maybe the soldiers were as confused as I was about what was going on, but they couldn't have been as confused as I was about what (at any one point) they were trying to do.  The early parts of the mission, in which everyone knew what was going on and what they were doing, are shot in precisely the same bewildering, arty, choppy fashion as the later bits, in which the bewildering, choppy artiness is allegedly meant to convey the soldiers' own confusion.  I don't buy it.Moreover, there's clearly an attempt to provide some political context at the beginning - or more accurately, a pretence.  Now, I don't demand political context.  A good film could be made - possibly in the vein of Kafka's ""The Trial"" - in which we don't know what the war is about or how it started or what the soldiers were doing there.  But if you're going to TRY to tell us the story, or ACT as though you're telling us the story, then it's as well to get it RIGHT.  The half-a-dozen sentences of context at the beginning are completely unhelpful.  And misleading, if not actually false. The Americans weren't there to provide famine relief.  They weren't, as the film obliquely suggests, obstructed in any way by UN troops - in fact, the chutzpah of the Pentagon, who had control over the script, claiming such a thing, blows me away.  Twenty-two countries obediently pooled their forces under United Nations command, but the United States, as always, refused to do any such thing - partly to leave the US army free to indulge in whatever war crimes it pleased.One or two moments are unintentionally revealing.  A fresh soldier arrives and innocently refers to ""Mogadishu"", but an older hand immediately corrects him: ""Firstly, it's 'The Mog'.  Nobody calls it 'Mogadishu'.""  No, nobody, except perhaps the people who live there.  If troops from a foreign power were to walk around my country as though they owned it, terrorising the locals (accidentally, according to the film, although there's ample evidence that much of it was deliberate), I would still find it an added insult if they were to contemptuously refer to our capital city as ""The Can"" and to other cities as ""The Syd"" and ""The Melb"" - unless they were inspired to do so by local practises, which, something tells me, wasn't the case here.Then there's the note at the end.  It says: ""...over 1000 Somalis were killed and 19 Americans lost their lives.""  (That's a ratio of 53 to one.) The Somalis were ""killed"", the Americans ""lost their lives""; Scott doesn't even have the grace to say something even-handed like, ""1000 Somalis and 19 Americans were killed.""  In case the double standard weren't obvious enough, we see a LIST of the 19 dead Americans (but not, of course, the Somalis). For a second I suspected that Scott was being subtle for the first time in his life, and that this sick joke was deliberate.  Then I remembered the rest of the film and thought: no, probably not.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Reality,"A movie such as this is hard to hate, it's hard not to sympathise with the characters even though they have such little development. Humans have a genetic reaction towards other humans in despair to want them to succeed, and when a war film is presented in such a realistic way it's not to feel part of the movie. The goreand the distressing images all ground the movie into its realistic state while allowing for some great choreographed action scenes. My only one complaint with the movie is that the first act perhaps drags on longer than it should with some of the long fights becoming repetitive, this could also be argued against saying it's more realistic and such, but film wise I saw this as slowing down the plot which also has a few bumps. There isn't much in terms of plot, again they can't change events that actually happened so it would be unfair of me to criticise. But the film does fall into the common mistake of not showing but instead telling at the start, I understand that the beginning descriptions display weeks of story which would otherwise take multiple films to cover but majority of plot development is on screen text. Overall a really great movie which pulls on the heart strings towards the end, I would recommend checking it out. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"One of the best war films ever--real, not based on a novel","Settle down in your seat and hold on.  This movie, after a fairly brief scene setting, moves right into high gear.  From the time the shooting starts, it is like the first 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", but stretched out over the next hour and a half.  This was a real event, not a plot from a novel. This is not any sanctimonious sermon like ""Platoon"". There is no flag waving. There is no political posturing--it is just a matter of the Rangers, Delta Force and pilots all trying their best to make sure they and their buddies get out alive--""leaving no man behind"".  For them, the only way out is to knock down every Somali militia man between them and the helicopter crash sites and ultimately, safety.  And those Somalis just keep coming. The steadfast pursuit of the Americans by the Somalis, with no apparent regard for their own mortality, brings back scenes from ""Zulu"".  The closest recent comparison for street-by-street battle was probaby the US Marines fighting to retake Hue's Citadel in 1968 Vietnam. The battle scenes are realistically portrayed, and the viewer does not even see that common war movie phenomena wherein the good guys appear to have an ""endless magazine"" for their weapons.  These guys actually change magazines, run through them, then change again, and continue firing, ultimately having to conserve what little they have remaining (per the book, the Rangers and Delta did get one sorely needed ammo and medical resupply during the night of the actual battle).  The noise is overwhelmingly and realistic loud (the nearly deaf machine-gunner was not a figment of the script-writer's imagination). I speak from experience as an infantryman in Vietnam.  But I fortunately never had to run this kind of gauntlet for an extended period (few ever have). It should be required viewing for current and future military people, for it illustrates that ""Murphy's Law"" is often the companion of a military mission.  It is at such a point that training, instincts, initiative and unit cohesiveness must kick in if the unit is to survive. This group of Rangers, Delta and the pilots supporting them demonstrated the concept in an extraordinary manner. A definite ""10"" rating.",,Anonymous,History
Ridley's Best!!,"The best movie of the director Ridley Scott in these last years (much better than the wasted Hannibal), in which counts us the warlike conflict of Somalia, almost ten years ago that involved the participation of the American troops as the Rangers and the Delta Force.   	A marvelous movie that directs with great ability Ridley Scott that makes us see as the American soldiers, after falling one of its helicopters, faces in a critical situation amid the capital of Somalia. Everything it counted with a great atmosphere and magnificent screenplay. The movie is counted as its it was a documentary; as Steve Soderberg's movie, Traffic.The only thing that could be attributed to this movie is that it can sometimes be too long.

"A very good action movie, that's all.","In my point of view, war is bad. So I prefer movies which criticize this activity.This is not the intend of this movie. Nevertheless, I must admit it doesn't contain too much ""patriotic-propaganda"", like I was fearing it.Like someone said : it's a ""pop-corn movie"" with no ideological purposes. Except of course, the soldier's macho friendship as the ultimate life value. In the movie, every soldier is obsessed to be useful and says : ""Yes Sarge, I can't fight ! I want to go back to fight !"". And the classical ""war cliché"" (present in every war movie since the 50's) : ""Say to my wife I was courageous ! - You will say it to her yourself !"" and the soldier dies.Frankly, where is the originality ? Some say the movie is almost a documentary. Are you kidding ? The historical frame is ejected in one minute after the movie starts. The enemy ? End titles say there were 19 killed US soldiers , and about 1000 killed Somalis. And what this movie shows us about the Somalis warriors ? Nothing ! They are just targets, with no personality, no humanity, they are ""objects"", like in a shoot-them-up video game. Like the monsters in ""Aliens"" or ""Starship troopers"". Soldiers US are the goods, the others are the villains. But the reality is more complex.Don't misunderstand me ! I'm french, but I'm not giving a judgment about American policy, but about a movie. And the base of this movie is stereotypes. Sometimes, I like stereotypes ! Like everybody. I like ""Rambo"" (really !) but it's fictional ! And if BHD would have been a fiction, directed by Peter McDonald or Roland Emmerich, I would be OK. But I was waiting a little more from a director like Ridley Scott and more from a movie about a real event.So it's really a very good action movie, (among the bests, I admit it) but it's not a ""great philosophical analysis"" about the war or about an historical event.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

Film vs. reality,"I can hardly believe the ratings this film is getting. You can't say Ridley Scott has made a bad film, but to state that this is a masterpiece...no, the film 's got just too many flaws for that. This is a case where the truth is harrowing, but the film version simply isn't. And the reality behind the film just isn't enough to make it a good film, as one ought to know.First of all: haven't we seen enough of this sort of American patriotism in films? Yes, these men might be heroes, but the way they're being depicted in BHD simply doesn't seem realistic. Add to that a soundtrack that is simply so inappropriate and pompous at times and you get the feeling that you are actually watching a movie and not something that really happened. Nothing wrong with that...if that's what you're trying to sell it for.Second, the dialogue, which is simply stupid. Are these guys really the macho types they're being presented as? Do they utter the stupid phrases you get to hear in this film? For their sake: I hope not. This film has got nothing of the intelligence and philosophy that a film like Saving Private Ryan for example did have. The actors too aren't really top-class. No Tom Hanks in this movie. Even Ewan McGregor and Tom Sizemore (who was in SPR too!) don't offer the performances you'd expect them to deliver. And Sam Shepard hasn't been in too many good movies lately too. Another thing is the storyline, which seems to be missing. The film consists of one long shooting, and that's it. Why not make more out of the obvious despair and fear these soldiers must have experienced? Finally, in the closing scenes, mention is made of the fact that 19 U.S. soldiers were killed...together with over 1,000 Somalis. This is presented as nothing more than a footnote, but there's hardly a sign of a critical approach to the intervention of the U.S., nor do we get any motivations. And can't we say after all that, due to this intervention, which was supposed to be almost bloodless, the U.S. made things even worse? 19 soldiers, yes, but what about the 1,000 Somalis, who are being depicted as savages, who kill each other and anyone who tries to break them up? The facts are pretty actual nowadays, but the situation in Afghanistan (or the attitude of president Bush)clearly shows that nothing is changed after the events in New York. And this film, more macho behaviour than reality, doesn't help much either. I gave this film a ""6"", but when I think about it, that seems to be far too much for the actual result. As I said, the subject alone isn't nearly enough to make up for the shortcomings in the making of the film. They should've known better...",6.0,Anonymous,History
worst film of all time?????? yes,"this film is truly terrible, and a massive disappointment considering it was directed by ridley scott. the thing that annoyed me most about it was the racism. all good war films either show both sides of the story or acknowledge that the 'enemies' are real people. this film does neither. throughout the film, the americans are portrayed as heroes of democracy. why? their job is to replace one corrupt warlord with another who happens to be pro-american. after the americans fail in their mission they are still treated as heroes... the fact that they lost is not mentioned. or is their success measured by the number of somalians they killed? in this respect they did very well, killing over a thousand people, including several innocent civillians. these people are mentioned only as a footnote to the 18 american deaths? 18!.......its not very much compared to 1000 is it? but then of course the americans were 'heroes'. there are few films that i genuinely hate but this is one of them. if you haven't seen it, don't.",1.0,Anonymous,History

True Story Epic of how things appear,"One thing that I can say about Black Hawk Down from a personal point of view is the setting is the year that I graduated from High School. It was quite amazing to learn later how a mission could go so wrong so quickly. Incidentally, this was a good break out role for Orlando Bloom, as the catalyst for kicking off the storm that ensues in Somalia. The action sequence is much like Pearl Harbor in that is conveyed to you a sense of endless time that the fighting commenced. There are many moments where the viewer is left aghast and horrified, wondering when it will end, and how much more can possibly happen to our fellow Americans as they attempt to get themselves out of this chaotic mission gone askew. I was fooled into thinking that Josh Hartnett was a main character here, but he is part of an excellent ensemble cast of people.

Muslims are offended once again by a lack of attention to the perspectives of the Somalians,"I was fairly offended as an American Muslim to endure the spectacle that was Black Hawk Down in theaters this winter.  Certainly we all needed a movie that would restore our happiness and passion after the tragic events of September 11 but Amelie is the film that provides you with that on every level.  Black Hawk Down was a vision with the lovely scenes of Black Hawk helicopters in the wrong place at the wrong time and the sound editing is some of the best I have witnessed in the war films genre but everything else about this film proved that Ridley Scott and his crew lacked the insight and research to embark on this venture.Were all Somalians who felt angry at the American military presence in their country in 1993 one-dimensional lunatics with guns and desires to kill Americans? Absolutely not but once again in the tradition of the ""Muslims are evil and that's just the breaks"" film genre (True Lies, The Siege, Not Without My Daughter, Executive Decision) we are given another film that fails to portray the religion and it's followers positively and does not allow us even for a minute to understand their perspective.  And why is that?  Could it be because in many ways they are American themselves with a love for SUV's, cell phones, football, and spaghetti with meatballs?  Ridley Scott could not possibly have the desire to show that side of the Somalians because America and certainly Black Hawk Down have to have enemies and not allied civilians whose lifestyles mirror our own.  And yet you cannot ask for much from a film that also refused to give personalities and character development to it's own American heroes of war.  I can accept the notion that Black Hawk Down is overly patriotic but for me it was not to honor these brave American soldiers who fought and died as most may assume Ridley Scott and his crew intended.  Instead the film is merely an exercise in depicting American imperialism and world domination in which America is happy to stick it's nose where it doesn't belong no matter what the consequences are for American soldiers and foreign civilians.  A tiring attempt to muddle an already estranged relationship between America and The Middle East hampers Black Hawk Down.If you are interested in a more accurate and useful film on America's concerns in The Middle East pick up a copy of Three Kings at your local Blockbuster.  The film has covered the most ground yet in it's efforts to portray Muslims accurately and intelligently.  We are not there yet and Black Hawk Down is one step back when we desperately need to take two steps forward.  I often weep for the future.7/10 for sound editing and visual effects alone",7.0,Anonymous,History
Realistic depiction of modern warfare,"For producer Jerry Bruckheimer (`Beverly Hills Cop', `Flashdance', `Top Gun', `The Rock', `Armageddon', `Remember the Titans', `Pearl Harbor'), this is a departure from the crowd pleasers he usually produces.  Bruckheimer is one of the most successful producers in Hollywood because he knows that crowd pleasers make a buck.  Even `Pearl Harbor', wasn't really about Pearl Harbor, but about a love story with Pearl Harbor as the backdrop.  Here, Bruckheimer produces a straight, no nonsense action film with controversial subject matter and none of his standard crowd pleasing elements.  Oh, and by the way, he still made money.This is not a film for the squeamish.  War is hell and this film turns up the fire.  It is a frank and realistic representation of war, much the same as the beach scene of `Saving Private Ryan', only once the action starts, it never lets up.  Ridley Scott gives us a raw depiction of modern warfare, based on actual events from the US military action in Somalia.  Despite a lot of criticism of Scott for not delving deeper into the political issues, I believe he made the right decision in staying focused on this as a combat film.What is so unlike a Bruckheimer film is that there is no workup of any single character.  There is no attempt to get us to love someone and have us pulling for him.  He just gives us a bunch of ordinary grunts that get thrown into a fire fight and try desperately to fight their way out to survive.  No one is a hero, and everyone is.Scott's direction of the action scenes is superb.  This film maintains a dizzying pace and Scott never lets us catch our breath with stunt work and pyrotechnics that defy description.  There is no safety net in this film where we know that certain characters won't die.  Everyone in the cast is a potential casualty.  While this is extremely realistic, it is also one of the shortcomings of the film.  By the end, the viewer suffers from battle fatigue and there is no emotional consolation that at least one character we liked came out okay.The ensemble cast does a fine job of creating realistic battle scenes, though there isn't a lot of meaningful dialogue.  The actors had to go through real military basic training in preparation for the film and it hardened them for the exhausting rigors of their roles.  Josh Hartnett and Tom Sizemore stood out slightly from the rest, but only because they each had slightly meatier roles.This is an intense and credible war film that doesn't so much engage viewers as it does overwhelm us.  From an action perspective it is a 12/10, but in the area of storytelling and character development it falls short.  I rated it an 8/10.  See it, but brace yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Battle for Survival,"Heroic and Intense, Black Hawk Down brings you right into the thick of the war in Somalia pinning you to your seat with your heart pumping scenes. Intense, Action filled scenes keep you engaged throughout the entire film. During the film, we see the heroism demonstrated by each one of the Army Rangers and the camaraderie they have with each other.
Based on the 1993 raid in Mogadishu, Somalia, we get a first-person point of view into the events of that fateful raid. The United Nations and the United States began setting up bases in Somalia after civil war broke out and the central government had been ousted. When UN forces began to withdraw the Insurgents led by Mohamed Farrah Aidid declared war on the remaining military personnel still there. In an act to try and weaken Aidid, the Army Rangers plan a raid on October 3rd, 1993 to capture two top-ranking officials. The mission fails and two Black Hawk Helicopters are shot down hence the title name.
The director of the film, Ridley Scott, uses modern film techniques incorporated with older props to recreate the setting of 1993 and tell the story of the film. Scott uses many different film techniques one of which being slow motion. During an important part of the film or when explosions and heavy gunfights are occurring Scott slows down the speed of the film to give it a more dramatic effect and to convey the significance of the moment. Scott also incorporates the use of close up shots to show the raw emotions of each of the soldiers as the violence around them breaks out.
One of the pivotal points in the film is when Private First Class Blackburn falls to the ground out of the Black Hawk Helicopter. Blackburn is a brave 18 year old who is just checking in when he has to leave to go on his first mission. Following this near-fatal fall Sgt. Jeff Streucker played by Brian Van Holt risks everything and he leads three humvees to pick up Blackburn and bring him back to base. On the way back to base, one of the gunner's is shot and killed instantly.
Sergeant Eversmann played by Josh Hartnett is the starring role during the film. Throughout the film, Hartnett plays his role with a methodical way of moving around so meticulous and detail oriented, every single movement is rushed, but you can tell he his putting everything he has into mastering his role to portray an accurate representation of that failed raid. Each scene is another battle that Eversmann must overcome in order to survive. In the end of the film, Eversmann says ""Nobody asks to be a hero, it just sometimes turns out that way"". Every single soldier who took part in the raid played a role in the safe exit of the situation and they are iall heroes.
Major General Garrison played by Sam Shepard is another key character. Shepard plays this role with such passion that you can see the raw emotion he shows during the raid and the casualties that are unraveling before his eyes. He keeps his composure to get the casualties and survivors out of the ""hot zone"". Garrison says ""Danny, you understand me? No one gets left behind!"". Risking everything, Garrison assures his soldiers that nobody leaves until the casualties and survivors are recovered. This shows heroism because risking their own lives the soldiers must stay in the hot zone until they can recover every single person.
Ridley Scott uses the right balance of sound, film and settings to portray the fateful raid in an accurate yet dramatized version. We see the importance that camaraderie and teamwork that is a necessity in achieving success. Each soldier who participated in the raid are hero's that day and Scott and the actors played each of their roles exceptionally well. The movie is a great tribute to the tragic events of that fateful raid.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Remarkably accurate and remarkably hollow.,"Black Hawk Down avoids dealing with the political side of the story and basically restricts itself to combat situations between American soldiers and Somalian rebels. It must be said that most of these scenes are brilliantly executed, wonderfully shot with pale filters and edited with a very hectic and effective pace. But BHD suffers from an overkill of technically superior firefights, that eventually deadens the senses just as the action sequences in Pearl Harbor tended to make viewers numb after prolonged bombardments and such. Scott undoubtedly succeeds in depicting a realistic and impressive report of what happened in Mogadishu, but he also ignores content in favour of style and thereby fails to make any statement about the events whatsoever (apart from stating that these soldiers were tremendously brave maybe which is of course a statement that will not raise any eyebrows); our heroes remain anonymous to us, also there isn't any character development to speak of. At one point i expected the film to focus on the executive mismanagement that may have played an important role in this military tragedy, but unfortunately Scott never really adresses this aspect of the events (and i have a feeling the military gratiously providing the actual Blackhawk craft for the shooting had something to do with this). Also I found it surprising to see BHD was practically devoid of patriotic sentiment (in the sense of American flags in the wind, accompanied by trumpets and horns) unlike almost all of Bruckheimer's other productions. What we're left with in the end is a remarkably accurate but also remarkably hollow war-film, not a waste of time, but certainly not worth the hype it has caused.",6.0,Anonymous,History

This may be my favorite modern war movie...,"What I think makes ""Black Hawk Down"" stand out from other modern war classics, and this generally refers to war films dealing with anything about or after Vietnam, is its grittiness and realism. I love war films and have seen many, but I always walk away feeling disconnected, but this film helped me understand. With ""Apocalypse Now"" it was the utter surrealism of the experience. The film is a surreal, mystical, acidic trip through Vietnam, and while it is a beautiful film, too much is about the imagery and surrealism of the story. With ""Saving Private Ryan"" there was too much focus on the characters and their development. It was a film about how people react to war far more then about war itself.That's what I loved about ""Black Hawk Down""--it was a war film about war. I have also read the book and despite the small changes (Eversmann leaves with the initial convoy), I feel the film still carries the spirit of the book and story. It never cheapens the integrity of the soldiers or makes their sacrifice seem unimportant. In fact, I think the film stands a testament to their bravery and courage and casts more negative light on those in command.There is minimal character development and while there are lead characters, the actors' screen time is very evenly spaced. There are also no female characters, which I greatly enjoyed, because love stories often detract from the point of the film and are just thrown in for shallow commercialism--fine most of the time, but not when dealing with a subject like this one. The focus of this film is not on one specific character, but on the men as a whole and the war that surrounds them.And I think this film offers one of the most honest interpretations of war, and might be one of the most straight-forward anti-war film ever made. There is propaganda and jingoism--how could there not be when this battle was considered a national tragedy? But I mainly walked away from this film feeling as if war accomplishes nothing. I felt for the Somalis, I felt for the soldiers forced to do a job whether they believed in it or not, and I resented Washington and their negligence towards human life--but that's war. There are no winners or losers, everyone suffers, and I think this film summed that up perfectly.The film was also done beautifully. The photography is truly stunning in some places, and the contrast of harsh sunlight and dark shadows parallels the characters' inner struggles throughout the battle. The photography is clear and almost arty in places, yet it never seems out of place. For example, when the first helicopter crashes and the shot immediately fades from the crash site to the JOC's view of the crash site, the photography trick doesn't seem gratuitous--it simply points out how disconnected the JOC is from the soldiers on the ground. I enjoyed similar moments throughout the film, like Grimes' eye, symbolizing the soldier's-eye-view of the war and how it affected those actually fighting.But most of all I felt this film explained war how it is, ugly and painful, even for the victors. It shed some light on American foreign policy, even more applicable with the situation in Iraq these days. But most of all it provided a view of war without resorting to cheap tricks, gratuitous violence, or a simpering love story--difficult in Hollywood these days, but much appreciated by myself.",,Anonymous,History
"Code Name-""Irene""","The Movie,""Black Hawk Down"" is an excellent story of what it means to come to the aid of civilization.I certainly as a viewer and even as a reviewer were slow to respond to

underpinning to Saving Private Ryan makes it a very memorable film,one which equates with great,A truly exemplary motion picture.However we have here a film that is about an event that took place in 1993 and it concerned the peoples of Somalia.This film opens on a subtle,almost eerie note with dark gray colors with music that won an academy award.The dramatic event begins ever so slowly almost to draw you in,perhaps even as a curiosity.To be certain we are looking at the dead and how the mass deaths were part of the picture of whatever life there was left.It invites an almost shocking perception as to the scale that this story tells off.We are told through the sayings of Plato that only the dead see the end to war and we watch how mass starvation due to the wars of clans and the like have provided the grounds for a loss of life that is described as Biblical in proportion.The numbers offered are said to exceed 300,000 dead due to starvation and counting.So dire were the needs of the Somalis that the World Community got wind of the disaster and in response to a terribly inhumane state, the UN with the full cooperation of our nation(USA)sent in front line U.S.Marines,some twenty thousand strong to restore order and re-establish a food line to assist in an attempt to save a future here too.We come to expect great things from our greatest and we got what we wanted as historically it will indicate that order was restored and food as well as supplies were finding there way to the population.However,the front line force was to be replaced soon and very capable units involving US Army Rangers as well as Delta Force commandos were on the ground in Somalia with designs to sever the head of the serpent by denying it some of its functioning pieces.Gun dealers,political as well military personnel are rounded up in an attempt to limit the effect of Aideeds faction.The claim as to the state of affairs that provided for the calls for help were an illustration of a failure of a governing body to be responsible and responsive to the many that they had authority over.This failure was and is a very present circumstance that cannot endure permanently and society or civilization will die as a result.However,this film does not as a rule look at the film as a political film it does though attempt to establish some methods as to how to deal with the events that we were watching unfold.The UN position was to do all we could without getting ourselves involved in what was considered somewhat of a civil war.We watch aid-ides militia shoot unarmed civilians and as the film takes us into Mogadishu,we learn that this is one of the most dangerous cities in all the world.The streets have vendors selling guns,which are AK47s with so many different small arms that you would probably equate its place likened to selling umbrellas,Belts,or neck ties.It is that pervasive and indeed that eerie feeling felt at the start of the film does not go away.This is a very dangerous community and not at all shy about it.The political position has an effect on just how capable a presence we wish to provide when there are final plans drawn up under the code name""Irene"" to move into the heart of what is considered very unfriendly territory and kidnap or capture these important pieces in Aideeds organization.The political climate suggested a low profile would be more fitting our place in the eyes of the world,so that a request for some of our special weaponry was disallowed.It may have contributed to the fact that we had to engage the enemy at all,however that withstanding our combat loses were to be nearly 19 dead and 71 wounded with the enemy having lost some 1,000.00 dead and wounded.The battle scenes don't end and there is a continuous involvement of the fight until the nighttime when though the militia may of thought it was there time when in fact they were dealt a blow through our helicopter gunships that by day light things were a-bit more peaceful.This is a very warrior type of picture,where our men in uniform provided outstanding commitment to peace and a unequivocal ability to gain that objective.In a final note this is a excellent film worth seeing more than once plus its not winning more academy awards than just two may have had something to do with timing more than anything else because this film is that good.The two categories in which it won were Best Film Editing and Best Sound.This film is worth the Soundtrack by its self,it is as good as it gets worth many many a listen.Highly recommended and rates equal footing with the very best in war time films.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Best movie ever,"This is not only one of the best war movies of all times, it is one of the greatest movies of all times. I am actually a ""Operation Restore Hope"" veteran. I remember going to the theater with my wife and mom when this movie came out. All three of us left in tears. I have tried to explain my experiences in Somalia to people, and none of them seemed to take it seriously. The media must not have covered it that well. Trust me, I was in Iraq for ""Operation Desert Storm"" and Somalia was much worse.Scott did a brilliant job at recreating Mogadishu. There were only a couple minor flaws in the movie and only someone who was there would be able to identify them.As far as it depicting all Somali's as mindless warmongers. I totally disagree with people who make this claim. Only the ones who were shooting at us were the warmongers and that is what this movie is about. Who in the hell would watch a movie about the nice side of Somalia. Besides they did not want us there and tensions between civilians and soldiers escalated to the point where we hated them and they hated us. It was not worth loosing one soldiers life.If you have not seen this movie, please do. Every bit of it is true. I was friends with a couple of the guys who died in this battle and I want people to know how they died as hero's.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hypocrisy?  War Porn?,"We americans are so hypocritical, we don't see reality. This is what I get from many on this website.  I find that odd, seeing as most of these oh-so-enlightened folks has never stepped foot in danger, never felt bullets rush past their head, never seen their best friend bleed to death on a filthy table in a dirt town of Somalia.  I find it disgusting, and insulting that the automatic assumption of viewers is that the US is always rushing in to do evil.  That is what they expect.  Though they would be hard pressed to deflect the fact that it is the blood of American soldiers that keeps their lands free, and has done so for that past 100 years. No one is doubting the bravery and courage of British and Aussie troops who fought for their own countries, but who maintains that freedom??It is not that the users on IMDB are excersing their right to free speech that insults me.  What insults americans, and members of its military like myself, is the fact that these people sit back on their lily white butts and forget the young men who should have lived long lives and never worried about their next breath.  Instead they insult their memories with their scathing reviews.

Who's who?,"OK, it's gritty, it's realistic and it shows us like many, many, many other films before it that war is hell, but American soldiers are buddies and heroes.What it adds is to document a true incident and its ensemble playing (that we also see in films like Band of Brothers, made around the same time). As in BOB, it's hard to follow who's who. One man in a scruffy uniform and covered in grime looks much like another. It was only when I looked at the cast list that I realised some of the well-known actors who were in it. I'd completely failed to spot a few of them while watching the film.The story goes on for a long time on the same note of non-stop action.

"with special effects , music , sound and photography ,u can find urself inside the film","This is one of the few movies which kept me enjoying and entertaining every moment i was watching the movie. Every scene was class of its own. i had seen the footage of the dead u.s soldiers on cnn the day after this incident and 5 yrs after i watched cnn ' s PERSPECTIVE at the incident of black hawk. But i really knew for the 1st time that it was so hard and intense battle raged on the ground. most of the time i felt being also a part of the movie. There was so much accurate photography and effects which really looked much real as never before. The credit goes both to ridley scott as director and jerry bruckheimer as producer. It really deserved to win the awards for best sound and film editing. This made me quite sympathetic towards those who were caught in the battle without their own choice.

I am a critic of u.s foreign policy but never ever have got any thing personal against American people and Their soldiers. About this mission , i only know that the Americans went for humanitarian reasons not occupation.

"Disappointing and badly written, but it's not all bad","I'm not a fan of Ridley Scott, I find he so often gets carried away with ""projects"" and makes them unnecessarily long and often they become boring. Black Hawk Down is no exception. It is too long. The character development is virtually non-existent, which considering the length of the film is inexcusable. Also, it means that I actually don't really care about the characters because I have no emotional connection with them whatsoever. So when it comes down to it the only way to identify the characters is to classify them as either American or Somali, which for me kind of defeats the humanist point that Scott was obviously trying to get across. On the other hand there are some good actors to look out for, Eric Bana, Josh Harnett, Ewan McGregor, Jason Isaacs and Orlando Bloom all make welcome appearances. The film does also make some interesting points about war, interesting given modern events and that it was made pre-9/11. In the end the film is good to watch for its nice visual effects and extremely gripping fight scenes. The film did grab me emotionally, but not because of the events that the characters found themselves in, more because of the situation that the Somali civilians found themselves in, something that the film didn't cover (which is fine because that's not what it's about). I think what I'm trying to say is that I didn't particularly connect with the characters, in what was an overly long film with drawn-out fight scenes that are well done, but frankly boring.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A blistering experience,"Black Hawk Down is simultaneously bruising to watch and impossible to look away. It is not the first war movie to place us in the middle of the action so skillfully, but it is definitely one of the best and one of the most harrowing. And it is not necessarily the endless and endlessly realistic action that makes this movie such an achievement; Scott manages to say something with that action and because of that we have a better understanding of war and those who fight it.Too much happens within the fabric of this film for me to provide a genuine summary of the plot, so I'll give a brief outline: a team of Special U.S. Forces is deployed in Mogadishu, Somalia with orders to apprehend a warlord who has created famine in his area when one of their Black Hawk helicopters is shot down and they become entangled in a never-ending battle with the Somali militia, fighting to save their own lives and the lives of the men around them.Scott has assembled a genuinely ensemble cast with virtually no standout names at the time except for Josh Hartnett and Ewan McGregor, who both do a fine job, but the character that left the deepest impact on me was Eric Bana's Hoot. Hoot is one of the few Rangers that knows his way around war and fighting and is almost ruthless in his tactics. However, he never loses his compassion and he reveals at the end that he truly understands why he fights- ""It's about the men next to you. And that's it.""The fact that this conflict was not even supposed to be war in the first place makes the movie all the more powerful. We are audience to many mistakes by the leaders of this outfit; the ground forces are led by helicopters from above and the navigators in these Black Hawks lead the Rangers astray many times. It seems to go on forever sometimes, but that is not to the detriment of the movie. On the contrary, it only adds to the reality of the situation. We are not subjected to nonstop fighting; there are moments between the soldiers and sometimes moments between the Americans and those attacking them. Even in these moments, though, Scott never relents from his indictment of war or his appreciation of the compassion of these soldiers.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Was that really it?,"I had been looking forward to watching this movie, and my girlfriend actually asked if we could watch it together. She fell asleep after about an hour or so, while i forced myself to watch the rest of the movie.What is the main problem with this movie? The camera work is great (which isn't really a surprise... I guess Ridley knows what he wants...) The acting is okay, the fx are good. The problem in my opinion is that there is little to no plot through the movie. We get maybe 15-25 minutes of plot and story explanation, and the rest of the movie a lot of soldiers are running around shooting black guys and being shot at. As we are not told ANYTHING about the soldiers, I really did not care who got shot. We have McGregor and one of the helicopter pilots... the rest of the soldiers looked the same to me. And when they were running around the city, I had NO idea where they were or how long apart they were.I understand that a lot of people will get angry when reading this, but I mean no disrespect to the 19(?) American soldiers who died in Somalia... and maybe we should remember that thousands of non-Americans died during the war?This movie is highly overrated...

Soldier's view of war,"Ridley Scott has been fumbling recently, making more producer type of movies then his own. He established himself with ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". Thelma and Louise, G.I. Jane kept it going. Hannibal really screwed it up. His direction is coarse, he wants to be focused on the photography, focused on the action. He wants YOU to be there with the soldiers, fighting along side with them, watching them die watching them kill. He succeeds. Ken Nolan on the other hand wants to create a war drama, an embodiement of the human fighting spirit and about the sadness of war. He fails. Jerry Bruckheimer wants to make a movie so over- the- top in it's own patriotism, it'll make money and hey, it'll be called ""good"". He succeeds. Ken Nolan's script should come first. What he tries to show is the bleakness of war, with the characters of Eric Bana coming into play. He also wants to show the seasoned veterans who disobey orders and who actually help win the fighting: William Fichtner's character, Tom Sizemore's character. And there's the rookies; Josh Hartnett and Ewan Mcgregor. They aren't developed. Words don't ooze from their lips with power and drama as they did in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now and in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. They say the same things over again. They run and duck as RPGs blow over head and as bullets knock their friends down. The acting is solid, but there isn't much acting required. They just have to look proffesional and even acted scared. Ridley Scott's direction wants to go deep in there, he wants to give you a camera and let you follow these men. He does a fine job with this movie, deserving an Oscar nomination. Yet at the same time there's the patriotism provided by Bruckheimer. Scott's vision of bleak warfare is turned into ""Wow! America is so good at fighting!"" The photography, editing, sound all come together masterfully to give the experience to the viewer. But remove all the fancy camera angles, the tight editing and the detailed sounds. What is there? Nothing. That is the problem with this movie, it is hollow. Gunfire, pants, blood, they all come together well but what's the significance? When the movie ends, and the factual subtitles start to roll, the movie is briefly remembered then forgotten. Recommended for people who want to get a good view of the war, but for those looking for depht, it's recommended that they pick up ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Full Metal Jacket."" 6/10",,Anonymous,History

One of the Best,After I this movie I had more respect for the military than I ever had before in my life. I also had a better understanding of what combat is like in this day in age. The plot is very good and is also based on an actual event that happened. It also shows the bad things the people of the military go through on a daily basis while fighting a war and it also shows that war is a terrible thing regardless of the cause. I also feel that the people who made this movie made good choices in the cast because it was made-up of mainly actors that starred in other war films like Tom Siezmon form Saving Private Ryan. This is a must-see film for anyone interested in war films and I guarantee you that you will be moved by this film.,10.0,Anonymous,History
The most realistic war film of our time but not necessarily the best,"Black Hawk Down is one of those rare films where you don't any of the characters. You don't know where they're coming from, you don't know there names, but they're there. The only other film I know like this is United 93.This is a problem for Black Hawk Down. While most likely being the most realistic and accurate war film of our time, not knowing who the characters are leaves you unflinched when someone important dies. There was only character where I felt only a hint of sadness for, and I didn't even know his name.Another problem is action. Honestly, there is too much action in the film. It's non-stop, not giving any time to flesh out any characters. You actually wish for a moment of peace but any of these moments are probably 30 seconds in length. I like how all the action came together, but there was just too much for my taste.On a positive note, all performances were believable. Even the Samalians, who were most likely no more than paid extras, were highly believable and you can feel a hatred growing for their monstrous behavior in the film. You can feel the savageness of their actions through gruesome images and the way they pursue the men of Black Hawk Down.Like I said, the film was realistic, even more so than Saving Private Ryan. This gets it a lot of points, and is one of the main reasons I liked the film.Overall, the film is entertaining but its hard to feel emotion for characters that die and none of them are fleshed out. Enjoyable, but not great. 7.1/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie,"""Nobody asks to be a hero, it just sometimes turns out that way"" In the movie Black Hawk Down directed by Ridley Scott depicts the day that the US military fought in the battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. The Somali warlord Mohamed Aidid had control over the city of Mogadishu. He had his power by taking the food that was given to the people of Mogadishu. Essentially he controlled the people by starving them. It was either starve and die, or join forces with Aidid and fight for him. The US military planned to step in and stop this from happening by taking out Aidid . When going in to execute this plan the worst happens and two of their black hawk helicopters get shot down. The movie then goes through the heroic acts that the military went through to save the survivors of the crash and get them out of there.This movie was made very well. The director Ridley Scott had already made plenty of action movies before this and this fit right in his genre. Some of the acting by the characters could have been a little better but the special effects and action scenes were amazing. The movie budget was $92 million which isn't too cheap or too expensive, it's just about average for the making of a major studio movie. Obviously they couldn't film the movie in Somalia because it's way too dangerous, so they decided to film it in Rabat, Morocco which has similar scenery and geography. This film was made 16 years go, released on December 28, 2001, and was very good quality. During the movie making there was no delays so the movie came out on the date they were shooting for.During this movie it was clear to see that the director was showing that the US military was very brave during this battle and fought through it. The director made this movie not only to show how brave and strong the US military is but also to show how good of a producer he is and prove himself to the Hollywood community. To figure out why the film was made you have to dig a little deeper to find out why and really pay attention during the film. It seemed pretty clear, if you payed close attention, that the film was trying to inform the audience that the US military is the best in world. The film was clearly made for the people of the United States to show that we are being protected by the greatest military in the world.The film was good for history and facts but they did manage to mess up in a few ways. The helmets the US soldiers were wearing in the movie were not issued when the actual events happened in real life but this is only a minor issue. Besides this very minor issue the actual battle scene is very factual and true. In the beginning and ending scenes the director did omit some important facts to bias the film in the US military's favor. Some facts they left out were that it might have actually been as much as 2000 Somalis killed and 4000 wounded. Also, this battle was seen as a huge victory for the warlord Mohammed Aidid because he managed to hold off a military superpower and keep his regime intact. They left these facts out to make the US military look great and not insane murderers. Although the director was very bias it did not really get in the way of telling the story.The characters were very believable in this film but the acting could have been a little better in their dialogue. For the most part though the dialogue in this war movie was appropriate for it and fit right in. The only thing that i would criticize about this film is that they should have put the Somalis point of view in way more. This would make the film seem way less bias and more factual to the true events that happened. Overall I thought this film was great and i would recommend it to everyone to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,History
One thumb up and one thumb down,"I came out of the theater with a nauseous stomach. Being Lebanese, I had experienced war, and this movie just managed to bring back that sick feeling of fear mixed with morbid fascination.And yet another ""based on real facts"" movie to honor American heroes. In 1993, 19 American soldiers perished in a raid that was ordered to bring about the defeat of the Somali militia and, consequently, the end of the hunger crisis in Somalia. Even though it was a civil war, the U.S. thought of it as ""a genocide"" and dispatched 123 elite soldiers there for a simple mission that turned out to be totally nightmarish for Americans AND SOMALIS ALIKE, mind you (1000 Somalis died that day). But, since Pentagon had to approve and stamp the script prior to production, I'm not surprised the movie turned to be such a (visually stunning!) propaganda. The American elite soldiers are courageous, attractive, humanitarian, compassionate, and so on. The Somalis on the other hand are portrayed as a mindless, ruthless, bloodthirsty, chaotic mob.The movie was realistic, sometimes too realistic, i.e. too gory. In my opinion, Scott crossed the line between movie and documentary, and because of that the movie fails as a movie and the documentary fails as a documentary. This is as far as the overuse of gunpowder and bloodshed is concerned. And when I say bloodshed, I don't mean close-ups of severe wounds, but insert shots of decapitated soldiers, and of 'idle' fingers, hands, legs, and intestines all over the place.Some of the characters were recognizable and easy to follow in the heat of the action (duh, as if Hartnett and McGregor were going to go unnoticed!). But to be honest, sometimes you just lose count of who got killed and in what circumstances and who managed to survive. And because of that, you just don't sympathize with them when they express pain and anger due to the loss of their comrades.The clichés were inevitable: ""tell my parents that I fought well"", ""kiss my little girls"", Rangers and Deltas leaving posthumous goodbye letters with the soldiers left at the base, a soldier calling his sweetheart home and leaving her a love message on her answering machine (yep, she missed him by one second cause she was, of course, shopping). One element of surprise: usually, in movies, when a soldier is seen gazing at the photo of his sweetheart and/or children, it's a sign that he will die very tragically very soon. Well, not this time: the only soldier who is shown doing the above is incredibly lucky; he survives a plane crash, the angry armed mob, and he is the only American soldier of the Raid who to be held captive by the Somalis; yet he is eventually released. I couldn't help notice that.I'm done with the cons of the movie, now I'll move on to the pros.Needless to say, the action was dazzling, sensational, suspenseful, etc, etc. There was never a dull moment, but it was a tad confusing at times.The strongest point of the movie was the superb editing. The insert shots of the Somali victims were poignant: heartfelt music, grainy photography, lonely ""skinnies"" (and how dare they call them that in the movie, by the way?) wandering in the ruins of their city, with their moving expressions of grief and confusion. I particularly liked the opening scene of the film, it managed to pull out the desolation, misery, and suffering of the Somalis.The moral of this movie? It doesn't matter if the U.S. have every right to butt in other countries' civil wars, what matters is that every American soldier on foreign soil must be brought back home, dead or alive. Mostly dead, in this case.",7.0,Anonymous,History

But if you want to know everything that went on that day, I strongly suggest reading the book by Mark Bowden after seeing the movie.

It has some of the best editing and effects I've ever seen in a movie. The sounds in the film are astonishing. From the gun shots to the whistling of the RPGs, it's very well done.

One of the Best..,"Black Hawk is quite simply the best movie of the year (2001) and one of best war movies I have seen. It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me with fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.All emotions, a subject of much debate where this movie is concerned, at least among some critics. While the reviews for Black Hawk Down have on average ranged from ""Good to Excellent,"" there has been persistent and growing criticism over the lack of clearly drawn out characters that the audience could connect with, the lack of historical context, and the fact that movie is all action, with no heart, with no point-of-view. Well I think those who criticize the movie on these grounds, have completely missed the point of the movie, and are flat-out wrong. It is a movie told from the soldiers point-of-view, pure and simple. This is not a political movie, this is not a movie that needs cheap sentimentality or conventional emotional ""hooks"" for the characters. As much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, the overly sentimental framing device used by Spielberg, really annoyed me. It felt like he was pandering to the audience just a little bit, and it wasn't necessary. Well, there's no pandering here, no cheap sentimentality in Black Hawk Down, just the horrible, gruesome, disorienting reality of modern combat. I didn't know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center, but I was moved to tears by what happened to them on Sept. 11 and that's the way I felt today in the movie.As far as I am concerned there was plenty of emotion in Black Hawk Down, plenty of ""choke-up"" moments, or moments when I was moved by the unbelievable courage shown by the soldiers as they faced an almost hopeless situation. I'm not sure how anyone could not be moved by seeing these 18-25 year-old men trapped in the horror of a Civil War that had no bearing on U.S. National Security. As portrayed by the amazing ensemble cast, these men (really boys in many cases) showed the full range of emotions that our soldiers must have gone through, not to mention the fear and confusion of their situation. To me the cast standouts were Josh Hartnett (boy has he got BIG FUTURE STAR written all over him) as Staff Sgt Eversmann and Australian actor Eric Bana as Sgt 1st Class ""Hoot."" Black Hawk Down is a great movie, and it is an important movie. It is the story of courage and heroism against nearly insurmountable odds. What happened in Somalia was a foreign policy failure for the U.S., but the actions of the soldiers sent into battle that October day were anything but failure. .",10.0,Anonymous,History
Remove the bullets and bombs and uncover the truth.,"Ridley Scott, the guy that ruined Gladiator, is back again.   This guy loves to make movies that put you to sleep.  The only thing that the audience will like is the bullets and big explosions.   Remove them and you find a story that is weak.  Sure it's a true story, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.   This movie gets off to a bad start when we see enough cuts and different camera angles to give anyone an epilectic seziure.  This seems to be a common problem with director Ridley Scott.  Folks, remember, different is not always better.  (Remember Natural Born Killers?)  Sure there's a story behind all this nonsense, but a story would move along a lot better with dialog (bullets and bombs don't count as dialog (see The Mummy Returns)).

"So many deluded fools in this world, I am amazed","First off: I am a white, middle class male from South-Africa. I find this piece of screen offal not only misleading, but blatantly offensive. Socio-Geo-political-economic concerns aside (and I could write a thesis on these issues alone), can a bloody, violent (but almost unnoticably brief, believe it or not) conflict like this from our recent past (and especially on a striken continent like Africa) really be seen as entertainment? THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINMENT, IT IS A GROSS MISREPRESETATION. It is nothing more than AMerican nationalist propaganda in the wake of the overwrought 9/11 travesty to be used as justification for American involvement in sensitive current world affairs. Here are a few unsettling macro facts; if anyone would like references, I can supply them, they are reliable, I am an honours university student: Since the end of World War 2, the United States government has provided more than 200 billion dollars worth of military aid to foreign governments, the purpose not being to protect them from outside aggression, but to secure American economic interests in those countries. The recipients of aid have been some of the most notorious miltiary dictatorships, autocratic regimes the world has ever seen. America is a rogue nation, like it or not.It was certainly clever for the producers of this film to single out an event in East Africa: America clearly doesn't have any economic interests in this region. Why not read up on some other positively heinous examples of American foreign policy gone awry: there are many sources, and believe it or not they are not hard to find, they are not obscure, and are written by intellectuals from Oxford, Camridge and he like. Go and find the information yourself instead of sitting on your couch, passively imbibing codswollop like this awful film.Why do so many people dislike America: is it because we are jealous of their astounding material wealth?

"""In Somalia killing is negotiation""","Black hawk down does well with the depiction or war, it certainly is better than Saving private Ryan in every way. Visually it comes very close to the 'real thing' and seems very accurate. It is also very exceptional in that it conveys some tones unheard before, the tones that tell about the fallibility of the US army. This in my opinion is very good and healthy, critizism is always good.But the problems lie with the depiction of the crisis, the film makers are unable to take a good look at the crisis from the somalis point of view. Also I wish there could have been more emphasis on the futility of the situation because now the action in the film makes it too adventurous and Rambo-like. It also has a 'Readers Digest'-feel about it, with the moral being that Americans equal 10 or perhaps 100 somalis.",,Anonymous,History
The best film i have ever seen,"It is great film, I love it. When you sit down to the chair you feel like a American soldier. You appear in Moghadisho and you're fighting for peace. I was very sad when anyone died. The great music gets the brilliant atmosphere. I was very angry when Somalians shot down BLACK HAWK. Because of them died many people who wanted to rescued the crow of the helicopter. Fortunately, All of the crew had been rescued. When i read about every US-soldiers killed in the action in Somalia I wanted to cry. It was sad. The film was great but also it was sorrowful. Everything has some flies. BHD is not exception. They showed only American soldiers life. Not life of Somalian. But that was not so important... I advice you to see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Honest & Beautiful,"When watching Black Hawk Down, I could not help but observe how honest and beautiful the film was -- portraying, in the beginning, soldiers as how they are (often rowdy and good natured, ready to serve, wanting to serve); a portrayal that you often see, but was done especially well in this film; it takes a lot of the past depictions of war film's portrayal of soldiers and modernizes them, and turns them into something that we can relate to very well.And above this, it took some painstaking steps to remain true to its' genre of war film through incredibly realistic portrayals of the calamity that is war; there are a few scenes in the film that truly show what war is, and what war can be all about. It had moments that were shocking and quite sad, and it really makes the viewer feel and sympathize with them. And, thank God, it takes no Hollywood side-bar love stories further than they ought to be taken (as in a film called Pearl Harbor).In addition to this, the film makes a good effort to give historical background to the film and to show Somalia for what it was during this era of warlords. Although the film may not follow history to a T, it certainly follows it enough to give someone a good idea of what was happening so that we can properly understand a conflict that many of us had forgotten about, and that many of us were ill-informed about. So in addition to the very realistic portrayal of war, we see a very realistic portrayal of the event -- something honorable to the sacrifices that were made by those men.Overall, as far as war films go, this was one of my more favorite films for a very graphic depiction of war as it is, and for a film that was not overly dramatized. The truth was not stretched, no real political message was made to clog the piping of the story/film, it stayed true to its' genre, and the execution of the script was grade A (Ridley Scott directed very well). It was a very honest and beautiful film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent action movie,"A very compelling war movie telling the story of US troops involved in a high risk operation in Somalia. Ridley Scott directs some incredible action sequences and creates a real sense of the US forces being overwhelmed, in both a military sense and on an individual level. Watching twenty years later, I found it to be much more Hollywood and less gritty than I remember although it struck me how the mega A list cast often faded into their uniforms, which I think was Scott's intention. At times, I did get the feeling I was watching a one sided piece of US propaganda and the 'enemy' Somalians were mostly seen in the form of a swarming mob without much more depth.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Now, in my country we say that someone is a hero when he dies for his ideas, for his country and of course without getting paid!!! And we also see in the movie that many soldiers said, `I am doing the things I was trained to do'. Just that. where is the heroism in that?Of course it's not a good thing when people die.

Where Have All the Soldiers Gone?,"This was a very good movie, however, it starts losing its intensity midway. The main story of American soldiers trying to take over a city in Africa to stop the starvation of its people, gets broken down into separate stories of the groups of men who have different missions. It starts out well but slowly gets confusing as large amounts of soot start covering the mens faces, and soon you can't tell who's who. Then, as the stories jump back and forth from group to group the viewer becomes utterly confused on who the people are and what they're trying to do. The plot starts out following the stories behind 3 men, Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), Grimes (Ewan McGregor), and Blackburn (Orlando Bloom). The story sticks with Eversmann the entire time but slowly loses all contact with Blackburn, (after a nasty fall), and Grimes. This leaves the viewer thinking ""Where did those guys go? Were they the ones that just got shot? So who did just get shot? And why is he making coffee in a battle zone?"" It leaves a lot of questions unanswered but is overall pretty riveting.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"The Tale about the Subhumans of ""Mog""","""Black Hawk Down"" certainly is an aesthetically strong movie. But that cannot justify such an oversimplification of the Somalian situation. ""It's just a movie,"" one might say, but if there should at all be the need to produce a war movie with a setting so detached from reality and with enemy troops so dehumanized, then please let it take place in some made up banana republic. African people are not the brainless herd animals they are depicted as in this picture. I remember how I laughed out loud at the scene with the young, beautiful Somalian mother and her child, which Scott so bluntly used as an alibi to hide the racism that is being conveyed throughout the whole movie. Considering that the story of the movie is (at least to some extent) a real one, it is surprising, how little you learn about the war in Somalia. The only thing that comes across is that it seems to be a country inhabited by not-quite-human creatures, whose only purpose is to look absolutely insane and be shot dead in hundreds per minute. Oh, and to serve as a backdrop for serious questions like whether Navy Seals or Delta Force are tougher. Somalia seems like Vietnam in a desert with shabby houses instead of jungle. If you just want to see a technically well made war movie, you might like ""Black Hawk Down"". If you have a conscience, you won't.",2.0,Anonymous,History
a very good film,"Contray to Mr Taylors opinion, i would rate this film as easily of the standard of SPR or Platoon, perhaps even better, whilst these films were good I find this one to be much more accurate to true events. Due to the number of Soldier featured you don't get as involved with them as if there were 2 or 3 main characters, but being a true story every time a soldier dies it is a real man who really died 5000miles from home in some stinking city. many have commented on the lack of poetry in this film, this i personally find one of the films strongest attributes, it is a down and dirty film about what these men went through, there wasn't a lot poetic about it. Rather than trying to make any big political points, what this film delivers is the courage of these men. what really hammers home the point is the coffins in the back of the hercules as the film endsA fine tribute to the men who did not return, i feel everyone has a duty to see this film.",,Anonymous,History

"Needless, poorly planned op into foreign land - nothing new","As a non-American living in then Swaziland, Africa, at the time - October 1993 - of the incident highlighted in BLACK HAWK DOWN (BHD), I could not help but wonder about the point of that operation. The South African media carried some reports on it, the local media very little, and suddenly it seemed forgotten to the extent that I wondered whether I had not imagined it all.Then I found a Newsweek magazine with a more detailed account and from it I inferred that the mission's purpose was to whack a Somali tribal chief. Why, I never learned clearly, but it would take no rocket scientist to conclude that he displeased the White House. One detail that stuck with me from that read was that the US forces had gone in with state of the art listening equipment which proved worthless because the Somalis had no intel, Internet, or even a reliable national phone network, and communicated by traditional systems such as signs, sounds, and messages sung from mosque minarets.None of that surfaces in BHD. I suppose that Director Ridley Scott decided to minimize the extent of the poor preparedness for the mission, though early in the film General Garrison (played by a convincingly baffled Sam Shephard) admits that the helicopters sent in for the mission might fall short of requirements - which ultimately proved true.As an onlooker, I could not but feel sympathy for the poor residents of Mogadishu who suddenly came under heavy fire from foreign forces apparently intent on icing a tribal chief. I felt most of all for poor dogs wandering about the streets: Somalia being 99% Muslim, and Muslims regarding canine breath as the devil's breath, those poor mutts had it tough enough to eke out an existence before all manner of heavy military vehicles and gun fire made them run for cover (and dog hearing surpassing human hearing some 60 times, it must have sounded like atomic bombs!)The manner in which the operation starts, with slick deployment of forces from helis on to roof tops and not too busy streets, immediately shows the difference in technology, and the superiority of US Delta and Rangers troops. Military personnel portrayed by a rather hesitant Josh Hartnett, a determined Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor in a part that is as short as it is meaningless, Tom Sizemore as a colonel able to keep things ticking despite his serious wounds, the briefest appearance by a very young Tom Hardy, all come into view under an endless stream of battle fire, flying rockets, crashing choppers, exposed guts, a blood flood, and all the graphic gore you could ask for and more.Now, in light of such a devastating attack, you should be able to identify a fearsome enemy. Instead, you see dark-hued persons in plain clothes apparently realizing that they are coming under attack, taking up weapons, and driving open-back vans and jeeps with mounted machine guns. They are portrayed almost like aliens attacking earthlings, and I suppose our instinctive sympathy lies with the earthlings, but in reality their country was invaded by aliens.The CGI special effects are first class, as one would expect from a Ridley Scott flick.I found particularly interesting and memorable the baffled facial expressions of Gen. Garrison as he kept receiving bad news from the perimeter inside the unfriendly quarters of Mogadishu, mounting evidence that his men were near condemned and that he had no clue how to help them, but still he issued a threatening warning to the UN forces in Mogadishu that their military vehicles and help was needed. Thankfully, those UN forces rescued the surviving US troops from a truly anarchic situation with locals carrying the bodies of US soldiers and attacking the defenseless wounded inside the downed choppers and other vehicles.The end of the movie explains that Gen. Garrison retired the day after the wanted Somali tribal chief was killed. A fitting end, I think, to someone handed an unenviable and possibly avoidable assigment without the necessary equipment and preparation.BHD was done for the US market and obviously neither Scott nor the producers wanted to put off that prime market, but for this film to rate masterpiece it would have to make clearer what prompted the mission, the viewpoint of the Somali authorities and military forces, and even how the Pakistani UN forces felt about endangering their lives and annoying the locals by rescuing the US forces. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Good stuff but no real substance. That's the difference between watching a boxing match and watching a boxing film.

Scott's best,"Oddly enough, I was underwhelmed by this film on first viewing--it was not the non-stop action-packed Bruckheimer-style thrill-fest I was initially expecting. But Black Hawk is in fact a remarkable film. Its slow and meticulous buildup is masterfully executed. The viewer is rapidly introduced to about a dozen characters during the long setup, and throughout the film, we see the action through their eyes. Scott segues from the frenetic to the lyrical effortlessly, from the cold-blue hardness of military action to the warn tones of the sun-drenched country.Despite my opening comment, the film does have plenty of action, some of it the best ever filmed. The DVD shows some of the remarkable special effects (most of which were completely transparent to me, the before-and-after CGI comparisons are remarkable).Acting is first-rate, especially considering most of the non-American cast had to adopt some remarkably powerful southern drawls--take Eric Bana for example.I've always thought Scott was talented, from Alien and Blade Runner, but considered him somewhat superficial and technical. When Gladiator came out, I just remember sitting in the theater saying to myself ""when did he become such a Great filmmaker?"" Black Hawk confirms his greatness.A number of sequences are beautifully executed, such as the capture of Atto, the men on one Blackhawk going out to get Bana, the other Blackhawk coming in to bring in Bloom crossing each other over the beach . Another wonderful sequence is the Mogadishu's early warning system as the raid flies in. Sequences flow into each other seamlessly and effortlessly. The scene where the soldiers drop down to secure Blackhawk #2 is one of the most harrowing in memory.I think Scott makes absolutely no miscues in this one, every scene is deliberate and counts, and there is nothing throw-away or gratuitous.I read Mark Bowden's book, and the film does inevitably compress some events and combine a few characters, but some of the more memorable characters, such as McGregor's Grimes and Sergeant Pilla were all real.A final plus: lots of Elvis music.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Jingoistic, kind of racist, but spectacularly well made","Ridley Scott delivers a blunt force patriotic American film that is so jingoistic that some scenes seem one step shy of having 1-800-GO-ARMY appear on the screen. It's an unabashedly American film that shows delight in filming the American flag, as well as mowing down as many 'skinnies' as possible. There is a scene when an American soldier is wounded next to the downed black hawk and after he is killed by a rampaging mob of Somalis, they tear off his clothes and parade him around. That is not the offensive part, it's how Scott films them - close ups of grunting Somalis that seems like he's filming animals. In fact there is very little humanity on display in Black Hawk Down, the American soldiers are all cardboard cutout noble and most of the cast is indistinguishable from one another, with the exception of easily recognizing Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner because of their poor American accents. When I saw this film in theaters in 2001, I detested it, as it felt like a piece of violent propaganda. Years later, I revisited the film and while it still suffers from those issues that bothered me on first viewing, I was able to appreciate just how damn well made the film is. The cinematography is masterful and the action is staged almost perfectly. On a technical level Ridley Scott did deserve his Best Director nomination and the film is worth viewing for the sheer level of craft on display.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Violence, gore, art and racism.","I have seen this movie before it went on wide. ""Black Hawk Down"" represents a kind of non-stop violence that you'd expect from a real war. Based only on the artistic quality of the gore in this movie, I would have to vote that this movie exceeds what we saw in ""Saving Private Ryan"". But, that's where it stops. There is no art in the depiction of violence that engulfs the audience the moment the movie starts till the end.Another point this movie misses, or ignores due to racism on the part of the original writer of the ""Black Hawk Down"" newspaper articles -- later a book --, was the amount of lives lost on the part of the innocent Somalians. Please understand, in this brief encounter, there were 18 odd American soldiers dead, and 500 (FIVE HUNDRED) Somalians militia and civilians KILLED (according to American-Somalian relationship Org -- as published on CNN). More than 1000 others were maimed. I find it hard to believe that anyone would ever want to make a movie glorifying this, and then completely forget the other side of the story.Another thing that would stand out is the fact that this is a war of the white man against the black. The US soldiers (specially Rangers and spec ops) as dedicated here are white Americans (I found it odd that this was actually the case among the real Rangers). American soldiers were armed to the teeth, over six feet tall, with similar Aryan looks that made it almost impossible to follow the various soldiers (not that it matted, cause this was just about violence -- even though some of the acting was good). Another point I'd like to point out and point out in BOLD, is the fact that we've introduced a new racist word to depict Somalians, the ""Sammies"", I found it as offensive as ""N*gger"". This is plain tasteless. And just goes to show how clueless the average American film makers are.The only redeeming features of this movie are, the good acting on parto of the almost unknown actors, and brilliant violence that would be more appropriate on another planet, against creatures that were not human (Thank you).Furthermore, this movie represents all that is wrong with the American mentality. This movie is an excellent example of the reason why the rest of the world truly dislike America. This movie is an ugly gash on America, and I am not proud of saying this is a product of our culture. This movie almost justifies the violence that others inflict on us. I am saddened by how people might be influenced by movies such as this.Two thumbs down.",1.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most impressive bad war movies ever made,"Black Hawk Down could indeed have been one of the best war movies of all time - if it weren't so mindless, numbing, and demoralizing.  Ridley Scott's new movie about the failed US action in Somalia certainly is one of the most exceptionally vivid and detailed cinematic depictions ever of an extended sequence of combat in all its horror, futility, and suffering. But this depiction unrolls without sufficient context or point of view. As I watched it, I kept thinking of the forgotten German Sixties film, The Bridge (Die Brucke).  In The Bridge, a similarly futile and murderous, though smaller scale, combat sequence becomes a devastating indictment of war; but significantly, the Bridge begins with a long background sequence on all the young soldiers' lives before combat.  That doesn't happen here, nor does the movie take a position on war. I realize Scott followed Mark Bowden's historical account of the events of 1993 and has sought to represent the events `accurately.'  But is it `accurate' not to comment on the fact that this was an effort to relieve famine, and all it ultimately did - despite the success of the operation (because it was a success, though people call it `disastrous') was kill off a thousand men, women, and children of the country as well as eighteen American soldiers?  Ridley Scott's visual spectacle with its chaos and accurate war machinery isn't enough.  A movie about warfare has to do more than present a spectacle of violent action. It has to provide a context and present a viewpoint that takes sensitive account of the people and events it depicts - which in this case would be a whole lot more than the insane little message, `we're good guys and we're heroes, even when we lose,' that the movie leaves us with.  Since this is the story of a huge snafu, an operation badly botched from above that the soldiers salvaged at great loss to themselves, the movie would also have benefited from some of the brilliant ironies David O. Russell brought to the Gulf War in Three Kings, but Black Hawk Down unfortunately is a film without irony and almost without humor, with its violent close-up action so intense and constant, with its personalities so sketchily dramatized, that it actually becomes boring at times.  And that's as cruel to the people depicted as it is to us.  To go through 144 minutes of grueling action and learn nothing is deeply depressing. Young actors like Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, and Orlando Bloom do their very best to give soldiering a human face.  So do more mature ones like Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepherd.  But it seems the camera and the equipment and the special effects are the real stars.  This is not entirely surprising coming from Ridley Scott.  Scott has done a few great, even classic, films:  Alien,  Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise.  But he hasn't always scored a win and he has never been noted for subtlety. Last year's Gladiator was much more interesting than this, but still highly overrated. This time he has used a very blunt instrument to dissect an enormously complex subject of contemporary warfare and American foreign policy and he has created a spectacular disappointment.",,Anonymous,History

Great War Movie,"Black Hawk Down is one of the greatest and realistic war movies to date. It depicts the struggle and hardships of American troops during the Somalia dilemma. Director Ridley Scott does a brilliant job depicting the brutality and ruthlessness of war on soldiers. Scott also shows the personal and humanistic side of the soldiers with the care and compassion they show for their comrades. Although short stints following the protagonist Josh Hartnett, the movie really follows the situations of a tight-knit group of brothers. You really get a sense of the loyalty they show for one another as they risk life and death in order to aid their comrades. Although you may not agree with the decisions and principles of the U.S. which resulted in the invasion, the movie will grip you and force you to feel for the soldiers who lived through the hellish event. This movie demands an audience with its realistic portrayal of war and tasteful acting.

"Compelling, profound look at modern warfare","Black Hawk Down is an important film to watch in these times of war. It vividly and brutally portrays what war is like in an era of computers, helicopters, far range missiles, and select highly trained soldiers, without ever losing it's touch with the human side of the story or falling back on cliché.The film often feels like you're watching jazzed up news footage, with shaky news-camera type shot framing; the information always given bluntly through officers and soldiers giving orders. Thus, the profundity is taken from the visual cues, characters, and the chain of events of the story itself. The movie is extremely intense, the action and violence rarely stopping, yet unlike a lot of war films, it never feels gratuitous (shooting-for-the-heck-of-it-with-no-cinematic-reason), and the violence, special effects (crashing, building destruction, explosions) and gore don't look fake and are probably the most realistic fighting scenes I've ever seen. It all just adds to the realism and psuedo-documentary feel of the film. Suprisingly enough, it all helps the storyline as well.You must pay attention or lose track of the storyline and characters (hint: keep an eye on their helmets, their names are written on the helmet band, and it proves VERY useful in keeping track of the characters). Unlike some war films, the many characters, despite their fairly divided and limited amount of screentime, endear themselves to the viewer, and the actors showcase some excellent acting. This isn't an acting film whatsoever, with very little scope, time, or material for the actors to create memorable characters, but this film seems to overcome that, and the acting is one of the shining points of the film. In one bloody and intense scene (and my favorite scene of the film), a young soldier (who we're inconspicuously acquainted with earlier in the film) is seriously wounded, and the ensuing scene, though intensely bloody and not `mushy', is also highly emotional. Scott and the actors just let the scene roll scene honestly and let it play out. The film is full of many such scenes, but it never once tries to manipulate your emotions. It is brutally honest and technical, sometimes confusing, but it was the news, is the stories of these men, and will one day be history.But even more than the freshly conceived look at the human cost of the war and the amazing street fighting sequences, probably the most compelling and exciting aspect of the film is learning about what happened in Mogadishu and seeing how modern wars are fought. I had known almost nothing about it, but the film very clearly lays out what happened, and shows the tactics and dangers that modern soldiers face while going into hostile territory.This film is an important look at modern life that will be a very important source for people in years to come, to see what modern combat is like. Ironically enough, a year after it was made, the world is seeing, live on the news, what modern war is made of. Hopefully it will shed some perspective on the dangers that our soldiers face on a day to day basis. It also shows how great filmmaker can still take an old subject and make it fresh and new, but most importantly, the film brilliantly shows that through the years human cost, bravery, suffering, and sacrifice hasn't and will not change.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"No point, no moral center, nothing to make this worth watching","Why do we need an action film about the US fighting in Somalia? What do any of us gain from propaganda? If every US soldier fights not for a cause but to stand by his buddies -- as nearly every scene and certainly the ending insist -- then what difference does it make if he's killing people in Somalia, Vietnam, Europe, or anywhere else? The portrayal of ""the skinnies"" by Ridley Scott is despicable. Very few even have faces; instead they have screaming mouths and war cries to reinforce their inhumanity in the viewers' eyes. Of course, we don't want to think about""the skinnies""too much; after all, that could slow down the action -- and the action has to be the whole point. (Don't ask, though, why  Scott has time to make us hear about Ewan's coffee preferences.) The Somalians aren't real, and neither are the US soldiers. Scott manipulates all the characters to skew the telling of history as he wants us to see it. Scott isn't just ""on the side of the soldiers""; he's expecting his audience to give up their any critical inquiry into the nature of war and the immense power held by our military leaders. Not one soldier in this movie is enraged at the political decisions that have led to so many lives needlessly lost. Is Scott saying soldiers don't think - they just obey? And is he saying we should admire soldiers for that? If so, he's participating in the kind of film making that many of our country's enemies have been perfecting for years.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Rebuttal for Daniel,"Daniel from France, I must post after reading yours.In my point of view, war is bad. So I prefer movies which criticize this activity.-Yes of course, war is bad. The US should never have invaded Normandy to liberate France from the Nazis. This movie was about the soldiers who fought and died Somalia. Do you criticize the Somali woarlords who stole the U.N. food aid for the starving people there?Like someone said : it's a ""pop-corn movie"" with no ideological purposes. Except of course, the soldier's macho friendship as the ultimate life value. In the movie, every soldier is obsessed to be useful and says : ""Yes Sarge, I can't fight ! I want to go back to fight !"". And the classical ""war cliché"" (present in every war movie since the 50's) : ""Say to my wife I was courageous ! - You will say it to her yourself !"" and the soldier dies.-How would you know about fighting? France hasn't won a war by themselves in 180 years. To think so many Americans died 60 years ago so you can say ""pop-corn movie"". Please do not dishonor their memory. What they said in the movie is pretty much what they said in real life.Frankly, where is the originality ? Some say the movie is almost a documentary. Are you kidding ? The historical frame is ejected in one minute after the movie starts. The enemy ? End titles say there were 19 killed US soldiers , and about 1000 killed Somalis. And what this movie shows us about the Somalis warriors ? Nothing ! They are just targets, with no personality, no humanity, they are ""objects"", like in a shoot-them-up video game. Like the monsters in ""Aliens"" or ""Starship troopers"". Soldiers US are the goods, the others are the villains. But the reality is more complex.-Somali warriors??? They were thugs and rapists who murdered other Somalis who dared challenge them. They stole the food the U.N. sent to feed the starving Somali people. You want to see their humanity??? I have news for you Daniel, they had no humanity. They were cockroaches. You are defending vermin. Typical of the French. The movie focused on the soldiers. Why would it give time to the criminal thugs??Don't misunderstand me ! I'm french, but I'm not giving a judgment about American policy, but about a movie. And the base of this movie is stereotypes. Sometimes, I like stereotypes ! Like everybody. I like ""Rambo"" (really !) but it's fictional ! And if BHD would have been a fiction, directed by Peter McDonald or Roland Emmerich, I would be OK. But I was waiting a little more from a director like Ridley Scott and more from a movie about a real event.-I know you are French. Thats why I feel sorry for you. This movie isn't about stereotypes. Its about men who fought for each other when our own socialist coward of a President wouldn't fight for them. They fought and died in a place you wouldn't even want to defecate in. They did it to feed and protect innocent dying starving Somalis. This movie honors those men. It is about honor and sacrifice. Something the French forgot when the Nazis were marching under L'arc de Triomphe.So it's really a very good action movie, (among the bests, I admit it) but it's not a ""great philosophical analysis"" about the war or about an historical event.-This movie is one of the few movies made that portrays the brotherhood soldiers have when faced with insurmountable odds. It does not insult them nor make them antagonists. It was never meant to be an ""action"" movie. There isn't much ""great philosophical analysis"" when an entire city is trying to kill you. Please read the book Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War by Mark Bowden. You will understand much, much more about this saga.

Black hawk down,"This stunning masterpiece ranks high up alongside such great war epics like Saving private Ryan and Apocalypse now. With a combination of Ridley Scots phenomenal directing and an array of well written and acted characters, the film really stands at the top of the action- war genre. The film is based on events which occurred in the early 90's when U.S. marines were sent in to capture two top Somalian lieutenants and hopefully end the bloody battles. The cinematography, directing and editing were the key points to the film. It was made to illustrate the danger faced by the military in such a situation and i think it achieves this well through the graphic battle scenes.

Jon Monsarrat review:  overrated but worth seeing,"Black Hawk Down is a wild ride, and satisfying as an action movie. The visual effects and pace are exhilarating and I enjoyed it.However, the film also tries to convey a story and have something to say. I think I missed it. War is confusing -- well, no surprise, I was confused as to what was happening where and who was doing what. There was no clear protagonist from whose viewpoint the movie occurs; several people share that role.Any film based on a true story is going to lack flexibility in what happens when and by whom. In a typical action flick, when stuff blows up, I cheer -- nobody is hurt, they are all highly paid actors. But here, the story was horrifying and real also. So I didn't enjoy the violence. It just unnerved me. Maybe that is why I rated the film a 6 rather than an 8. I just can't find entertainment in war, and as a documentary -- no thanks, I don't want to experience the trauma of war so directly. I like documentaries to inform me, not scar me emotionally. I suggest ""The Siege"" or ""Thirteen Days"" if you want a great movie that educates you without immersing you so fully.Who should see this film:-- Action / war movie buffs-- anyone who's intrigued by the horror of war and wants more (and you stay away from my daughter)-- Drama / arty types (because the film is really well put together) who aren't having a bad day and don't get nightmares easilyI gave this film a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"A realistic, gripping depiction of modern war!","Black Hawk Down definitely beats Saving Private Ryan out on the violence stakes - this film does glorify war, but it glorifies it in a way that brings you closer to the action, and takes you back to that fateful day, in which the Americans learned that not all stories had a happy ending. Though we never get to know any of the characters or care about them, we do witness the struggles they go through, and learn that, in the film's words, ""nobody wants to be a hero. It sometimes turns out that way."" This film has a 30 minute or so beginning where we build up plot and get the film set up for action, and after that, it's solid war the rest of the way. The fight scenes are beautifully directed, choreographed and made - Ridley Scott's film should have won more Oscars, but it wasn't fortuitous that the first Lord of the Rings came out in the same year. The film was evidently filmed on a massive budget - nothing looks cheap about it - but it shows us that even stylized battle scenes can depict war just as realistically as non-stylized ones. On top of that, the film has a simply-written yet powerful ending, and a script that captures the true feel of war. Ridley Scott deserved more from this film than he got - though it wasn't a sham either. The exact opposite, in fact.But what made Saving Private Ryan great was its varied and interesting characters, cracking script, realistic looking battle scenes and truly believable research. Black Hawk Down doesn't deliver as much in any of these aspects (save the battles), and will never be taken as seriously as SPR. Though it will never capture Ryan's heights, Black Hawk Down will stick in my mind forever as possibly this decade's greatest war film.Overall, if you are any self-respecting fan of Ridley Scott, this is a must-see - it shows his true talent as a director (he got an Oscar nomination for this), and also shows his bravery at tackling the times that Americans don't remember so fondly. This film is great - do not miss it if you get the chance. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Black Hawk Let Down,"Sorry to be a party pooper on this one.  I am a serious Ridley fan :Christ, I quite liked ""Hannibal"", and ""Blade Runner"" is quite simply the best movie of all time.  And I was expecting great stuff from BHD, a sort of ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the 1990s.  And after a great, ominous build up, culminating in that marvellous shot of the choppers belting towards Mogadishu over the kid with the mobile phone, I settled down to enjoy a cracking movie.....which never really arrived.  The action scenes are competently directed, the acting is first rate, a huge number of extras and buildings expire in spectacular fashion, but after about half an hour I actually got bored.  It felt like I'd seen it all before; I kept expecting the maestro Ridley to add an extra ingredient, to show me modern war in a new and frightening light, but it just didn't happen.  Which is a great shame.  I'm afraid made for TV Band of Brothers is a much worthier successor to SPR.Still, the RPGs hurtling across the screen were quite fun.",6.0,Anonymous,History

This could be the most unpleasant film I've ever seen.,"What an awful experience. Do you remember all the buzz about the D-day scene from Saving Private Ryan? Imagine a whole movie that's just that. Black Hawk Down is that movie.Giving a synopsis is very difficult simply because the film does a horrible job of explaining what's going on. Basically the Somalians are bad and the Americans go in and fight. We follow a bunch of random soldiers as they fight their way through.The problem is that we don't ever get to know anything about them. They are just names and faces. One minute after the credits rolled, I could not remember the name of a single person in the entire thing. Not a single name! That is how unimportant these characters are.It is impossible to care about what's going on if the reasons behind the chaos are vague at best, and the movie gives us no reason to care about its protagonists. Because of this, all I saw were random explosions and people getting maimed. Unfortunately that isn't even done right since I could never tell where anyone was in relation to anyone else or where/when these goings on were... well... going on.I suppose that it could be argued that it was done this way to simulate the real confusion and chaos of the battle field, but I disagree. Real conflicts are complex things. They are not just random acts of violence. They involve real people; people with a past and family and friends. They involve complex political and social issues and conflicts. Ridley Scott's vision of war, on the other hand, has none of this so it cannot be simulating any kind of reality. Ridley Scott's vision of war is that of a hyper-active fourteen-year-old who just watched Saving Private Ryan and thought that the D-day scene was ""cool"" but that pesky story was boring and disposable.1/2 out of 5 stars",,Anonymous,History
This is an easy 10/10 for me.,"Black Hawk Down (2001) is currently available on HBOMax. The storyline follows a mission in the middle east that was supposed to be 30-minutes in and out, efficient with heavy land and air support; unfortunately, the enemy is alerted and prepared for their arrival. When two of the black hawks are shot down a rescue mission ensues; unfortunately, those that were waiting for the mission aren't going anywhere or making it easy for the troops to be saved. This movie was directed by Ridley Scott (Alien) and stars Josh Hartnett (30 Days of Night), Eric Bana (Hulk), Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting), Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting), William Fichtner (Crash) and Sam Shepard (Mud). The storyline for this is so well told, paced and delivered. The intensity from beginning to end is mesmerizing and couldn't have been better delivered. There was so much detail in this, way more than the average military/war movie. The acting is also first rate and the characters and their mindset in each circumstance is very well presented. There isn't anything about this film that isn't perfectly done. There may be some people who question the accuracy; but like all stories, it's not going to be 100% accurate to the actual events...get over it and enjoy the movie for what it is, which is a masterpiece.

What can you say?,"Let me start with the good....The cinematography in the film is beautiful.  The filtering and such really did give the viewer the sense of being there.  The same goes for the sound. Recorded and mixed really well.  This is what you should get production-wise for a big budgeted film.Now to the actual film itself....Plain and simple , it sucks.  To steal from Gertrude Stein, there is no 'there' there.  It's nothing but two plus hours of stuff blowing up and bullets whizzing by.  There is nearly nothing going on at all from a storyline sense, just pure action scenes.  Granted, this was based upon an actual event; however, if you were going to pick a historical story one might like to choose one that has some substance to it.All in all, you get what you might expect from it.  It's a Bruckheimer film, you don't need to say much more than that, although it's probably a little less entertaining than some of his stuff.

More Bruckheimer Junk,"Two words tell you everything you need to know about this film: Jerry Bruckheimer.Remember, he's the man responsible for inflicting the painful Pearl Harbor on us. His involvement in Black Hawk Down more than cancels out anything director Ridley Scott might have been able to make out of it.Black Hawk Down is the story of the disastrous US raid-gone-wrong in Mogadishu, Somalia, in the early 1990's. The story itself is extraordinary, and the book by Mark Bowden is much more exciting than the film, which ought to tell you something.As for the actors - who cares? With so many actors, an incredibly small amount of time is spent in what should have been crucial set-up, so we neither know nor care about the characters, and most of them are reduced to fake two-dimensional stereotype caricatures (a Bruckheimer hallmark).Horrible, trite dialog which you see coming a mile away and is just embarrassing to hear come out of anyone's mouth (another Bruckheimer hallmark).One of the soldiers calls his wife just before mounting up for the mission, and leaves her a sappy message on the answering machine, and she walks in and picks up the phone just as the soldier hangs up, missing his call. Any guesses on what's gonna happen to THAT guy (another Bruckheimer Hallmark)? Put a classic Star Trek red shirt on him, for god's sake.Much of the combat scenes are very well done, but the movie is plagued with horrible editing, both visual and sound. Many times a character speaks words with his mouth way out of sync with what we hear.Music score by Hans Zimmer's California corporate music factory excellent. Superb version of classic English hymn ""The Minstrel Boy"" over closing credits.Crowd scenes very well done, something which modern movies regularly screw up. The extras portraying the Somali savages really did a great job, were very well-drilled and choreographed, and looked very believable.And for the usual nit-picking criticism - major continuity errors throughout the film. My favorite: A column of US Hummvees is driving through the streets of Mogadishu, and we get a great shot from the top of one of them, clearly showing the Hummers mounted with M60 machine guns atop each. Cut away to side shot, and all the Hummers are mounted with M2 heavy-barrel machineguns. A small thing, but when you spend that much to make a movie, and it is one which is going to be viewed and analyzed by military hardware fanatics, one which you'd better freakin' well get right - especially if you're charging us $8 to see it. For those of us who AREN'T military hardware fans, an M60 is a Viet Nam era weapon which almost everyone would recognize... and an M2 heavy barrel machinegun is a WWI era weapon still in use. The two are totally different and look nothing alike.In all it's generous to score Black Hawk Down a 4 of 10. I would say wait for it on video if you're going to see it at all, but then the film's only powerful impact - the battle scenes - would be greatly diminished.

Gritty Urban Warfare,"Black Hawk Down: a movie that never should have been made.  It depicts the ugliest possible victory in battle:  the attackers extremely unprepared, yet with vastly superior training and coordination they take heavy losses and somehow don't fail.

Certain political and ideological motifs run through much of the movie, but fizzle out into exhaustion.  These events led (unfairly) to years of my blind hatred for President Clinton.  I don't understand how Americans will pay to see Kalashnikovs ripping into GIs.  This was front page news a mere 9 years ago.

"Without a Doubt, the Best Film of 2001.","""Black Hawk Down"" is everything that ""Saving Private Ryan"" wanted to be and should have been. But the film is smarter than Spielberg's masterpiece and director Ridley Scott (Oscar-nominated) took a few pages out of Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" to convey some really strong messages about war and what the U.S. military is in this day-and-age. It is 1993 and warlords are controlling Somalia and the capital city of Mogadishu is an important initiative for the U.S. to control as they try to prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of poor people who are unable to get food and supplies needed to survive. The mission is simple: capture the warlords, seize the city and clear the area so supplies can be transported to the starving people of the country. A 30-minute mission then turns ugly as the U.S. is ill-prepared and they under-estimate the fire-power of those on the ground. What follows is total chaos as two helicopters are shot down and a 30-minute exercise turns into a frightening 15-hour battle for survival within the walls of the city. In all dozens of Americans were wounded and 19 ended up dead in the event, not to mention 100s of Somalians as well who lost their lives. Ridley Scott spares no expense in the gore department as the film is brutally realistic and sometimes very difficult to watch, but Scott's film is very honest. Early on, he shows how the U.S. acted before the attack and it is not complimentary at all when it comes to the military. It shows a group of young men that are unaware of where they are and ignorant of the fact that danger is looming from every direction. Some were turned off by this, but I felt it made the film much better as it showed why this tragedy happened. The best performances came from Sam Shepard, Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore and Ewan McGregor, but this is a director's movie from the word ""go"". This is the best film of Ridley Scott's illustrious career and with much competition, it was the best film of 2001. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,History

Where were you on 3 October 1993? I live in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the home of Ft Bragg and many of the soldiers sent to Somalia for Operation Just Cause. When I went to the theater to see this movie, an old lady sat next to me, by herself with no other friends or family accompanying her. I couldn't help but wonder if she was watching the movie to understand the experience of someone she knew that had gone and perhaps had not returned. Unfortunately, I did not ask, but her presence at a violent Hollywood movie demographically targeting young males speaks volumes about the underlying interest and respect America has for its soldiers who answer the call to defend our freedoms on foreign shores.

If the American military is involved in any conflict it must be with OVERWHELMING force, with clear and achievable objectives, and with the full focus of the country and especially the country's leaders (Clinton appointed a committee to oversee the actions in Somalia).

The greatest depiction of modern warfare ever filmed,"Ridley Scott has achieved what very few Hollywood directors could do; the ability to bring to life the visceral intensity and chaos of urban street combat, and to do it in such a way that tinkers exquisite cinematography and imagery that is both visually pleasing and mind blowing. Everything in this movie from the aerial shots to the close ups of soldiers wailing against a wall as they press their faces into the sandy cinder block surface whilst carefully peeking around a corner is expertly accomplished and brilliantly choreographed in such a way that the entire style of filming resembles a thematic dance to the retina. That's the thing about Scott....his capacity to absorb visual composition with image translation and process it in such a way that its blissful to watch.I won't get into the details of the raid or the mission as that's left for the viewer to find out, but I will elaborate on what type of movie this is. It's not your ordinary war movie where there's a sweet lovable young handsome male with a loving family and a pet dog and a caring girlfriend who wishes him the best and sends love letters. That's called sentimentalism, and that's out the window. Black Hawk Down is sharp and straight to the point, there is no time for back stories or emotional connections to the characters, because real war movies with a focus on blood and battle disregard that silly trivia as nothing more than what it is...trivia. This is by far the greatest testament to the modern American soldier ever filmed, mark my words on that. Until something as impressive, visually encapsulating and combat orientated comes to pass, nothing is topping Ridley Scott's raison d'etre of war movies.

Makes a defeat seem like a victory,"The film ends with the summary: a thousand bad guys died while only 19 Americans were killed.  Wow.  Even during a total SNAFU, 50 baddies get killed for every American.  Makes one wonder why the Americans left Somalia.The film is a wonderful example of how a battle plan can be go awry.   If the kill rate was as high as claimed, the film does a bad job of showing why special forces are so much more deadly than semi-trained militia.  For example, I found it hard to believe that the baddies would run up to the second downed helicopter, a few at a time, getting gunned down so easily by the 3 remaining Americans.  The whole film seemed to give the baddies about as much sense as Indians riding in a circle around the covered wagons while the smart settlers sit behind cover and gun them down.  I say baddies, because the ""skinnies"" certainly weren't fighting like real people.Remember Saving Private Ryan, where some troops were so angry when they broke through, off the beachhead, that they shot some of the German prisonners?  I can't even remember any good guys getting angry.  Special forces don't get angry.  Instead, they just cry when they have to shoot a woman.  Yeah, right.This film is dreck compared to Private Ryan.  But it's ok entertainment, so 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Worst movie ever!!,"I may be biased, based on the fact that I was in the 10th Mountain Div. in somalia, at the time. This was the most ridiculously misrepresented and inaccurate movie I have ever seen- If I hadn't paid to see it, I wouldn't have stayed past 5 minutes. ""Everyone calls it the Mogue"" - maybe they should have pulled a grand away from that massive special effects budget to hire a real military advisor and get it right! This movie was a joke from beginning to end. I truly believe that this movie makes our military look idiotic and pathetic. I cannot believe it won any awards at all- it's plot is meandering and impossible to follow. It's characters are two- dimensional and unrealistic. In short, I hated this movie.

"Intense, brutal... ""war is hell""... lower the dosage please!","I can take intense films, but after about 2/3rds this one I was at great unease. The action was filmed good, as would be expected from Ridley Scott. At times though, it did feel a little silly how all those rebels and militias dying by dozens cant hit an american soldier. Ok, so some may say its how it happened but I wont get into that debate nor the politics involved...The real problem for me is the intensity of fighting, non stop for about a full hour, with extreme gore for every 3rd or 4th american death.

Did we see the same movie?,"I'm curious...how does IMDb choose which review is to be the one displayed with the movie details as the ""default"" review. The review I read politicized the movie, which from what I could see was as near a factual telling of the Black Hawk Down incident as Hollywood could deliver, without it becoming a documentary. Black Hawk Down is neither ""pro"" nor ""con"" about war - it simply recounts what happened. For those that would like to paint the US forces as ""cruel aggressors"" and the Somalis as ""freedom fighters,"" you would have to ignore the first ten minutes of the movie. The original intent of the Black Hawk Down mission was to try and capture two of the warlord's lieutenants, in order to stop the civil conflict. Remember, the Somalis were being systematically starved, raped, and murdered. The U.S. was there to try to feed the starving people and end the conflict - hardly a situation where the U.S. was acting as an aggressor. The Somalis warlords were busy killing anyone that stood in their way. Our soldiers were in the wrong place at the wrong time and were ambushed. Black Hawk Down the movie does a masterful job showing just what that ambush was like. The real question raised by the movie comes years later. Osama Bin Laden has stated publicly that the U.S. pullout of Somalia after the Black Hawk Down incident convinced him that the U.S. did not have the stomach for war, and would run from a conflict. Thanks to the Clinton administration's response, in 2001 we discovered just what a policy of ""turn tail and run"" would bring. Black Hawk Down is a riveting look at one military battle that had effects on U.S. policy - and terrorists plans that reached far beyond Somalia.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Realistic enough but ultimately not absorbing....,"The battle scenes that are the major part of the film look more real and less ""heroic"" than most Hollywood productions.At times a raw anti war rather than patriotic message is conveyed. This is good in my book. The main problem is that the character build up is lacking and the viewer is not given the opportunity to identify with any of them.And that is a crucial shortcoming ..You don't get to know them ,you don't get to feel for them....The acting itself is sufficient for supporting acts but no performance is particularly strong.The whole experience of watching this film is not a waste of time, but it leaves a lot to be desired.If you are a fan of no nonsense, non epic war films you can proceed.

"""It's the men next to you and that's it.""",Black Hawk Down is a film that shows a true story of a group of soldiers caught up in a fight with Somali soldiers and citizens who attack a US aircraft. This is not an anti-Somalia story as one very specific scene will help to present. This story is one that shows how a group of people can turn on a country they consider to be the enemy and how that perception of the enemy country can be perpetuated. It also shows how one small mistake in a hostile environment such as the one shown can lead to disastrous consequences.Ridley Scott is great at action. That is no secret. He has made several great movies with some excellent action sequences. This one is one of the most tragic tales he has put on screen. There are many scenes that are hard to watch. The shots he gets on screen are incredible. Scott does a great job to direct these fine actors and puts together a gritty film that puts you in Somalia during this battle.The actors were great but I thought Tom Sizemore was excellent. He built on his role in Saving Private Ryan to become that leader who will never stop until every last man is out of the line of fire. He put on one heck of a show. Josh Hartnett was good but he sometimes tends to lose me in the many blank faces he makes in just about every role I have ever seen him play. It does work very well in this film however.I would recommend this film to just about anyone that likes a good action movie. I could see some people having a hard time with some of the scenes as they are hard to watch and even heartbreaking at times. This is a fitting tribute to those soldiers involved in this incident but nothing will ever be enough to make up for the lives lost.,7.0,Anonymous,History
"Well worth buying, listen to the message of the film","I 1st watched this movie when it came out on DVD and thought that it was a good movie. I recently watched it again with 8 minutes of footage left in that was previously removed in the 1st release..... I think the movie was inspired by the deaths of two snipers that volunteered to help out at a downed Black Hawk crash site knowing that the chances of survival were at best, slim. The courage of those two men should be an inspiration to us all.As a rule i am not a fan of American ""fact based"" war movies as they often glorify the US army etc etc etc... One thing I am a firm believer in is that if you are going to produce a movie that is from an actual event you have a responsibility to make it as accurate as possible regardless of who wins and who loses....I felt that this movie was more ""open "" in the way that it showed the suffering of US troops, however I felt that there was no real effort made to take the viewer over to the other side and see it from their point of view. This does not detract from the story in any way though.If it's got Ridley Scott on the box then you KNOW that it will be a fine piece of film work........ How accurate it is, is not for me to judge as I was not there.. I have seen many WW2 movies (yes I know this is not a WW2 movie) and have found them so far from the truth it's laughable... Pearl Harbour and U571 to name just two.To sum up, I think this is a film worth buying........It's great music score, cinematography and sound quality are top notch... Try to take note of what the film is really trying to tell you though, to which you have to draw your own conclusions.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Too long,"Very little small talk or geopolitical considerations, we get here into the subject right off the bat : combat. And this battle is very captivating because it is very tense and very well directed, empathy builds up rapidly towards these soldiers you just want to see get back safe and sound.But the thing is that, assaults, gun shots and explosions become tedious and headache-inducing after 2h15. It also would have been more judicious to reduce the number of protagonists because it is sometimes very hard to identify them in the heat of the action.As for the cast, it is incredibly dense but this pile of fancy names, in the context of the film, turns out to be kind of pointless.Ultimately, Black Hawk Down is just a vast street fight, surely very well filmed, but too long and totally unproductive.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Misfire,"The fact that this movie was made is almost as embarrassing as the decision to send troops into a hellish, tribal war pit that fateful day.  Who's to blame?  The book is loaded down with detail and characterization that the movie somehow disregards for the sake of placing the audience in the cockpit of terror.  The movie made me angry because of its utter lack of development on several key factors that any important war movie should contain.  How can this film be important on a patriotic level?  Do those of you who actually give this movie a 10 feel that the closing lines somehow deliver an important or revelatory message after watching hundreds of Somalis get mowed down by U.S. force?  How do the families of these soldiers feel?  The movie is a spectacle; however, it's anything but spectacular.  Why Mr. Scott decided to get into a cinematic bed with Jerry B., whose odor throughout this film is unmistakable, is a mystery.  Don't waste your time or money.",1.0,Anonymous,History

"A film about friendship, bravery, and honor.","""Black Hawk Down"" is one of the few movie screenings I've ever attended where no one talked during the 2-½ hour running time. No one left their seats until the movie ended. Not one. One of the most powerful and realistic films I've ever seen. It tells us and shows us exactly how it is. This is a film about real people in the real world who were placed in harm's way solely because of political expediency. Many of who really died.Ridley Scott masterfully directs in such a way that he takes the most chaotic and confusing of situations and makes it clear to the movie viewer what exactly is happening and does so on a multi-dimensional level.The screenplay allows the characters to explain what war on the battlefield is about. Before the raid one battle tested veteran says to a soldier who is untested: ""When that first bullet goes by your head, politics goes out the window.""  Later, when it is all over he explains that when he goes back home and people ask him what happen, he won't even try to explain, because they would never understand. In battle it is always about the same thing he says, ""just you and the guy next to you.""Every politician should be made to watch this film to see the human toll from the decisions they make. ""Black Hawk Down"" brilliantly demonstrates that war is not a military act but a political one, and that there really is a difference between dying for something and dying for nothing. Every one of the soldiers who were killed died for their friends. None of them died for nothing.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It should be shown in schools and make the younger generation appreciate not just the other wars but this awful one also. No doubt there will be some that disagree,which is fine , we all have different opinions. Since that movie came out its intriguing to see how Somalia is doing ,sadly they still aren't at peace.

"If you Love war movies, you'll Love Black Hawk Down!!!","Well, like I said, if you're a 'war movie' fan, you're going to want to watch Black Hawk Down! When I heard of the title,I thought, ""hmm...what is this movie about?"" But it's a good thing that it left me at that point because the title made me and my friends curious. It made us want to go and check it out! That's a very good thing because it's not until after you watch the movie do you realize what a mistake you would've made if you had never come down to see it. Well, the trailer made it look awesome too! From that point, I was already pumped up to go and see it, but of course I had to wait a month to see it because it was still December. To tell you the truth, I have already seen the movie twice and am willing to go for the third round. Movies like this one (Black Hawk Down) Heaven and Earth, Saving Private Ryan, and Pearl Harbor, are the movies that I'd rate at the top of all war movies.I loved the way the director made the movie seem like it was so real! I mean, it was a true story but you can just feel that adrenaline rushing through your veins and it made you want to just get off your seat and fight with the American troops! I'd also like to add how the movie just went straight to the point, leaving no guesses! I remember thinking, ""I feel as if I'm watching the news!"" because I saw parts of the movie just as I saw on CNN.I thought the movie was so dramatic and parts were gruesome, and some other ones were funny. That is such a winning combination. I've never cried, braced myself, and laughed so hard in less than two minutes just watching a movie. I mean, from the time when someone died, to someone almost getting shot or almost dying, to someone who can't hear was totally funny...(well, that's if you've seen the movie). It's great how the movie keeps you up the whole time! A couple of friends, family and I saw the movie at 11:40 p.m. and we stayed up throughout the whole movie. I mean, at that time, you're probably already tired from either work, shopping, staying at home, but this movie would keep you watching! There's just non-stop action and that's definitely what the audience wants. We don't want the movie to drag at all.I noticed that the majority of the actors chosen for this movie are also from the movie Pearl Harbor (my second best war movie aside Black Hawk Down). It's unbelievable! They did a good job representing who they were. I mean, there you have Josh Hartnett, the ever-so-gorgeous looking man (alive) in the movie. I loved his character! He was so soft spoken, yet he was a good leader for his troops, and he knew his stuff. Then you also have Tom Sizmore, the Mr. know-it-all, yet funny guy, also a good leader, then there's Ewan McGregor, the dude behind the desk, the funny coffee maker who is totally surprised once he finds out he's going out to fight but feels totally freaked about it. But it was funny how he portrayed his character. And then there's Orlando Bloom, from Lord of the Rings, who is really serious about fighting, so motivated, and ready to fight, but later is injured went the Somalians targeted their chopper. Ewen is just too funny! Just like he was in Pearl Harbor. These are just some of the roles that you'll find interesting.I thought about how these little things in the movies that we don't normally pay attention to really mean a lot if you catch it. I mean,  the characters in this movie obviously play different roles and that is something that you'll notice in the movie. The actors obviously knew how to portray their characters and that's what made it seem so real. They all looked like real military boys! It's just so awesome! I really am dying to watch it again and again. Hey even when I needed to use the restroom, I told myself ""no way I'm getting off my seat because I am not going to miss a thing!"" I just can't explain (on computer) how excited I am for this movie but I do hope that they take this movie to the AWARDS! It deserves the biggest award. I hope the audience LOVED this movie. Wow! I wish I was a part of it! Hard work and fun is my philosophy and that's what this movie was about!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Engrossing, unbalanced and insensitive.","This movie is worth seeing from a historical context. This movie is based on an actual event and takes some cinematic liberty to fill in some of the blanks. Let's face it, this is not a ""re-enacting"" of the event - this is a movie. The actual event says as much as you need to know and to make your own conclusions about war and humanity. Hell, there's a countless number of hopeless and bloody battles raging all the time. A movie - as art - can transcend historical context and give us a new insight. Unfortunately, Black Hawk Down is rather one-dimensional. Considering that around 1000 Somolians were killed, this movie portrays little of their experiences save their bodies being torn apart by bullets and grenades. This is insensitive, but alas, this is war and - Hollywood. This movie succeeds in delivering the white knuckled combat action sought by combat deprived American males, it does not offer much in the way of acting. Some of the dramatic scenes seem contrived and out of place. Though based on real events and even real dialogue, the presentation of these parts reeks of Hollywood. It is the intense hyper-realism of the battle scenes that make some of the scripted scenes seem so out of place. So you want it real then? Okay, how about shut off the silly American patriotic sound track then. Or how about a scene showing Master Sgt. Gary Gordon body dragged through the streets of the Mog. After all that is what happened. But I digress, it might not be entertaining! No, but it would be respectful. This is that man's last hour, that is how he died, why not tell us.

But one thought may cross your mind: ""I'm glad I wasn't there"". That ""there"" is Somalia in 1993. A violent, starving city run by a corrupt government. Militia flood the streets. And I'll tell you this right now: few things are more terrifying than the devotion of these militants. They want the American troops out of their city, and they'll stop at nothing to get that message across.All the actors are excellent.

"More Like A ""Tony"" Than A ""Ridley"" Scott Film","That millions of people around the world suffer from hunger, tyranny, suppression, discrimination and worse is apparent to anyone who even only occasionally turns on the 6:00 news.  Heinous crimes and atrocities are committed daily in third world countries, and even in the most highly developed and civilized countries, as we all know only too well in the wake of September 11.  And the frustration, guilt and despair evoked by the accounts of such things can induce a sense of helplessness that is immeasurable.  Filmmakers here have chosen one especially significant incident from among the many on which to elaborate, and which puts the plight of those less fortunate into succinct perspective.  Probably because this was the largest land battle since Vietnam, the battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993 was selected to bring the turmoil in Somalia to light, and in so doing bring attention to the ongoing distress of our global community, as well.  A dramatization of the events of that day are depicted in `Black Hawk Down,' directed by Ridley Scott from a screenplay by Ken Nolan, adapted from the book by Mark Bowden.Civil War in raging in Somalia, and thousands upon thousands are starving to death under the relentless rule of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid.  U.N. food drops have been ineffective in relieving the situation, as Aidid's troops confiscate the food in his name.  Hunger and fear are Aidid's weapons of choice.  When information comes their way that two of Aidid's most influential advisors will be in conference in the city, the commanders of the American troops stationed nearby determine to launch a raid to capture them, which they feel will greatly undermine Aidid's hold on Mogadishu.  As planned, the operation will take less than an hour; but as with all sure things, the mission quickly goes bad, American troops become trapped in the city and are summarily engaged in hostilities by the enemy.  During the melee, one of the aircraft, an American Black Hawk, is shot down.  From his command post, General William Garrison (Sam Shepard) assesses the situation, and determines that no matter what, `No man will be left behind.' Afterward, the whole affair briefly became a blip on the evening news and a headline in the papers; but to those who lived it, it became a day they would never forget.  And this is their story.With his 1998 film, `Saving Private Ryan,' Steven Spielberg set the bench mark for depicting combat on the screen in decidedly realistic terms.  That film gave the viewer a sense of being in combat that was unprecedented, and with it, Spielberg raised the bar for all who followed.  Now, it's expected that any major motion picture dealing with such subject matter will deliver that same kind of realism.  And this film certainly does.  But Spielberg did something else, too, that was very effective:  He presented all of his major players on a very personal level, which gave `Ryan' a significant impact emotionally as well as viscerally.  Ridley Scott did not do that with this film, and it makes all the difference in the world.  Toward the end of the film, one of the characters, Hoot (Eric Bana), makes the comment that in battle, it's all about `The guy next to you.'  And that's very true; the problem here is, we don't really know who that guy is.  Beyond enabling the audience to feel the sting of combat, to be entirely effective and really make that necessary connection with the viewer, Scott should have made sure we knew enough about these men out there fighting for their lives to really feel something when one of them went down.  With few exceptions, it is difficult to put a name to a face during it all.  Quite frankly, for the most part you can't tell the players without a scorecard.  What he basically gives you is glimpses into a number of lives, and leaves it up to you to fill in the blanks.  And it's just not enough to make this the gut wrenching drama that it should have been.As far as performances, only a couple actually stand out:  Sam Shepard as General Garrison, and Tom Sizemore as Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight.  Shepard is outstanding, turning in a fairly understated portrayal that is entirely believable, while Sizemore shows much more reserve than usual, and gives one of the more affecting performances of the film.  Also worth noting is the work of Ron Eldard as Mike Durant, one of the pilots of the Black Hawks. But Josh Hartnett, as Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann, while creating a character that is believable, and definitely endowed with a 90s sensitivity, is less than a commanding presence, and for the most part is nothing more than just another face in the crowd.  The same fate befalls Ewan McGregor as John Grimes, a company clerk/typist who finally gets his chance for duty in the field on this ill-fated mission.The supporting cast includes William Fichtner (Master Sergeant Howe), Ewen Bremner (Nelson), Jason Isaacs (Captain Steele), Jeremy Piven (Wolcott), Orlando Bloom (Blackburn) Danny Hoch (Pilla) and Gregory Sporleder (Galentine).  Without question, the highlight of this film is the patriotism it inspires; in that regard, it's through the roof.  But as a cinematic endeavor, `Black Hawk Down,' is average at best.  It could have-- and should have-- been a film as emotionally gripping as they come, but Scott and Nolan dropped the ball by concentrating too much on the technical aspects of the project and apparently assuming that the human element would emerge of it's own accord.  The result is an intensely patriotic action film-- albeit a darn good one-- which accurately (by all accounts) depicts an incident that, while extremely disconcerting, is presented in a less than satisfying manner.  Scott and his team put together a good package with this film, but they just didn't fill it up-- or deliver the goods as well as they could have.  I rate this one 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Shades of 1898,"Like many things in life, one cannot very well complain about things that cannot be helped, things that you cannot change, and things that simply ""are."" So, I am not going to come in here and vent about the woes of American foreign policy; nevertheless, while Black Hawk Down might have been a well filmed movie, the false sense of patriotism  that it portrays (in a place much like vietnam: a place we had no business sticking our noses in), it was hard to watch the movie, and see our boys being killed for something that does not even belong to us. I love America, but I cannot condone any action that leads to the senseless slaughter of our youth, while as a nation we are unprovoked by outside forces. Since the year 1898, when our forces were sent into Cuba to fight a conflict that was not ours, there have been only two wars that America had a right to become involved in. In WWI and WWII we were essentially provoked in to the conflicts and thus had some sort of meaning to be there. George Washington, in his farewell address, all but begged and pleaded for us to stay out of foreign affairs and wars, but we have never listened. Ok, that is the way things go, and I will not cry over split milk. Nevertheless, if there is any measure of patriotism to be found, it is in the wars where AMERICA'S freedoms were maintained, and not the freedoms of those countries that have made poor choices along the way. America has made enough poor choices of our own: things that we must swallow and move on. Therefore, movies like Black Hawk Down, are simply plasticine portraits of what patriotism is suppose to be. If you want a ""feel good"" American movie, watch ""Ben and Me""(1953): the movie about that little rat that hung out in Ben Franklin's pocket. Sure, ""Ben & Me"" is a cartoon, but so is Black Hawk Down.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Hyperkinetic account of modern warfare,"The story  : in the 1993 UN intervention in the Somali civil war  US troops get ambushed in Mogadishu during a raid to capture local warlord Aideed. They must   fight their way out of the hostile city, under constant assault from thousands of  Aideeds warriors and Somali civilians.I remember reading about this incident  and thinking that this would make an interesting topic for a modern warmovie but frankly, I'd never expected something like this.Based on the book by Mark Bowden, it's a painstaking accurate retelling of the actual raid.  Prepare yourself  for a breathtaking, blistering brilliant  account of non-stop mayhem and carnage,  limbs getting blown off, hundreds of casualties and more ammunition  spent then on a dozen recent action movies combined.   BHD makes `The Wild Bunch' seem like The `Sound of Music'.BHD is near too perfection : direction, acting,  production values, editing, photography and script are  almost flawless. It is so rich in detail and moves along at such speed  you 'll need at least 2-3 viewings to get a full grasp of the full chain of events.    It may be  confusing  sometimes but so is a real war. The battlescenes are exceptionally well handled by  Ridley Scott ,on the top of his craft here, turning out one of the best movies of his long career (Alien, Hannibal, Gladiator, 1492,  Thelma and Louise, etc...) It almost looks like  a bunch of vets did the whole raid all over again.The DVD offers off-screen commentary by Bowden himself and some of the actual vets who that went through the ordeal, so movie must be pretty accurate.A good thing producer Bruckheimer decided on shooting (sic) the whole thing in Morocco instead of some Hollywood back lot  (and that he didn't choose Ridley's brother Tony to direct or we'd stuck with a  Club Med commercial with some blood 'n guts thrown in).Movie has some big stars like Ewan Mcgregor and Josh Harnett,  but they are hardly recognisable between all the shootings and explosions. But Shepard is distinguishable as General Harrison, the CO who took full responsibility for the mess.  Also Tom Sizemore as the convoy commander and William Richter as some kind of super Delta warrior stand out.BHD is almost an updated version of  the old-style colonial war movies where a small number of white soldiers pitched against  thousands of hostile natives.  One of the best  in this 'genre' is ""Zulu"" (1964) and  also based on the true life event of the Battle of O'Rourke Drift  in 1879 South-Africa, where a handful  of British soldiers must fight off a few thousands Zulu warriors.  Michael Caine's breakthrough movie !One minor  remark though on the reality bit : these high-tech soldiers are sure a far cry for the thugs and ragtag grunts  seen in `Platoon' or `Casualties of War' and whose main concern was  getting laid  or scoring some dope.  These model Rangers and  Delta Force (cool outfit !) troops are all such clean-cut and wholesome guys,   spending their free  time playing chess and scrabble, reading John Grisham novels and getting high, haha, on coffee.  Yeah, right.Is BHD the best  war movie ever made ?

Propaganda,"Let's put it this way: the soldierly fraternity antics at the beginning were bland and incomprehensible; Americans never missed their shot (except when firing at one another), and are accorded 5 minutes death scenes; the locals, on the other hand, are killed at a rate of 5 a minute, if not more, and are seen charging headlong into withering fires to be shot like they were Zulus at Isandwanah, or just running aimlessly about, again to be shot, nameless and faceless. They may have no notion of tactics but they were certainly not that stupid or suicidal (which kind of remind me of the final combat scenes from Saving Private Ryan where German elite Waffen SS troops were running around aimlessly too). The dialogs of course were ludicrous: the locals got to say endearing lines ""killing is negotiating"" while Americans had: ""tell mom and pop I fought well"". And by the way, they looked nothing like Somalis but were clearly West Africans. So in closing, I expect this movie to serve for years to come as recruiting video for the US military, and that's about it.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Made you grateful for your life and grateful to all those who have fought and continue to fight for our lives and our freedom.  I'm not a fan of war movies for the sake of a war movie, I prefer those based on true stories. I think this movie is OSCAR material.

As a look at men in modern battle this is very good. As a depiction of the actual event its fair,"Prompted by listening to the book on CD going to and from work I finally sat down and watched Ridley Scott's film of the day everything went wrong in Mogadishu Somalia.The plan was to go in, secure a building where some of a wanted warlord's men were meeting and then get out. From the minute the soldiers started to lad things went wrong when one soldier falls from a helicopter. Complicating matters even more is the fact that the Somali's know how to take out the helicopters and soon one of the Blackhawks goes down. This is followed by a second helicopter. With men and machines scattered all over the city it becomes a desperate race to get the soldiers out before they are cut to ribbons by what seems like every person in the city.I'm of mixed emotions about the film. Certainly as a representation of urban guerrilla war this is a kick in the pants. You are there in the thick of chaos as choppers go down and everyman is fighting desperately for cover. As a war film the film is amazing and its frightening since where do you hide when everyone it seems is out to get you? The problem for me is that the film is often not very clear. The battle is not in context of history. Granted that this is not always needed or desired, and I understand the ""why"" of it all isn't the point of the film, but without it the battle just seems to be a bunch of guys going in to a place they don't belong and getting in over their head. While that is certainly part of the story its also not entirely true. I think the problem is that the opening bits of the film which gives the film its place and time while explaining what things are like in Somalia promises more background then we get and perhaps it would have been a better film if we had just skipped all of that and just went into battle.We also get lost as to who is who. Even with the modification of names on helmets I found it tough to tell who was who and which story thread I was following. Yes the casting of Eric Bana (who is excellent and actually gives a real performance), Josh Harnett, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor and a few others help to make things easier to follow but for the most part much of the film was people in uniform shooting at people out of uniform.Okay yes, I had just heard the book which neatly lays everything out, but at the same time knowing what I know, I was still confused (and not because what I knew conflicted by what I saw).To be honest once I divorced the film from any sort of depiction of actual events and took it to be just a story of men under fire I quite enjoyed it. Is it the be all and end all? No. its a good story told in an action packed manner.Worth a shot Personally I'd like to see another version of the story which manages to tell the larger story as well since there are too many stories that weren't covered or left hanging..",6.0,Anonymous,History

Great film for those who love action movies,"This movie is one of the best I've seen. I doubt it will ever go down as a classic, but I think that everything about it is great, especially if you love action movies. It's at a good length, and you miss it a lot when it's over.Most people know that the basis of this story is that of an event which happened in the early 90's, when US peacekeeping troops were sent on a mission in Somalia. No one really cared until so many people wound up dead on account of this tragedy. This is a retelling of the story, and it's very realistic. Throughout the telling of the story you get to know all of the major characters. Perhaps not as much as in other movies, but you know them enough to care about them.Take Hoot Gibson, for instance. Eric Bana did a wonderful job in this role. He really puts the whole entire scenario into perspective throughout the entire film. He did things that I couldn't even imagine having the guts to do, while he did them without flinching.Of course, there are some times where the audience is left annoyed to death when characters do insanely stupid things that would probably cause even more deaths. I know that I couldn't believe it when women and tiny children would pick up guns and shoot at the men. I nearly died when the helicopters went down, and there were hundreds of Somalians going after the few survivors.The special effects in this movie are great and some of the best I've seen. It might be a little gory for some viewers, but that's what it's really like.I was really surprised to see that this film is not completely one-sided. I hate going into a film which is completely pro-American. In this one, however, Ridley Scott, although the main characters are all American, does try to show you things from Somalian perspectives.The film is rated R for language and gore, but don't mind it. There's some language but a lot of the time it's covered up well by bombs going off and if you don't listen closely, you'll miss it. As for gore, it's in almost every good action movie and there's no way to avoid it.This is a great film, and I recommend that anyone who really likes action films watch it. It's worth it.Black Hawk Down, Directed by Ridley Scott. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
War,"This movie is not about which side was right or which side was wrong in Somali Civil War. It's not also about to tell if General Aidid was a popular leader or a wretched criminal and oppressor of his own people. It´s not about patriotism either which would be a very easy choice. And last but not least it's not about to tell if U.S. aim at intervening there was truly humanitarian or moved by economical or political or strategical purposes. This movie is about war. War that could happen in any part of the world. As one of main characters says in the end (I cannot recall the exact words): if you are asked why you are in this war you may answer that you are here because of the guy by your side. Which means that this movie is also and above all about friendship, comradeship and solidarity during fighting. In fact the most moving moments of the movie are those when those guys tried to help wounded or dying comrades under heavy fire with total abnegation and at risk of their own lives. Technically it's an almost perfect movie, one of the 5 or 6 best war movies ever made. All the scenes are extremely realistic and true in every detail and you feel yourself moving around those streets of a Somali city and almost taking part in the fighting yourself since you are so close to those men that you can almost touch them and feel their breaths. And we come come to the usual conclusion in the end: wars are cruel, useless and irrational.",7.0,Anonymous,History
And you Thought WAR was Hell!,"The horrors of combat are nothing compared to sitting through this movie. Actually, I didn't sit through it.

And don't give me any arcane crap about how this ""merely represents the anonymity and expendability of every man or woman who serves in the U.S. military's giant killing machine.""

Worst war movie... EVER,"One major thing was missing from this movie. A little thing called character development. The characters were introduced and killed within about 5 minutes. One thing that generally makes war movies very powerful and different from other genres is that you get very attached to a character (it can even be the main character) and then he/she dies. This is powerful because you care about the character. When I was done watching Black Hawk Down, I didn't even remember any of the characters' names, let alone anything about them. Why should I give a damn about any of these guys? In short, this movie is the polar opposite of Saving Private Ryan in terms of character development. That said, the cinematography was incredible at times, and some of the battle scenes were very well done. But if you don't know anything about the guys who are fighting and dying, you might as well be watching Battlebots",,Anonymous,History
Combat with no apologies,"No matter what country you are from, whether Austria or Australia, if you have never volunteered to stand in harms way - then you shouldn't be allowed to criticize this film.There is no hype, no majesty, no glory - there is blood, there is pain, there is anguish, and there is death.  That is combat - and that is accurately and graphically depicted here.  This is not a telling of the trials of the country of Somalia, it is the depiction of less than 72 hours in the lives of some American soldiers.The comments that the movie drags, that the combat is so long and you don't get into the characters, that it's all American Hollywood - those writers have missed the point completely.  This is a movie that sums up the reason that men have fought and died since time immemorial - it is said best with the statement not from the movie - ""We few, we band of brothers"".These men have no deep motivation that we need to find.  Two things that some of the movie watchers may have missed - first, the US Army is all volunteer.  So to be a soldier you have to volunteer.  Second, to be in Delta Force or the Rangers, you have to volunteer again.  These soldiers are fighting - and dying - because they swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and to obey the lawful orders of those officers over them.Combat as depicted in BHD is what the face of combat really is - Tom Sizemore as the Colonel looking back into his Humvee where all of his men are either dead or wounded - and then going back in.  That is an American soldier being depicted.  From the perspective of this one time ground pounder, this is as real as it gets.  No bloodless wounds where the soldier who gets shot falls to the side and off camera - a squirting femoral artery right into the eyes is what real combat is.  For those of you who thought this movie dragged on - that's combat, and that's reality.  There is no moral to this story, no Private Ryan inner motivation - this is just pure combat - as it really is.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It's an action film from first frame to last.,"This is the only movie I've ever seen where I could leave to urinate, wash my hands, come back to my seat and they were still shooting the enemy non-stop.  The pyrotechnic and ammunition budget for this film had to have exceeded what Cecil B. DeMille invested to part the Red Sea.  It's an action film from first frame to last.  And its timing could not be better for a patriotic America.As a study of the intimate realities of war, it could be a training reel for the U.S. Military.  It impacts with the wallop imparted by  ""Death on the Highway"", a high school film Driver's Ed served up to kids learning to drive in the 60s and 70s.  Blackhawk Down offers a brief segment of a thirty minute ""incursion/extraction"" operation gone awry as they sometimes do  due to the many unpredictable variables in hostile territory.As a film study, it dissects a 36  hour of real life as a Ranger / Special Forces task force.   I empathized with every soldier and the gritty reality of their task as well as the intensity of their commitment; but the absence of backstory prevented me from becoming emotionally attached to any of them, an impact directors often hope to achieve.If you like action, nothing could be better!

"Goodnight, Irene","""From acclaimed director Ridley Scott and renowned producer Jerry Bruckheimer comes a gripping true story about bravery, camaraderie, and the complex reality of war. 'Black Hawk Down' stars an exceptional cast including Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Ewen Bremner, and Sam Shepard.,"" according to the DVD sleeve. All true, except for the bit about the ""complex reality of war."" There were certainly complexities about this war, but they aren't evident in the film. We get some basic truths about war, mainly that War is Hell and American soldiers are brave - neither are news.The title ""Black Hawk Down"" is at lest 50% of the film's total storyline. The DVD synopsis elaborates, ""In 1993, an elite group of American Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are sent to Somalia on a critical mission to capture a violent warlord whose corrupt regime has lead to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of Somalis. When the mission goes terribly wrong, the men find themselves outnumbered and literally fighting for their lives."" Humanitarian missions don't end like this; obviously, much of the story is missing.Be prepared for graphic war violence (accent on dismemberment). Mr. Hartnett (as Matt Eversmann) winds up being the valiant leading player. Hiding behind an accent, coffee-making Mr. McGregor (as John Grimes) is called to action. However, Mr. Bana (as Norm ""Hoot"" Hooten) emerges as second in command. Proverbial ""young upshot"" Orlando Bloom (as Todd Blackburn) starts out like he's going to be a focus, but drops quickly off screen.

Successfully walks a difficult line...,"Black Hawk Down could easily have devolved into a flag-waving Rambo-type affair very easily. All the elements are there: Good-looking, young, white American soldiers, faceless black Muslim enemies, a Vietnam-like setting, hyper-violent film-making, a young idealist Sergeant, an experienced heroic Colonel, a stern General, etc. One can imagine the damage that would have been done to this story in the hands of the wrong production team (say, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay instead of Jerry Bruckheimer and Ridley Scott).Like all *great* war movies, and most war movies in general, Black Hawk Down is an anti-war film. It does this by telling only one overall story: the true story of these soldiers in a fight against their ""assigned"" enemy. Whether the fight is just, or necessary, is basically irrelevant to the story. For what reasons things go awry is also generally unimportant. The fight is shown form the perspective of the American soldier, leading to a `good against bad' conflict. Within the American ranks, there are no `good' or `bad' players. Mistakes are made, to be sure, but there is no intent behind it. What matters is the ferocious fight the characters find themselves in and what it feels like to face that terror.I'm not sure that Black Hawk Down is a great war film, but it can pack an emotional wallop on the order of All Quiet On the Western Front and Platoon, and its action sequences are as realistic and direct as those from Saving Private Ryan. If you saw it and didn't like it, reconsider why not, as you are depriving yourself of a powerful experience.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Unbelievable movie,"I saw the DVD today and was so enthralled, I watched it twice. I sort of knew the story but since this event occurred during the beginning of the media venerated clinton administration; the whole story was never explained. The movie only makes a passing reference to the major reason why 19 soldiers died needlessly. Clinton and his minion, les aspin refused to allow light armor and c-130 gunship support for the troops; so delta force and the rangers were left to fend for themselves against a rampaging horde of somalis.Hollywood would never say anything to disparage clinton so we are left with a cryptic statement regarding ""Washington"" refusing the aforementioned mechanized support. The fact of the matter is that if the soldiers had went in with support, the sad event would never have occurred.This is clearly not what any good clinton-left winger want's to hear. That doesn't mean it isn't true.I usually don't go into the politics of something but this needs to be said.Now back to the movie: visually the movie is stunning, the cinematography and battle scenes are amazing. War should never be depicted as something glamorous; it is bloody and brutal. The violence in the movie is absolutely positively necessary.I have heard 2 major complaints about the movie, one that the characters are not well developed and that the movie is one sided and racist.Making some type of central character with a love story and other Hollywood clichés would truly detract from what this movie is about. It is about a group of soldiers fighting for their lives, not some inance piece of fluff in which the battle takes second place to some ridiculous love story.The movie is one sided to an extent. It is not about the Somalis; it is about US soldiers. I agree that it would have been nice to have them explain themselves. Is it racist to point out that the US went in to help these people and had it's proverbial hand bitten. These people do not value life as most people. The Somali's statement to the effect that killing is negotiation is emblamatic of their belief system. If they valued life, they would not practice middle age tribalism. 1000 Somalis died in the raid; I have heard ad nauseum about those people. What about the 300,000 Somalis that starved to death, are those people not worth as much as the 1000 terrorists who died? Think about that.Oh, by the way, have you noticed that the comments from the UK and Europe are overwhelmingly negative? Interesting isn't it? I saw a few comments from Denmark. What the hell does Denmark have to contribute--besides something rotten?Finally, this is a story that needed to be told in a gritty, brutal way.A 9/10",,Anonymous,History
One of the best films of recent years.,"I saw this film at the cinema, I really enjoyed it. Recently I got it on DVD, and have watched it a great many times since.What really made me love this film, was it's gritty realism of war. And based on just what was shown in the action sequences, was easily comparable to Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now (among others).The characters aren't really that important (except for maybe Eversman and Hoot), what is, is the way that work together and the bonds that they have in the field.The half hour build-up to the action, is used simply show what they (the US) was doing there, and what the Rangers, Delta and 160th SOAR were going to do.What follows, never once, not even after seeing it so many times, makes my attention wonder from the screen. From the codeword ""Irene"" until the last bullet is heard snapping past your ears, you are on the edge of your seat, dodging RPGs around your living room and shooting imaginary enemies.Because of the realism of this film, it's not one for the squeamish. There are (as you would expect) some grizzly injuries.The performances are good (although as the extras on the DVD show, a lot of it isn't acting), but Ewan McGregor should really learn to hold down an accent. A special mention for Eric Bana as the films ""voice"", Sgt. Hooten. Who really shows why they were there.All in all, an excellent war film, which really pushes the genre to a new extreme of action, with a little bit of depth.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

It features the best and most realistic battle scenes ever put on film. If everyone remembers how well Saving Private Ryan did with the message of ""War is hell"" you will certainly realize how good and how straight forward Ridley Scott is with the same message. As I was watching this film about a failed mission that was supposed to last only an hour but at the end it was near the 16 hour mark, I really got to care and respect each and every character despite the lack of character development. I got to know each character as the movie went one therefore character development would have been pointless because as I watched these guys get killed I felt a tremendous amount of emotion for each character.Why? because I got to know them as soldiers before the battle began. I didn't need the whole life story in order to appreciate these guys. Moving on, I do want to point out that this film is very violent and features probably the realest and most graphic scenes ever. You see open wounds and you see men with there legs blown off. If you have a weak stomach I advise you to turn away during these scenes because they are like I said very graphic. Another thing to remember if your a parent is this: If you must see this movie make sure you find a sitter because it is NOT for kids... I recommend this film to any adult that enjoys war films and film making at an all time best. It's very emotional and very touching. An unforgettable experience.

Be thankful that Bruckheimer didn't totally mangle this movie like he did Armageddon. This is by far the best thing he has ever been involved in.Black Hawk Down has sick action and violence and is pretty entertaining for those who have already been desensetized to massive amounts of gore. I agree that the end where they list the 19 Americans who died was a little bit bad, but what did you want them to do? List all the 1000 somalis who died? How would they ever find out all their names? They didn't have to list any names I suppose, but at least they went to the trouble of honoring the Americans (as if they need any more of that). I suppose what they could have done was just put ""We also remember the 1000 Somalis, names unknown, who died bravely in this tragedy.""All in all though, a very entertaining and accurate depiction of one of the greatest blunders in US Military history.

Relentlessly tense wall-to-wall action combat classic,"""Are you exhausted? "" director Ridley Scott asked his audience when he took the stage for a post-screening Q&A session in NYC on 12/20/01. And they were. Scott then claimed that ""Black Hawk Down"" is an ""anti-war movie,"" one certainly not one to be construed as a ""recruiting film,"" but the fact is, it could be shown proudly in any American Legion hall and rally the youngsters to sign up afterwards in droves. Those that are not scared by blood, that is. Doubtful that you could recruit many medics with this true-story depiction, since they bear the brunt of the horrors of war here. But I digress. The movie--to its credit--does not. Hypnotic opening visuals and atavistic tribal music create an aura of famine and hell on earth in 1993 Somalia that compell attention, attention that does not stray until final credits. It's an epic, but awesomely believable entertainment in which a real town in Morocco stands in for Mogadishu as well as Ridley might stand in for his director brother Tony. Does not compare in scope with Scott's Oscar-winning ""Gladiator,"" but certainly in craft.An unforgettable old-fashioned cowboys-and-Indians showdown where the cavalry does not come to the rescue, at least not in time to save 19 young Americans. Biggest flaw here, shared by other huge combat dramas such as HBO's ""Band of Brothers"" and Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" is that there are so few central characters and so many look-a-like white American soldiers in this ensemble cast that the viewer loses track of who is who. Fortunately, Tom Sizemore is recognizable here strutting his stuff as almost exactly the same fearless non-com combat character he played in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" so thanks to him for the visible reference point. A movie that has to be seen in the wake of September 11 if for no other reason than the point it makes very early on about the crucial role solid military intelligence plays in any successful operation, especially against terrorist civilian militia in the middle of a third-world urban war zone. Makes Afghanistan look like a training exercise, especially since there were three times as many U.S. combat deaths in this 24-hour operation in Somalia than there have been so far in weeks of fighting against the Taliban.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Essence of War,"Numbingly graphic depiction of an infamous 1993 Somalia mission that claimed the lives of 18 U.S. soldiers. It all starts with a mission that seems easy enough -- capturing a warlord's two top lieutenants. But when one (and later two) army copters spiral to the ground, the mission becomes a daring rescue attempt through unbelievably hostile streets full of armed men.Say what you will about BLACK HAWK DOWN, it captured the essence of war about as accurately as a staged portrayal can. We're with the bloody and battered men as they take cover and fire, desperately trying to survive hellish urban warfare. Scenes where soldiers are lost are not overly emotional, but a passing moment that neither the men nor the viewer have any time to reflect on until we return to safety. This serves the film well, making it an active experience rather than a passive one.The acting is also a strong asset, with the soldiers ably led by the likes of Ewan McGregor, Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana and Tom Sizemore. They wonderfully portray the enthusiasm, fear and courage of men not just in this battle, but all battles. Director Ridley Scott keeps things moving at a reasonable pace, though a slightly shorter running time (it's 144 minutes) would have been welcome.BLACK HAWK DOWN is recommended for anyone interested in a realistic portrayal of war or who wants to learn more about this sometimes-overlooked incident in military history.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This is a war movie worth seeing and remembering!!,"Black Hawk Down is a masterfully done film on a conflict that occurred in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993.  The Army's elite Rangers and Delta Force were sent on a basically US political public relations mission to show that the huminatarian Americans would do all they could to thwart the genocide occuring in Somalia and more discreetly to save face.  These units were not sent to Somalia until the politicians recieved negative press when Time Magazine ran an issue with a starving Somalian boy on the cover.  This film however only deals with the political issues of the conflict in the opening moments of the film to give the viewers a brief synopsis of how the efforts in Somalia had reached the point they had.  After that the story is shown from the perspective of the men who were there, no politicians, no humanitarians, simply elite soldiers trained for combat, to protect freedom and humanity. The film opens the day before the conflict giving a brief view of life in Somalia for these soldiers.  The film offers no deep analysis of individual, independent characters just simple overviews of a few.  This film shows war as a whole effecting every soldier and person with no man being more important than the next, each death being a terrible loss.  I praise Ridley Scott for leaving out all the meaningless banter and frivolous political hooplah and getting down to the gritty, simple fact that in the midst of war only the people within it matter. I haven't seen this as masterfully done since Platoon was made.  After seeing Pearl Harbor I worried filmmakers had lost the concept of what truly mattered in a war film and what the truly important effects of war are.  The only good part of Pearl Harbor was the actual attack.  Thus this film was a breath of fresh air leaving you with the impact of what occured on October 3rd and nothing else.  Allowing you to understand how these men were forever joined together in one day without needing the characters to tell you how they were changed. But understanding it because the film viewer is too changed forever. Understand that this film is an American perspective on what occurred and the impact on American soldiers who gave the ultimate sacrifice for people they didn't even know.  The absolute powerful and moving display of heroism at its very core.",10.0,Anonymous,History
ridiculous,"To see this movie on the top 250 Movies of All Time is just ridiculous. The first 20 minutes is pretty nice.  The breathtaking helicopter shots flying over Mogadishu, the shot of the Muslim praying before the orange sized sun setting in the ocean, these are great images.  After that it's non stop 90 minutes of people getting blown to shreds.  How many helicopters going down and people getting shot, how many people got blown to pieces and had their intestines spraying everywhere shots can one throw into one movie?  I had to see that to figure out that war and violence is pointless?!  They forgot to spend part of there 18 gazzillion dollar budget and get script or a story, not to mention original ideas, concepts or perspectives(see Three Kings if you want to see what this movie was trying to be and failed); they spent it all on the cinematography, film and squinty pretty boy actors.  This doesn't make a movie good though. One of the most soul-less movies I have ever seen. Why people continue to pack theatres and pay 9 dollars a ticket for this movie or movies like this is beyond me.  I need to stop going to the multiplex.  I'm in a bad mood because of this.

"A little overlong, but still enjoyable.","Definitely one of the best war dramas of all time. Filled with tons of action and gore that will have war film fans cringing. The first time I saw this was cut up on FX. But after seeing it a second time, not to mention a better time, I found it to be an absolutely brilliant film. After all the other great war films made, its hard to compete. But Ridley Scott does it the right way.Based on the actual event of 1992 in Somalia, American soldiers are sent to clean up the African mess in the city involving the starvation of villagers, which turns out to be a blood bath when the mission becomes more complicated than expected, leaving them to fight for their lives.Perfectly edited, great cinematography, excellent performances, and full blown action. The only problem this film bears is over length. Some of the action scenes could've been chopped, as well as some of the scenes from the beginning, as I started to get impatient. But its not too long before things start to pickup in the end. Stars Orlando Bloom, Josh Harnett, William Fichtner, and Tom Sizemore. Although quite a bit more gore than a usual war film, Ridley Scott, with Alien and Gladiator, apparently likes gross realism in his films, which is actually kind of entertaining.A war film that debates over your opinion. But for me, it was a clean, organized, and excellent war film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Timeless, Engaging. Well made. Deserves a higher rating. T","I enjoy historical films, and this one is a true story, ""spot on"" in every way, down to the ammo and weapons used (according to some experts here), which adds credibility to the story. I was hesitant to watch this, because, quite frankly, I have become adverse to watching blood and gore in movies, yet every bloody, violent scene was necessary to the story, not mindless, pointless gore, for the sake (and sensationalism) of gore alone. Also, hesitant because we got our butts kicked! But that was not the story. The story was the amazing efforts dedication, injuries and lives lost to achieve ""No Man Left Behind."" I guess we civilians never knew, because they rarely tell the stories about when things don't work out as planned. I am glad I watched this one.Also nice to ""go back in time"" and see then fledgling stars such as Josh Harnett and Ewan McGregor and comfortable old favorites like Tom Sizemore - R. I. P. (Saving Private Ryan), Eic Bana (Romulus My Father, Troy), William Fichner (A Perfect Storm) and one of my all time favorites, a true, ""mutimedia"" artist, Sam Shepard - R. I.

Not an Ordinary Movie,"Many films have many purposes. Not only that, but many films have many clichés. Black Hawk Down is not any ordinary film. War is an undervalued subject; many people do not understand its principality. Unfortunately, things in Somalia did not go according to plan. The mission was to be an in-and-out, only lasting an hour. But one minor mishap, combined with the determination of American forces to not leave behind any of their number, produced the bloodiest U.S. military action since Vietnam. Saying this, Black Hawk Down is no ordinary film.The screenplay and character development could've been more persuading in some instances. Quite Frankly; Black Hawk Down tells us nothing we didn't already know about the hell of war and the nature of bravery. Separating itself from other war movies, Black Hawk Down tends to fall back from the familiar cliché of the usual solo-hero. Black Hawk Down compresses so many tales of courage under fire into one, big narrative that it leaves little room for individual heroics. The audience comes into contact with a newly promoted Sergeant Eversmann who does his best to keep his platoon strong and intact; and he seems like the closest thing to a hero. Otherwise, the movie doesn't focus on one main character, which in a way is good because it allows the audience to escape from the good ole' fashioned scenario of an ordinary hero.Overall, Black Hawk Down is an enthralling movie that I would recommend to any viewers above the age fifteen and those that underestimate the true concept of war.",9.0,Anonymous,History
BLACK HAWK AND THUMBS DOWN,"If you like an endless barrage of bullets, explosions and bullets and bombings, than this is the movie for you. Sitting through it for over 2 hours adds up to a boring movie experience. If I want to watch that much gun action, I'll watch Vietnam documentaries. Even the documentaries show some bright scenery and variety once in a while. This snorer was one long burst of machine gun vollies. I expected alot of gun play, but this was every scene. At least put some variety into the various explosions and machine gun fire. Give some scenes with some dialgue, even if it isn't clever. I'm sure most people, especially the younger audience, thought the combat scenes were action packed.

One of the Best War Movies of All Time!,"Black Hawk Down is one of the best war movies of all time, but the remarkable thing is that it is a TRUE story!People complain that the visuals are wrong, or the lines that the actors say during the battle is laughable, but how do they know? Were they there? Granted, artistic licence has a part, but, by all accounts, this is a very real account of what happened in October 1993.Those people that say they couldn't care less which characters died have not taken into account that it was real people that were killed, and the actors are just showing the audience what happened.Anyway, back to the film. This is about a mission that I would class as a successful failure (the objective was completed, but too many good men lost their lives for no reason at all). The whole movie was really tense, and, even though I had read the book before seeing this movie, I was really shocked at the way some of the Rangers were killed, and amazed at the courage of the two Delta snipers (Shughart and Gordon) who dropped in on their own to protect Durant's crash site against crowds of Somalies. No wonder these two men were awarded the Medal of Honor! The film, for its length of 144 minutes, was basically a 120 minute running battle, with 20 minutes of build up at the beginning.The battle was well filmed, and, even though the characters were hard to tell at points, the script was good.Sure, there were things missed out of the film that were in the book, such as the airdrop of ammo and IV bags, and Mike Durant being forced to make a video, but ultimately, these wouldn't have really made a difference to the film.Don't believe these so-called 'professional' reviewers in newspapers. I read a review this morning where the reviewer kept talking about a film that was 10 minutes shorter than the real movie, and he mentioned things that were not in either the book or the movie.I recommend that you make up your own mind about this movie, but don't go to see it is you don't like too much blood and gore.

The best war film to date,"Black Hawk Down begins and ends as a high octane action film. Accompanied with a great sound track, there is rarely a break from the action. But what makes this film great is the lingering theme that runs in the dialog of ""what"" and ""who"" the American soilders are fighting for. The dialog of Mogadishu being a ""civil war"" is an idea the rebel forces use in defense of their killings. The American side speaks for the thousands of lives lost calling the rebel's action ""genocide."" The war takes place in the busy urban streets heavily populated with civilians. The American soilders are grossly outnumbered but utilizes tactical warfare governed by the ""rules of engagement."" By this rule, the only way to tell apart civilians and rebels is to see who's shooting at them first. There is no glorious victory for winning the war in this film. The fight is to end the rebel genocide. The heroes are the ones who will risk their own life to leave no man behind.",10.0,Anonymous,History

An Objective Look at a Heroic Disaster,"It is hard not to get emotional after watching this film. The heroism and courage displayed by the Rangers and Delta team members is the stuff of legends. They were men that risked their lives, not for their President or their country, but for each other. In the end, I guess that is why soldiers do give up their lives in wars and battles, so their comrades won't lose theirs.In the early 1990s the world was outraged by the human rights abuses going on in Somalia. War Lords were stealing UN food supplies while their own people, women and children, starved. The US and other nations believed that military action was the right thing to do. It is hard to fault them for it. However, what Somalia showed us, was that best intentions can go wrong. So often, we intervene in the hopes of doing good. However, many times the people we are there to help, do not perceive it that way. An interesting thing to ponder now, as many in the world chastise the US for not having involved itself in the genocide of Rwanda.Although I had doubts when I saw Bruckheimer and Ridley Scott's name on this project, it is a real drama. Yes, there is plenty of action (tons), but the action is not Hollywood thrills, but rather in keeping with the story. I also feel that the movie makers did present the side of the Mogadishu militia. We understand why they were shooting at Americans and can respect that they were coming from a different perspective, not necessarily the wrong perspective.In summary, this film shows that no soldiers have ever died for a mistake, be it Vietnam, Somalia or Iraq. They die for each other and there is an honor attached to that which few will ever understand.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Going Down Hard,"Right as you read this, the Somali civil war is still going on. Since 1991. Twenty one years, with casualties reaching up to 500,000 deaths. There, the REAL hunger games are being played. The rest of the world's interference came up with nothing. Even humanitarian missions are being attacked.Black Hawk Down is based on a book written in 1999 by Mark Bowden that chronicles the United States Army Rangers, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, Delta Force, Navy SEALs, and UN forces attempt to capture Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid in Mogadishu and the intense battle that resulted between U.S. forces and local militia and citizens in 1993.Even though it's a war film, with a lot of continuous action, the cinematography is beautiful and points you to pay attention to the detail. There were a few fast scenes greatly covered and co-ordinated. The whole movie was accompanied with strong ethnic and instrumental music, songs from the 90s and earlier.What can i say about the cast! It had variety , and talent. With names such as Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Ewen Bremner, Jeremy Piven, Tom Hardy, Orlando Bloom, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and the list goes on. A lot of them have made more than one appearance in various war films or TV series before.It's a good war film to watch with a lot of information on what's happened and happening in Somalia.

Of course it was only down hill from there, but that it would go this far...The film is basically a looooong gun fight with basically no story and stereotype characters. The Somalis are portrayed as mindless brutes at best , whose only job is to be blown to pieces. The moral of the film seems to be that an American life is worth at least 50 foreigners' and that there is a definite and indisputable line between good and evil that separates Americans from whoever opposes them.In times like these, maybe the black and white moral makes sence.

A Solider's story,"Black Hawk Down should be considered as one of the all time greats of action war films. Unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"" which begins with an incredibly realistic reenactment of the landings on Omaha beach in 1944 but becomes rather ""theatrical"" later, BHD depicts actual events throughout and sticks close to a historical facts. The action begins almost immediately and builds to a heart stopping moment when the trapped soldiers are under attack from what appears to be thousands of Militia men. For me the main point of the film was not to depict a ""botched"" mission but the bond between soldiers on the ground. In my mind the film has a similar feel to ""Das Boot"" which could have been a story about any nation's submarine. A more recent addition was ""Band of Brothers"" the amazing HBO series. Black Hawk Down is a soldiers story and goes some way to explaining the question ""Why do you do it, do y'all think your some sort of heroes?""",10.0,Anonymous,History
Best movie about guerrila warfare ever,"I had heard about this movie since about October of 2001.  The fact that Ridley Scott was directing was exciting enough, but the fact that this was about the 1993 battle in Moghadishu, Somalia was all the more reason to see this.  I vividly remember Somalis dragging our dead shirtless soldiers through the street like they were a piece of meat and was thoroughly p***ed off by that.  Many in the press at the time called that a failure of our special forces, which I did not buy; I thought that our special forces did well, but it's the men in Washington (especially Clinton) who messed up.Before seeing this movie, I saw Lord of the Rings and thought that that was one of the only movies of 2001 worth seeing.  I now have to place ""Black Hawk Down"" in this category as well.  This movie captures everything about the hell of war as well as US intervention in other countries.  Yes, we can make similarities to ""Private Ryan"", but this movie hits closer to home because a. it speaks about the type of war we are now used to (guerrila warfare), which really doesn't have a winner and b. the fact that we are facing a current war now.Most films on war so far have dealt with the conventional war that we are used to seeing.  A possible exception may be ""Platoon"", about the Vietnam war, but I really count that as a conventional war because we had a defined enemy.  This movie, on the other hand, deals with an unexpected confrontation with an enemy that really had no face--a true guerrila war. The movie spares nothing to the imagination.  I myself felt lost in parts of Moghadishu with the soldiers; the film makes you relate with what it was like to try to find your way to a downed helicopter while having to fight an enemy that you couldn't really see or identify.  What is was like to be forgotten and find your way to your company in a mindfield of people who were after you.  What it was like to see people you worked with blown apart by rockets while having to fight the faceless enemy.  I could go on, but I'll let you see the film instead.  I was also surprised by the fact that they did show the dead american soldiers being dragged through the streets, and quite frankly, as disturbing and sickening as it was, I'm glad they did to show how chaotic it was.And the best part of the film is that none of this is glorified.  We are not seeing Rambo blowing the Somalis to smithereens while he never sustains a scratch and able to escape a situation with his brute strength.  We instead see and feel what it is like to fight a real war and be pinned down, even when you are the best of the best.  I give a lot of credit to Ken Nolan (screenwriter) and Ridley Scott for not venturing into Hollywood territory. Ridley himself wanted to make this film a documentary, and has done a beautiful job at doing that.  I was almost scared that it would when I saw that Jerry Bruckheimer was producing the film.As for the cast, excellent job by all.  Yes, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, and Josh Harnett are in it, but as far as I'm concerned, they did their job; they made me believe that they were the soldiers fighting this war.Now let me deal with some of the criticism I have read about the film. Some have said that it doesn't allow for characterization.  I think that is thorough B.S.  Watching this film, you ARE with the Special Forces/Delta Force, and though you won't remember the names of all the characters in the film, that works to the film's advantage because to us, they are any Tom, Dick, and Harry that we know on the street, not some superhuman commando portrayed by a faux hero like Arnold.  We empathize more with them. Second, some will say that this movie is racist because it shows black guys fighting against white guys.  Hey, this isn't the US; it is Somalia, and everyone there is black.  And most of the special Forces were indeed white (from what I understand, only 2 of the commandos were African Americans, and one is portrayed in this film).I say that this should get at least a nomination for best picture and best director, if not win in these two categories.Finally, this movie should be recommended viewing for the entire public and especially to the beauracrats in Washington; the beauracrats should know what it's like to send our forces into an area that they barely know and into a war that is not ours.  I never blamed the troops for what happened; they were just doing what they were ordered to do, and they did it superiorly in the situation they were in.  Instead, I blame draft-dodgers like Clinton for putting them in such a hot situation without thinking things out.I've always had respect for our men in armor, and this movie is a testamen t to those who put their lives on the line for their country.  God bless the 18 soldiers who left us and the United States Armed forces.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Cruel, painful but necessary","By now, everyone should know the plot, etc so I'll cut to the chase.  This show is raw, visceral and almost painful to watch.  Not because it is bad, rather it is good, too good.  You can feel the pain and torment in the soldiers caught up in the fight.  You can empathize with their loss because they are just your friend/buddy/mate next door, whom you trust your life with.  This type of bond is rarely experienced outside the uniform services, and is specially strongly here and it shows.  The cruel part is to see young, healthy people cut down in the prime of their lives for a cause that was good but so poorly and disappointedly, lost.  BTW, I had bought the hardback version of this book back in May 1999 and had only the opportunity to read parts of it as it was painful for me to read it (for the above reason).  This movie made me confront the entire issue again.I can't say enough good things about this show, with a few exceptions.  The characters are not developed enough.  As such, the show is too short and too long at the same time.  Too long, because the fire fight especially some parts could be condensed since parts have already been cut out.  Too short as you don't know the various characters except for the first four of the billings: Eversman (Harnett), Grimes (McGregor), McKnight (Sizemore), and Hooten (played by the Aussie, Eric Bana) as well as MG Garrison (Shepard).However, to the younger viewers, this movie will NOT strike a cord as most have already been in my view, desensitized by games like ""Counterstrike"" and various FPS where you can kill and be killed without suffering any loss, much less pain of injury.  This is in my view, another tragedy in itself.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Big Mack with triple cheese,"I had not seen this film in some years, and it was great to see it as a Blue ray release. I had forgotten how many young up and coming stars worked on this blood fest of a war film. It starts of slow, but at a good pace, but as soon as the action starts it does not back off. Acting is very solid, great cinematography and very well directed. After watching it I again had to think why the hell do we go and sent our young people to fight in countries that don't want us there, and than when we loss lives, spend god knows how much money, pull out and than feel the urge to let these people into our countries as refugees, when will we learn, Korea, Vietnam, the gulf wars, and a few other. Unless our countries are invaded let these so called countries at war sort out their own mess at the expense of their own. I have the up most respect for our armed forces, but none for the politicians that just sent our young people to die in far away places in pursuit of their political agenda's. very solid 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Cut the preconceived biases,"Every review of this movie that has given it any less than an 8 has been filled with one of two things--a) exaggerating the sometimes poor quality, or b) talking about how great this could have been if it had instead given more thought to the politics involved. To both I must say a grain of salt and a pattern of objectivism is needed to appreciate just how good this movie is.  I saw it expecting a decent action film, because Ridley is a great action director, but came out feeling utterly overwhelmed because this movie is the epitome of recounting a battle in its horrifying, realistic sense.The dialogue is somewhat poor.  At the end of the film in Hartnett (I think it was him)'s last monologue, especially, people have complained of the lame simplicity and gung-ho-ishness.  But, I must say, having read the book for English (and everyone shoud both see this and read the book, for historical/appreciatory purposes involving the soldiers who make such valiant sacrifices)   that the dialogue, while admittedly simplistic in intent and uncomfortably gung-ho; is true to the dialogue and feelings expressed by the soldiers who Bowden interviewed.   Therefore, cut the bias, and recognize the realism present throughout the movie, even in dialogue.On the matter of the lack of political motivation the most obvious argument, of course, is that there is no time in the movie, and that is a good reason. Even better, and far more obvious, is that this movie is not at all about those events, as made clear in the sweet dialogue in which a Delta forcer tells Hartnett he'll be able to think about that plenty when he gets back from the battle.  Even still, some symbolic stuff has been woven, things that did not happen in the battle, that works in the movie to express some of these motivations fairly well.  Also, even further, the book did not occupy itself with these motivations much, either, and fittingly so.  For, this movie is about the battle, and does a damn good job of presenting it, but that is so obvious I need not talk of it.On the biggest qualm people have had with this movie--lack of character development--I, too, felt a certain amount of lack in this.  While I have yet to see Saving Private Ryan, I understand how getting to know the characters even further in this film might have served to its advantage. To that problem, the answer lies in a couple of sources.  On the matter of editing, this film does a great job, I think, of focusing on the battle at just a long enought time for the events in it (this is after reading the book, mind you, so mock me if you want for that bias).  They are especially hard to express because of the totally chaotic nature of the battle, but the movie did as well as the book (which was perfect) within its own timeframe. Which comes to the answer, which is, that having more character development would either a) make the movie too long or b) have to take away some of the events from the battle.  A few of the important parts of the battle are not included in the movie, even, so removing any more would take away from the battle even farther.  Also, the other thing, is that by not including as much the soldiers become more of a unit helping eachother, sometimes as individuals, creating even further the feeling of responsibility to this unit.  IMHO.Now that I am done rambling about people having biases, all I have left is to say that this movie is perfectly directed and cinemated (not a word) and acted for what it is--a recounting of modern warfare.  It is as intense and realistic as movies can go for that objective.  The biggest problem is in the sometimes weak dialogue, and it is not only easily forgiven, but somewhat fitting for the people who speak the words.  Everyone should see it for that reason (unless you have a weak stomach) and also for the historical fact of the matter.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Incredible war movie,"Black Hawk Down is an incredible war movie that's intense, action packed and harrowing.

Accurate Recounting of the Battle of Mogadishu,"This one of the best war movies ever made. It's hard to follow at times, partially because the cast is so large. There are over 40 speaking roles and on first watch you may not be able to keep who's who straight, especially as the actors become covered in grime and blood.It was too dangerous to film in Somalia, so Ridley Scott reconstructed Mogadishu in Rabat, Morocco. Everything about this movie is authentic as possible. Scott imported a small U. S. Army into Morocco, including 100 Rangers, 4 real Black Hawks, 4 Little Birds, and a ton of authentic weaponry. Some of the real survivors of the battle are in the movie. The actors underwent training by the U. S. military. It doesn't get any more real than this.This film goes a long way toward setting the record straight. The U. S. Media has colored the Battle of Mogadishu as a disaster for the U. S. Military. Watch the movie and form your own opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Near Perfect!,"This is a movie that had the ability to have an epic, but fell short in one department, the soundtrack. There was no need for any of the rock music in the first 40 minutes of the movie, especially the ever so clichéd Jimi Hendrix while getting into the helicopter.The action was intense and non-stop, the emotion was there, the cinematography was spot on, and the sound (outside of the soundtrack) was very realistic. It is also always nice when at the end of a ""based on a true story"" film, it gives you updates on how things finished. Ridley Scott did a tremendous job with this film. All things told an excellent retelling of a sad and rough day.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Cinematography,"Black Hawk Down was wonderfully filmed and it pulls my attention from the beginning of the movie. The event is centered around the Civil War in Somalia and it captures the strife between Adid and the UN, but, sparing the first scene where Adid was holding food from the Somalians, the movie lacked to explain the Civil War situation in Somalia. After watching this video, I still do not understand how Adid got into power, how he managed this, and what he planned to do by starving the rest of the nation. Other than this, the movie was extremely entrancing, grabbing me by the nape and dragging me through a disaster of broken down houses, bullets, and RPG's. The cinematography is something to be commended. From the first scene in the movie, the pictures are very evocative. The movie opens with a brief description and a striking scene of the starvation in Somalia. Several other striking scenes focus on the condition of the Somalia people. The combat zones were filled with seemingly and vividly realistic gunfights. Deaths were also very realistic. The video was largely taken from the standpoint of the US Rangers. As the nature of being with this group the entire time one tends to side with the US Rangers.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Brutal, powerful, very engaging","I was perhaps first struck by how modern this movie felt. It doesn't seem like something from 2001. It could have come out in 2015 and I wouldn't have noticed anything odd about it. It's set in 1993 of course so everything is meant to be appropriate for that time. I was also amazed at how many famous actors are in it, many of them before they became big stars.It's funny to see complaints that the movie is shallow because it supposedly doesn't give enough back-story to the characters. In fact, I find that quite ironic because I often find family scenes in war movies to be the most melodramatic, shallow and unnecessary parts. We know they have families. We don't need to be shown. And that can actually be more powerful. The soldiers themselves might not know much about each other. Maybe they'd like to talk about it and maybe they wouldn't. Black Hawk Down starts and ends where it should. It's a brutal experience that puts us right in there with the soldiers. We are one of them and all of them. There needn't be a main character.Black Hawk Down is an epic action film. It is relentless and never compromises its tone and style. It doesn't tell you what to think or feel. There is no preaching or tragedy or politics. It just presents what it feels is an important or interesting story. The acting, special effects, editing, sound are all top-notch. You have to sit back and wonder at how they did a lot of it. It just seems completely real. From what I've read, they did a lot of training and preparation for the film. The real people were consulted with. It makes such a difference and shows that the film-makers cared about doing it right.Some of the scenes were quite scary and painful to watch. I was strongly emotionally affected by parts of it. And it gave a lot of context to see how much emotion the soldiers hold back. At most they might shed a tear. Not because they don't care but because they have no choice but to push on and be tough. I think that's an important sort of thing though. To share some of the inner details of a world most of us will never see but probably fear or dread. I think many people like to avoid it. So to bring it to attention is really positive. We have to have some understanding of what war is actually like. What can go wrong. Some glimpse of how it might affect the people involved. I personally find all of it terrifying and I'm glad I've never had to go through any of it myself.This movie had me getting furious at all the Somalian people with guns. Where did they get so many weapons? Why are they shooting at soldiers who are just doing their job? They forced the soldiers to kill them. Even women and children. Why are they anywhere near such a violent area? It made me curious about the true story and I'm keen to read more about it.So, in conclusion, Black Hawk Down is a very violent but impressively made film. Not exactly light-hearted fun but important as an intense experience that gives you a better feel for some of the things that are going on in the world. Plus it does have some nice messages about camaraderie and plenty of food for thought about war in general.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Ridley Scott directing this? Beyond me.,"So... an adaption of a novel of the Somali civil war, later a disaster being watched upon by the world, launches onto the big screen through fabulous director Ridley Scott, who has brought us wonderful movies as Alien, Blade Runner and Thelma & Louise all among my favorites.""Black Hawk Down"" is probably at the other end. This was one of those movies I couldn't watch through. So, it aims to be a ""realistic"" war movie yet it's all played out like an action one, skinny Somali militia runs as cannon fodder for a handful of US soldiers that are outnumbered by say 100 to 1. So, they have a few casualties as well, I'm not surprised. But it annoys me that the movie is filled with nothing but utter violence, limbs being sprayed around, bodies torn to pieces through every possibly imagined way...

One For the Heroes,"It would be difficult to have a discussion about Ridley Scott without mentioning 'Black Hawk Down'. We have a knot in our stomachs watching the whole affair play out, sympathizing with the modern day soldier. What we come away with is a greater sense of patriotism, a bolder respect for our military, and a gratefulness to be alive and free. It's evident Ridley Scott achieved his goal when any viewer witnessing this experience can go beyond the screen and forget they're watching a movie. We forget these soldiers are actors, as every last face fit into the desperation of war. I commend Scott for staying focused on the operation at hand. Two and a half hours only felt like one.

pure war movie excels,"I just saw this for the first time and found it engaging and impressive, although with little of depth or originality. It is an old-school war movie of the type that have gotten in vogue again, where comradeship and battle action are the main things. The movie is essentially one long battle sequence, and as such it's pretty outstanding. The editing and the sets are extraordinary, reminiscent of the last 1/3rd of ""Full Metal Jacket"" or the first 10 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Big cities and structures shot to pieces make for excellent cinema, although the direction does border on a computer game-like showpiece at times. There were some strong scenes involving dying soldiers, not terribly original but effective in the context.The first thing I had to check out was who played ""Hoot"", and it turned out to be Eric Bana who I didn't recognize. His character and performance is the best thing in the movie, apart from the superb action scenes. Great screen presence, and also a thankful role as the cool uber-soldier. I can't say I think Ewen McGregor's part worked, except as comic relief. Josh Hartnett was OK, but seemed a bit underdeveloped. Tom Sizemore, Jason Isaacs and William Fichtner are *always* a delight to see, and I admire the casting department that brought in these charismatic supporting actors into the same movie.Racist? Well, if I was Somalian I wouldn't have appreciated this movie.

clarifications regarding the film's accuracy and brief review,"While Scott has put a lot of work into creating an aesthetically very 'realistic' film (although this particular style of special effects realism is worth more time)- tight camera work, incredibly fast cutting, and a meticulously crafted audiotrack - it would be misleading to view this film as historically accurate because of the blaring inaccuracies I list below. Number 4 is probably most important for a lot of people: departing from the book on which the film was based, in which Bowden wrote that large numbers of civilians were massacred by the American forces, the film goes out of its way to show troops only killing civilians when they pick up weapons. It does make a legitimate effort though - and Scott worked closely with top military brass to authenticate his film. But there is a range of inaccuracies that, while nice to know about, may not be essential to the film, which is far more enjoyable if we abandon the presumption that this is what it was really like (if we expect this going in then the film plays like a commercial for the Special Forces).Here are the range of inaccuracies I mentioned, from most benign to the more troubling:1) There are details that are put in to help orient viewers and tell who is who - eg. Rangers don't actually have their names written on their helmets - and these adjustments are harmless. 2) There are more involved changes designed to orient us in the genre - for instance, 'Hoot' (Bana's character) is an entirely fictional character modeled after various cowboy heroes in Westerns. This is interesting because he is the character I at least identified with most strongly as the 'most bad ass;' he is also the mouthpiece for the most explicitly propaganda-like messages in the film. 3) Also, more generally, the historical context is elided so that the mythological tone of the film can be amplified: the history of Somalia we get is purely designed to further put us in the world the first two quotes set up for us: -Based on Real Events, and -Plato: Only the dead have seen the end of war. From here the issue of (in)accuracy becomes clearest: Scott is more concerned with mythologizing the Mogadishu disaster, that is presenting Mogadishu as a philosophical problem and not merely a political one. He thus presents Mogadishu as a place where war is simply a way of life with no ultimate explanation.4) as mark bowden's book black hawk down details, the American forces were not successful at distinguishing somali militants from non-combatants and ended up killing large numbers of unarmed people.This is not to say that the film is merely a piece of propaganda. Thinking this way is usually an excuse to either dismiss the enjoyment one legitimately gets watching the film (and this is a deeply satisfying film for action-movie fans) or to avoid thinking about it altogether. The film is important in many respects, Mike Davis, an urban theorist, argues that it is the Blade Runner of the 21st century, and if you think about how powerful the image of militarized slums has gotten in our public imagination, it is not hard to see what he's getting at.",10.0,Anonymous,History

As there is no drama, there's nothing to hold the interest of any viewers who are not military buffs.

Ridley Scott does a good job in capturing the youth, vigor and determination of our soldiers overseas.  He also does a good job portraying the way our government cripples our military before it can act, which leads to debacles like the one depicted in this film.

"A very effective, visceral film","When I first heard about this film I was dubious about how Hollywood would approach it. I was a little more assured seeing as it was Ridley Scott at the helm; however Hollywood portrayal of historical events has often left a lot to be desired. It was only after seeing the film on several occasions that I realised that the film itself was much more about what was happening to the characters themselves, and therefore I would argue deserves to be seen in a different light to ""historical"" films. The visual filming is incredibly realistic and intense and Ridley Scott really gets the most out of his ensemble cast (notably Josh Harnett, Eric Bana, Jason Isaacs and Ewan Mcgregor) however that should not take away from the superb acting from the rest of the cast as well, who with the film makers have created a very absorbing and entertaining film.Once again Hans Zimmer's score is spot on and up there with my other favourites (True Romance and Gladiator) and it really is nice to see the music actually really adding to the film itself. While this film is only shows the view of what happened in Mogadishu from one side, it really does not loose anything for that. In fact I think that the focus of the film, if anything, is much better for not focusing on the political problems of the time. As a final word I would like to state that on my first viewing of this film I thought it was okay. Since I brought the DVD I have come to realise exactly what a brilliant piece of film making this is, and now watch it at least once a month. It is well worth watching a 2nd (or even 50th, as I must be on now) time. Once again another masterpiece from Ridley Scott.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Individual soldiers come off as individuals with their own personalities. The movie fully shows the problems of civilians in Washington trying to dictate how the front-line soldiers fight and what they fight with.

Just Wow!,"I know about the story of the film which is based on a real event which took place in i guess 1996 (i am not sure about the year so check it on google) and after watching this movie, i am thrilled and i watched it atleast 2 to 3 times idk becoz i love this movie. Loved that they added the Pakistanis too as they helped them (US) in the war. I am Pakistani so that is one thing that i liked seeing US and Pakistan fighting together. The Malysian army also helped but there was no mention of Malysians in this movie. Anyway i loved this movie and this is simply my favourite Hollywood war movie.10/10 for all of the things. Loved the soundtracks and everything.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Brutal but incredible,"Ridley Scott seems to make really incredible films, then go through a brief dry spell where he just puts out complete crap. Thankfully, Black Hawk Down is not part of one of those dry spells. It is a visceral experience, especially from a visual standpoint. It tells the story of 123 US soldiers in Somalia attempting to capture two top lieutenants of the warlord who has ravaged the country. It is a mission which should only take a few hours with limited shooting and little to no bloodshed. But things begin to go horribly wrong when one of the US helicopters is shot down, hence the film's title, and crash lands in the middle of the city. So begins a brutal rescue mission that results in a staggering amount of casualties on both sides of the battle. And to make matters more harrowing, it is all based on a true story.This is a very genre driven film, as are most of Scott's films, and Black Hawk Down is drawn out to a very detailed and specific account of a harrowing and bloody conflict in Somalia. There are a lot of characters and a lot happens in the two and a half hours the film spans. The beginning of the film is all a detailed setup of the situation in Somalia and what the US's current involvement in the conflict entails. We then move on to planning the mission, at the same time getting to know each of the many characters, some better than others. Then the troops set out and the last hour and a half of the film is the actual battle, which is practically a nonstop onslaught of violence and action. But it is all very gripping, very real, and very shocking.Visually this film is just stunning. The majority of the film all occurs on the streets of a poor Somalian town, but the scenery never seems to get boring or repetitive. Everything moves so fast that it will constantly keep your attention. The film has a powerful demeanor and a driving force that never lets up. I was truly worn out by the end of the film as there is hardly any time to catch your breathe. You just have to keep taking in all the brutal action unfolding before your eyes. This really seems to draw you in even further and you really begin to feel as the soldiers do, just wishing the action would let up for a second so you could cool down. But it never does, wearing down the soldiers, as well as the viewer. I don't know how Scott was able to do this, but he really did create a brutally engaging atmosphere with this film.Perhaps what really draws you into the action is just how detailed and brutal it all is. Scott shoots this film incredibly well, making sure we get to see every gory detail of the fighting, and while he keeps his cinematography fast paced you can still keep up with what is going on during a firefight. It is sort of difficult to keep up with who is wear and who is fighting who at all times, just because there are so many characters. It is always difficult to develop all of your characters fully when there are so many of them. It is especially difficult when your film isn't exactly a character driven film. Black Hawk Down is not. It is a genre and action driven film that also happens to have a lot of characters. Thus you don't get to know all of the characters as well as one would hope, and yet it is still difficult to watch some of the characters die, because even though we, the audience, don't know them well, you get a very moving sense that the other characters know each other very well, still making the incessant death in this film very impacting.Black Hawk Down is, in one word, intense. It is just a nonstop action experience that lets us see every graphic little detail. There are times when you have to look away because it is just so brutal, but you don't want to stop watching the film just because it is that engaging and that gripping. The only thing that would have made this film better would be a little more time and effort spent on the development of the characters, but other than that this is a fantastic film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A Very Quick and Intense Two and a Half Hours,","Black Hawk Down is a great movie with a very well developed storyline that felt very real and accurate to kind type of things that happen during a war,and because I felt that it was very intense and really put you in to this serious situation,the movie is almost two and a half hours long but it dosen't feel that long,its action packed all the way through.I felt that there was a bit too much action,not that I didn't enjoy it,but we could have gotten to know a bit more about the characters,Josh Hartnett,Ewan McGregor and many others put in very inspired performances and I would have liked to have gotten to know a lot more about their life.I was very impressed with Ridley Scott,he has directed several different genres,but I never thought he could direct a war film,but he did a really impressive job.I would highly recommend Black Hawk Down to all fans of war films.A large group of US soldiers are sent to Somalia to capture two warlords but are trapped by the people of Somalia that carry many weapons.",8.0,Anonymous,History
War IS hell .....,"Naturally I read the book first, and the movie was as true to the book as it can get without sacrificing time for entertainment.  If war can be called entertainment ..... This movie so realistically captures the two different styles of war (USA and Somalia); one being incredibly organized and technically superior, and the other being disorganized but fighting with reckless abandon. The gunfire-scenes are amazing as are the injuries and the treatment of them.  This movie ranks right up there with Saving Private Ryan and A Bridge Too Far.  A must-see for anyone thinking war is glorious. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Best Film to Date About Modern Urban Warfare,"'Black Hawk Down' plays a little fast and loose with the facts, but it's presentation of the events of the Mogadishu Battle in '94 and depiction of the sensation of being in the middle of a tense urban battle are as close to the real thing as any major movie has thus far come.Ridley Scott's rendering of the political events leading up to the battle is a bit bothersome in its brevity, but it becomes clear enough once the action gets going that this movie exists primarily for the purpose of reenacting the battle. We are offered the standard Hollywood tropes, especially in the form of Josh Hartnett's character, Eversmann, who is saddled with the role of resident idealist, and the character of Norm 'Hoot' Gibson (Eric Bana) as the king-daddy bad-ass, but the action is very faithful to the accounts of the battle described in Mark Bowden's superb book, and the development of the various characters (some real, some--like Hoot--composite) lends a strong sense of the stakes for these young men. The film is memorable for being one of the first authorized and realistic depictions of the work of Delta Force, the secretive elite branch of the Special Forces, and for reconstructing in a palpable manner the challenges of urban warfare with modern weaponry.This film probably doesn't deserve to be ranked alongside the great war films such as 'Apocalypse Now,' 'Full Metal Jacket,' or 'Saving Private Ryan,' largely because the events it describes are not part of a larger, more coherent war narrative. Task Force Ranger was a relatively isolated peace-keeping operation that would likely have failed to gain the attention of the international media were it not for the footage of the corpses of dead US Army personnel being dragged through the streets by angry Somalis (later that same year, the US Army invaded Haiti after a military coup against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and hardly anyone noticed). Nevertheless, 'Black Hawk Down' is a breathtaking, moving experience for its portrayal of the realities of warfare in our contemporary age.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Best War Movie Ever,"I saw BHD last night and it was everything I expected. I had read the book once and was halfway through a second reading prior to seeing the movie. What makes BHD so unique is that 1)the movie followed the book closer than any movie I've seen and 2)the book was based on facts. Mark Bowden has commented/written that he did not put anything in the book that was not only reported by those who were there but corroborated by others who were there.This movie is not for everyone. There is no love story, no slo-mo flag waving set to a swelling score. It is 30 minutes of background information followed by 2 hours of modern combat - the most hellish place on earth. I went with my brother-in-law and walking out he said he could not believe only 19 Americans were killed.I realize not everyone will like this movie but I would like to address two criticisms that are being made. As for what some would call ""sappy dialogue"", try to think about what you would say if you were about to die in the worst place on earth you've ever been. As for the claims of racism re: no blacks in the Delta Force/Ranger task force, it is my understanding that most blacks cannot swim at all and/or very well. There are stringent swimming requirements to get in Special Ops which most blacks cannot pass. This is not meant to be a racist comment, just a statement of fact. If this is incorrect, someone please feel free to correct me.This should get Best Picture/Best Director. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Refreshing,"The film has been criticized as over-patriotic, which I was happy to notice (I am really allergic to those films), it was not. Any country would react if UN-soldiers were harassed. Scott told a story and succeeded to make it live. He managed to capture how the situation must've felt in the US soldiers eyes. Also: the music was very well chosen to give structure to the movie. I've read interviews where the locals complained that they were made appear as the bad guys. In my opinion, a war movie has to be made from someone's point of view, and I do not see how the locals could've been made look ""better"". This was a film worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Another mesmerizing war film that reveals the true brutality of war,"Ridley Scott steals the screen with his awesome achievement that reinacts the most savage war since Vietnam. Black Hawk Down tells the powerful story of a settlement in Mogadishu, Somalia, but this little settlement between the president of Somalia and the US Army turns out to be a savage battle which endures all the horrific traits of mankind. Black Hawk Down is a brilliant and intensifying epic which reveals all the bravery and sacrifice of war and is undoubtedly the most realistic film to desert combat. In the successful event of winning 2 Oscars, Black Hawk Down is an authentic piece of work that commences a battle that can only reveal the brutality and savagery of humanity and in the midst of survival and hope lurks an enemy that is fully determined to cause troubles to the known world.",10.0,Anonymous,History
like a documentary footage..,"Black Hawk Down opens with a quote by Plato: ""Only the dead have seen the end of war"". Then, over a color-desaturated series of images, we are presented with a brief history of why the United States was in Somalia in the early '90s. The story begins on October 2, 1993. Characters are introduced - Major General William Garrison (Sam Shepard), who is in command of the U.S. military presence in the region; Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), recently promoted to commanding a team; Company Clerk John Grimes (Ewan McGregor), who is about to exchange paperwork for a gun; Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore), in charge of a segment of the ground troops; and Master Sergeant Paul Howe (William Fichtner), who will challenge orders if he thinks they are ill-advised. Together, these men, and many others, are about to become involved in a seemingly routine mission that will go disastrously wrong. ........The objective is to capture several key advisers to Mohamed Farrah Aidid, the warlord who controls Mogadishu. The United States wants Aidid out of the way, and this seems to be the best opportunity to advance that goal. But the troops, both on the ground and in the air, encounter stiffer resistance than expected, and this results in the downing of two black hawk helicopters. The ground troops then become divided as the raid turns into a rescue mission, and, in part because of poor planning and in part because of bad luck, the fire fight turns into a debacle.....It is informative, a history lesson on Somalia that many of us needed. The film is visually brilliant, a spectacular dose of reality that made me repeatedly say, ""How did they do that? No wait, how did they do that?"" I cannot stress this point enough. ""Black Hawk Down"" makes you believe you are watching a documentary or live CNN war footage by one of those crazy reporters. It has that much gritty authenticity. ....the film is more about the incident than it is about the people fighting the battles. It relies too much on action and battles, in my opinion, instead of getting to the heart of the matter, the humans involved in this slaughter. There are so many U.S. military personnel involved in this failed mission that we never really know who any of them are...",,Anonymous,History
A masterpiece!,"Black Hawk Down is a really intense, intelligent, violent, moving film. I can't think of anything bad to say about it.

Of course, I expected it would be good because of the director Ridley Scott. But still, I wondered what the result would be if Ridley Scott worked together with producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I can only say 1 thing about that: the result was amazing.

My second favorite war film of all time,"Ridley Scott blew me away with this tragic and heroic work on 1993s troubles in Somalia. Having been entranced as a ten year old boy viewing Lawrence of Arabia in 70mm, I found even the better war films since wanting by comparison. These two films are utterly differnt in myriad ways but this; they a perfect on their own terms, executed so well, and engrossing -- so engaging that one ought to go away only disatified that one could not have lived through it in person, although the violence is a bit much for REALLY wishing you'd been on the scene, with limbs flying about and such.
I can't adequately describe how this film was so effective, to even dare compare it to the incomparable Lawrence. Every scene just worked. So much battle action pervades, you might think, ""what is the differnce between this and a Van Damme or Chuck Norris picture?' Fair question. All I can say is the acting is fantastic and the action scenes are directed by one of the truly brilliant auteurs of cinema. This is Ridley Scott in his finest hour, and if he were to make movies for a thousand years....THIS will be his best picture!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A movie with a videogame style.,"Extremely boring and inefficient war drama about a urban conflict in the streets of Mogadicio, capital of Somalia in the early nineties. The movie despises any real story line and concentrates its power (if you can say so!) just in fierce battle scenes, explosions, gore and some preposterous moments of friendship between the soldiers just in the old way of American movies of this genre. Mr. Scott, who made some good movies before (Duelists,The and Blade Runner) seems to be rendered by the spell of the video games. It's a pity that when you are in a cinema  you could not have a joystick in your hands!. So, it'll be a good idea if somebody say that for Mr. Scott. I give this a 4 (four).",4.0,Anonymous,History

What a horrible excuse for a movie.,"I did not like this movie at all and am surprised to see that other people have given it good ratings. I usaully do not write things like this but what the hell; I don't see many other people recognizing the crappiness of this film. First off, there is no plot set up as there is in other very good war movies such as Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan. Second, there is a sad attempt at character development; the ""heroes"" are given tragic deaths while the viewer sees no tragedy because he or she does not ""know"" the character. One could say that we do ""know"" the characters: Young, American GI's. That would be fine and I could see your point if there was no attempt made at character development, but there is. Some characters are briefly labeled as ""the idealist"" who ""believes in what we are doing here"" or as a bozo who shouldn't really be here fighting this war. Besides that, the acting was so-so and the score was mediocre to horrible; at times the music didn't even remotely fit with what was going on in the action. I am getting tired of writing this review as I feel that I am wasting my time: people will flock to this movie because it plays up to their new-found patriotism, rather than the intelligence that they never had. I would really appreciate it if the intelligent people among you who enjoyed such films as: Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, and Saving Private Ryan took my advice and did not go see this film: it is not worth watching.",4.0,Anonymous,History

GREAT! Watch it with commentary on if you can.,"OK up front, I am going to review this in 2 ways, as a movie, and than as a 'war movie'. As they are somewhat different in a sense.As a movie: A great, damn near non stop action movie. Very realistic, often brutal, violence. If you're an action movie junkie you'll love it. Whilst I cannot watch this just as a movie, if you are looking for an action flick, this is incredible credits to credits.CONS: Alas, the only downside, for me, is Eric Bana. Perhaps it's because I am an Australian, but between his dialogue, script, and accent I found him to be distracting and annoying. Luckily, he's not in it very much.As a war movie: Having said that, you HAVE to remember this is real events and real lives. Whilst I'm sure some people can watch war movies as a movie, I cannot divorce myself of the real events and the knowledge or real lives lost. In that regard, the 'realistic' violence I mentioned before does not boost my adrenaline, but scares me silly.I own the 3 disc DVD. And as great as the movie alone is, the ability of the movie to move the soul when you see the struggle of the soldiers is amazing. About the only movie I can compare it too is the Shawshank Redemption. What I am talking about here, is mostly with the audio commentary of the returned Veterans. The real men (women?) that were there on the day and risked everything to save their fellow soldiers and finish their mission.I cannot hope to give the full details on the commentary, but you learn an infinite amount more than the movie, and their struggles are sheer mind blowing.I urge you, if you can, to watch the movie with the commentary. To at least begin to learn what the brave, amazing, troops do for their country and their fellow soldiers. It truly moves the heart.Incidentally, it's perhaps poignant to note I'm NOT an American. I believe if I were the effect would be greater still.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining for civilians; good fictional tale based on true event,"This film is engaging & rewatchable, one of the best war films I've seen. All star cast, good score, chemistry among large cast, good performances by all, & mostly believable action- until I saw real pics & docus of USA military survivors' testimony which is FAR worse. Note that Ridley omits: crucial UN allies aide, recreating or inserting daily news clips of masses of starving/dead Somalians, & horrid desecration of USA pilots bodies.This film did well in USA as it's only from USA viewpoint - 1 criticism many comment. Without other UN countries aide, esp Malaysia, there'd be LOTS more dead USA soldiers. Likely this is why other nations did not favor this ""USA only"" film. The recovery / rescue was an international collaboration. Also, our own USA military strongly dislikes this film is a fact - it's FICTIONAL yet memorable depiction of a TRUE event.Ridley could've remedied false ""solo USA act""view with scripted writing @ start & end of film, Pakistan is briefly mentioned. To many who criticize film today, it's not documentary with 2022 political agenda.Ridley does accomplish very well is immerse & entertain civilian viewers while causing sympathy for all various military soldiers who endure living hell of combat, esp in 1993 before ""smart bombs"" & drone bombs resembling video games were invented. Civilians cannot Empathize this type of real horror due to lack of combat war experience when odds are 100 to 1 against you, well armed enemy awaits you inside its own territory.NO film could show true battle scenes nor wounds bc it would be horror film. Nor show true hell of tens of thousands of bullets, RPGs, etc bombarded non stop onto USA & allied troops during those night ops. Also, film fails to show Clinton admin tragic failure to provide proper protection to our military, denying common sense requests from general Garrison, bc in truth soldiers are ""expendable"".This film names 19 USA elite who died but NOT the newbie USA 66 dead 18 yr olds who comprised ground forces that performed critical dangerous burden removing many burning barricades, house to house clearance, so armed allies tanks/humvees, squads, etc could reach both crashed black hawks & many US wounded. Also, film sadly OMITS courageous VIP necessary leadership / cooperation/ military equipment from Malaysian, Italian & Pakistan UN militaries who endured same hell & suffered losses too. Ridley could've easily given credit to all our allies in intro writing & summary but does not..Here, this film DOES draw in & emerse viewer very well with camaraderie, rivalry, bickering among USA military, & the highlights of the op. A few real ppl/ leaders & events shown truthfully. Also depicted realistically are myriad emotions new & non veteran soldiers in combat war must overcome against overwhelming odds, incl intense strict leadership to keep them alive, & how ALL the military leaders kept modifying / coordinating the rescue plan out of necessity. In truth, this UN recovery op occurred mostly at night & early mornings.Ridley's ""USA sole viewpoint"" & anti war theme is present from start with Plato's quote ""only the dead have seen the end of war"" to the end. I do not know how Somalians or other aiding UN nations reminisce about this 1993 event, but those same UN nations sacrificed significantly to provide aide Africa greatly desired.As USA patriot, & knowing truth from docus, I enjoy this film & admire some of our military more , esp survivors who state in DOCUS, not here, they're grateful to experienced ally UN officers who preserved their lives, & gave them mental grit & ability to rescue USA dying/ wounded in lethal op. Several USA officers were KIA / injured in field, so leadership quickly changed in the chaos. Film has few nonsensical scenes, ie, dead soldier embedded with live rocket; both gunshot Colonel & his driver are able to drive.Emotionally this film gives viewer TINY taste of real combat, & immense courage our military & ALLIES faced in insurmountable & morphing odds situation. Not heroes, not supermen, but real youngsters & elite military who served their countries proudly without hesitation to aide each other, & foremost give aide to war torn starving Somalia for humanitarian purpose, not oil, nor other coveted resources.",8.0,Anonymous,History

This Is How You Do It,"BLACK HAWK DOWN affected me profoundly on my first viewing, and now, with four more to reflect on, the genius of this piece is obvious.As another reviewer stated spot-on, this is as though one were watching documentary footage. And you better believe it is. This is hands-down the most realistic war footage ever filmed and offered to the public's eyes next to archival video of an actual battle. The action is intense, unrelenting and accomplishes the rarely achieved feat of having the viewer's emotional attachment draw in, sustained and juggled in perfect balance between varying characters at a consistent enough rate to let your heartbeat rest alas at only the final few minutes-- if even then.The cast and crew's unquestionably tremendous efforts are visible through every moment here. The performances, editing, cinematography, lighting, effects, pacing-- it's almost a dream for a film-goer. I am a film lover and yet I only have about twenty DVDs, an intentionally small collection as I only buy the rare movie I am engrossed in and can be sure to enjoy no matter the ninth or ninetieth viewing, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of them.I just watched it again today for the fifth time, and when the mission begins, I felt the same acceleration in my heartbeat, the same chill down my spine as the first. Those are the signs you're experiencing something; not just ""watching a movie.""10/10",,Anonymous,History
This film was alright,"I just got this film on DVD and I was excited about viewing this film. I was a little disappointed, but not much. I liked Pearl Harbor better. This film is based on an actual event where the US gets mixed up in a civil war in Somalia. First, I will start with the positives. The acting was great. I liked Harnett and McGregor. There is non-stop action. I also liked the score, but it is not really noticeable because you are dazzled by the visuals and action. There are also some negatives. There is poor character development. The movie doesn't try to explain the characters. Harnett's character should've been more explained. Next, the film is a bit too gory. But, I was fine with that. Overall, this movie is a fair war flick. I rate this movie a 7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An Audio/Visual Triumph,"Ridley Scott does a superb job of bringing Mark Bowden's piece to life. Scott is the elite of the manipulators of sound and sight.  He not only takes you to the battle, he places you there.  Complimented by todays surround sound theaters, one becomes immersed in his angles and bytes, woven magnificently into a well-told tale.Devoid of flag waving patriotism, Scott nonetheless evokes emotion from the complicated nature of modern war.  He holds true to the book, delving almost immediately into the battle after brief introductions of the principals. Though many, he does a nice job of rolling multiple folks into composite characters.  After all, this is a movie, not a documentary.Politics and patriotism are almost absent (despite the claims of many of this site's messengers); the focus is on the battle:  an operation that was supposed to take one half hour but became an twelve-hour-plus marathon.Criticism of the one-sided nature of the fight is unwarranted.  The movie, like the book/articles are told from the American point of view for a reason:  it was nearly impossible to find the Somali viewpoint.  If anything, Scott is PC in his handling of the Somali tactics.  The movie leaves out (probably due to time constraints) several damning incidents from the book such as children being used as spotters; Somali gunmen, knowing the American aversion for civilian casualties, using women as shields, and Somali females brandishing weapons while holding infants.   Additionally, rumor has it that captions at the end of the flick suggesting that the results of the Battle of Mogadishu impacted American policy in Rwanda and the Balkans were pulled at the eleventh hour.One feels the immediacy of the moment, the spinning-out-of control nature of the fight, and we are dragged along for the ride.  While it is easy to pick apart the decisions of the combatants afterward, Scott appropriately reminds us that life and death decisions tend to be made on the fly, without the benefit of omniscience.  Though we view the actions much like the Joint Operations Center (JOC) did, we are similarly helpless to avoid the tragedies that occur.  And this is the strength of the movie: it merely tells and does not judge.  There are no ""aww shucks"" or ""we shoulda"" moments only a retelling of the actions -and inactions, that influenced a small composite unit of America's fighting elite.It is worth noting that Scott has done his homework in bringing this authenticity of ""today's"" military to light.  Minus some theatrical ""necessities"" such as using name tapes on the helmet and names on the radio, the lingo, technical and tactical proficiency, and actions of the characters are militarily very accurate. The sounds of (most) of the weapons, the uniforms, and even the jargon and lingo (such as the rank sergeant being pronounced ""sar'nt"" rather than WWII-era ""sarge"") give an authentic feel to the film.  Also, the macho nature of the forces involved is accurately depicted.  Keep in mind we are recounting the actions of America's elite warriors, the Rangers and Delta force, not the Girl Scouts.This movie won't get best picture for a few reasons.  There are too many characters to get you too involved in any one of them and the pace of the book and movie preclude the typical highs and lows found in mainstream movie;  the flick is an adrenaline-filled roller coaster only  going down. If you are looking for melodrama, two-sided politics, or hokey action adventure, look elsewhere.

Astonishing Realism,"A cinematic dramatization of the intense 18-hour gun battle in central Mogadishu between Army Rangers and Somali irregulars, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a 120-minute roller coaster ride with bullets and grenades. Accurately following the terrible events in October 1992, director Ridley Scott seems to chronicle every gunshot and rocket as a band of Army Rangers tries to extricate themselves from deep inside enemy territory after a failed attempt to capture high-ranking associates of a local warlord.  The gun battle and rescue attempt encompass the final three-fourths of the movie. Its stunning realism is on par with the Omaha Beach opener to ""Saving Private Ryan"". But unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"" that's all there is to ""Black Hawk Down"". The first quarter of the movie is not used judiciously to introduce the characters and we don't know them very well when the action starts. And after the bullets start to fly, that's it till the end of the movie. Don't get me wrong, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a very good war movie, but if the first quarter had been better written, it could have been a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Ridley Proves What a Great Artist He Is Once More,Ridley Scott has produced a film that is truly an event among modern cinema showing that War Really is Hell. Yet doing it with such vision and style that you cannot help be mesmerised by the brutality of the conflict and the braveness of these soldiers. Unfortunately the lack of background information on the story and certain contrived generalisations stop this from being Ridley's greatest masterpiece just sit back and enjoy it for what it is the brutality of War summed up in three words 'Black Hawk Down'.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Popular type,"Black Hawk Down is an iconic movie. It may not be very down to earth in some aspects but it is still a very strong film.

Depicting the senseless brutality of war,"This film is an account of the devastating battle between American soldiers and Soamli warlords in Mogadishu back in 1993.""Black Hawk Down"" is a tough film to watch. Almost every scene is chaotic and intimidating, reflecting what battles look like. It features constant gunshots and explosions. It is scary and intimidating to watch at first, but gets tiring as I have become desensitised by the sounds of the deadly machines. If it was not for the occasional gory scenes, I would have forgotten that each shot had the potential to kill someone. It lacks dramatic plot twists present in most other Hollywood productions. This unconventional take on battles adds realism to the film, enhancing the brutality without using excessive gore.""Black Hawk Down"" is not a film to be enjoyed.

The action sequences are a marvel and really take you through what happened in Somalia. Ewan McGregor especially shines, as Grimes, the underdog that just found out about the Somalia raid an hour or so before it actually happened. McGregor especially brings life to most of the scenes and a lot of humor to show what the soldiers were really like and what they thought of the war.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"'Black Hawk Down' is filmed in a documentary style, and this is both an advantage and a disadvantage for many reasons...","Black Hawk DownIn Somalia on October 3, 1993, nearly 100 U.S. Army Rangers, commanded by Capt. Mike Steele, were dropped by helicopter deep into the capital city of Mogadishu to capture two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord which lead to a large and drawn-out firefight between the Rangers and hundreds of Somali gunmen which led to the destruction of two U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu, and the heroic efforts by various Rangers to get to them, centring on Sgt. Eversmann commanding one Ranger unit, named Chalk Four, pinned down by the street fighting, to Warrant Officer Durant who was only survivor of the second black hawk crash site and whom was captured, to Lt. Col. McKnight who leads a rescue convoy for the Rangers only to get lost within the hostile city, to Lt. Perino leading Rangers to the first black hawk crash site, to Staff Sgt. Yurek who leads his decimated Ranger group Chalk Two through gunfire to safety, to many others involved who where either killed or survived.'Black Hawk Down' is filmed in a documentary style, and this is both an advantage and a disadvantage for many reasons. Disadvantages include slight lack of character development (although the performances here are good all round), which means that the audience may not care about some of the minor characters. Also, the shaky cinematography can get a little distracting, and more of an orchestral score would have improved the tension.However, the documentary style also puts the audience right in the action, and reminds us that this really did happen (although the filmmakers may have tweaked things a bit). Ridley Scott has really redeemed himself after 'Hannibal', and the same can be said for Jerry Bruckheimer and 'Pearl Harbor'.~ 8/10 ~",8.0,Anonymous,History

Wears out its welcome,"This movie is two and a half hours long, and even though its full of non stop action and war scenes, it gets boring and drawn out. After about an hour and a half, the action started getting stale and tedious. But it just keeps going for almost another hour and its the same thing, the same kind of battle scenes, it got really dull. Also, I never got the feeling these guys were really in the action, most of them seemed to come out of the many battles unscathed and there was no real sense of them in danger.The movie is well done in its production qualities, and the camera is used to good effect with nice shots and overall its a pretty movie in the way its filmed. But the movie's tone seems to think that it is much more serious than it really is and has a fake gravitas that it gives itself, when its basically a very superficial movie.The patriotism angle is played too hard and is without subtlety, its like the movie says - look at all these heroic American soldiers and they all are so noble and brave, fighting against these black savages who appear to have endless numbers and who want nothing more than to kill them - I mean, seriously, give me a break.Plus many scenes were too composed and almost looked like a music video or something with slow-motion and corny ""African"" music playing over the scene. In sum total, an over-rated war movie. The recent sci-fi/war movie Battle: Los Angeles was better than this in both the action and being fun to watch.",4.0,Anonymous,History

War at its worst. A movie at its best.,"Black Hawk Down displays war as realistically as any movie I've ever seen. Yes, people die. Yes, people die in rather gruesome ways. And yes, you get close ups of these people dying. However, this is war. Black Hawk Down does an excellent job depicting what can happen when something goes wrong and is a wake up call (especially to the younger generation that have only lived through operations like the Gulf War) that war is not without casualties and that our soldiers are not invincible.Black Hawk Down also does an excellent job of not being biased. There is no judgment of whether US forces should have been there in the first place. There is no flag waving. Just the events of October 3, 1993. The operation gone wrong and the soldiers that depended on each other to get out.This movie is not for everyone. However, it is worth seeing if you can tolerate gore. It gets its message across loud and clear. War is terrible and we should have respect for the men who go to war for us.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A Cautionary Tale of Paternalism at its Worst,"If the leaders of the United States have a particular failing, it is that they assume they know what is best for every other country and every other culture.  In *Black Hawk Down*, the story of the failure of U.S. Forces to bring down the ruthless dictatorial warlord Aidid in famine-stricken Somalia in 1993, this is portrayed with relentless fury and unvarnished ugliness, by portraying the failed raid in Mogudishu in October of 1993 that took the lives of 19 ""elite"" U.S. troops.This is not Ridley Scott's best movie as entertainment (although the war buffs may enjoy the gore), nor is it entirely faithful to the book about the raid, but, even so, it may go down in movie history as one of our finest film morality tales of our failure to appreciate the lessons of history.  We didn't get it after Vietnam, we didn't get it after Nicaragua and El Salvador, and we didn't get it in Somalia, either.  The movie demonstrates how we indoctrinate the rank and file to never leave a brother (or sister) behind, which in the case of this raid, set up a trap that left these well-trained, and certainly very brave troops, who were supposed to apprehend some specific prisoners within one hour, at the mercy of Aidid's militia for almost 20 hours, trapped in a hostile portion of Mogudishu.  All of their training and bravery still left them ill-prepared to handle a situation like this one.And in these times when the talk of this kind of war is all around us again, when our leaders refuse to appreciate the diplomatic options available and see war as the only option to bring down another ruthless dictator, all I can think is this what our troops will face in the streets of Baghdad?  I, for one, am not interested in seeing brave men and women facing that kind of environment only to come home in a body bag for a cause that may or may not actually prevail.It is noted in the credits at the end of the movie what most of us know now as history.  Clinton removed the troops two weeks after the failed raid. And Aidid was assassinated by his own people in 1996.   Sometimes, as much as we might want to, we simply cannot solve all the world's problems, and Ridley Scott certainly makes the case here that using war in particular to solve these problems is most especially NOT the answer.",,Anonymous,History

Intense,"I had mixed feelings going into this one.  On one hand, it's directed by Ridley Scott; who has done his fair share of great movies.  On the other hand, Jerry Bruckheimer's name is attached to it; who seems to be involved in big, pretty movies, with very little substance in them, *cough* Pearl Harbor *cough*.  I hoped Ridley's artistry would overcome Bruckheimer's `presence'.  So, did it?  For the most part yes.The film is beautifully shot.  After the initial set-up, which I believe makes up the first 30 minutes or so, the troops get sent in and that's when the film takes off......and doesn't stop for 2 hours.  Man, this movie is intense.  Think: the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, only six times longer.  You get a real sense of being caught in the cross fire.  My only major complaint are some obvious CG effects, such as the dust being kicked up by helicopter propellers, but overall they don't distract too much from the experience and most people might not even notice.Some might not enjoy the graphic nature of the movie.  It doesn't turn away from the violence, in fact, it zooms in on it and keeps it there, forcing you to watch.  It's a very powerful picture which I don't hesitate recommending.

Sound and Fury...,"Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" is masterful technical work that depicts the cost of war, and the honor of the soldier, though it so full of sound and fury for the first hour that it blurs it's own message. Elite Ranger and Delta Force troops drop into Somalia on what is supposed to be a short mission to capture the two lieutenants of a warlord. Based on the book by Mark Bowden from the actual event in 1993, the screenplay by Ken Nolan and Steve Zallian is very confusing in the beginning, and it gets it's bearing toward the end of the movie. There is a large and talented cast with standout performances from Josh Hartnet as Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann, Eric Bana as the warrior, Sgt. ""Hoot"", and Tom Sizemore as Lt. Col. Danny McKnight. Some of the confusion comes from having such a large ensemble cast-- some of the characters are indistinguishable, along with the intentional chaos on Director Scott's part as he depicts the initial mission going awry as Eversmann's men drop into Mogadeshu. The violence is realistic and uncompromising in the beginning, though it lacks the strong narrative style of ""Saving Private Ryan"".What ""Black Hawk Down"" does well is make the viewer uncomfortable. In war the cost are the lives of young men. Bringing back everyone from battle is the highest tribute in the honor of the soldier. Eric Bana's ""Hoot"" says it all when he tells Harnet, ""It's all about the guy next to you..."" That is inspiring. ""Black Hawk Down"" gets it right in the end.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Neat Film, Lazy Audience","When I read the book this film was based on I sometimes had to take a day or two off before continuing... the imagery, atmosphere, and details were that disturbing to my ""civilian"" mind. With that experience behind me, the movie was not as harsh/shocking.  This allowed me to focus on aspects other than just the ""shock"" of seeing blood, guts, and body parts in a story.This is unlike Saving Private Ryan (SVP) where the initial ""shocking-brutal-harshness"" of the first few minutes hit me like a ton of bricks.I like this move.What I can't understand is why so many people whine about the lack of ""character development"" or ""not getting to know enough about this-or-that character"" to feel their pain!When I drive by a serious car accident, I don't know anything about the peoples' lives or characters yet, I ""feel"" for them and their pain/hassle. Why would this change when I watch a movie about how brave/desperate men fought for their lives?  Ever think of using your imagination to fill in the family, friends, etc being left behind by a dying movie character? Humans are generally all the same... how much hand holding do you need to imagine what the soldier on the screen is feeling as he dies?Oh, and to the ""boooh-hooo-hooo... I was a little confused with the ""chaos"" during various fighting scenes"" crowd... Are you kidding?! Perhaps they all should have run around with numbered football jerseys so you could keep track play-by-play (complete with slow-mo and arrows).When I watch gymnastics or figure skating I watch for the skill with which the contestants move. This is an appreciation of the dynamic nature of controlled action. No story, no character development really needed for my enjoyment and wonder. BHD is an account of a desperate fight between a small but well trained group of people against a large but poorly trained group. Throughout the film you are given an opportunity to get a ""SMALL taste"" of various moments that occurred during the mission. The actual people, what they say or decide to do is not really all that important.OK, one last point: If you're going to a movie you know is about intense combat why in the he*l would you complain about being de-sensitized to the RPG's and explosions?

"Very real, not as intense as I was expecting","Black Hawk Down has arrived and I must say that I'm a little disappointed. I was expecting there to be lots of running, lots of explosions, and most importantly, lots of gunfire. To be sure, these things are abound in this film, but not to the point where you are exhausted after watching it. The film is well acted, but the dialogue fits with your standard war movie (i.e. ""Tell my wife/son/daughter/pet I love them""). The military paraphenelia is all very accurate and the sound effects dead on, but I was never pulled in. The action was never frenzied; streets are often empty and hundreds of Somalis with AK-47s wait their turn to fire, it seems. Overall, a good war film, but it lacks the sheer chaos and panic that made Saving Private Ryan unforgettable.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not Quite Right,"i am appalled at the fact that this movie has made it into IMDB the top 250 films list. From Pilger, In 1993, in the last days of George Bush Senior's presidency, 18 American soldiers were killed in Somalia after the US Marines had invaded to ""restore hope"", as they put it. Black Hawk Down, glamorises and lies about this episode.  It leaves out the fact that the invading Americans left behind between 7,000 and 10,000 Somalis killed. Many of them innocent civilians.  I dont think its the right time for Hollywood to glorify the violence of the Marine Invasion of Somalia. I read alot of negative comments on the inaccuracy of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, both based on WW2, which is the last TRUE ""good vs. bad"" war to be faught.

Amazing!,"This was second favorite film of 2001 (behind Lord of the Rings and tied with Memento).  How this got left out come awards time baffles me.  This is incredible, intense filmmaking.  Ridley Scott sets a pace and tone that is unmatched in the history of war movies.  It's like the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, but for 120 minutes.  Violent yes, intense, definitely. It compels you to watch.  Your senses are overloaded with sights and sounds, like you are in the middle of the battle yourself.On first viewing, I had a minor quibble about the lack of distinction among the soldiers - the uniform and buzz cuts serve to make the actors hard to tell apart.  After watching it again, I realized this isn't really a problem because we aren't suppose to identify with individuals in the beginning, we are supposed to only see ""the army""  Not until later, when the team is split apart do we see them as people with personalities and lives beyond shooting the enemy.  Even then, keeping the well known actors fair unrecognizable helps to keep your focus on the events at hand instead of ""Hey that's the guy from Pearl Harbor"" or ""There's the young Obi-Wan.""A comment on the film just isn't complete without mention of the sound, which won a well deserved Oscar.  Perhaps more than the visuals, the use of surround sound puts you in the middle of the action even more.  This is a movie to watch loud to get the effect the filmmakers were after.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Outstanding film to which there is no equal.,"I give this film 10 out of 10, something I never do.  This film is simply an incredible experience.  Ridley Scott has truly captured the art of depicting modern war on film.  The performers were superb, standing out on occasion, but never becoming individuals.  They remained part of the team.  And that is what a group of soldiers in battle is, not a collection of individuals, but a team where selfless courage produces heroism.I've read several reviews stating that the characters need more development and don't stand out.  Let me say that if the characters stood out more, then you wouldn't be looking at the real army.  If you want characters that really stand out, then watch a fictional depiction of war.  Men don't stand out on the battlefield.  It is only after, in retrospect, that heroes can be identified.  And to those claiming that they don't get to know the men well enough to care about them:  These are real United States Army Rangers, Delta Force, and Night Stalkers out there.  You should care about them simply because their our men who fight and die for the freedom we enjoy.If there is a flaw to this film, I think that it is perhaps shorter than it should be.  The reason I say that is because the night in the city seems to go incredibly fast.  Having read the book twice, I think this is perhaps the more critical part of the story.  However, the film does a very good job of showing how desperate the 15 hours in Mog were, so perhaps the length is just right.I have to commend all involved in making this incredible film.  But even more deserving of commendation are the men of the Rangers, Delta Force, and 160th SOAR.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Black Hawk is a thrilling adventure of many America soldiers sent to a place in Africa to kill the leader of a terrorist group. This movie is so great I can't believe it.

A Memorial and A Lesson,"As someone who read the book upon which this movie is based, I was intrigued by the pre-release criticism of so many reviewers. Everyone seemed to be dwelling on the fact that there wasn't enough character development. Watching the film, I began to understand what they meant because we really don't get enough time to know all of these characters they way we might like - such is life. As the movie progresses we do begin to see what kind of characters each one is. Some are jokers and some are fools. Some are pragmatic or stoic or romantic. The characters in this movie represent all soldiers. What we do see clearly in this movie is a small memorial to each of the men that died during the Battle of Mogadishu. The scene in which Sergeant First Class Randy Shugart and Master Sergeant Gary Gordon come the aid of downed pilot Mike Durant is reason enough to see this movie! Overdevelopment of any of the surviving characters might have overshadowed the most important lesson of the movie, that no man be left behind.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A two hour long free-for-all.,"BLACK HAWK DOWN is a two hour long battle. The first fifteen minutes of this movie are talk and explaining what happened and we jump right into the battle. The cinematography was really something in this movie. I felt like I was in that damn war. The sound was so great, that the seats in the cinema were actually shaking (and that hasn't happened to me since JURASSIC PARK 3). But, this is one good movie. Depiction of graphic war violence in stunning detail, we get the privelege to watch bodies get blown apart. I haven't seen such graphic violence since....well, actually, I can't remember ever seeing such graphic violence. I do not recommend this movie to anyone with a weak stomach. You will be running out of the cinema and barfing your brains out every five minutes. But for those of you who like war or action movies- this one's for you. My only complaint is that everyone in this movie seemed to have guns. What's up with that? I wouldn't have been surprised if we had seen a little toddler concealing a revolver in his diaper or something. Once the battle starts, it doesn't stop (until the movie itself ends). Josh Hartnett (PEARL HARBOR)is the closest thing I can think of as a main character. There are just so many. The supporting cast includes Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor, William Fictner and many others. So, if you like non-stop action from start to finish, BLACK HAWK DOWN is definetly your cup of tea (or should I say something that sounds more manly?)

18 hour fight into a 2.5 hour movie,"I was reading through everyones coments on the film, and I was shocked to see that people were complaining about telling the story the way it happened. If you want exactly what happend to be put into a movie be ready to watch a movie thats 18hours long, and has mulitipul things happening at the same time (possible each person could have their own box!) This is and unrealistic notion, and though the movie does cut some stuff, and change things around in order to give what was litterally total chaos an easy to follow plot, it does so in such a way that people are exposed to the bravery and courage of the young men that were really there. As for the claim that the movie has no plot, thats simply not true, however if they mean that they didn't care about what was happening in the film, then they are forgetting that this event really happend, and that the script is somewhat dependent on people knowing this.Personally I loved the film, Ridly Scotts direction was surpurbe, and the way he brought you into the battle was horrifingly effective. It is ture that the movie drops a lot of the history leading up to the events it portrays, but then again the movie isnt about the history of the Somalian crisis. All considered the film accuratly depicts war, and to a great degree the events on October 4th 1993. This combined with the excellent direction, FX, and story lead me to give this movie a 9/10.Disagreement is what makes America, and all other democracies great, so nothing personal to people I disagree with, and no offence taken if you don't agree with me.

"Major war movie, with few Hollywood flaws","An interesting thing : there are all kinds of viewpoints about this film. It means that everyone sees it with his own eyes, and every one has his own reasons to like or dislike ""Black Hawk Down"". Well, I most certainly liked it. To me, it's a major war movie, a worthy cousin of ""Saving Private Ryan"". To me, both changed the genre forever.As many people pointed out, the most impressive aspect of ""Black Hawk Down"" is its realism. The war we see in that film is a bloody mess. We see scared men doing their duty, fighting for their lives. Of course, it's gory, noisy, but that's war, isn't it ? War isn't a pleasure cruise, it's not a picnic. It's about men being ripped apart, that you have to patch up the best you can (see the death scene of Cpl Jamie Smith). SPR was the first film to give us a taste of the kind of hell war is. BHD does it also. It has a visceral power. There are differences between the two movies. SPR had faded colors, and a documentary-style. BHD is very stylized, with a magnificent photography. Yet, both are equally effective. Once you've seen BHD, you don't forget it. Ridley Scott and his crew did a superb job in throwing us into the heart of the action. WWII movies like ""A Bridge too far"", ""The longest day"" are great (because they're interesting and very well directed and I still love them), but they give a Hollywood-like vision of war. They cut out the pain, the blood and the mess. The street-fighting scenes of BHD are the best I've ever seen. They give of good idea of the merciless ordeal contemporary soldiers have to face.To me, BHD is also quite a clearsighted movie. The soldiers who were in Somalia fought because they were professionals, because they wanted to fulfill their mission, because they wanted to save their comrades. That's it. Eric Bana's character says it pretty well : ""You want to know what I think ? It don't matter what I think. Once the first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that s... go right out of the window"". Or : ""It's all about the man next to you, that's it"". There's a believable speech. It's a million years away from the silly propaganda of ""We were soldiers"", where the private dies on the field saying how proud he is to die for his country. Films like ""We were soldiers"" or ""Pearl Harbor"" give a glorious image of war : to me, a big lie. I also felt watching BHD that the United States were not depicted as the saviors of the world (a nice change from ""Independence day"", one of the worst Hollywood blockbusters). As I felt it, BHD tells about the naive aspects of the US foreign policy. The two scenes with the Somalis (Osman Atto talking with Maj-Gal Garrison and the man who talks with captured CWO Michael Durant) are well written. (""Do you think that removing Gal Aidid will have us put down our weapons ? That we will adopt American democracy ?"") Soldiers on the field are paying the price (in blood) for the mistakes of their political leaders. In Somalia, they fought bravely to get themselves out of the mess. BHD also shows that immense military power isn't always a good solution. An armed militia entrenched in a city, warned by observers with cell phones (a powerful image, when the helicopters are flying over a kid with his phone) : there's enough to put heavily-armed US soldiers in jeopardy. In the light of the US problems today in Iraq, BHD had a lot of insight.Of course, everything isn't perfect. I don't know if the reasons for US presence in Somalia are as simple as the opening captions. In the end credits, it's a bit annoying to see the names of the 19 KIA opposing a simple statement ""More than 1000 Somalis were killed"". The US soldiers have their names, but the Somalis can die anonymously by the hundreds. Those are Hollywood-like flaws.Regarding the historical accuracy, I tracked down the articles by Mark Bowden. I was surprised to see how close to the facts the movie is. There are changes, of course (the main one is that Sgt Eversmann didn't spend the night in the city in the real fight), but those are only details. The spirit of the facts remains : we do understand what happened in Mogadishu.The more I watch BHD, the better I think of it. It's excellent film making (great music by Hans Zimmer, by the way). It's a gripping war movie. It's quite gut-wrenching (you need a strong stomach to watch it), but it's believable.",,Anonymous,History
My best friend was a Black Hawk Mechanic in Somalia,"One evening I first saw the preview for this movie and it gave me chills. I knew they had written a book about this incident, but didn't realize they were making it into a movie. My best friend in school joined the Army shortly after high school and became a helicopter mechanic. An admirable occupation for sure, but we sure worried about him when he spent the Gulf War in Saudi Arabia/Kuwait/Iraq. And shortly after hearing about trouble in Somalia, he was on his way over there. I admit that before this movie, I didn't know that much about this incident. I had heard about the book, but didn't really know the details. Shortly after seeing the preview for the movie, I emailed Charlie to find out more. Yes, he was a Black Hawk Mechanic in Somalia, but he had come home shortly before this event took place. However, he did know many of the people who were involved in it. He told me about what he went through personally waiting for the outcome and how hard it was for him. His story really brought it home for me and personalized this movie like no other war movie. It was more real when seeing the soldiers injured and killed. I just watched this movie for the second time and the effect wasn't lessened. I found myself getting chills like never before when watching a war movie. The movie itself is excellently and realistically filmed. It definitely puts you in the middle of the battle. The most frustrating thing for me was watching the poor command decisions being made by guys in charge that lead to this incident being worse than it had to be. Keeping the chopper circling over head, when those on board wanted so much to get in there and help the trapped soldiers. I know the chain of command is important in the military, but sometimes I think it's important to trust the soldiers who are there in the battle. I have always had a great respect for soldiers who are willing to put their life on the line for the sake of the country, but am often frustrated by the leaders that put them in such awful situations in the first place. It's a great story of comraderie between the soldiers. The scenes where the soldiers make it back to base, but go back out again are very touching. It is so hard for me to fully comprehend having one's life depend on the randomness of where a bullet happens to fly in battle. I'm pretty sure I could handle myself as good as the next guy, but I don't ever want to be in that situation. Because if it's not you, then it's probably your buddy next to you. I definitely sleep better at night knowing Charlie has retired from the military and is now launching rockets for Boeing. I respect his service that he put in for our country, but am happy to know that I'm not going to get a phone call that he's off to some God awful part of the globe. Though, unfortunately we are currently shipping soldiers back to the gulf...my friend's husband just left on the U.S.S. Nimitz for an undetermined amount of time. Everyone say their prayers.***1/2 (Out of 4)",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Intense action, good script, great movie.","Throughout the movie I felt very connected to the actors. The script was just great,  no love story, no 2 hours of one actor struggling to do this and that - this was an hour and a half of intense action featuring many different characters.Each character was an important part - I came out of the movie thinking of atleast 20 different guys and how their roles were important, even the small ones. There were parts where the 5 seconds of camera time on one thing stirred many thoughts and made you really think.I read one review here that said the action was not as intense as Saving Private Ryan, although I'd give SPR a 10/10 - I'd definitely say that the action in Black Hawk Down at points was 10x more intense than SPR. It was simply amazing. Go see it.Rating: 10 / 10",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Gritty, Intense, Military Action","Blackhawk Down is a fantastic film that paints a realistic picture of what actual combat is all about. From the very beginning the movie drags you into it's web and never lets you go until the credits roll.Based on actual events during the Somalia uprising, this makes the picture all the more interesting and extremely intense. Anyone who is not emotionally affected by this picture has a heart of stone. I myself underwent a gamut of emotions including anger, compassion, sorrow, joy, and pride. I am not an American, but you cannot help feeling proud of these men. The politics involved may be questionable to some who feel we should not involve ourselves in other cultural conflicts, but when genocide is involved, it is not our right, but our obligation.Tom Sizemore delivers a wonderful performance in his role as does Josh Hartnett. Sam Shepard also has a great role as the General overseeing the operation. Gritty performances are seen in the entire cast. The movie moves fast and delivers a hard hitting punch. War is not pretty, and this movie ensures we see that. I found myself laughing, crying, and cheering. This movie has it all!

Amazing Movie!,Black Hawk Down is amazing! This was a very good story about how American Soldiers make some of the bravest and most selfless heroes because they go out of their way to save lives! The story also showed American Soldiers are great heroes through how much they love their families. And it was a great story that exposed how war is hell and it showed the political and food crisis in Somalia. The action was epic and very entertaining with all the gunfire action and all the helicopter and humvee action. All of the actors did great at their roles. Without doubt this is one of the best action and war films ever that I strongly recommend! Have a great day and goooo Black Hawk Down!,9.0,Anonymous,History
A Surprisingly Visceral Experience,"RATING:  **** / ****I was skeptical going into ""Black Hawk Down"". After all, just look at the credits. Ridley Scott is the director, and he hasn't had a good film for ages (no, not even ""Gladiator"".) Jerry Bruckheimer has bad enough judgment to produce cash cows like ""Pearl Harbor"" (and that's a train wreck big enough to destroy anyone's career.) The cast, while featuring some good actors, is not exactly stellar. I was convinced I wouldn't see the film after seeing the trailer (the dialogue struck me as incredibly poor). But somehow I found myself seeing it, and boy was I surprised when I discovered the most riveting, unsettling war film since ""Saving Private Ryan"".The time is October 3, 1993; the place is Somalia. 120 American soldiers were on a mission to capture lieutenants of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a portrait of how what was supposed to be a half-hour mission turned into a grueling, 18 hour ordeal that led hundreds of Somalis and 18 Americans to their deaths. ""Black Hawk Down"" is amazing in how it puts you right in a soldiers shoes. It doesn't speechify or go heavy on irony. The event is depicted through actions, not words, and the result is stunning. We see each little decision that was made, each step that went wrong, and how it all lead to tragedy. Watching ""Black Hawk Down"", I felt like I was actually a soldier in combat, and it was terrifying.It is important to remember that this film isn't about the politics and the reasoning behind the mission, but about the experience. There is no trying to justify the reasons why things happened like they did. At times, it seems the screenplay (written by Ken Nolan and Steven Zaillian) wants to go that route, but Ridley Scott won't let it. We don't get to know the characters, but the idea of the film is that you are one of them. ""Black Hawk Down"" differs from films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" in that it isn't so much about the soldiers lives and their legacies, but more the terror of being shoved into circumstances beyond your control.Scott has regained his title of one of the most visually brilliant directors around, after losing it with films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Hannibal"". Anyone can make a film gory, few people are clear-headed enough to make it realistic. ""Enemy at the Gates"", for example, gives us a good look at Russian soldiers being mowed down by German machine guns, but the film is such a blur that it's impossible to care for them. In ""Black Hawk Down"", a sense of urgency is constantly pushing the film forward. Every time Scott cuts to a wide-angle shot to show the incoming enemy, it will get the entire audience tense. But as soon as he brings you back down into the action, the tenseness turns into horror. At times it feels almost impossible to watch, but it is just as hard to turn away.There is the issue of the treatment of the Somalis in ""Black Hawk Down"". It's a sticky subject. I won't pretend that most of the Somalis aren't being treated as the enemy. But I will say that the film is not overly unfair. This is a film about battle, told from one side's point of view. If this were a story about the Somalis, then the Americans would be just as much the ""bad guys"". But this is battle, plain and simple, and no matter which way one looks at it, its barbaric. What would be unfair is if the film assumed it knew the other side's every thought and tried to simplify their story. This was done to the Japanese in ""Pearl Harbor"" with disastrous results.""Black Hawk Down"" is a visceral film that shook me down to the core. It doesn't try to tell the political and moral complications behind all the chaos, which are far too vast and incomprehensible for any film to grasp. Film is a visual medium, and so Ridley Scott keeps the speechifying to a minimum and with his camera puts us in the middle of one of the biggest travesties since the Vietnam War.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Movie Review,"Black Hawk Down is an excellent depiction of the 1993 Somalian Civil War where US soldiers were sent to help quell the battles taking place. The movie is seen from the US soldier's point of view and provides a very realistic touch to relate to the audience. The director, Ridley Scott, was great in capturing the intense battle scenes as well as making them extremely graphic. The characteristics made the movie much more realistic and shocked the audience as it created suspense. The actors did a wonderful job (Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana etc.) showing the anxiety and leadership roles some soldiers undertook as they went into war. The only flaw that I noticed in the movie was it's lack of an in depth look at a certain character. The movie did a good job showing their qualities in war but the personal background to a certain person could have created a better effect in making the movie more suspenseful. However the movie is an excellent film and shows the special bonds soldiers develop with one another, a bond that no one else would ever understand.",,Anonymous,History

"An accurate presentation of real life warfare, showing that war is hell.","Saving Private Ryan told us ""is it really worth it to save one man?""  Thin Red Line told us ""every man fights his own war"".  Black Hawk Down told us that ""everybody comes home"".  There have been many war movies on the dreaded World War II, but never any on real-life war.  Black Hawk Down presents a great presentation of the war in Somalia not a decade ago.  There seems to be a lack of drama in this movie, but it still shows how war is HELL. People in America take great pride in the countless big and small wars the United States have won, but most do not understand the detail of it.  They don't understand the chaos of war.  Saving Private Ryan had some great drama, but they didn't express enough on the death of soldiers, and the movie presents thousands of soldiers dieing in the beath scene as almost nothing.  Black Hawk Down expressed most (if not all) drama on the death of each and every soldier, that every single man is important to war.  Some people believe that there was too much action in this movie.  I feel it is ok.  In World War II, they had times where they can just enjoy the fields because they have a whole continent to go around.  In Black Hawk Down, they have a small city of 5000 armed Somalians, which means there has to be action in it throughout the movie, because in such a small area, there is not a single point in the day where you can relax.  Black Hawk Down only is about the #150 of the top 250 films.  I believe it should be higher.  Saving Private Ryan changed the views of people of how a war film should be, so they feel this wasn't such a good film.  However, Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan were in 2 long different time periods, and for the time period Black Hawk Down takes place in, this was truly a great presentation of real-life war, and it should be #50 and higher.10/10 Best war movie replacing Saving Private Ryan. 3rd is The Thin Red Line.  You must see all 3 of these movies.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Really Good,"Really good war movie, with both its greatest strength and greatest weakness being that there was no attempt to really make a larger statement. Thankfully it avoided an agenda, either excessive flag-waving or political finger pointing, and just stuck to the action, which was exceptional.  The movie managed to simultaneously express the chaos of the running street battles that evening in Somalia while keeping the audience always up to speed on what was going on.  The movie also benefitted immensely from being able to show about 2 1/2 hours of a 12 hour long battle.  You are dragged into the battle along with the soldiers instead of just being shown a highlight package, and the brutality of war is conveyed by war itself rather than a bunch of preachy statements or Hollywood plot cliches.  All of which makes it a very good war movie.  But its lack of ambition to be anything more than a war movie probably does keep it from going beyond its genre and a notch below a classic such as Saving Private Ryan.  An 8/10 and one of the best movies of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Be Still My Heart!,"Ridley Scott is a genius!  I held on to my heart from the beginning to the end of the three hours, and felt for the first time in my life that I have even come close to experiencing war. No other films I have ever seen even comes close to capturing war without the fantasy features.   The entire theatre was spellbound, horrified, and amazed.  At the end the audience had been through the military action with them, and clapped at the end of the film.  This film is another remarkable world created by the genius of Ridley Scott, it does not rely on any one actor, and is the profound magic, creativity and brillance of the most remarkable film-maker of vision, and creation of worlds than anyone else in cinema.  I would see this man's vision of anything.  He is worthy of an Oscar for best director, without question.  My only thought is how long can the Academy continue to ignore this genius. I hope it doesn't this time around.  I pray not.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Overwhelming,"That's pretty much what I thought of it. Overwhelming and shocking.Listen, I'm sick of tose who say that it's unrealistic, I'm sure that at least 99 per cent of those who say so have never been to combat or enlisted armed forces or even shot a weapon. This is the closest I've been to combat and hope to be, so then I can tell you that Ridley Scott did a terrific job with this movie where I felt I was another Delta shootting with my rifle.About comparing BHD and SPR, you're right: that's not possible because BHD is so much better than SPR. And more gory (SPR didn't have an artery operation, a severed finger and a half a torso lieing on the battlefield). SPR had TOO many patriotic stuff, and BHD only has US (I refuse to use the word 'American') flags, small ones, on the soldiers BDU's, that's a good thing.BDH has, also, what most war movies should (but don't) have:Be based on a real war operation (Normandy or Guadalcanal are OK) - Have A LOT of characters: and you shouldn't know either their ranks or names. They all carry the same weapons and dress alike. I say it 'cos I can tell you all the names of the squad on Ryan's. - Focus only on the battle: when somebody's shootting at you with an   AK 47 or RPG I don't think they start telling each other why they love their wives or what happened when his father left home many years ago. And check it out, the only woman who appears on screen isn't on it for more than 5 seconds.Giving a deeper analysis on the Rangers or Deltas as normal peoplewould have just ruined the movie. It makes it better when you concentrate on the battle. The political side of the operation is thankfully only the kind of 'what a hell are we doing here' or 'you cannot change the world this way'. It gives some credit to the Somalis as people, though I've seen what they did with the 61 crew and it was pretty horrible. The acting was fair specially Sizemore, and the few funny stuff ok. The action scenes are really good although there seems to be nothing that looks like a shrapnel, mostly coming from the RPG's. But (yeah, I have a complaint) there is one thing that doesn'tmake sense: i've heard that the cassualties from the somali side where from 1000 to 10000. So where the hell are those 500 Somalis that didn't get killed?OK, I've said enough. Basically I say Go BHD, Down with SPR, the most overestimated film ever.

Long and Gory,"While Saving Private Ryan was nearly perfect this film adds firefight to firefight until you get numb.What's the meaning of it? War stinks, and people shoot at invaders?The story in short: a hundred US troops tries to beat a few beat thousand well-trained, well-armed and highly motivated irregulars in a back alley war and it goes sadly wrong, as espected. It can never be successful, unless you erase the city.Alas UN and US troops didn't (for the sake of the tens of thousands of non-combatants in the city) and we all know the sad consequences it had.This film is one of many that has a good intent, but by trying to be true gets bogged down in reality's repetitive character. War stinks, and will always stink, no matter if your operating a man-to-man combat war or a push-button war, where things are remotely controlled - people still get their bowels blown up.Even though hundreds of skilled actors, stuntmen and cinematic wizards helped making this film it doesn't tell us anything new - and it isn't that good at telling it either: Harrison's Flower is a masterpiece in comparison, and that film's story is still just as brutal and as scary, but so much better told.Go see it instead!",2.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful but Unengaging,"Besides being a huge war movie fan, after hearing ""the best war movie ever made"" and other critical acclaim of that nature, I was SO excited to see BHD.  The cinematography was amazing, of course--Ridley Scott is an incredible talent.  The sights and sounds were all there.  However, I felt little or no emotional connection to any of the characters--the only characters I even wondered about were Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, and Ewan McGreggor because I could recognize them.  I didn't even know Josh Hartnett's character's name by the end of the movie.  I didn't care about any of them because there was absolutely no character development.  What's worse is the last five minutes when Josh Hartnett and some other guy I didn't recognize gave their ""Why we're doing this"" speeches--like Scott wanted to spell out a moral for us at the last possible minute.  The film lacked focus--it was like an adaptation of a book that was so true to the original text that it didn't coherently transfer to the media of film. However, like I said, the design and production were incredible which means I give BHD  6.5/10.",,Anonymous,History
"One of the best war movies, ever!","This is one of the best movies of the year!  I have read the book and was pleasantly surprised that the movie portrayed many of the stories from the book.  In fact, the movie plays more like a documentary of what happened than just a ""Hollywood-ized"" version of the events.  And that is what makes this movie so good.  Instead of trying to push characters on us or give us a sappy romantic subplot, it simply lets the events speak for themselves, since the events were horrifying enough to elicit a reaction.  The direction was great, and the cast did an excellent job with what they had.  I thought the movie did a good job of letting people who had no knowledge of the event know what the situation was.  Also, I have heard that there is not enough characterization, or that the movie takes no stand on why we were there, or the political climate surrounding the events.  This is a movie about the mission, not a ""JFK"" type movie trying to explain why or why not we should be there.  This movie's main point is to show combat as hell on earth.

I'm sitting there thinking, `What is he going to do with it?' keep it as a souvenir? Give it to the man's wife? The poor lady would freak.Another stupid thing is that they would get the bodies of dead soldiers, and put them in the truck/trailers  whatever they are called, and the living people would be in danger by running outside.There is this guy that gets captured and he is in the prison. In the movie we do not see if he is rescued or if any think of him. He just gets captured and that's it. WHAT THE HELL!!!The sad scenes are so predicable.

And Ridley Scott Up for an action packed meat chopper war film.,"Incredible, outstanding war film about a modern conflict and the best war film of the modern Hollywood since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. And keep in mind that such a topic, inspired by actual events, could have been avoided, forgotten, because US Army did not particularely shoned during this battle in Somalia. It was a real defeat, even more than in Vietnam when the US troops left South East Asia only because of the University campus riots and public opinion gruesome pressure. Here, in 1993, they underestimated those General Aidid's rebel troops. This was a humiliation, and I guess it was very brave, bold, courageous to make a film about it. I don't think it was made to justify anything. A great war film, and for once not a patriotic film. That's my opinion, at least. And that's very uniqque to see such a 2h 23mn war film so action packed, and providing so manny bloody scenes. Meat chopper of a film.",,Anonymous,History
Hell ... from the Soldier's POV,"But for a (not-really-rusted) rusted Pepsi sign, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a stunning achievement in movie-making.

Eversmann's answer is changed by warring as is the character of the warrior in Josh Hartnett's gripping portrayal of war's Everyman.""Why does the United States have a military?"" this film asks.

"A directorial triumph, but it's not flawless","A directorial triumph! Ridley Scott delivers such a searing picture of warfare that this must be one of the must accurate filmic depictions of battle. The chaos, courage and fear are all palpable.It must also have one of the best casts of young actors ever assembled. So very many then unknowns went on to become stars.Now on to what the film does not have. It makes almost no attempt to understand the Somali's who inexplicably impale themselves by the hundreds upon vastly superior American firepower. Meanwhile a much smaller US death toll is eulogised.It recognises the role played by the UN peacekeepers in rescuing US forces. But every act of courage or sacrifice is performed by an American. Perhaps that is the truth, but it seems so very unlikely.

Great movie that shows the realities of war,"The best director and best producer teamed together to make *the* greatest war movie of all time. Finally, a movie that shows the war-hungry American public that it is not so easy to say 'o lets bomb this country and that'- this movie was 110% true to detail. It displayed how savage the Somalians were, and in every aspect they were- I remember seeing CNN and all the mutilation of the bodies. It will make you cry and make you think. This is the first war movie that deals with the recent past and is a good one indeed. I see this movie taking home some Oscars in March.",10.0,Anonymous,History

lacking one vital element,"Black Hawk Dawn is technically a brilliant film. The acting was superb throughout, and the cinematography and music put you right in the middle of the conflict.Unfortunately it failed on the most fundamental aspect of film making. It was not enjoyable to watch. This is not just the sometimes disturbing nature of the subject matter but at the end of the movie I found it difficult to care about the fate of any of the characters and without a let up in nearly two hours was exhausted from the effort of watching it.It ran much more like a semi-factual documentary than a film where the action and events took a much greater role than the characters who's eyes we see it through.I am not a war movie fan but despite this was disappointed by the way the film detached itself from its audience. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Could have been better,"While Black Hawk Down is reciving amazing praise from critics, I did think it could've been better. I thought the movie was exciting. It also it is good at showing the true horrors of war. What I didn't like about it is because it went fast. One scene would focus on one of the groups for 5 minutes then it would go to the next group of soldiers. This makes me from giving a 10. Most likely this movie will get nominated for some Oscars.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Saving Your Personal Private Ryan.,"Black Hawk Down (2001)Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepard, William Fichtner, Jason Isaacs, Ewen Bremner, Charlie Hofheimer, Tom Guiry, Ron Eldard, Orlando Bloom.The whole idea of the film 'Black Hawk Down' could easily have been avoided. It was a war that didn't need to be fought, and a victory that didn't need to be hailed. Only 19 soldiers lost their lives that day, but for the men who were lucky enough to survive, will never forget it.'Black Hawk Down' is inspired by a true story in October of 1993 about American soldiers who give food to Somalia to prevent starvation. The warlords, led by Mohamed Aidad, take the food away and give it to the soldiers fighting for Somalia. America plans to make a quick attack by eliminating Aidad, but it ends up as a long battle (17 hours) for their lives once the American helicopters are shot down by heavily armed Somalians.Ridley Scott is a quite talented director. He's given us the amazing 'Blade Runner',the disappointing 'Hannibal', and the thrilling 'Alien'. And now, 'Black Hawk Down' is, in my opinion, his best work. He does a brilliant portrayal of war and the horrors that it resembles.Though the Somalian war was for not very long at all, it was still very brutal and non-stop. It is visually dazzling and very long. Throughout, we see soldiers helping other soldiers and risking their own lives in order to save others. That is one of the bravest things that anyone could do, and this film shows exactly that.There was very little conversation going on throughout the fighting. We didn't really get to know the characters very well, but then again, there were many of the soldiers to know, and I think Scott didn't want to make the film overlong by doing so.Even though we don't get to know the characters very well, director Scott still delivers dramatic and tragic scenes throughout, for both the Americans and Somalians. There is one scene involving an American soldier (Yurek; Thomas Guiry) who is almost shot by a young Somalian boy, who instead shoots his father on accident. The boy hugs his father and tries to help, and Yurek aims his gun away because he can't shoot a young kid.Many people didn't like this film because of it's overuse of war scenes, little character development, and thought that it was trying to ""rip-off"" of 'Saving Private Ryan'. The acting was very good from about everyone. Josh Hartnett soars in the lead role, doing much better than the other War film he was in that year (Pearl Harbor, 2001). Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, and Sam Shepard do very well in the supporting roles. This film does remind me of 'Saving Private Ryan', but just with much more combat and a better message. If people thought that 'Private Ryan' was a slap in the face to moviegoers, then 'Black Hawk Down' is like a punch to the gut.'Black Hawk Down' gives one of the greatest messages about war that I have ever seen. It is everything that 'Pearl Harbor' should have been. If a child were to see this, I recommend for a parent to see it with them. Not because the child may not be mature enough. So the parent can guide the child into not thinking that the war is ""cool"", but instead describing the horrors of war and explaining to them why it is wrong. War is the biggest fear nowadays, that sometimes may never be confronted. One of the best films of 2001 and quite objectively excellent with it's direction, acting and cinematography. 4.5 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,History
War's Futility and Carnage,"War is bad. Everyone knows that.  This movies tells us why!  The ugliness that is war, is beautiful depicted by the marines who battle the Somalis. I have to warn you, before you go see this movie that it is not a very easy movie to see, and some of the scenes can be gruesome.  The lady next to me, had to go outside several times...because she just could not stand the site of the bleeding and death.  I think this episode in Somalia is subtlety telling us the situation that marines would/are facing in Afghanistan.Overall, I gave the movie a 9 not 10, because I think the Somalis were depicted like mad men, which is not true (American war movies have the tendencies of just focusing on their sides). No wonder that the Somalis who live in American protested this movie.  However, other than this fact, it is really an unbelievable movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Of course, saying that BHD is better isn't saying much, because both episodes weren't great to begin with.  The acting in Black Hawk Down is great, and the action and realism is incredible.

Elephant trapped in china shop,"He turns this way, WHAM, he turns that way, CRASH, he stampedes, BADOOM, but he can't find his way out  doesn't know where he is, in fact. He needs help from Pakistani Stadium (Pakistanis should know how to handle elephants, after all). In the end: 19 Americans dead, about 1000 Somalis dead.Needless to say, this movie (a multi million dollar affair that won two Oscars) does not comment on this stunning ratio. Its purpose is to honor the 19 dead Americans. According to what I perceived in this movie they were badly trained, narcissistic amateurs under an abominably bad leadership. (They are not conscripts but professional career soldiers of en elite outfit, I got that right, didn't I?) Their getting into the china shop is based on a crass case of error of judgment, their problems seem to stem from a complete ignorance of local conditions. The population of Mogadisciu are supposed to be either bad-guys or extras. There's black, there's white (yes, apart from one guy all the soldiers are Caucasian)  and no gray in between.I cannot imagine a movie that causes more harm to American foreign policy than this one. What makes it really bad is the fact, that the aim of the whole intervention is a selfless, purely humanitarian one, which makes the operation part of a noble cause. However, the movie does not dwell on the basic objectives of the operation or the mistakes and its consequences but shows a lot of action which does not help the story development and becomes boring after a while. The source of inspiration for the soldiers seems to be solely their own personal glory, they are individualistic sportsmen rather than team-players. They put, as they are depicted in this movie, contemporary US military involvement in a bad light. And it is not your ideal recruiting propaganda, either.The movie was filmed in Morocco, the Somalis were played by West Africans. That's like making a movie about Mexico in Alaska, taking Escimos for Aztecs. The disrespect for geography and ethnicity the movie displays lead me to suspect that this is the way the world is seen by many Americans: Somewhere out there there are some bad-guys who have to be wiped out, getting a similar treatment like the unruly parts of the indigenous population inside the national boundaries in the 19th century.Let me finally point out, that my comments are referring to the content of the movie which forcibly has to differ considerably from real events. I think that the world owes a lot to the intervention of American troops who risked or even lost their lives during the past decades  including hot-spots in Europe, not too far away from the place I live. But one wants to be sure that those guys who command all that high-tech machinery know what they are doing and what for. This movie did not convince me that they do.",1.0,Anonymous,History
heroes left and right,"I just saw this film and I heard nothing but good reviews from my friends and the critics.  So i wanted to see if they were right.  One column stated that you couldn't compare it to anything and that you'd have to see it to know the experience of the film.  Boy, was it right.  100% right.  This film blew me away.  it is easily one of the best films of 2001, along with A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Ali.  You will never again watch a helicopter in a movie without thinking first of this.  You will never watch ER the same because this film makes it look like Sesame Street.  You will never hear a gunshot the same after you witness the amazing sound effects.  As soon as the Somalis begin firing, you flinch at every shot because they feel so close, it is amazing.The actors are great, but it still cannot compare to the action and effects and the hard work that went into this.  The scenes in the helicopters, flying over the city are breathtaking.  They look amazing, with the smoke and scenery, it puts you right there.  Even teh music plays a role in teh film, by speeding up its tempo with the action, and focuses on the Americans, everytime one dies, the music stops, but it is done masterfully.  I give this film a very diserving 5 out of 5 stars.  Absolutely, one of the best, or the best war films ever.  I said that about Saving Private Ryan, but this surpasses it.  Just great, but one question bothers me.  Why the heck did teh Americans want to get mixed up in all of this.

Very emotional movie,"This is an excellent film in many ways.  As an avid viewer of war films, stemming from my very early years during WW2, it ranks high on the list of good ones in my view.  However, having said that, I must add that it was very personal and very intense for me because I was in Somalia immediately prior to the time these events took place.  The opening commentary by our Austrailian friend, I found to be quite touching.  As luck would have it, I was billeted in Baidoa, Somalia with the Australian CARE organization during the UNITAF occupation.  I had worked in Somalia as a developmental anthropologist during the period 1985 and 1986 and had Somali students while teaching at the U of Wyoming.  I had read Mark Bowden's excellent book and knew several of the individuals involved in the operation.  Moreover, Mohammud Faarah Adid had been my landlord when I'd stayed in Somalia before the civil war.I'm submitting this review in hopes someone will read it because this film should be seen as an indictment of war and the cruelty we humans often heap on each other.  Some reviewer extols us to ""leave the politics some where else.""  Crap.  You can't escape it.  Viewing this film as our President and his lackeys prepare this nation for more war so the rich can enjoy more wealth and the nation can enjoy cheap and pollute the environment with gas-sucking SUVs is pure politics.  No rational human being likes it.  But like it or lump it, that's what this film is all about.The youth of our nation and the Somalis paid a terrible price for the follies of our leaders. Let's hope we can learn something from it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
At last Hollywood has it right.,"From movies like U-571 and Saving Private Ryan it is clear that some people in Hollywood are intent on making America look like the savior of the world. Their position is powerful and their actions well intentioned but almost never did they reach this ""World Savior"" point, especially in events U-571 and Saving Private Ryan were based on. This is why i think Ridley Scott has produced such well rounded film. Even with the help from usual gung-ho producer Jerry Bruckheimer this film depicts both events for and against the USA. It really shows what everyone with even a vague knowledge of world events knows, America made some mistakes, ones with dire consequences.The style and feeling of the film comes as close to real battle as any normal person could imagine.

I am so sad I wasted my time,"Blackhawk down is perhaps the worst war drama ever created, and this comes from a fan of the genre. I found it too claustrophobic, inane, and very BORING. If this, Scott's worst (by far) effort had not been based on actual events I would maintain that it was made up by an incompetent army newsletter writer. There are no characters that seem in any way believable nor do you have any level of empathy with a single person (and these are American soldiers). Mr. Scott should despite many glowing reviews be made to sit in a corner and really think about what a pitiful movie he threw together. Of all the films I have seen in the past five or so years this has the least (if any) redeeming qualities, it is that bad. I will not take the actors to task they had nothing whatsoever to work with, so we have no idea what the performances would be. So I will stick to the real problems story, direction, and editing. First, I love America and I respect and admire our men and women who serve. That said every conflict we take part in does not need to be captured on film. Blackhawk Down had no more business being made than Heartbreak Ridge, and the Eastwood flop is sadly quite a bit better in everyway except special effects. As far as direction I am shocked that Ridley Scott would put his name on this fiasco. He fails to get a single memorable performance or to provide any feel other than being in a coffin with explosions in the background. The guys(including the talented Scott)in the film cutting room also come up short but maybe they just threw in the best of a bad lot and hope that patriotism would cover the almost endless flaws. On a positive not the film is not extremely long and there are some pretty good effects, but too few for this to deserve much merit for them.1/5 .5 for being a great Army commercial(though I prefer the 30sec variety) and .5 was for a token few special effects scenes that were effective.

Great war film set in some rundown African city,"Man, I couldn't wait to see this movie.    I am a huge fan of thebattle scenes in Saving Private Ryan and was hearing that BlackHawk Down was SPR II.  And Ridley Scott, the master of kineticdirection, in league with the King of Kinetic movies JerryBruckheimer, do deliver a big rock-em sock-em battle that had mephysically shell-shocked by the end of the movie.  So why am Ipulling my endorsement punch a little?  The problem, which manyothers have identified, is that you really don't care about this battleor the people that fought it because nothing is exposed very much.If a bit more of the political background and the moral ambiguitiesof the Somalia situation were laid out to us, and the bitter epilogueplayed out more, I think we would have been more involved.Another problem is the multi-person cast, none of whom are givenenough screen time to bond with the audience.  I would have lovedto know a little more about that Delta Force spook who gets pickedup on his bicycle to start the movie; he epitomizes cool.  And theSomali warlord/power player was a total mystery to me as to whyhe was even in the movie, although he sure was a character.Once the battle scenes start, it's tough to tell the players without aprogram, the only faces I even recognized in the middle of all thebanging and explosions was Tom Sizemore (since I loved him inSPR) and Josh Hartnett, because he is supposed to be theSensitive Soldier.  And the Somalis were like the Germans in theold WWII movies, just cannon fodder for the M-16s.  Still, if you likea big testosterone movie where Everything Gets Blowed Up RealGood, I can't think of a better movie for you to see.  See it in thetheatre (since I love Ridley Scott's movies, you should helpcontribute to his billions) or on a really excellent DVD system in thefuture.",,Anonymous,History

He has captured the chaos, the horror, the courage, the stupidity of war in a way no other movie I have seen ever has. I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the movie, something I dont think I have ever done before. The visceral impact of the battle scene is unbelievable, more intense than any movie in my recent memory.

"Brilliant, unsparing war story","A city is the worst possible place to fight a war.  The distances are short, the fields of view restricted, and the presence of high windows and rooftops means that an attack can come from any direction with no warning.  Your long-range fire-support options are limited severely by the terrain, the main guns on your tanks are all but useless, and your armored vehicles are vulnerable to ambush in the tight, narrow streets, where an enemy can rain fire down on their weakest points.  Cities are also full of people who don't want anything to do with the war, whom you have to be careful not to kill, even if your enemy displays no such compunction.Ridley Scott's visceral, intense movie ""Black Hawk Down"" gives us a ground and air view of the worst urban fighting encountered by American troops since Hue City.  As the movie begins, U.S. Army troops in Somalia are attempting to crash a party and grab Mohammed Farah Aidid, the warlord who ruled the port city of Mogadishu (called ""the Mog"" or ""the 'Dish"" by American grunts, who nickname everything as a matter of course, including each other).  What is supposed to be a quick mission turns into a desperate battle that lasts through the night, as two Blackhawk helicopters are shot down and the security elements are surrounded by Aidid's street-gang-cum-militia, laden with AKs, RPGs, and a supply of the narcotic leaf ""khat.""The movie is first and foremost a battle picture, and Scott has pared down most other details.  Policy wonks are sure to be disappointed, as there is little discussion of the politics of the U.S. intervention in Somalia, or of the decisions affecting and affected by the outcome of the battle.  There is no pondering about whether the mission was right or wrong, or what could have been done about Somalia.  What info we get on the Somali civil war is relayed in a few short screen blurbs at the beginning.  There is only a brief reference to the decision by Clinton's then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin not to authorize the use of armored forces in support.  If that is the sort of thing you like, read Mark Bowden's book.  The movie is more concerned with covering fire, roadblocks, and hot brass sliding down the collar of your flak jacket.And that is all to the better.  What Scott has done in foregoing big-picture issues is deliver a focused and relentless depiction of combat, complete and convincing in its details: rifle slings jury-rigged with tape and 550 cord, spray-painted sniper rigs, sweat, blood, and agony.  The picture is full of small memorable moments, too many to count, and what philosophical points it makes (mostly about the sometimes heartbreaking ingenuousness of American GIs) are subtle and easily missed.  There aren't a lot of director's tricks (not that you notice anyhow), including, oddly, less of the sped-up action sequences Scott loved so much in ""Gladiator"".There are inherent difficulties associated with war movies; it can be difficult to tell the characters apart, or know exactly what each group is trying to accomplish, but Scott manages this aspect surprisingly well (for viewers, being ex-military or reading the book will help a great deal). The movie's look works to its advantage as well, making the city (Rabat, Morocco, in the role of Mogadishu) look dangerous in grim, spooky night and harsh, merciless daylight.  The movie also contains some of the most eerily beautiful shots of helicopters in formation since ""Apocalypse Now.""Battle movies tend to focus on a great many small stories.  Josh Hartnett's Sgt. Eversmann is the nominal protagonist, but we do not follow him all the time, or even most of the time.  As a result, we do not get a lot of insight into the particular characters.  In early scenes, they are sketched rather than drawn: there's the untested kid, the office hack who wants to prove himself, tension between the straight-laced brass (Jason Isaacs, last seen as the sadistic British Dragoon in ""The Patriot"") and the free-wheeling special operators, etc.  The characters are given brief moments in which to establish themselves, and we're off.  Some of these work better than others; Hartnett's dialogue establishing him as an ""idealist"" is especially clumsy and unconvincing.  The actors are no slouches, and there are capable performances all around, but the event is the real story here.You could knock this movie for its lack of larger context, for not examining bigger issues, for not having deeper dialogue, but these criticisms are not exactly fair.  ""Black Hawk Down"" is intended to give us a glimpse of something that happened, something horrible and heroic, and to give us some idea of what it was like to live through it (or not live through it).  All most people remember of the battle of Mogadishu was the dead stripped American pilot, dragged by a truck while the people we thought we were helping spit on him.  This movie shows us the insides of an event we thought we understood well enough, and shows us that there can be great valor even in defeat.  When I was in infantry school, I knew a guy who was former Army, a member of the same Ranger unit that got trapped in Mogadishu.  He was ribbed once about ""losing the fight"", and he exploded.  Nobody understood what happened, he said.  Nobody knew the real story.Here's to you, Wickstrom.  They know now.",10.0,Anonymous,History

As a Canadian realist, I can only applaud America for its continuing efforts to broker peace, and, where diplomacy fails, to oust the Aidids of the world with the only tool left at their disposal, and the only thing these enemies of civilization understand: force.Kudos to Ridley Scott and the cast and crew of ""Black Hawk Down"" for accurately portraying the horror these young Rangers faced in their failed attempt to remove a worthless and insanely cruel man from power.",,Anonymous,History

"Blood, sweat, bullets and RPG's: the protagonists of Black Hawk Down","Black Hawk Down makes it intentions very clear when Eric Bana's character says `when that first bullet goes flying past your head, politics go right out the window'. It is not a study of the situation that lead to the Mogadishu incident portrayed in the film. It's not an in-depth analysis of human action in the midst of horrible conditions. What it is, in fact, is a frontline film, concerned with giving its audience a experience as close to real war as a film could ever hope to come. The last film to really try this was Saving Private Ryan, during its ragingly intense battle sequences. Well, Black Hawk Down pretty much stretches that into a full-length feature. The first 30-so minutes may be all exposition (starting off pretty badly, telling the whole back-story to the conflict in title cards), but after that it's all-out action.The question it raises is the following: is Black Hawk Down what we'd expect from Jerry Bruckheimer, just another action flick, or did Scott do something more with it. The answer may not be the first OR the second, but rather a little bit of both. Black Hawk Down is not a polished actioner like Pearl Harbor. It doesn't feature too much (read: any) vomit-inducing American flagwaving. It is often spectacularly brutal although we're largely spared the pornographic violence of Ryan's harsher scenes. What Scott focuses on indeed is using all cinematic techniques in his reach to create a movie experience which is as intense and energetic as possible. It has the dynamics, the trickery and even the spectacle of a traditional action flick, but it doesn't have any real form of making us feel secure and happy about it. Black Hawk Down is so unforgiving in its pacing and in its bluntness in presenting a modern day armed conflict, there'll never be any doubt in your head, that war is a horrible, horrible thing.But, wait, the Bruckheimer has not left the building. Black Hawk Down is good, but it's not great. I am willing to accept the absence of political debate over the situation, the absence of any critical inquiry into the U.S. policy and strategy deployed. After all, this isn't about such abstractions, it's about the man dodging the bullets. The way the Somalis are treated here is less easily accepted, though. They are mostly seen as an overwhelming, never-ending wave of hostiles, more reminiscent of James Cameron's Aliens than any human group of adversaries seen on film. Two scenes do present the Somalis as fathers or men trapped in their situations respectively, but it's not quite enough. Therefore, there's something to be said for the film mourning the 19 American fatalities more than the 1000+ Somali ones (considering the film's American perspective, one could argue this makes SOME sense). What I really can't accept though, and I'm looking at the film from a storytelling instead of a political standpoint from now on, is the characterisation. There's an argument to be made for this film not needing any really well-developed characters. They could have been archetypes for sure, but I would have liked to have seen them a little bit more defined. Basically I gathered Ewan McGregor's characters likes coffee and Eric Bana's character was really tough and that's it. It's a film that aimes to make you 'participate' in the experience it's offering and as such doesn't require a fully developed set of characters that explicitly experience everything for you, but a little bit more would have been nice. Now, the fact you're frequently watching generic figures dodging another hail of bullets somewhat distances you from the experience.This is the script's (and film's) main failure and not necessarily the cast's, who all do a pretty reasonable job with the limited material. The mid-war scenes are well-performed and it's only when the actors are asked to deliver some speeches on why they would do these things, that they are unable to compensate for the screenwriter's inability in answering this question in any manner beyond Hollywood sugartopping or Pentagon propaganda (which, by the way, was very supportive in the process of making this film). It's a shame then, the film has to end on such a false note, with josh Hartnett talking into camera about how 'sometimes people just turn out to be [heroes]'.All in all, this is not a smart film. It doesn't have the level of sophistication Three Kings brought to its Gulf War-subject matter. In fact it's little more than the cinematic retelling of the events. What could've been provocative piece about the Somalia situation or U.S. political influence throughout the world is Bruckheimerized into a film which is about nothing more than not getting blown up and not making sure your fellow man doesn't get blown up either. While that's not anywhere near revolutionary, it's a testament to Ridley Scott's great directing that it's nonetheless shocking enough to be a worthwhile addition to the war movie  genre.Rating: 6",5.0,Anonymous,History
Pro-Military Propaganda Disguised As Anti-War Account,"A pro-military propaganda disguised as anti-war account, Black Hawk Down comes drenched in American jingoism from the get-go and is unabashed in its apathy for a culture different than its own but the film as a whole still manages to impress on the sheer strength of its technical mastery & downright visceral combat scenes that unfold with unrelenting grip once the action begins and sustain their charged intensity until the very end.Directed by Ridley Scott, the story distorts history for its one-sided depiction of a real-life event as is commonplace in most Hollywood war films and features a vast array of characters who all remain unworthy of any emotional investment. What offers the film its running legs is its endless supply of loud, bombastic & unflinchingly violent battles unfolding in multiple streets at once which Scott juggles smartly & escalates steadily so as to make sure that things stay consistently engaging.While there is an attempt to create a sense of camaraderie & brotherhood between the soldiers, it isn't convincing enough to make us care. The ensemble cast chip in with fine performances in their given roles but it is the meticulous set pieces, gritty camerawork, taut editing, terrific visual effects, stellar sound design & fab score that do the heavy lifting here and keep the interest alive from start to finish. Its powder keg atmosphere is palpable, gunfire is non-stop, and body count is always on the rise.Overall, Black Hawk Down remains one of the most intense, gripping, explosive & action-packed examples of warfare filmmaking and continues to be one of Ridley Scott's finest directorial efforts. While the script is lacking in characterisation, the film somehow still makes up for it with its pyrotechnics-laden action set pieces & top-notch technical craftsmanship. Too americanised to have a universal appeal, this vicious, thrilling & relentless war drama nonetheless delivers the expected goods in pulse-pounding doses.",,Anonymous,History
"A Lot of Action, But Where's the Context?","""Blackhawk Down"" has now been the top grossing film in the USA for the past three weeks.  Quite apparently there are themes, or visualizations which resonate with the American population, as our troops are in action at this moment in Afghanistan.  Absent the very real daily heroics in Southwest Asia reported in newspapers and on television to the US population, I do not think Blakhawk Down would have been so successful.  It is a well-made movie which strives for (and succeeds in) authenticity, but it is not, in my opinion a ""great movie"" or would stand as such on its own in different circumstances.I think that for Americans, (including myself), and particularly in light of the military tactics employed with such success against the Taliban forces in Afghanistan, the frustration of watching the dire situation of the Army Rangers and Special Operations soldiers stranded and surrounded after the ambush is exacerbated by the knowledge that what was done in Khandahar this Winter could just as easily been done in Mogadishu ten years ago .  This is a major part of the story which is essentially ignored by the movie.  Another is any real mention of the planning and motivation of the ""warlord"" forces who ambushed the US troops and were trying to kill them.  A lengthy synopsis of the history of African politics or essay on international affairs may not be not necessary, but some type of context is needed as we watch the firefights and carnage.A perfunctory set-up of the situation in Somalia is given at the beginning of the film.  There is some attempt to explore the military culture of the US soldiers, but this too is far too abbreviated; some distinction is made between Rangers and the Delta force personnel, but no explanation is forthcoming.  (Why could a Delta Sergeant speak so dismissively to a Ranger Colonel in the mess line?).  The fact that the Army Rangers are themselves a very elite unit is not emphasized, and I do not think the general public (even one now following the news from Afghanistan) knows the real distinctions between regular soldiers, airborne soldiers, airborne Rangers and Special Forces.  The point is that these men represented the very best of the US Army in terms of training and motivation.  The Delta personnel, the absolute best of the best, consider themselves answerable to none but their own (also shown later in the film).As I mentioned, no effort is made to illuminate the thinking of the Americans' antagonists or to explain their actions.  In fact, the Somalis in question had studied Rangers rappelling down from Blackhawk helicopters, and so knew when best to strike.  The US raiding party was ambushed, and then cut off, while efforts were made to extract them.  This is the heart of the movie, and it is done very well: pinned down, the US soldiers, vastly outnumbered and outgunned, try to cope with their situation and await rescue while surrounded by heavily armed ""militia"" indistinguishable from the general population.  Unlike many movies, the heroics shown were quite real: it really did happen that way (there is a Documentary on the ambush now on the History Channel).  Why, however, was this ambush undertaken by the Somalis?  What did they hope to gain?  Why was a prisoner taken and later released?  What was the reaction of the rest of the population?For an American viewer, other questions pose themselves more urgently: Where were the fighter-bombers?  Where were the Cobra gunships?  Where were the US reinforcements?  President Clinton had been quite specific in limiting the American military presence, completely ignoring the manpower and equipment requirements stipulated by the officers in charge of the Somalia expedition. There were no US forces, or adequate airpower or armor to face that contingency (which the Somalis knew).  This deserved some mention or explanation in the film (but then again, Hollywood loves Slick Willy and won't do him wrong).  The ignominious withdrawl of the US troops after the ambush ordered by Clinton was a major factor in the renewed interest in attacking Americans and American interests on the part of adversaries around the globe, strengthening the belief that American casualties will end any American international involvement- a belief quoted very enthusiastically recently by those espousing a ""holy war"" against the US.We see what happened, but we don't know why. In the end, ""Blackhawk Down"" provides an interesting vignette of soldiers in action, and is horrifying realistic in its portrayal of the gore of combat, but raises far more questions then it answers, and these are answers that the movie's viewers deserve to be told.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An American Monument,"Truly one of the bests.An astounding, masterful, thrilling, engaging, utterly racist US propaganda vehicle.This is one of the most deeply pro-war movies I ever saw (and we know how deep that goes). Sure to fire some vocations on both sides, and thus to feed the eternal flame at the empire's fist.Evidently, for international distribution purpose, two or three scenes and ""dialogues"" at the end try to mitigate this pure, grand and global message, fortunately this is far too late and just a vain, generic effort. You know, ""we only fight to save ourselves"" (nothing personal guys), ""it's not for us for say we are heroes"" (just let the idea float in the air, martial music can subtly help), ""don't run over this surviving father carrying his dead child with great dignity"" (that would be kind of mean), etc. ...Truly a blood'n'guts spangled masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A very realistic, bloody war movie. Is this accurate at all?","I wonder where I was when I first saw this movie in 2004. I totally don't remember it. I just watched it again, a few days ago. And I was going to submit my rating on here, then I was surprised that I already rated this movie.Anyway, I was wondering where Mohamed Farrah Aidid is now. And I found a news report from BBC, with the title of ""Warlord thumbs down for Somalia film"", if you search for it online, you can read it yourself. It seems that what we are seeing is a Hollywood version of that story. Could it be accurate as some viewers claimed on here? Were they there when it happened? After all, did they read the news directly from the Somali news agents? I doubt it. As the warlord told the BBC reporter, ""I don't recall myself that somebody has interviewed me in this regard and I have never given neither written nor verbal authorisation to anybody.""If they are doing a movie about someone in the US or Europe, I am sure that they will have plenty of lengthy interviews with that person. This is indeed the typical US arrogant attitude toward third world people.There are always two sides to the same story. So you might be deeply moved by what you saw in this movie, but you don't really know how the Somali people think about that event? After all, only about 19 US soldiers died, while over 1,000 Somali people were killed. How would you feel if someone killed that many people in your very own city in your own country?This movie is good entertainment for anyone who wants to see how soldiers fight in an urban setting, but just don't assume that everything you saw is all real.The following was writing on 25 April 2004.Even though I have never participated in any war activities, and I hope that i never will, I think that this movie has given us a very realistic powerful view on the cruel bloody war.close to the end of the movie, it is emotionally shocking to see an old man holding a dead boy's body walking pass right in front of a war tank car. Whoever decide to put that scene in the movie did an excellent job of giving out the powerful message about the importance of peace.For the first 30 minutes or so, there were several clues about the soldiers making wrong life decisions, because they thought that this mission would be easy and short. And I was also thinking the whole mission will probably be over in the next 30 minutes of the movie. I was wrong, the war was so dangerous, full of blood, full of chances of death. Even thought it is more than two hours long, I was complete clued to the screen.The thing is that this real war all happened when I was living happily in the US. the soldiers were killed, the local people were fighting for their own justice. it is a war that neither side wants to happen, but they defend for their own believes. and i wasn't even aware of it, like the rest of the people, we were just minding our own business. the war in Africa was only a gossip to most of us.It is futuristic and ironic, when one of soldier mentioned that the war in that African country was much worse than the war happened in Iraq. Comparing with the war that is ongoing in Iraq, what this movie is shown is only a tiny fraction of the cruelty of the modern wars, yet it is very powerful to give us the realistic view of what a war can bring.I hope that everyone who watched this movie would come to realize that peace is the best solution that we can ever ask for.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"I'm proud to be an American, but does that mean I have to like this movie???!!!","When I went to my local West Coast Video to return my 3 DVDs (""Black Hawk Down"" being one of them), the clerk asked me, ""How were the movies?""  I succinctly told him, ""'The Majestic' was good; ""Rollerball"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" sucked.  He replied, ""You didn't like 'Black Hawk Down?'  What are you, a Commie?""  I didn't laugh at the joke.  He assumed I took it seriously, but I didn't.  It's just I happen to live in the 21st century and I don't find a joke like that offensive, nor funny.  But I knew where he was getting at:  This is a war movie!  I'm supposed to like it!  It depicts unrelenting American heroes who died face down in the muck for the sake of patriotism.  Well, I respect those heroes--I really do.  And I actually found the (real-life) story of ""Black Hawk Down"" to be touching and powerful.  During the opening and closing credits, when the title cards gave us a vivid idea of the beginning and aftermath of the tragic event, I was really moved.  It's everything between those opening and closing credits that had me anesthetized.Many critics and audiences have given Ridley Scott great appraise for creating such ""realistic and groundbreaking war scenes.""  I honestly didn't think they were that great.  I didn't feel the same intensity I felt while watching ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Maybe it was because of Scott's continuous cutting.  Ridley Scott is one of those directors who doesn't believe in staying on one shot for over 2 seconds.  We continuously cut from one area of the battlefield to another to another, etc., etc.  And that's probably what took me out of the film.  That's not including the thinly developed characters.  I especially wanted to get to know Ewan McGregor's character better.  He provided occasional comic relief, but we don't know much about him, other than he loves coffee (and I completely relate, being an avid coffee drinker myself) and is timid when under pressure.The acting is good, despite poorly developed characters.  The whole cast gives their all.  I was impressed to find out that a good deal of the characters weren't even American, yet they feigned very convincing accents. I haven't seen Eric Bana, previously to this film, and all I know about him is that he's gonna star in the upcoming ""Incredible Hulk"" movie.  I didn't have a clue that he wasn't American.  I didn't know until I saw him in an interview in the featurette.  Jason Isaacs, who I didn't recognize until the end, was also very convincing.  Josh Hartnett delivers another fine performance.  He's one of the few young actors who I think has great potential in becoming a talented character actor in the future.  I hope he does, so if he wins an Oscar about five or ten years from now, I can tell people that he knew him when he was just a struggling young actor.Another thing that irked me was the DVD:  the special features sucked!  As a matter of fact, there were almost no special features.  Usually, a big movie like this is jam-packed with special features like audio commentaries, deleted scenes, documentaries about the real-life event, etc.  It has a pretty good featurette, but that's it.  I guess they're gonna wait 'til 2 years from now to release the Collector's Edition with a 2-disc set, like they did with ""Independence Day.""Many will probably disagree with my thoughts on ""Black Hawk Down,"" but I'm not gonna pretend to like it to prove I'm a patriot.  The real-life story is powerful; the movie is simply a pointless display of violence.  I know it's a war movie and it's supposed to be violent, but if ALL you're left with is violence, then you have the equivalent of a flashy video game.  And how am I supposed to feel sad when the characters die when I hardly know a thing about them?My score:  3 (out of 10)",3.0,Anonymous,History
This Really Happened,"Charlie tango ten four we got a modern war movie here requesting permission to review. Black Hawk Down, based on a true event that just so happened a couple months after I was born believe it or not. This one of the based on true events that to my knowledge stays pretty close to the actual event. This movie is gory and it seemed like a modern Saving Private Ryan.The plot is about the Black Hawks that were shot down in our invasion of a Samolian city and how everything just went to hell. Now I find the story extremely interesting and truly captures the feel of what these guys went through. I can describe this as a pure action war film with a sprinkle of drama.The characters are mixed with really interesting to cliché as hell. One of my favorites was Grimes (Ewan McGregor) he plays this army ranger who signed up thinking he will be a army bad-ass but ends up making coffee the entire time till now. They have these two snipers who are the bravest guys ever, just watching the scene where they go to secure a crash site by themselves you think wow they are real heroes. You got some cliché characters or at least boring characters. Josh Hartnett plays this emotionless soldier he might as well not have been in the movie and definitely not the main character. Hoot (Eric Bana) is the man of few words he seemed like the silent protagonist in a Call of Duty game, but they tried way to hard to make him a bad-ass when he doesn't do anything.Overall this is one of my personal favorite war films. It is not for everyone but I say it is still worth a view. With the stellar cast and how they interact with each other I say High Rental.",,Anonymous,History

GOOD REALISTIC WAR FILM. Blame Bill Clinton for this fight.,"When I saw ""We Were Soldiers"" I immediately compared it to this film. The most obvious difference is that ""Black Hawk Down"" was more of a straight action film depicting the hell of war, while ""We Were Soldiers"" made more of an effort to depict the human element - of the Americans, their wives, and even of the Vietnamese. Ridley Scott's purpose in making ""Black Hawk Down"" was clearly to show the utter chaos of the combat in Mogadishu, and in that he succeeded.Although we may not know the human beings quite as well as we'd like, the audience can grasp the turmoil into which they were thrown - and that is a vivid though unstated indictment of Americasn leadership, and especially the pusillanimous Clinton administration that left them hanging without adequate backup, armor, or air support, even though these were requested.Although Bill Clinton, and his then Sec. of Defense, Les Aspin, deserve much of the blame, the commander on the scene, Gen. Garrison, must accept some culpability also. He was depicted as having not bothered to even tell other Allied troops on the scene of the planned incursion into Mogadishu: the U.S. 10th Mountain Division, the Pakistanis, and others. No excuse for that. Clinton later bugged out while scape-goating Les Aspin. It is now revealed Osama Bin Laden was much encouraged by Clinton's cutting and running out of Somalia.A good, realistic war film. And I give it credit for not opening up the can of worms that would be the politics of it all. Although perhaps an unstated message would be for the U.S. to be far more circumspect in where it goes in efforts to ""help"" those who neither want nor deserve help.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"So ugly, you can't possibly look away","The presence of U.S. forces in Somalia was right and just. It's just that this particular operation was vastly flawed. Precautions that should have been taken were not, for the simple reason that is alluded to in the film: American arrogance. This mission was supposed to be easy. On paper, it all worked out. In and out in half an hour--wishful thinking, I'd say. Hindsight, though, is always 20/20 isn't it? Even as General Garrison (Sam Shephard) is telling his squad leaders not to underestimate this enemy, the sin has already been committed. By going in with no air cover, they've already got one hand tied behind their backs. Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) tells his men, this is what we do, we're elite, remember that' to build confidence, but with no basis on which to make the statement.  The man had never seen combat before. Many of the hundred or so soldiers who drop into the middle of one of the most hostile, armed, dangerous spots on the planet at that time, Mogadishu, had likewise never seen combat. But this is what they are trained for. This kind of operation is what the elite armed forces live for.Ridley Scott's direction is what makes ""Black Hawk"" work as well as it does. The script, more often than not, gets in the way, making what could really have been a masterpiece, just a great film. The sometimes ridiculous dialogue you know no one would ever say, is the only evidence that they were in any hurry to finish. I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, how in the world did he get THAT shot?' One of my favorites was what appeared to be done with a camera mounted on the front of one of the Black Hawks, pointed toward the back, filming as the copter flew through a dense cloud of smoke from tire fires in the streets below. Awesome.I submit that Scott can't NOT make an intense film. Ask him for a women's film and he gives you ""Thelma and Louise"" or ""GI Jane."" Ask the man for an action movie and he gives you ""Gladiator."" I'm surprised it's taken him this long to make his first war film (GI Jane is a military movie, but by no means a war movie), but it's the kind of film we always knew he'd excel at once he finally got around to it.I enjoyed this mostly because it's a well-executed film in most every respect. If the Mogadishu operation hadn't been flubbed so badly, such a well-executed film wouldn't have been made about it. It's a war film the likes of which we've never seen. It's so well made that you never fear that the director is going to slip up. You're not just interested in what's going on--you're riveted.The actual events are more horrifying than any script writer could come up with, or would even dare to write. In this case, though, something rare: you don't feel like you're being lied to here. You don't feel like anything is being glamorized. Scott presses on, compromising nothing. This is not an interpretation of what happened, but a dramatization. This happened too recently to do otherwise, keeping in mind the families of the dead. I will say, though, that much seems to be left up in the air at the end. Despite Garrison's revised initiative, the rangers killed in the second helicopter crash were left behind. We're left wondering exactly how those bodies are eventually recovered. Maybe this is the film's way of saying this is as much as I'm going to tell you. If you want to know more, look for yourself.' The details of the operation are well documented by news organizations and in Mark Bowden's book. Grade:A-",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Great War Film, But I Wouldn't Consider It The Best Of All Time","I went into the theater with high expectations, and they were more than fulfilled. I definitely did not expect the intense, graphic, realistic violence lasting the entire film, but it definitely works to convey the emotion and mood of the time. Superb acting by Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, and Ewan McGregor. Josh Hartnett gave a pretty standard performance, which is to say that it was good. Not great, not superb, but not horrible. I've never really been a fan of his, and even thought his Pearl Harbor job was somewhat lackluster. Anyways, back to the movie itself. First things first, if you didn't like the first 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, the gory part on the beach on D-Day, then definitely DO NOT go see this movie. The first ten minutes in Private Ryan encompass the entire length of Black Hawk Down. It is extremely violent, and not for the weak at heart. Those who can stand it will be struck by the realism and brotherhood between the special forces troops. As is said in the movie, those who haven't experienced it will not be able to fully understand the dedication to each other, and the unit as a whole, that exists in US special forces troops, and all US military troops in general. Overall, great portrayal of war and the hopelessness that can occur, and above all, the hope that those troops can maintain as long as necessary to get everyone home. Great film, and great action.

A film of staggering power and authenticity,"I am biased.  Let's get that out of the way.  I don't think you can watch or review a movie like this and avoid being biased.  The mere idea of the United States in a military conflict elicits a strong opinion in nearly anyone.My bias is this:  I loved the book.  I read it twice, the first time in two sittings.  I find the story absolutely captivating and one of the most heroic accounts I've ever read.  The movie would have to try very hard for me not to like it.  So I'm biased.What I can say objectively is this:  the cinematography is as good as I have seen in any movie of the last several years.  I predict an Oscar nomination. The acting is good, and sometimes more than good.  The score is phenomenal. Probably another Oscar nod there.  And the directing of the battle scenes is stunning.Not everyone will like this movie, even if they can appreciate it. Unfortunately, since it's a Bruckheimer project that involves a fair amount of realistic war violence, and leans towards being sentimental in parts, certain so-called highbrows will pan it categorically.  Don't listen to them.Where this movie triumphs is in providing a realistic and accurate portrayal of what this experience looked like and felt like.

A piece of art,"I've seen this movie for the first time when I was 13. As a little boy I was a fan of the action scenes, however I didn't follow the story. Now 4 years later I have the movie on DVD and gave it a second look.Now I recognized a whole lot of movie stars like: Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, Ewen Bremner, Sam Shepard, Gabriel Casseus, Kim Coates, Hugh Dancy, Orlando Bloom This war movie directed by Ridley Scott won 4 awards in 2002, of which 2 for the sound in the movie. Something I didn't even noticed 4 years ago. This time I listened very carefully, and I understood why this movie received these awards Off course gunshots, rocket impacts, helicopters sounded like the real deal. But the true beauty lies in the music, which goes perfectly along with the actions of the characters.This movie is great because of different reasons. I already explained one, the music, however there're more. First of all, the actors play there role great. You see the fear in there eyes. Delta force actors are clearly different from the Rangers. And because of the fact that the movie follows both, makes it pleasant to watch. Another reason is the subject of the movie. The war in Somalia is a subject that isn't overused like World War 2 and Vietnam. It wasn't a big war like these last to, but it lasted for a few weeks. The last reason is the story line. In the movie you follow the actions of different soldiers with different tasks in this operation. This may sound that It could cause confusion when watching it. The truth is contrary, it all falls perfectly together. I had no problem at all with all the switching of characters and locations because you can recognize the soldiers, vehicles and locations.I recommend this movie to everyone who likes a decent war movie, and is aware of the fact that war isn't like a Rambo movie.

My Thoughts.,"This past Friday I was given the opportunity to link up with a few of my best friends in the whole world and watch a movie about the most life changing thing that has ever happened to us.I will try to let you know what I think. This is me talking, and not my fellow Ranger buddies, they all have their own opinions.I think that the movie does a good job of telling the story. There are some things that are in my head that happened different, but this is Hollywood, and that is to be expected. The actors involved in this movie did an excellent job of doing the right thing and trying ""play their parts"" to give honor to those who lost their lives. If I ever get to meet some of these guys again, I would shake their hand, and tell them thank you.It's hard to show what was going on in a situation like the MOG, but I think they did well. They had to smush some things together and make some characters into 3 or 4 different people to make the stroy flow. They also had to make some things happen out of time sequence and in the wrong areas. I have no problem with this, because they needed to make the story flow. I think they did just that.It was a very emotional experience for me, and I'm glad that I was able to see and talk to my Ranger buddies right after I saw it. THANK YOU CARMIKE.There are some things in the movie that are not tactically correct, but th en again, it's Hollywood, and they are into this to make money.... So I will not get too much into what I think was wrong. You have to make your own opinions on this one.There was not enough volume of fire going on throughout the movie. We saw a lot more fire, and sent a lot more bullets down range than the movie shows. Also, it has to be hard for someone to grasp that in this fire fight, targets were on our left, right, front, rear, in the windows, and on rooftops. If they showed the amount of fire that was really happening, the general public would think that it was fake, so I understand.The actors did a great job of ""being"" the characters they were playing. I just wish that I could have seen it with all of TFR. That way I would really know what each person thought.The battle scenes are good, and the sound effects are spot on (in my opinion). The Camera work was really good. Trying to show how confusing it really was while we were trying to do our mission.In my opinion, the Rangers looked and acted like Rangers, as well as the Operators. Bad thing was that they made the Rangers look a little indecisive, which was not the case. But that's a whole different rant.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Idiotic violence,"The movie depicts Somali militia as a bunch of black, vicious monsters who should be killed, and they are - in thousands.I've never seen a more obvious propaganda movie than this one - no wonder US army agreed to lend their choppers.How convenient for then, to have such a release in the wake of the second Iraq war.And the image of Somali people clapping as the Rangers run their Mogadishu Mile is the most silly I've ever seen.Shame on you, Ridley Scott, for tapping into testosterone-fulled, ""patriotic"", cruel redneck fears.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Too American focused,"There is no doubt that the film is well shot and edited, with very punchy action scenes and an awesome soundtrack. But I was still disappointed, being very familiar with the book.Two things come across in the book but less so in the film. The first is the fact that the soldiers survived only because of (i) the Delta soldiers, who remained composed and effective when the plan had gone to hell and (ii) the close support of the 'Little Bird' helicopters. Although the Delta soldiers' status is hinted at in the film, the impression one receives from the book is that a lot of the Rangers really struggled to cope when things got out of hand, and would not have survived without Delta's leadership (and, let's face it, ruthless killing ability and training). I think on a similar line the film also should have shown the frustration felt by some soldiers with their 5.56mm ammunition, which tended to make surgical incisions rather than knocking the enemy down, hence Delta Sergeant Randy Shugart preferred to use an old Vietnam era 7.62mm M14 - a similar conclusion reached by the British in the Falklands War.The second thing absent from the film is anything substantial of the Somali perspective. It's all very well inferring that the Americans came with the best of intentions to save starving people from Aideed, but the fact is they never had appropriate local intelligence to distinguish friends from foe and, by the time of the raid, had alienated a number of the Somalis - enough to make a huge crowd want to kill them. The entrenched tribal conflicts weren't going to disappear overnight, and it was naive at best for the US to assume that the tribal culture behind those conflicts might disappear just because a few elite soldiers took out some of the ringleaders. This is alluded to in the conversations between General Garrison and his prisoner, but overall the film gives more of an impression of heroic young soldiers fighting a lunatic mob.Other than that, or for those only wanting a bit of war pornography, the film is, as I said, exceptionally well shot and with the full benefit of modern technology, to give battle scenes the sort of violent realism made famous by Saving Private Ryan. But there are many far more thought provoking, equally well filmed war movies that I would recommend ahead of BHD (or SPR for that matter): check out the US Library of Congress reissued version of All Quiet on the Western Front for the godfather of all war films, and also Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket and, more recently, The Thin Red Line (1998 version dir Terrence Malik).",,Anonymous,History
Very accurate and straight forward,"Black Hawk Down is a movie about the events surrounding the Battle of Mogadishu where 18 American soldiers were killed. This movie takes no time giving the background or developing the characters. We see that Mohamed Farrah Aidid and his militia had been taking UN aid from the people who needed it and that's all we need to know. We get a brief glimpse of the Rangers and Delta Force operatives. We see that the Rangers are mostly comprised of well trained, but inexperienced young men. We also see that the Delta Force operatives are mostly older veterans who are very professional about how they do their job. Ridley Scott must have had a lot of assistance from the military when making this movie because the planning and execution of the raid seemed to right out of something you could see today in Afghanistan or Iraq. The Delta Force operatives come in with overwhelming force and capture Aidid and everyone at the meeting. They are fast and precise. Black Hawk Down highlights how professional our military has become. We only see brief glimpses of the Rangers or Delta Force losing their cool. Throughout the battle they are trying to find a way to get through the battle and keep as many of their men alive as they can. The only time they really have time to reflect on what occurred and the men they lost was after they were safe outside the city. You aren't going to see another Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line here. The movie does not go too deep in developing the characters and it does not try to send a message about war. It's an accurate depiction of what happened that day and what our men had to go through in order to make it through alive.",8.0,Anonymous,History
a realistic war movie,"I like this movie a lot.  The bullets buzzing by and the soldiers in a panic as they get separated seemed so real. I'm also a big blood and gore fan, so we get plenty of that in BHD.  Also, after seeing this film, I wish I had paid more attention when this was really going on in the world.  I remember hearing about soliders being drug in the streets, but I didn't know there was such an interesting story behind the conflict.  The acting was good by everyone. And the director knew what he was doing.  There was a lot of suspense in seeing how these soldiers were going to get out of a tight situation.FINAL VERDICT:  A very good war movie, but not for the sqemish.

Boooring!,"A standard issue American heroic movie. This movie is more or less the same as most ""heroic American"" moves, except for the goriness of the movie and fact that there are multiple heroes and no single Rambo-type hero. The movie does not give you any interesting characters; in fact the film gives you nothing interesting at all. The Somalians are all bad guys with guns that are killed in endless amounts or some special evil dude that's just evil and cool (in an American laconic way). The movie is practically just a loot of shooting and bombs going of and scenes of Americans who are ""just doing there job"" and saving injured friends without a though of their own security. All with a bit of heroic music playing along while they are killing a couple of hundred Somalians who are otherwise more or less completely ignored. In fact if you where to fall asleep during the middle of the movie you wouldn't miss a thing, when you wake up 30-60 minutes later (except the death of Americans who you have a very poor relation to, or a bunch of Somalians who you know nothing about). All in all, a very intense uninteresting American battle movie with no surprises. I guess you have to be an American or soldier yourself to even begin to like this movie. To all us other, it just a waste of time. Don't see this movie, do something useful instead.",4.0,Anonymous,History

One word: FANTASTIC,"This is truly one of the best movies I have seen so far this year.I didn't know what to expect when I entered the theatre, and I left with a feeling I rarely have when I have been to the movies; the feeling of having seen something that actually felt realistic.Ridley Scott has made a war movie completely without patriotism.

Go see it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A lot of potential, but it gets lost","The battle of Mogadishu was in some respects America's Roarks' Drift.  A handful of soldiers are trapped and surrounded by overwhelming numbers of enraged locals.  In the case of Roarks' drift, the locals were Zuli wariors, fresh from slaughtering a British army at Ishwandla.  Against them were a tiny group of British soldiers.  Yet against the odds the British held off the Zulus and most of them survived.Roarks' drift was, of course, made into the fantastic film ""Zulu"" with Michael Cain and Stanley Baker as the two mis-matched lieutenants in charge of the impossible task of defending the British position.  ""Black Hawk Down"" could have been a great retelling of this classic--reflecting both the heroism of the soldiers and the uncomfortable links between British colonialism and modern ""nation building.""  Sadly, Scott opts to stay as close to the events of the real battle as possible.  This means flooding the audience with a confusing array of soldiers from several distinct organizations.  I didn't understand it all until I read the book.  Even then it took many viewings to get everyone straight.Scott should have taken more liberties with reality if he wanted to make a great film.  There are many great potential conflicts in the story, but none are expanded upon.  Scott should have focused on two or three main characters and used their conflict to tell the larger story.But, as it is, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a fine war film, especially if you can watch it several times with the book in hand.  It gets high marks for using the actual sound of the weapons in quesion, from the big fifties of the Technicals to the SAW's and M-16A2's.  This may have upset some in the audience, but it improves the film in my opinion.  Firearms should sound like firearms, not like some bizarre combination of cannons and .38 Special blanks.  The combat scenes also get high marks in my book.  They are nasty and brutal.  When the first soldier gets hit in the head, he falls like a dead piece of meat.  It hits home.  The rest of the fatalities follow reality pretty closely, down to a severed thumb and a live RPG stuck in a body.  This is how combat should be shown.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Best Picture Of The Year,"Very few films are able to extract such a strong emotion from the audience such as tears of sadness, gasps of horror and sigh of disbelief. I'll name a few recent films that have succeeded. Schindlers List, Saving Private Ryan and now Black Hawk Down. I cried during this film, I was horrified, I sat in absolute shock at what these soldiers must have gone through. Black Hawk Down is based on the true story in which 19 soldiers (Rangers and Delta Force) lost their lives on Oct. 3, 1993 in what was supposed to be a quick and simple mission.  A Mission that went wrong, very fast. The country of Somalia is suffering a terrible Civil War. The city is Mogadishu in which wanted Warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid's Lieutenants are meeting. The mission, extract these men and return to base. Casualties expected: None.  The film does a great job of building suspense leading up to the mission and the minute the strike force enters hostile territory, its a heart-pounding, adrenaline pumping roller coaster ride to the end. This is a nail biter and not for the weak of heart. The hardest part to stomach about this film is the fact that its all True! This film should win an Oscar for Best Picture, it just makes too big of an impact to not win. Please observe a moment of silence for all those who lost their lives in this horrible tragedy.

What I would expect,"Despite the fact this movie was made by a British director and it was made before 9/11, this is what I would expect from an era of such jingoism as we are now experiencing in the US.The somalis are nothing more than faceless savages. Even the main US characters are given no thoughts or dreams. They are simply facades of manliness and destruction. How do they feel going to somalia ? Do they feel that their country has the right to intervene in affairs of other countries ? Are they scared ? Do they enjoy what they are doing ? Is militarism always the best strategy ? Do they want to go home ? Do they feel they are being sacrificed for a nobel cause ? What do they feel toward the people in the towns, cities, countrysides of somalia ? None of these issues are explored in this movie. Isntead it is 100+ minutes none stop death and destruction. After the second persons insides were blown against the camera I felt it was too much and walked out of the theater.Okay it is an action movie, fine. Then do not base it on real events if exploration of real issues is not important.If you want to see a movie concentrating on the depravity of war see JOhnny GOt His Gun, All Quiet on the WEstern Front, even the Big Red One, not this junk.3 out of 10 stars.

good action film but NOT SO ACCURATE,"Forgetting the fact that the hero in this movie later turn out to be a child molester (not a good person as he is made out to be) or that there are accusations that the Rangers used the woman and children in one of the scenes as a shield, the biggest inaccuracy is the downplay of the roles the Pakistanis and Malaysians who were a big part in saving the butts of the captured Americans.Sure, it won't make a big blockbuster if the movie didn't kiss up to the ""American exceptionalism"" but it is far from saying it is ACCURATE. Ridley Scott also directed kingdom of heavens, which is a good movie but didn't do well since it doesn't fit the American taste, but even that film had inaccuracies like the use of fire arrows in battle scenes (probably to give that zazz to film) and this unknown character bailan which I doubt would amount to anything if you consider the giants Saladin and the knight templars.",,Anonymous,History
This is the best war movie ever...,"This movie really made me obsessed with Somalia the first time I saw it in the theater. It felt so real to up close and personal with them. It was scary real. There was rockets flying around and chunks of warm body parts spewing up, it made my stomach REALLY hurt. Just like everyone says it's a 90 minute version of the OMAHA BEACH scene from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.It has REALLY good sound in it, so if you haven't seen this yet, go to someone's house who has huge speakers and a really big TV. There's just so much to this movie that you can't be satisfied with a dinky TV and little bitty speakers. You'll miss the spooky details if you do watch it the watered down way, and you won't fully appreciate it. It really does matter. It's really thrilling if you watch it like that. I just don't give a 10 to any movie. This one is really that good. I was a little dissapointed with the DVD cuz it didn't have that scary feeling I had that i was in a desperate situation, dodging bullets, rpgs, and my own team (friendly fire). What makes this movie so good is that it's a true story that people really don't know much about(like teenagers). It happened in 1993, so I was only 5. My mom didnt let me watch dead soldiers getting dragged through the streets(related to black hawk down), I wouldn't remember anyway. So when I walked into that theater, I didn't know what to expect, I didn't read the book anyway. There was a blue-ish scene in the beggining that had to do with the hummanitarian missions the UN went through that used really disturbing and upsetting imagery. It grabbed my attention lots. After that it went to October 2nd (the day before the big incident oct 3), to give an idea what Somalis were like. It was disturbing too. Never mind. I wont go any further but to say if you haven't read the book...please see this movie. You won't know what will happen. If you have read the book, see this movie anyway and don't gripe about mess ups since this a story of a battle that went on for 19 HOURS. You'll get to greet thousands of angry, heavily armed somalis with nothing to loose but their arms, legs, and heads. Check this movie out.

"Exciting, Inaccurate War Story","I enjoyed this movie very much, and I would say that it is effective at getting its point across - but it's far from anti-war and is fairly described as a flag-waver.  Anyone interested in a more 'balanced' account should read the Mark Bowden articles upon which the film is based, and which have been collected in book form.  The movie takes some dramatic ;-) liberties with the original material!As the movie is extensively described elsewhere at this site, I will just say that I found it difficult to tell the soldiers apart at times, which sometimes makes it hard to follow exactly what is happening and why.  The story is almost continuous action, involving many characters seperated into different groups, which makes it hard to 'get to know' the individuals as in ""Saving Private Ryan.""  On the other hand, ""Black Hawk Down"" avoids some of the schmaltz of the Spielberg epic (despite two slightly forced speeches by Eric Bana's ""Hoot."")The movie presents a (literally!) black and white look at Americans vs Somalis, and implies that the Clinton administration was pretty much to blame for keeping too tight a leash on ""our boys.""  The book is VERY different on both counts, and states that, ironically, the Somalis deliberately planned to down U.S. helicopters to force the 'surround-the-wagons' shootout that actually happened.  Bowden asserts that this plan was developed by foreign Arab extremists - read Al-Queda!!!  This isn't explored in the movie.None of that is required to make a good film, and I'd say that, like ""Battle of Algiers,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" is an excellent film - but take it with a grain of salt!",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""Leave no man behind""","Who would of thought that hack producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, would be associated with one of the greatest motion pictures ever made?  Anyone remember ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Armageddon"", or ""Con Air"".  True, he does have a talent for bringing fast paced, wonderfully shot action to the screen, but never for a film worth remembering, except for maybe ""Enemy of the State"".In ""Black Hawk Down"", Bruckheimer is at the top of his game with all of the action you can dream of, with choppers mowing down dozens of Somalis with miniguns and rockets, explosions from RPGs left and right, and blood and gore aplenty.  But the action, as good as it is, isn't made out to be glorified as it is with his other films.  It's almost hard to watch half of the time.  If this had been directed by Michael Bay, one of the worst directors ever, this movie would have been nothing more than propaganda, and it would probably would have had a love story, and all of the action would have been glorified, like it was in ""Pearl Harbor"".  But since this was directed by Ridley Scott, you'll find none of that cheesy crap that made ""Pearl Harbor"" such a bad movie.  What you have is a gritty, hardcore war film that presents war in its true state, with all of the horror, chaos, and destruction that is associated with it.""Black Hawk Down"" tells the true story of a failed '93 mission in which 18 Americans were lost, and a 1,000 Somalis were killed during a raid to capture a warlord's top 2 lieutenants in the city of Mogadishu.  The mission was supposed to have lasted only 30 minutes, but when 2 of the 4 black hawks were shot down, the raid turned into a rescue mission that lasted 15 hours.The cast, most of whom have been in previous Bruckheimer films, is top rate.  The cast includes Josh Harnett, Tom Sizemore, Ewan Bremner, Eric Bana, Jason Issaccs, Sam Shepard, and William Fichtner.  All are excellent, but the biggest standouts are Bana as Sgt. 1st Class Norm Hooten, and Sam Shepard as the distraut General, William Garrison, who watches in disbelief and horror as the mission unfolds from his command center.Every technical aspect of the film is brilliant.  From the sound, to the fast paced editing, it's as though the audience not only sees the battle as it rages on, but are actually thrust into the heart of it with sheer verocity and intensity.  Think of the first and last 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", and try to imagine all of the terror and chaos from those 40 minutes for over 2 hours.  ""Black Hawk Down"" rarely lets up.What the film does lack, however, is character development.  We're given the soldiers names, and we pick up on their personalities, but that's about it.  But, for this film, it isn't a problem.  Even without the development of characters, the emotional connection is still there, and you can't help but to care deeply for these men and what they have to go through.All in all, Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer have created a film that not only shows us what war is all about, but also the bond that war creates in the men that are swept up in it.  It's an honest, accurate portrayal of an event that will never be forgotten.  A+.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"If this is as good as the US Military is, God help us.","And that is what makes BHD a horror movie rather than a war movie really.  What we have here is a case of mixed genres.  This is not a film about the evils of war, or even really about war itself.  Is a propaganda piece for thinking locally and acting locally and horror movie designed to make one paranoid because it turns out that the people who are supposed to be protecting us, are incompetent in all the ways that we usually figure that they would be.Now, having said that, what makes this movie a particularly bad piece cinematic endeavor is that Scott and company are afraid to allow the force of that insight to shine through.  Plenty has been written about the 'Fog of War'--that is, the fact that when the bullets start flying, not only do politics go out the window (regrettably the politics seems to have gone out the window when the film cameras started rolling as well), but so also do the best laid plans and what small levels of good sense there were to begin with.  But, you see, Scott hasn't the stomach for that film.  So he front-end loads the reasons for the fog of war.We find out that in the midst of the Delta Force and the Texas Rangers, we have asthmatics and epileptics.  I did a little checking, and discovered that asthma and epilepsy (and I don't mean to knock anyone who has either of these ailments--you can live perfectly normals lives with both of them), are generally considered reasons for reassigning soldiers to desk jobs in Ft. Worth, or Laramie.So what we have is Scott afraid to make a movie about the fact that war goes wrong just because war always goes wrong, and instead making a movie about how war goes wrong because our Special Ops are populated with people who either can't breathe when the going is tough, or having seizures when the going is tough.  You see, it makes the world safe again.  All we need to worry about is that the next time, we don't send in any asthmatics and we can be sure that the operation will be a tidy success--just like Afghanistan was (with certainly no errant bombs and no mis-information).  Once, you have that set-up, that's when the politics really is deplorable--because of the fall back on such idiocies as 'heroism' and just looking our for your friends.  I am less interested in heroics than I am interested in people (not just soldiers but them too) thinking about why we are in such places as Somalia in the first place.  I'll forgive a movie about the brotherhood between soldiers as long is it seems like those soldiers are aware that they have a place in the wider world, but this is not that movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History

A soundtrack for devastation.,"Early this morning (4/20/02) I watched this movie for the second time and I must say this viewing was more depressing than the first. When I speak of depressing, I do not imply that this movie bored me. When I speak of depressing I mean I left the theater with a tear trickling down my cheek.The story of this movie can be told through the compilation of songs with an attitude as well as the score. I never really paid attention to the score in the movies I view. I always thought of it as somewhat of a mood enhancer that has the capability to be annoying. I never intended to, but for some reason i paid close attention to the music; this could be because I knew the outcome...who knows.The music portrays the spirits and optimism of the American soldiers when they feel the situation is under control. House of Pain's ""Jump around playing as the soldiers are getting prepared for a fly-by with ease mission. Jmi Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child"" being covered, yet containing those edgy spine-tingling riffs that made the song famous as the blackhawk's and little bird's are flying out. The optimism of the music is almost an assurance that things are under control; then the score by Hans Zimmer turns confidence to fear. As the movie progresses and the viewer witnesses american soldiers die, the music gradually becomes more and more catastrophic in tone. Throughout the duration of this movie, the music threw me into an emotional downward spiral. I'll never forget the overbearing death dirge that closes out this movie as it fades to black.In conclusion, it was not only the on-screen attachments to the characters that made this movie masochistic. It was the soundtrack and score that ripped your still-beating heart out of your chest and forever stamped foot prints on your mind",8.0,Anonymous,History

I love it!,"Black Hawk Down is a remarkable war film that has earned its place in cinematic history. What sets it apart from other war films is its unique approach to storytelling. Rather than having a single hero or a squad of soldiers, the film presents us with a wide array of characters, none of whom are clearly singled out as a hero or type. This creates a feeling of a cohesive team that is working together to achieve a common goal. The film's pacing is consistent, moving from location to location without slowing down to focus too much on individual soldiers.The film's emphasis on military professionalism is further enhanced because it never puts too much emotional weight into a single moment. This makes the film feel like a documentary of a real military operation gone wrong. While this approach may create some detachment among viewers on the first viewing, it makes the film all the better on subsequent viewings.Ridley Scott's direction, combined with the editing, cinematography, grading, scoring, and visual effects, makes Black Hawk Down a visually stunning film. The intensity of the combat scenes is on par with Saving Private Ryan, leaving behind other war films like We Were Soldiers. While it may lack the emotional resonance of Saving Private Ryan, it is a masterpiece in its own right, challenging the mind with its construction and blowing it away with its visualization.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Thumbs Down for Black Hawk Down,"This is the kind of movie that's probably going to show up big on Oscar night -- heck, it might even win Best Picture. It's meticulously well made, looks beautiful (if you want to call exploding bodies ""beautiful"") and couldn't come at a better time when Americans probably want to feel good about themselves, their country, their place in the world. But for what it's worth, I really, really didn't find much value or enjoyment in this movie.Do people really enjoy watching people get killed in various ways: falling off helicopters, getting fingers and legs blown off, guts spilling into the sand? Do you get pleasure from watching hundreds of Somalis get picked apart and mowed down by rifles and machine guns? Unless you consider this to be some kind of entertainment, there's nothing to recommend this movie for, especially in terms of its ideas. It offers only the most simplistic explanation for what led to the most disastrous American military operation since the Vietnam War. It doesn't offer much insight into the mistakes that were made before and during the operation, and how the government and the military might have reconsidered its policies and strategies to avoid this nightmare from happening again. Instead, it gives us the nightmare operation from start to finish, wall to wall action with little room to think about much of anything but where the next bullet is going to come from, and how the next body is going to get blown up. The underlying logic is that there comes a time when thinking just doesn't matter: it's all about ""the guy next to you"" and what you're willing to sacrifice for that. Ridley Scott calls this an ""anti-war movie"" but he's clearly having his cake and eating it too; it's obvious that he's in love with his own re-creation of bloody, intense combat, and that he can turn it into mass entertainment.My comments are not meant to disrespect the brave soldiers who were placed in an impossible situation and fought tremendously to get themselves out. I disrespect the people who told (and sold) their story. In trying to give a feel-good patriotic spin to it, they do us all a disservice by avoiding the bigger picture. Heroism is great, but so is wisdom -- the wisdom to know how we can avoid disasters like what happened in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 3, 1993. This film barely gives us that wisdom, and is far more interested in giving us a blood-and-guts thrill ride.Four years ago Steven Spielberg claimed that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was the ""war movie to end all war movies"" -- that its graphic scenes of combat would persuade all of us that war was a terrible thing, never to be entered.

"Guns, Choppers, Carnage!","First of all, I have not read the book. My mates wanted to see a Brit horror flick 'Long Time Dead', I wanted to see Black Hawk Down. I won the battle to see what movie to pick. After 144 minutes, I came out of the picture - SHOCKED! I'm shocked for to things. One of them is, the carnage and the second one is how great the film was!Ridley Scott's Gladiator was great. But this was alot better! Josh Hartnett gave the performance of his career so far (I'm sure there will be more). Tom Sizemore was even better in Black Hawk Down than Saving Private Ryan (but not alot).Any Good?Anyone who do not like war films, might not like this. Anyway Black Hawk Down is a anti-war movie and in my opinion it's better than Saving Private Ryan and Platoon (I have not seen Apocalypse Now). Ridley Scott deverse the Best Director Award at the Oscars, now as for Best Picture, I think it does but Lord Of The Rings was excellent, so there will be a another war between The Lord Of The Rings and Black Hawk Down!

Feels like a RAW experience of the Mogadishu incident,"This film at its core has something very few war movies portrait it correctly.
The cinematography and sound designs are very effective, and seems to mix up with the action seamlessly.No wonder it won so many awards. There's no depiction of hero or a hero's unit. The atmosphere and tension was natural and there's no necessity of using music to amplify that. Even with the inconsistencies of certain characters, events and other armed units,the movie showed the operation of Delta Forces and helicopter crash correctly. Never I felt the raw tension and palpitation of Somali combatants creeping up to the injured pilots.All in all its a pretty gritty and on most parts accurate depiction and action grounded in realism. Revisiting this movie after watching ""Hacksaw Ridge"", made me appreciate it even more. We dont need over the top gore to depict horrors and tensions of war. The war stories if told correctly can create situations for that. For those who never saw military movies, see this one, its a gem of the military genre.",10.0,Anonymous,History
See it.,"I recommend this film.  It's very intense and you might need a moment to yourself after, but see it.  Ridley Scott does an excellent job with the story and he includes details that other filmakers might ignore.  I went & bought the book immediately-the book fills in a lot of backstory and details that can't make it into a 2+ hour format.  Excellent performances from the actors...no one stands out, which is exactly as it should be.  This isn't one man's story.  I know some people will leave this film with hatred for Somalis, but I hope that more people take the time to get the whole story.

full length feature/commercial for armed services,"Join the modern US army, which is engaged in killing natives everywhere. I'm waiting for the follow-up about the 'Gulf Wars'. A film like this celebrates every lost American life as if it was the greatest sacrifice after Christ, but takes no pains in bringing us the faces of many of the dark skinned people who are mowed down by machine guns. They are just animals, targets, and legitimate targets of course.Hear the US soldiers bemoan fighting a war with one hand tied behind their backs. Why can't they just nuke the place?All in all, this is a glitzy package of war production and war propaganda from the (i.e. with the support of) the US government. If you're pro-war on any pretext and like 'flying the flag', this one is for you.From a dramatic standpoint, there really isn't meaningful drama, although one aborted rescue attempt is memorable.

OUTSTANDING!,"The first time I saw Black Hawk Down, I knew it was going to be a good movie because it's set on a true story.  Ridley Scott did an outstanding job shooting this film and the cast did an excellent job showing the world the kind of camraderie that develops in ordinary men under desperate circumstances.  I cried when it showed the deaths of American Soldiers, particularly Cpl. Smith who died in the arms of his comrades and saving their lives.  This film shows the true meaning of war.  It's not some John Wayne flick where the main characters don't die and war is glorious.  This movie shows that people die in battle, nobody wins, and war is not glamorous.  Although Black Hawk Down is portrayed as a Military Victory, it also shows that no one in this film is jumping up and down and celebrating that they survived, but they are tired, exhausted, hurt emotionally and physically, injured and in some cases killed.  This movie shows what ordinary men do under extraordinary circumstances and shows what war really is.  Hell.  For that, I give Black Hawk Down a Ten. Outstanding!",10.0,Anonymous,History
World's most morally punishing film experience Ahoy!,"Imagine the Omaha Beach landing scene from Saving Private Ryan played over two whole hours. If that sounds like something you probably would not enjoy, than you belong to the sane majority, and deserve a cookie. It also means you might be put off watching this film, for that premise was one of its great marketing elements. The truth is, you'd be missing out.In recreating the 24 hours or so around an operation to capture a Somali warlord's top advisers, the film is a hybrid of police procedural and war movie, giving you the limited but focused scope of the former with the intensity of the latter. It also acts a horribly prescient display of a modern Western army completely underestimating a ""primitive"" enemy, and making everyone pay a heavy price. On paper the mission meant minimal casualties and a deployment meant to last for less than an hour. In practice, the day-long carnage cost the lives of almost 20 elite troops and around a thousand locals. It also proved utterly futile in the grand scheme of things.Cushioned as its release was between 9/11 and the second Gulf War, BHD admirably manages to avoid the prevalent flag-waving tone and boils both sides down to nearly tribal elements, all the way to the strangely homogenous look of team America's cast: our heroes are often hard to tell from one-another, and the emphasis is on team solidarity when thrown into a living hell, not individual heroics. Josh Hartnett is wisely used as our conduit into this world, not our hero. More showy characters like Eric Bana's Delta veteran or Tom Sizemore's bullet- proof colonel manage to be both impressive for their courage and depressing for their inner hollowness and resignation.Visually, this is astounding, and once the fireworks get going, they are relentless. This is an immersive experience, in terms of both image and sound, all the way to the music, with Hans Zimmer's genre-defining score perfectly complementing the action and giving the film's rare moments of calm a haunting quality.In an age where modern warfare means ever-growing distance between a nation and the implications of its actions abroad, this comes a brutal reminder of the costs of such conflict: both to those who live in and around war-zones, but also to the young men sent to fight such battles. As a representation of modern warfare on the big screen, it has no contemporary equal.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great,"Great movie, that's all I have to say.  Truly shows the horror of war better than I ever thought possible.

The Most Powerful Movie Ever!,"Black Hawk Down was truly an amazing movie. It was as close to an accurate depiction as war as could possibly be made. This movie showed how horrible war is. The movie did not take sides on the conflict between the US Army Rangers/Delta force and the Somalians of Mogadishu, but simply showed the Sh*t the soldiers went through. The effects were unbelievable, and the Cinematography was in a league of its own. Imagine the memorable Apocalypse Now helicopter seen, now imagine one 100 times better, and you still are not close to Black Hawk Down. I read the book Black Hawk Down, and I was expecting the movie to really ""flop"" in comparison, but the movie was truly spectacular. It was very accurate in its story line, and it left a gripping image of the tragedies of war, as well as a respect for that those who serve in our armed forces. As someone who is planning a career in the military, this movie scared the hell out of me, and I believe that anyone who has an opinion on our military one way or the other should view it.

Better than I had hoped.,"1st I will not compare this to Saving Private Ryan, because you are dealing with 2 REALLY important issues here. Different wars all together, and the fact that Saving Private Ryan never happened, this did.First I read the book and couldn't put it down. I was amazed and shocked by everything that these guys had been through and had to endure for 18 hours what was suppose to be a 1 or 2 hour mission. When I first heard that the movie was coming out my first reaction was to go to this web site and see who was directing it and see who was staring in it. I wasn't too thrilled to see that Jerry Bruckheimer was going to produce it. Most of his films have been nothing more than flash, no story line, good kick ass movies. but that is it. I didn't want to see this movie make light or glamorize what happened on Oct3-4th 1993, but rather keep the integrity of everything that happened, like the book had.When the film came out several weeks before the rest of the country did in New York and L.A.,  I started to read some of the comments made. You can actually tell who read the book and who didn't. Those who didn't expected to see more action, didn't think that the Somalies came out of the woodwork like vermin (""right 235SCOPE""). Had they read the book they may have understood that most of the stuff that happened in the movie, even some of the funny comments, were in the book.I have spent quite a few years in the military myself, so I have been there and done that, but my experiences don't EVEN pale in comparison to what hell the members of Task Force Ranger went through.For people who have NOT read the book, or have not even been there don't judge this movie by the events of what happened or even how they happened. Judge it by the direction or the acting. I though the movie was awesome. I loved how it did keep the integrity of the book and didn't diminish the events of what happened. I will always remember the names of at least 2 of them. Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon were 2 members of Delta who posthumously received the Medal of Honor for going into almost certain death.See the movie, decide for yourself, but remember...this did happen.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Masterclass on the desperate and ugly nature of urban warfare,"A US helicopter crashes in the third world and a chain reaction ensues. Based on a true story.I usually don't like war films because far too often they are gratuitous and pointless, but what we have here is not just a good film, but a classic war film. Indeed something that can be put alongside Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and A Bridge Too Far.(While the above are not among my favourite movies they give us a good insight in to what other people had to go through on our behalf. A place that you hope fate doesn't drop you sometime in the future.)Usually you criticise films for their chaos and lack of overall clarity, but here the moments of confusion and ambiguity are appropriate. When you watch it first time you can enjoy (if that is the right word) the ride, when you watch it the second time you can see the detail and structure. Director Scott brings us in to the movie through angles and emotions (the stone cold war room trying to figure it all out like a chess game versus the grunt in the line of fire), to the point where we are ducking with the actors as the flack comes our way.(Some of the scenes set to music are just strangely beautiful. Soldiers running for their lives to wailing middle-eastern music haunted me for days after seeing it. There is no real reason for it - in the telling of a story - but the image and the music somehow work magic.)The soldiers mission is simple to comprehend: Let us try and complete our mission and then get out of here alive; but there is a real sense of the honour and bravery that has to make up a modern army. You have to know that if the worst happens, no expense will be spared to try and save you. This isn't just Hollywood - it is true.This is a message film whose message is only just being understood: that well intentioned actions can go horribly wrong and no matter what your technological superiority there has to be a price to pay: and the everyday soldier is the person likely to pay that price.A film that can be enjoyed as a simple action piece or as a message picture; or if you smart enough a combination of both. One of these films that - while hardly unregarded now - could grow-and-grow until it becomes an all-time classic. I guess it all depends on how world history plays itself out and how common situations like this become.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Great movie! NOT RACIST OR PATRIOTIC!,"A great movie that is consistently being put down by idiotic accusations, BLACK HAWK DOWN is outstanding. One thing I hate to see are people accusing this movie as of being racist, and patriotic. To touch the subject of it `being' racist, for those who say this, I think, may not be sure, but I think it is because of the way the Somalian militia are portrayed in this movie. Now people have said it shows them being barbaric savages. People say it's a misinterpretation, but if we remember, the Somalian militia did grab those two pilot bodies and drag them through the streets, they stepped andkicked the bodies, spit on the bodies, and basically tore the body apart. Now if that is not a barbaric savage act, then I have no idea what it is then. But if your saying that you take the side of that militia that did that to those pilots, then you are being racist towards the American soldiers. I remember, I was about 7 to 8 years old, it was 1993 and I remember watching CNN the day after the events. I walked into the room while my parents were looking at this savage act. I glanced at the television and saw the bodies of those pilots being torn and kicked. It was the first time I had ever seen a dead body. It was the first time I learned how much hatred there was in the world. Even at that early age I though of that soldiers family, and how they must feel at seeing this. Now if you say that the way that militia was shown in the movie is a racist act, then you have just proven to everyone you're an idiot. Wars are about killing people, and the way a side wins is by killing people. It doesn't matter what skin color they are.Now to get to those who say this is just a patriotic movie. The movie is not about America being better. The movie is not about the politics. The movie is not even about the battle, but what happened to the people in that battle. Meaning that it was what would you do if you were in that event? What would you do if your friend is in trouble? The movie is about the fellowship of your fellow soldiers. The movie shows what extraordinary things sticking together can do. The tag line of the movie is `Leave No Man Behind'. The movie does not go into politics whether America should have gone in there, or showing the flag of hope. The movie is about the friends you make. And if you do not agree, then you either did not watch movie, or you have no idea what was going on in that movie.Black Hawk Down is an outstanding movie about soldiers in a war. It is second to Saving Private Ryan. The movie truly shows the chaos in war. And on a plus, the actors, even Josh Hartnett did an extremely perfect job in the movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10.

War must be fun when you're with the us of a because all the American soldiers smiled waaaaay too much for their own good (or were they stoned?)

One of the best movies Spielberg has ever made,"Black Hawk DownThe film ""Black Hawk Down"" is a fantastic movie that became a blockbuster hit soon after it was released. Black Hawk Down really showed brotherly love, which symbolizes how military squads can be like family. My favorite thing about the movie was the intense close ups of each solider and each weapon, plus all of the dramatic battle shots. One last thing that was my favorite about the movie would have to be, including the actor Ewan McGregor. The reason is he appeared as Obi Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films from episode 1-3.Evidently, the movie was a total success.With two Oscars, two Academy awards and twenty-nine nominations this movie exploded in theaters everywhere. The quote ""We leave no man behind"" out stood the movie and had a symbolic message. The story talks about a young man who wishes to be recruited by the army, this young man's name is Grimes. Every man goes into the army full of pride and thinks that this will become the best adventure in his life, sadly it turned out to be total chaos. Every solider in the movie was determined to rescue the injured pilots no matter what.Every close up shot of each solider showed real fear, a fighting spirit and determination. This kind of spirit keeps solders energized and ready to fight again tomorrow and without it then where is the purpose of putting your life endanger if there is no fighting spirit and some one who appreciates your hard work. Each solder has a purpose on the battlefield which includes watching each others back and sometimes having to make the hard choice of rather letting you take the bullet rather then your comrade.The battle shots sometimes take me into the actual movie. The movie shows that it can be me fighting a war somewhere in the future. You never think that you have it hard until you see this movie or you read something about a conflict happening somewhere around the world. Directors have the great opportunity to bring film making to the next level which is fantastic. Steven Spielberg did an amazing job on this film, he even brought a war that I didn't even though And made it fantastic and unforgettable.Even though this movie was one of my favorite I do wish that there could have been for story and a heroic conclusion. Most movies that I have seen either end in great conclusion or they continue in another movie. This movie left me puzzled. I did intend to see a comeback from the United States military but sadly there was nothing. Nevertheless this move was fantastic, this movie is recommended for people who love brotherhood within movies, determination and those who have a fighting spirit.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good war movie.,"This movie is simply about the skirmishes between US soldiers and Somali militias on October 3, 1993.  On that day US Rangers and Delta Force were sent deep into the hostile city of Modgadishu to capture General Aidid's top aids.  What was suppose to be a half an hour mission but things went wrong and the ordeal lasted nearly one day.  The movie portrayed the battle very realistic and accurate.  Good pictures, and sound effects really put you in the heat battle.  It was almost as good as the begining and end battles from Saving Private Ryan. The only thing that wasn't real is that Modgadishu have smaller builings, more trees, and less sandy.  But that isn't important. The character development here are decent.  Sometimes they can be a little dry.  I didn't have a sense of conncection with them or felt sad when they die like I did in Saving Private Ryan.  I guessed that's what happen when Ridley Scott tried to focus on too many people at the same time. The only character that I understand and felt for was Hoot played by Eric Bana.  He was really good in this movie.  It was very emotional at the ending scene when he said: ""When I go home people ask me, 'Why do you do it man? What are you some kind of war junkie?' and I won't say a damn thing because they wouldn't understand...they wouldn't understand it's about the men next to them.""Overall this is a very good war movie, to me it came in third after Saving Private Ryan and Glory.  What I like about it was not a cliche, flag-waving, glorifying war heros flick such as Pearl Harbor and We Were Soldiers. Black Hawk Down simply tell a true story about a group of guys who were in a deep sh*t situation that not in hell anyone else would want to be in.  The movie made it clear that the soldiers weren't fighting because they were heros or because they were patriotic.  But because they were fighting for survival and each other's lives. I recommend that you should not miss this movie, it must be seen.",9.0,Anonymous,History

I love histories of movie that always put ""yankees"" as the heroes and savers of the world. But is that true? Did that episode happen? Anyway, this is a very deep movie if you think that the actors had to achieve a very complicated script: ""Aghhh"", ""uhhhh"", ""Roger, roger"". Really, very very difficult. I really don't know why Scott make an imperial movie like this, because he's really capable of doing better stuff, although we're becoming more and more super production lovers, movies without messages. This is a typical northamerican (I hate when you call yourselves ""Americans"" because you're actually northamericans) movie with the message of: ""we had to suffer but we killed everyone with 3 persons because we're the savers of the world"".

Buy a history book,"There seems to be an overwhelming number of complaints from viewers regarding a lack of historic background provided with this film. To those who feel this way, I have a question: do you need a brief history lesson at the onset of every war film? This movie has been compared for whatever reason to Saving Private Ryan. In that film, Steven Spielberg did not find it necessary to explain the motivations of Hitler after the opening credits, nor did he feel it necessary to explain why the soldiers involved with the story were there in the first place. Most every human being that may have seen that film knows enough about history to understand what was going on there. Yet this film is looked down upon by people too caught up with getting their history lessons from Hollywood because it lacks some sort of long-winded overview of the events leading up to 3 October, 93. In my personal opinion, this is one of the best movies ever made. It's too bad it's based on a point so low in American history that most Americans did not even know that it took place.",8.0,Anonymous,History

I imagine some people might say Black Hawk Down was not as ""entertaining"" as they had hoped.  All I can say to that is thank God it wasn't another `Pearl Harbor'!  This movie is as a case study of modern warfare.Unlike ""Pearl Harbor"", this movie is made in the tradition of ""Tora! Tora! Tora"" and ""The Longest Day"" in its straightforward and objective portrayal of the events.  It is based on the meticulously researched book by Mark Bowden. There are no Rambo-like cartoon heroics.

Marvelous Portrayal Of This Moment In History,"Ridley Scott has done what so few have.  He has made a realistic, true reenactment of war.  There is no beating around the bush with this movie.  I would breathe the cliched line from the pundit's guide to great movie reviews, and call it ""a roller coaster ride"", but underneath the thrills, there is nothing innocent and joyful about ""Black Hawk Down"".  In my mind, all other war movies of this caliber will forever be compared to Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"", the first successful attempt to get the audience down in the trenches with the director and the cast.  Scott's vision, which is based on Mark Bowden's novel, tries, for lack of better phrasing, to make as much sense of the confusion as possible.  The audience is fairly aware of what's going on at any given moment, but that is to his credit.  It's part of the effect, as well it should be.  Why should we, the audience, be more oriented with the geographic details then the soldiers have under heavy fire, pain, and stress.  Quick editing and cinematography drained of bright colors, gives this movie an ominous feeling of constant awareness.  Whenever the action has ceased, we still feel threatened, and the territory is as unfamiliar as ever.  This attack on the senses is what makes ""Black Hawk Down"" so powerful.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Very realistic war drama,"The history of film has given us some great war movies, e.g. Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front and Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory chronicled WW1, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Oliver Stone's Platoon, and Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket showed us the madness involved in the Vietnam War, and Steven Spielberg's recent Saving Private Ryan chronicled a chapter in WW2. Now, Ridley Scott, with Black Hawk Down, has given us one of the most realistic depictions of what it feels like to be in the heart of battle. It is about a group of US soldiers who in 1993 tried to capture two Somalian guerrilla warlords in a mission that went terribly wrong. Various critics have complained that there is not enough character development in Black Hawk Down. The complaint is basically that in a film that boasts a running time of roughly 2 1/2 hours, only the first half hour or so is devoted to giving us the background of the various characters, and why we should care about any of them. While I believe that this criticism is not completely off the mark, considered purely as a technical exercise designed to get the viewer to feel ""what it's like"" to be in a war, it is undeniable that Black Hawk Down is something of a masterpiece. Spielberg wowed audiences in 1998 with the technically brilliant and realistic battle sequences that frame Saving Private Ryan. But whereas Spielberg's film eventually ""slowed down"" to give us character development, etc., Scott's film, after the initial half hour of set up, never lets up. For the next two hours or so, Black Hawk Down assaults the viewer with a technically brilliant recreation of the brutality, craziness, and the horror of war. The event of war is presented without moralistic commentary; Scott wisely lets the action speak for itself. The brutality of war is presented as a simple fact. This is not a ""recruiting"" film; this is not necessarily an ""anti-war"" film; it is a film that realistically (and brilliantly) shows us what war is LIKE.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Aww come on Foreshead and a snoozer? OMG,"What do you want,, a love story? A little political intervention? typical UK'erThis movie was about a battle, a big screw up by the US forces and that alone.  This is none of these things because this is not what happened. Yes there is some fiction (i.e. was no Grimes Ewen Mgregor's character etc etc) included in the movie and character molding of a few into one. However this movie does justice to what happened and to those who fought and died with heroic actions.  It all happened so fast and there was no time to think once the first Black Hawk went down.  They did not have air support other than the other copters.  There was no fantasy ending or happiness.  It is just a 2 hour movie about a much publicized battle.  they technically could have made another movie just on Michael Durant alone.I think ridley Scott did a magnificent job portraying what went down In october of 1993.

"More gore then natural born killers, saving private ryan and reservoir dogs put together!","Despite the mindless violence and incomplex plot the movie does successfully depict the tragic events of October 1993. With stunning visuals, and unprecedented gore, Blackhawk Down effectively demonstrates the futitily and tragedy of war and combat. For all those unsatisfied with the movie and horrified with the blood and guts, they should realise that it is their tax dollars (if you are americans)which pay for these special operations. They should also realise that the violence shown was probably not too exaggerated and is pretty close to what really happened. So if you chose to go for the movie, be man enough to accept the reality of war and mature enough to accept its realistic portrayal in the movie BLackhawk DOwn.A 8/10 for a very realistic portrayal, and stunning visual effects.PS. I have been to many movies, and never have i seen practically an entire audience looking the other way during many of the gory scenes. People had their eyes covered, faces covered, and heads on their neighbours shoulders!",8.0,Anonymous,History

War at its grittiest and most breath taking,"For roughly 80 minutes of this film, I have never seen this much action, weapons and deaths depicted so emphatically. Ridley Scott made a gem of a film, one that is powerful in its imagery than its dialogue and other aspects. This proves to be one of the few films with bad dialogue I actually liked, simply because of the detail and care placed onto the technical side of the film. The cinematography was quite stunning, even though it was thinly guised as your typical action-movie cinematography.While I felt Josh Hartnett was WAYYY out of his element, the other actors were all exceptional. Ewan McGregor and Ewan Bremner, both known as the druggies from Trainspotting, were quite convincing in their roles as Army Rangers. Tom Sizemore proved he is the ultimate bad ass when it comes to war movies, and the likes of William Fichtner, Eric Bana and Sam Shepard proved to be worthy background characters. The best war film to come out since The Thin Red Line.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Realistic.....Smart.... Simply Put...Unbelievable.,"I went into Black Hawk Down with high hopes, being a fan of war movies, and Ridley Scott, i knew i was in for a treat.  After reading the compelling book by Mark Bowden i couldnt wait any longer to see it, its just too bad i finished the book two months before it came out.  After reading such a graphic novel i knew Scott could show the violence and gore in his own way, which would be a realistic way.  Seeing the movie get an R rating for ""intense realistic graphic war violence"" kind of surprised me since ive never seen any rating reasons like that. But being a fan of these kind of movies i couldnt wait to see it.  thought some say that you can compare the violence to the first 20+ minutes of Saving Private Ryan, you cant really, though it is pretty gory its not actually that bad, some scenes make you want to turn away or close your eyes but Ridley Scott is just trying to make it as real as possible.  The acting is ""ok"" but you dont really get enough time to know any of the characters well because of the many different story lines, but war movies arent supposed to have that much character developement.  if you want to see action, and drama this is one of your best choices of some of the poor films hollywood has to offer this time of year. so in conclusion Black Hawk Down is a first rate war movie without all that ""getting to know the main character"" stuff. its simply what it is, and it deserves 10/10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Amazing...,"When I walked into my local movie theater, I didn't quite know what to expect of this movie. I mean, I knew it was a war movie about the battle of Mogadishu and all, but what I saw was not what I expected. And I mean that in a good way.What I didn't expect was the movie to be one long war sequence. I thought that there might be some character development or a backstory of some kind or another, but there wasn't. Normally, this really angers me when that doesn't happen in a movie, but Black Hawk Down makes a special exception. Here, the only character that you need to know is the war that rages around the U.S. Rangers. Yes, Josh Hartnett and crew give excellent performances, but you didn't need to know who they were or what they did to enjoy them.Cinematography in this movie = excellent. I swear, I felt like I was in the middle of the battle my self, with bullets flying by and rockets whizzing past. And it shows you what war is really like, unlike what Pearl Harbor or Behind Enemy Lines did. True, Pearl Harbor had a spectacular war scene, but it felt fake. And Behind Enemy Lines, well, I wasn't too impressed with it. But Black Hawk Down, just like Saving Private Ryan, puts you right smack down in the middle of the action and makes you see what war is really like. Yes, there are some graphic war wounds and disturbing images, but war ain't pretty.Listen, for all you people who haven't seen BHD, get off the internet, turn off the computer, get in the car, go to the movie theater, and see it. Great visuals, powerful acting, and another excellent score by Hans Zimmer make this one of the best movies of 2001.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
The next Saving Private Ryan,"Ebert and Roeper said this; ""If you take the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan and Multiply it by ten, you have the war sequence for Black Hawk Down.I have seen many Hollywood type war movies like Pearl Harbour, and I hated the element of love that each of them contained. I don't mean to exterminate it altogether, rather to minimize it to give it an existing portion in each individual character.Black Hawk Down, on the other hand, exemplified the sort of determined love that each soldier feels when they go on the battlefield.Looking at the movie as a whole, it was brilliantly conveyed as an American struggle in Somalia. All the necessary emotions were illustrated, and carried out in an all-round exceptional attempt to re-create the war image from soldier to soldier.If there were more war stories created like this, we, as 'civilians' would receive a much clearer image of loved ones as they fight someone else's battle.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Exceptional and unemotional observation of the futility of foreign military involvement.,"More often than not, Ridley Scott can make exceptional movies - of that there's no doubt. Okay, so occasionally he comes up with a turkey (Legend and Hannibal, anyone?), but, although to date he's only directed 13 feature films, among them are numbered Alien, Blade Runner, Black Rain, Gladiator and now Black Hawk Down. Not a bad strike rate, all things being considered - and more than a few might consider me uncharitable for not also mentioning Someone To Watch Over Me and Thelma & Louise.Black Hawk Down details a single incident during American military involvement in Somalia in the early 90's, where a small contingent of US soldiers was sent deep into rebel-held territory in Mogadishu, the capital, to capture warlord leaders. The film catalogues this mission from start to finish.Looking at the acting first, one can only use the word adequate - not that any of the cast does a particularly good or bad job. So, if the acting's not noteworthy, what makes this film exceptional?Well, it's not about character. The protagonists are stereotypical - Josh Hartnett ""stars"" - but that's entirely the wrong word - as a young US ranger staff sergeant, Eric Bana produces a noteworthy performance as a war-hardened Delta Force loner, Tom Sizemore gives good value reprising his ""Saving Private Ryan"" hard as nails soldierly role and Ewan McGregor is nearly anonymous as an office-bound Ranger dragged into the heat of battle. Scott doesn't develop any of these notables as fully rounded characters, primarily because the movie is *not* a character piece. In fact, it's often confusing when following the various fates and fortunes of the separated groups of US soldiers to tell them apart - and I'm more than sure that is intentional.The ""star"" of the movie is without a doubt the cinematography. As with Ridley's best, all the stops are pulled out to give you a completely seamless atmosphere of heat, dust, urban chaos, violence and futility - the visuals are simply stunning and engrossing, but in no way beautiful, and nor should they be, given the subject matter.The action sequences, or more accurately, the continuing long action sequence which comprises three quarters of the movie, is again expertly handled. It has none of the gimmickry of ""Three Kings"" for example, but is handled in a style much more reminiscent of parts of Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" and maybe moreso the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan"".However, this is where the movie outscores its Spielberg WW2 counterpart, and heavily. It's the unemotional observation. Whereas Spielberg seems to need heroes, Scott goes out of his way *not* to judge - at least on the surface. Of course, his audience will go in with a firm preconception of who the good guys are, but to see this movie as US heroics against impossible odds is to miss the point entirely. History has shown us that US involvement in Somalia was a complete waste of time - it changed nothing, got tens of US troops killed and thousands of Somalis - and Ridley Scott is all too aware of this. It's not about right or wrong, it's not about US hi-tech warfare versus guerrilla fanaticism - so aptly highlighted by helicopter gunships on one side counterpointed by Somali machinegun-mounted rusty pickup trucks on the other. It's not about heroism, either. ""Heroes"" live or die randomly in war - they make no difference at all. The two Delta Force men who volunteer to be dropped at the 2nd crash site kill a lot of Somalis, but get killed themselves in the end, and the pilot (who was the only survivor) gets captured anyway, just as he would have been without their involvement. It's not even about leaving no man behind - yes, the dead are brought back, but they're still dead, and for what?Black Hawk Down is about the utter futility of war, of the uselessness and the sheer inappropriateness of the world's last superpower getting itself simplistically involved in a far-off situation, where the rules of combat and the motivation of the local inhabitants are completely alien. The most telling moment in the entire movie comes when a Somali militia man is talking to the captured helicopter pilot, and he says:""Do you think if you get General Aidid, we will simply put down our weapons and adopt American democracy? That the killing will stop? We know this. Without victory, there will be no peace. There will always be killing, see? This is how things are in our world.""Overall, an exceptional movie, and one of Scott's best. Realistic, unemotional, visually brilliant and thought-provoking.",9.0,Anonymous,History

To all the bad reviews...your missing the point,"I was satisfied with the main review from IMBD and most of the reviews in the comment list.  One of the points that were mentioned, however, was that not enough information was given to the individual characters, making them hard to distinguish.  It was even compared to Band of Brothers and Thin Red Line.  To this I must say that in a movie such as this and also Thin Red Line, the story was based on a group of American soldiers.  Not as individuals, but as a group.  Otherwise the story could have been titled ""Lt. Colonel McKnight and His Men.""  But no, its not.  Also, there was another bad review that ended with a dramatic quote and then the audiences reaction...laughter.  This can be comparable to ""Lord of the Rings,"" as there were a few dramatic scenes where the audience laughed.  This only comes to show the immaturity of many Americans.  The only bad comment that can be given to the movie is that there were some repetetively overdramatic scenes and I'm sure that Ridley was not to blame. Mr. Bruckhemier probably would let Ridley sleep until his rawnchy scenes were added. But otherwise, the movie is one of the best war movies I've seen. Scenes, depicting the horrors of war, are as strong as those in ""Apocolypse Now.""  And the music only made the movie even stronger.

Assault on precinct Bakara,"Brilliantly directed combat-movie that stirs up a lot of controversy despite(or because of)it´s unwillingness to commit itself to any kind of wider political or moral commentary.First off...like in most of his films, this is essentially a movie about Ridley Scott´s filmmaking craft. The cinematography, the acting, the use of sound are all melded into a brilliant composition of complex flowing imagery. It really brings a tear to the eye of any true fan of his.The story really isn´t about how glorious theAmericans are, or how evil the Somalis are. The movie is reasonably even-handed in that respect, regardless of how you might feel about the fact that we follow the viewpoint of the American troops. The tone of the movie is mostly just: ""everyone does what they do"".The Somalis are p****d at the Americans for invading their turf and meddling with their affairs. And the soldiers just want to get out of it in one piece. The movie honours the soldiers for going through this ordeal and watching each others backs. Fair enough.Like in many of his other films(Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, 1492, Gladiator and even Hannibal), the theme is of people striving under, and finding a form of redemption through severe physical or psychological distress.We don´t get to know the characters deeply. Only glimpses of who they might be. Most of the drama is relayed through the reactions and choices made under fire. There are no real stereotypes here, and neither any heroic foreground-characters who might take over the story. After all, the real star is Scott´s direction.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great Film,"A war started by CNN (hunger) and ended by CNN (soldiers dragged). I've heard some critizism about the amount of gunfire in this movie. Imagine how it was for the soldiers and Somalias who were in the battle. At least the audience can munch on Milk Duds, while the bullets wiz past. This is a great example of soldiers not having proper support for the missions they are expected to carry out. I guess Vietnam proved nothing. I was impressed on how the Rangers and Delta Force were portrayed. This followed documentaries I've seen pretty well. Although, the movie didn't mention that all of Durants crew survived the crash. Only problem with this movie is how visually dark the images are.

some glory but mainly horror in war,"The best thing about this movie is the unremitting sense it gives you of the horror of war. True, war is also the occasion for great acts of bravery, but the glory achieved pales by comparison with the gore. There's still more than a bit of the usual Hollywoodiana at work here, especially since none of the guys who die are very well-developed characters, so the sense of loss is somewhat mitigated. Nonetheless, one might hope that the movie would serve as a cautionary bracer for those who are eager to go to war. (Addendum years later: I guess it should read now: ""might have served"". Obviously it didn't serve as the ""cautionary bracer"" I hoped for, since we invaded Iraq less than 1 year later.)",8.0,Anonymous,History
Reprehensible Tosh,"I am truly amazed at the gushing reviews for this film. This may be a ""true"" story, but frankly this could have been a war movie or western about any conflict, international or domestic. Because in reality this was just an excuse for Scott to create what boils down to a two-hour gunfight. What story there is is paper thin and the plot is set out on a plate for the audience in the first 5 minutes, probably because if it wasn't nobody would understand what the feck was going on for the next two hours.Character development is virtually non existent, plot development is so clichéd and hackneyed so as to be almost irrelevant to the movie, because what this is really about is CGI pyrotechnics.This a boys film for white boys(I think there is one female character in the whole film who is on screen for about 5 seconds, and one black character on the US side), and you would be hard pressed to tell any of the characters apart as they shout, shoot and blast their way through this insidious pile of crap.Why insidious? Well, the Americans / The Goodies, are fighting the Somalies / The Baddies. The Americans are 99.9% good, white wholesome American boys, with one black face we see a couple of times. The Somalies are evil, violent and nasty black men. Can you spot the sub text? Its not hard to read into the movie a feeling that the great white American, whatever the pressure will fight and beat the black menace, wherever they are in the world - in Africa searching out evil warlords, or back in the US battling evil African America gangsters.Utter rubbish - the worst film I have seen for many years.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Blood, Sweat & Bullets: The New Story of GI Joe","The partly successful, partly disastrous 1993 mission in Somalia is recounted in a horrifyingly glorious storm of blood, sweat and bullets as American soldiers find themselves up against an entire city.Hate to sound like a cheap ad, but director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) has fashioned a war movie so powerful it leaves ""Pearl Harbor"" (which also starred Josh Hartnett) looking like a bad ""GI Joe"" cartoon. This is how a war movie should be: no romantic cliches of two soldier friends in love with the same woman, no flag waving glory crap, and no clearly drawn good guys or bad guys, even if our sympathies lie more with our own troops than the Somali war lords.Anchoring the film is a strong cast that features Sam Shepard, Jason Isaacs, Tom Sizemore, William Fitchner, Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana (in the role that made him a star in American eyes), Ewan McGregor, and Orlando Bloom in a small but crucial role as the man who falls out of the helicopter. It's an ironic bit of casting, seeing as how Bloom himself broke his back in real life and his claim to fame is playing the sleek, cat like Legalos in ""Lord of the Rings"". Just an actual incident recreated flawlessly and featuring violence so raw and powerful that you'd swear you were there (the first time I saw this film I swore I could taste the heat of the desert). Rarely is the horror of war so well depicted.This is also probably Josh Hartnett's best performance to date. He's not eye candy for the girls here, he's just playing a regular guy (who ironically was not that involved in the real incident). If he keeps this up, he might actually have a career worth remembering after his pretty boy looks have faded.Take it slow with this one.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Gritty account of a messed up Somali mission.,"Black Hawk Down presents the problems of the mission to Somalia and graphically portrays its consequences.  Our mission to Somalia was to bring order and feed the hungry.  That sounds great but we attempted to do that in the middle of a civil war.  That was the same mistake we made in Vietnam. Black Hawk Down showed the consequences of that mistake.I have to admit, I was expecting a long period of character building in this one as Bruckheimer and director Ridley Scott are in the habit of doing. Pearl Harbor is an example of this folly.  It was so bad in Pearl Harbor it was a real distraction from the film.  This was not the case in Black Hawk Down.  There is about 30 minutes of character building so you know who they are, which is done along with some of the events that lead up to raid on the Olympic Hotel in Mogadishu.  After that time, the remaining part of film was about the raid itself.  How the raid started, how it went wrong and how our men got out.The combat scenes were first rate.  Realistic and graphic.  I could find nothing wrong with the affects or the stunts. Everything seem realistic. The chaos the film projected is accurate and shows just how messed up and unorganized these raids can become when they go wrong.  I have to admit, even though I did not agree that our soldiers were over there in Somalia, I was proud of them.  I have also seen the commentaries from the soldiers that were actually there and found that the film stayed very close to their accounts.  I could only find a few small variances.  The film showed that our soldiers preformed very well and professionally in this battle.  They showed they knew what they were doing.  If you think about, our soldiers were out numbered nearly 100 to one.  We only had about 150 men and a few choppers and the Somalis had more than 2000.  The fact that only 19 of our were killed speaks well our the training our soldiers receive.One the best parts of the film occurred after the first team returned to base with the prisoners they captured.  One of soldiers said he did not want to go back in there.  This scene shows the difference between bravery/courage, cowardice and out right foolishness.  I have family members how have been in combat before, some in WWII and Vietnam.  They all have said that ""Bravery/courage, cowardice and foolishness all deal with fear. Fools have none and end up dead or getting others dead in the process.   A coward is one who is afraid and runs away.  A brave man/woman is one who is afraid, but goes anyway."" This scene shows that clearly and I feel it is a point that needs to made.Back Hawk Down is graphic and some of the scenes are not for the squeamish. Some people have made it comparable to Saving Private Ryan.  In some aspects yes, but for the most part, no way!  The presentation of Black Hawk Down is powerful and has a great deal of impact.  However, it does not have impact that Saving Private Ryan did.  I did not leave the theater shaken as I did with Saving Private Ryan. I left with a sense of pride of our soldiers that fought there.  This one is not children as some of the scenes are very graphic.Overall, nearly perfect and definitely worth your while (9 out of 10).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good Acting & SPX Can't Save This Racist Piece of Propaganda,"In short, Ridley Scott attempts to summarize what exactly went down with the US soldiers in Somalia in 1993.  I would be more inclined to forgive this film's propaganda motive if it weren't for the fact that it was poorly directed at times.There are definetly too many characters.  There is no development, and the only way an audience could feel a connection with these characters is if they wanted to, and forced the feelings out for some ideological reason or another.  Tom Sizemore was good as always, as was the rest of the cast considering the material they were working with, but they just can't save this.I won't go into the many reasons as to why this film is such a racist and factually inaccurate piece of work, but I do have an interesting side note. Brendan Sexton, who played the role of Alphabet, was very publicly critical of this film after they edited it.  Apparently, his character had a monologue near the end about how the US shouldn't have been there in the first place, but in the wake of the Sept. 11th attacks, it was cut out to give this film just another piece of brainless insta-patriot spin.On the upside, Ridley Scott did wonders visually.  Like Speilberg in Saving Private Ryan, another lackluster and unrealistic war film, Scott pushed the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in the violence department. He has guts, and knows how to show the physical aspect of war very accurately. I've seen things similar to Somalia before (seriously, don't ask), and that is really what it's like.When looking at this film from a critical standpoint, it's full of extremes in the areas of battle direction and story/developement, which still tend to balance out to a somewhat poor film.  This is one movie that, no matter how much I dislike many aspects of it, I would recommend seeing even though it isn't good.  Even people who dislike it even more than me admit that it stays with you.  So, see it for yourself.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Black Hawk Down gets it right,"As a history major in college and pure film guru I long for historically accurate films of real events that do not insert cornball Hollywood dialogue and or change real events to ""make a better story"".  Films about historical combat events have traditionally fallen victim to this scenario. Only a handful of films about war/combat have been made that break away from this mold. Tora Tora Tora!, Hamburger Hill, Paths of Glory, and Das Boot are some of the best war/combat films that get it right when it comes to accurately depicting real combat experiences and events.  Black Hawk Down also belongs in this group.I have read the non-fiction book of the same name that the film is based on. Yes there are some composite characters but the film is still 98 percent accurate to the events of 10-3-93. The Ewen Mcgregor character is based on a real Ranger who was a desk jockey and had missed combat in both Panama and the Gulf War and was a last minute replacement on the Somali Mission.  It is not a cliché, as some reviews have said, to depict a soldier dying from a leg wound because they do and it did happen true to fact as it is depicted in BHD.The movie is apolitical. Facts are facts. The Clinton DOD did nix the request by General Garrison for Armor and C-130 Gunships because they did not want the public to think we were fighting a war. Sound familiar? I am a registered Independent that leans toward a libertarian approach to domestic and foreign policy. Personally I think we never should have been in Somalia or Viet Nam or Korea or WWI. But as the son of a Viet Nam Combat Veteran (173 AirBorne Division, who was incountry during the Tet Offensive)I have great respect for our armed forces.  That is what BHD is all about. It pays respect to the Delta Commandos, Army Rangers, and Black Hawk Pilots who fought and died on 10-3-1993 by accurately depicting their actions for what they truly were, heroic men fighting for each other. This is what the Eric Bana Character says at the end of the film in such a succinct yet eloquent way.  His observation that ""some people just don't get it"" obviously still rings true as some of the reviews of BHD have illustrated.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Damned if you do, damned if you don't try to help the starving, sad heroic film","In 1990s Somalia, there is great trouble. The leaders of Mogadishu are preventing food and aid from getting to the starving populace. They would rather fight amongst themselves and squabble with UN peacekeepers. The USA military decides to run a covert operation and capture a couple of the corrupt Somalia leaders. After all, the World is watching and wondering why we can't help. But, as the Mission unfolds, two Blackhawk helicopters crash and the Marines must try to prevent any survivors from being captured. Most of the soldiers are 19 and 20, seeing their first real battles. Meanwhile, Somali soldiers are trying to kill the US forces. Will any Americans make it out alive? This harrowing film is based on real events and it's brutal. Should the USA even be doing this kind of covert meddling in a country far away ? Yes, the people of Somalia were in a horrible famine, with rogue leaders who cared nothing for the hungry. So, Prez Clinton felt we must try to help get food to those who needed it. But, wow, what a price that was paid by brave special forces. The cast is great; Hartnett, McGregor, Shepard and more do amazing work. Also, the re-creation of the battle is riveting. In the end, here is another great anti-war film that should be seen and discussed. Alas, it hasn't succeeded in stopping the evils of war.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Loved the film,"You might have heard this film being described as ""the first 20minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN extended to a two hour plusfilm"" and I want you to strike that from the record. This is not to betreated as a Steven Spielberg conquest. Yes, the man terrified usinto ever going in the water again, made us laugh at the Nazis,cried for the Jews and brought dinosaurs to life but BLACK HAWKDOWN was directed by the man who proved to us that in space noone can hear you scream, had virtually every male on the planetpounding their chest while yelling, ""Maximus"" and almostsingle-handedly created the visual style not only for a cyberpunkworld but in doing so defined how science-fiction films would lookfor the next 15 years until the Wachowski brothers one-upped himin '99. This is Ridley Scott creating one intense war film. This isNOT the first 20 minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, this is the first20 minutes of GLADIATOR extended only with the GermanicBarbarians sporting AKs and the Romans in this film are led by anex-heroin addict turned Jedi.In GLADIATOR, and then in HANNIBAL, Scott has been able tosuccessfully place the camera in the middle of the action allowingthe viewer to become a participant awashed in dirt, dust andblood. The camerawork transitions between floating as elegant asa Black Hawk to tumbling in the streets of a red hot Somalianmarket. Bullets sing by you. The dull thump of exploding RPGsreverberate inside you. War is hell and you just paid $8 to witnessit. Scott doesn't disappoint.Aside from the incredible camerawork and F/X there is an actualstory present. The Americans are not shown as this invinciblefighting machine acting on the whims of a corporation nor are allSomalians shown as gun-toting warmongers. In fact, despite anybad press this film has received from Somalian-Americans, I defythose people to watch this film again, if they even bothered to inthe first place. Somalia is portrayed as a starving country whosepeople are willing to do anything for a slice of bread. Parents lovetheir children and watch them as they run in the streets playing.But this is a war film. There are good guys and bad guys andsometimes the lines are not always clear on who belongs to whatteam. American policy and American authority is questioned andthe only thing that matters is if these troops can make it to theconvoy safely or not. That and the fact that Somalians are terribleshots.I remember this time in history. I was in college and I believe thisday-long skirmish ended up being a footnote on the news. After all,I'm sure there were more important events happening that day likereporting on why miniature golf attendance was down thatsummer.Ridley Scott took a moment in time, a drastic, hellish,insurmountable moment and expanded on it showing bravery,camaraderie and patriotism. Two hours into the film I noticed I wasstill holding my breath.I'm looking forward to reading this book.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent, but one flaw!","Blackhawk Down features genuinely harrowing and tense battle sequences, but for me is slightly let down by what I consider to be a dreadful performance from Ewan McGregor, as a normally deskbound soldier thrust into battle. I bet I'm not the only one who found his ""cup of Joe"" line to be actually embarassing, and they have even managed to shoehorn into the cast one of his sidekicks from ""Trainspotting"" as an American soldier too. Fortunately his appearances are relatively rare, and not enough in themselves to be off-putting. Very well worth it, especially on a good home theatre system. I have given it 9/10, and taken off the one point because of this casting error.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Fine Scott's incursion into the war movies, but it somehow tends to the average","In first place, to be able to appreciate any movie from this genre you must be a-. a nationalist-imperialist green-go (or in the exterior, a pro-yankee that still thinks (or prefers to think) that the U.S. are the good guys of the movie); or well b-. ignore the strong propaganda that is patent on it, and to separate the moral/ethic judgment we may have about the facts from the movie it self. In this movie's case, as hard as it could be, I could achieve this last thing, and, from this position, I may say that it is a fine movie, but nothing extraordinary, and, when compared with other movies from the genre, it may become one more of the lot. Anyway, the tension is well managed, as well as the camera work and the takes, achieving some really interesting scenes. In addition you may notice the direction of someone that knows what he wants, and the plotline, though all the distracting factors that may attempt against it, manages to make it through the the movie and to perform without problem. Other than that, I can't bear it anymore, it's all cheap propaganda (as you may see it isn't that true that I managed to achieve the previously said). About the director, without regarding any personal opinion one may have about him, we can't deny that he is one of the most versatile directors there are in the medium, as there are not two of his movies that belong to the same genre, but, in an opposite way, he has made a foray into every genre he has been able to: from K. Dick's science-fiction, to the historical film, passing through the space terror; and later making he's epic megaproduction. In this terms, being this his first (and probably the last) incursion into the war genre it is not bad, but as said before, it doesn't go further than that.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful photography, but confusing characters","Pluses:Photography - All of Scott's films have amazing photography.  This one is no exception.  The combination of video and film gave the sequences more depth and meaning than if one type of film was used.  He did this without the film technique overwhelming the content.Music - Scott's propensity for Indian/Arabic music is once again seen here.  I almost had a sense that I was watching Blade Runner during some of the sequences.  The combination of modern (Faith No More) and classic (Jimi Hendrix) seemed to be an effort to connect this film with Apocalypse Now in a modern context.Minuses:Too many characters with the same haircut and face - Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepard are the exceptions.Not enough character development - However, Scott doesn't dwell very long on sappy sentimental sequences as do many war films.I will have to see this film again as I feel I missed too much the first time.  Perhaps not Scott's best work, but it is well above most other directors'.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Best War Move EVER ! ! !,"First of all, several posters (mostly non-Americans) seem to have doubts about the performances in the film.  They don't seem to understand, that this movie is not about American soldiers or even Rangers but rather 75th Ranger Regiment Rangers.  There is a big difference.  75th Rangers are the most Hoorah soldiers in the United States Army.  If anything, I think these movie Rangers are a little subdued compared to real 75th Rangers.Second, people whine about the poor dead 1000 Somalis not being honored. Those fighters were basically gangsters supporting a warlord who used starvation, as a tool to control his people.  In any case, no American was recorded dragging a half-naked dead Somali thru the streets in ""celebration"", like the Somalis did to a dead American.  Yeah, they are real nice people - NOT !!!Third, people complained about how confusing and surreal the movie was. That is one of the best parts of the movie.  War, especially close urban combat, can be very confusing and surreal.  The movie didn't try to smooth over the rough edges, which added to the realism.I personally know, at least two former Rangers that were in Somalia and they indicated that this movie was very accurate (as far as a movie can be).

Some of the things I read in the book, I will never forget.Also, Delta Force in the books were written to be just highly trained, experienced infantry with some unorthodox methods; they were still very human, not ninjas or anything. About the only thing the movie seemed to get right was the two Delta guys being sent down to guard the chopper pilots.

Probably the grittiest depiction of modern war ever made,"While it certainly isn't perfectly accurate (what war movie is?), ""Black Hawk Down"" does what few war movies ever do - it portrays a battle without endless prattle about how horrible and futile war is.Confused? Basically, it boils down to this: every acclaimed war movie has implicitly been anti-war. BHD is neither jingoistic or pacifist; the American soldiers and Somali militia being portrayed on screen are neither heroes nor villains. Rather, Ridley Scott lets the viewer interpret the actions of the people involved and make up their own mind.That being said, I have to confess I especially loved the part of the movie where Shughart and Gordon selflessly drop in to save that second helicopter crew. I'm certain their families and their comrades are proud of the bravery they displayed in the face of overwhelming, hopeless odds.",9.0,Anonymous,History
'Black Hawk Down' needs no rescue...,"Black Hawk Down is without a doubt one of the best if not THE best portrayal of modern combat. It is so much different than Saving Private Ryan - which focussed on the rather uninteresting characters - yet it's  better.BHD is focussed on the event. I'm surprised it didn't do so well at the european box office(although it didn't do that bad). It was critically well received. All the downsides (there were very little) featured in the reviews in Europe were the same as the ones in the States. There is no flag-waving BUT: THERE""S NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! and 'IT'S A SOMALI-SHOOT-EM-UP'.I get a little angry when I hear that. Why won't they understand it's NOT about the characters. We don't want to know if one of the soldiers is a schoolteacher like in SPR!!!ITS ABOUT THE EVENT!!! ITS ABOUT HOW THEY DIED not HOW THEY LIVED!!!And as for the somali-shoot-em-up; That's what it WAS!!! more than 1000 somali's were KILLED!!! OK? So basically this movie has no bad aspects. I did however discover one tiny mistake in the sound editing. I don't remember exactly but there was a scene where - I believe it was Twombley - is running towards the rest of the men during prayer and you can see impacts of bullets on the ground yet we don't hear gunfire. Tiny mistake... Overall this movie is better than any other war movie I've ever seen... It would have been a worthy nomination at the Academy Awards.

An educational experience and a great movie.,"Black Hawk Down is one of those rare movies that I find myself watching repeatedly and pressing on friends, family and anyone else who cares to listen. It is without doubt one of my favourite movies and I will tell you why. In 1993 America intervened in Somalia. First by sending in 20 000 marines (maybe not exact figure but it's in my head from somewhere) to aid UN efforts to feed the thousands of starving Somalians, later that year they brought in their special ops, their Task Force Ranger to track down the warlord Aidid. When I first saw Black Hawk Down I did not know any of these things, I in fact knew nothing about this movie other than it was a war movie and it starred Josh Hartnett. Seeing this movie made me realise something, I was alive in 1993 (okay only 7 at the time) and yet I knew nothing about what had happened then, you could i guess say the film was an educational experience for me but it was more than that. The movie inspired me and afterwards I read the book by Mark Bowden and have done research of my own to bring myself to the point where I feel that relatively I know what happened that day.So now I know the facts and I know the movie is not completely accurate, and that certain people's roles have been beefed up or amalgamated into one person however I still watch it because this is a GOOD movie!! Ridley Scott throws us right into the action on that day. We see war for what it really is. Yes war is hell but in that extreme situation we see other humans doing amazing things; the best example I can think of is Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon roping in when the second helicopter went down. Their bravery speaks for itself, amazing people.The movie has been criticized for having all the characters look alike and blend in but that's the point, no person should stand out as ""the star"" they are a team. The acting is very good and some of my favourite scenes are the ones showing the camaraderie between the men such as the scenes in the hangar before the mission. I have seen the movie countless times and yet I still cry during the scene where the medic and other soldiers battle to save Jamie Smith.Yes this movie has flaws, it is hugely one sided in parts showing the Somalians as an evil mob. However the good things outweigh the flaws. this is a great movie with great performances. This movie shows the heroism of men drawn into a battle where they fight not for themselves, but for their friends. Even if they never wanted to be heroes I think they are.This comes from a non-American10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Best War Movie Ever Made.,"This is, in my opinion, the best war movie ever made. It shows the battle of Mogadishu from so many different perspectives and how it impacted everybody. No other war movie could do that and I think only Director Ridley Scott could catch this much chaos at once. How this film is shot and the directing are great, the screenplay is amazing, and how realistic the situation is is amazing considering this event only took place a few years ago.

Didn't need to exist like the events it shows,"I don't usually write a lot of reviews but this movie shouldn't exist. There's little to care about here. I understand Scott was trying to capture the chaotic nature of these events. But one it didn't function as an eye opener to these horrid things, didn't even have half the intensity of saving private ryan's opening sequence, and two and more importantly it was used to promote fighting this war instead of acting as a commentary on the nature of this pointless war. I don't want to get into the political nature and motivations involved in this war so I'll stick to the movie now. The movie is too hard to watch, it's disorienting to a fault cause after a point you stop caring where it's going, how can a movie simultaneously try to keep me invested in it's characters and not. If the technical side of the movie wasn't good I wouldn't even have believed that it's a Ridley Scott movie. It's a 2 hour long action sequence that doesn't get any better until near the end and for that I can't watch it again or recommend this movie.
Everything about the movie grows tiresome eventually and a decent cast can't make up for it. It has nothing to say no story to tell it's a good drill in making a movie with a war zone fight sequence. And honestly you'll probably have a better time playing COD or CS:GO to get a more engaging experience of the same.
It hasn't aged well in my opinion.",5.0,Anonymous,History
An amazingly realistic portrayal of modern war,"Covering a little known event in October of 1993, Black Hawk Down follows the failed Army Ranger attempt at overall executing a Warlord contributing to a genocide in Somalia.  The overall goal of the movie seems to be to be as accurate and realistically horrid as the actual event.  Somewhat in line with scenes featured in  HBO's Band of Brothers, Black Hawk Down accomplishes everything it sets out to do.Personally, the movie for some reason reminded me somewhat of Rules of Engagement, only taking one scene of the film and extending it as well as making it much more serious.With the team of Ridley Scott and Bruckheimer, this alone tells what the movie will be like.  The epic and saga of a Gladiator combined with the smooth visuals of movies like The Rock combines to be phenomenal.Josh Hartnett is surprisingly well suited for the ""leadership in the face of adversity"" role he takes on, as well as gives a very emotional performance. The rest of the acting is also top notch, with no one character proving annoying or poorly cast.The visuals are what makes this movie though.  Visceral scenes or RPG's flying and guns firing.  Endless Somali's, men women and kids, armed to the teeth trying to kill the horridly outnumbered Americans in any way possible. A sense of urgency and desperation surrounds the action as it unfolds fast and never ending.  The only movie it can really compare to would be Three Kings, that somewhat overlooked gem from a few years back.  Black Hawk Down is lacking a small amount in the uniqueness of the effects presented in Three Kings, yet makes up for it in every other aspect of the movie.All in all, a great movie with not a dull moment, and the icy and eerie echo presented at the beginning and end that indeed the events shown are real events.  Not for the weak hearted or those seeking a cheer-me-up movie, Black Hawk Down gives a grim portrayal of fighting a war that isn't ours to begin with...",10.0,Anonymous,History
Greatest War Movie Ever Made,"Black Hawk Down is by far the best war movie ever made. The film moves along so well that even though it is two hours of gunfights it completely keeps your attention. And the movie is SO realistic! I felt tired and drained coming out of the theater when I saw it because you actually get the feeling you're in the middle of the battle. It's also realistic in the sense that not every shot an American soldier took killed a Somali, ya know? Also, everything that happens in the movie is true. Even the line Cliff Wolcott (Jeremy Piven) says as his Black Hawk is going down (""Hey Bull you gonna pull the PCLs off line or what?"") was what the real Cliff Wolcott said as the Black Hawk was going down. The real John Waddell was a bookworm and was always reading in the hanger, and in the movie we see Waddell (Ian Virgo) reading before they go out on the Mogadishu mission. The movie's just real accurate like that. And like every sentence or line that we know was said during the real battle (I know this from reading the true, fact book of Black Hawk Down) was in the movie. To me that's what makes the movie even better, the realism and the accuracy. You don't really get TOO attached to the characters, but that in no way ruins the movie. Also, the ending of the movie was done very well (Josh Hartnett talking to a fallen comrade).So all in all, I consider this to be the BEST war movie ever made and this is definately my favorite movie.

Single Minded War Film,"This is a truly single minded film. The purpose here is to do nothing more than, as accurately as possible, recreate a terribly failed US military action.

From minute one, we are tossed mercilessly into the streets and markets of Mogadishu and left stranded with the cast. Black Hawk Down is a major technical achievement, and though I was suprised to see it win two Oscars, I felt they were earned.This movie cannot be compared to Platoon, SPR, Born on the Fourth of July or most other war movies for that matter. It focuses solely on a mission and a failed one at that. For me, if this movie brought any message to the screen, it was that America did not know what it was doing in Somalia.

I know some of you might say that ""well this movie simply states the FACTS as they happened,"" but I'm afraid that is where you are dreadfully wrong. The movie simply shows Black Africans as bloodthirsty born savages who needlessly attacked American SOLDIERS involved in a COMBAT operation. For the producers to do justice they could have at least showed why the Somalis attacked the US soldiers. This is where the facts come in: about a month or so before the incident, American helicopters, while hunting for a SINGLE warlord, had come to the town looking for him. The Somali residents did not trouble the Americans then, for after all the Americans were there to help them all out. But in hunting for that SINGLE guy, the Americans, in their classic military tradition, blew up the ENTIRE building that this guy was thought to be in, killing at least 75 PEOPLE, all of whom had LOVED ONES too (and the guy was not even there). So what do you think Mogadishu residents did the next time they saw American helicopters in their neighborhoods? They had to at least try to defend themselves from another mass killing of course. And the vast majority of the Somalis killed by the Rangers were unarmed women and children, a fact the filmmakers carefully disguised. And by the way, for those of you who think the Rangers in Somalia were sweet little angels, I believe that the ranger one who was portrayed by Josh Hartnett is currently serving a thirty-year sentence for CHILD RAPE!!!",4.0,Anonymous,History
Probably the best 'war' movie,"Black Hawk Down just tries to be honest about the 1992 experience in Mogadishu, and does not make claims over and above the events.  Rarely is a 'war movie' not about someone's notion of patriotism, or pacifism, or peace, Shakespeare, ethics, morality . . . The audience gains dignity by witnessing events without being spoon-fed something 'more.'  The soldiers gain dignity without having something 'more' deemed necessary over them for a worthwhile movie.  This might be the best war movie for those who appreciate an honest approach to an event as terrible as war, and, because of its seriousness, to be allowed to form their own judgements. There are great actors in the movie too.  They give great performances, and as such they don't . . . stand out.  I remember that the New Yorker called their performances, ""selfless."" People who think it was an ordinary war movie have perhaps so little an idea (based on having no interest) of the realities of today's army that they just don't know when they're being shown something false, and when they're seeing something pretty genuine.

The best movie of 2001!,"Here's the movie that I'll be rooting for at Oscar time (that's only if it gets a Best Picture nomination which it should). ""Black Hawk Down"" is my choice for the #1 film of 2001. This may be the best war movie that I've ever seen. There have been great war movies made in the past like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Platoon"", but ""Black Hawk Down"" got to me like no other war movie ever made. Maybe the fact that our country is at war right now made me think about our U.S. soldiers and the fight that were in because of the horrible September 11 tragedy. So you can see that this is an important film to see right now. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a powerful motion picture about the true story of a U.S. military raid that went disastrously wrong in Somalia in 1993. Director Ridley Scott shows us the horrors of being in a war and how bloody it can get. It's heartbreaking. ""Black Hawk Down"" has an impressive cast of actors playing the soldiers. Josh Hartnett comes off much better here than he did in ""Pearl Harbor"" as the leader of a squad which includes Ewan McGregor (""Moulin Rouge""), Tom Sizemore (""Saving Private Ryan""), and William Fichtner (""The Perfect Storm""). Sam Shepard also stars as the major who gives order to the soldiers. ""Black Hawk Down"" has plenty of action but this movie is not about action. It's about war and the soldiers who fight in it. This is Ridley Scott's best film to date. It's better than his Oscar winner from 2000, ""Gladiator"". Though he didn't win the Best Director Oscar for that film (which went to Steven Soderbergh for ""Traffic""), if nominated for Best Director this year, Scott would be my personal choice for the Best Director Oscar for ""Black Hawk Down"", because he did an outstanding job on this film. However, that will be tough to come by (Ron Howard of ""A Beautiful Mind"" and Robert Altman of ""Gosford Park"" are currently the front-runners for the Best Director Oscar). Scott produced the film with Jerry Bruckheimer, and what an amazing turnaround for the long-time producer after the disappointing ""Pearl Harbor"". Remember in my review of that film, I complained that the film was ruined by the directing job of Michael Bay. I had said that Steven Spielberg or James Cameron would have done a better job if one of those guys had directed that movie. Ridley Scott is another one. He could have made that film better too, and his direction on ""Black Hawk Down"" is proof of that. Bruckheimer redeemed himself by choosing Scott to direct this film and he did himself some good in that department. Good job by all. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a great movie that's powerful and emotional. It's my favorite movie of 2001.**** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,History
powerful and,"I loved ""Black Hawk Down."" I loved everything about it, the fact that it was exactly everything it wanted to be, and didn't go over the top in any way and shove down our throats how to feel about it in a certain way. It gave us a great perspective on what the ordeal was like for the Americans, with just the right amount of moments to draw the audience's emotion out for the characters. It was pretty much the best war movie I have ever seen in terms of making the viewer really feel like he/she was there to experience it. It started out, after giving sufficient background on the conflict in Somalia, feeling like ""The Thin Red Line,"" where we get to meet all the characters - in this case U.S. soldiers - and see what they are like before thrusting them into battle. This goes on just long enough for us to like and appreciate them and feel for them later in the movie. Once the action starts, it goes nonstop to the end of the film and all important events are shown in such good detail and so efficiently that the audience knows everything that is happening, without being confused for the most part. There are great performances by all the actors, making their characters seem very genuine, and the technical work is just flawless, making the location seem so real and, as I said before, almost as if you were there. I'll say 9.5 out of 10, rounding up to 10 for the rating scale.",10.0,Anonymous,History
