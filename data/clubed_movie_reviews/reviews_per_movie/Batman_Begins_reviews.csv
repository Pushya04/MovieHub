The Batman film I've been waiting for...,"Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.Thankfully though, Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character, portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne, who ultimately rises to become Gotham's greatest champion. Don't expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie, waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume, as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen, it is well worth the wait. In my opinion, Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film, I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.One of the strongest features of the film, is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a 'Batman' could be a reality one day. The technology is current, with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets, again making the film work by today's standards. Plus, we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too, something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too, are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully, in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly 'normal' and manage to be menacing at the same time.Which finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let's face it, what a line up! Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katy Holmes, Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance: Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn't have faith in Christoper Nolan's talents and thankfully they took the leap...For the comic book fans out there, waiting to see this movie, let me assure you that you won't be upset. Imagine the darkness of the 'A Death In The Family' and the 'Year One' story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn't love these books. Well, this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale: Dark, brooding and tortured by his past, yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans, then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane's original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....Thank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman has truly begun!,"To start off this review I'd like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clich√©s, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze ""You're not sending me to the cooler"", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun.

Nolan is the real superhero,"To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.I heard Batman Begins, and I thought great, this was called ""Batman"" in 1989, selfishly I said, ""I want something new!"".But, of course being a big Batman fan, I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later, like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to (and yes I have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip, this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin, Texas.I never would have thought this would have worked, even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong, so wrong. After seeing the X-Mens and Spidermans, I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up, again, so wrong.Nolan gave us a dark, gritty, and pleasantly realistic, view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred, and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.Even though X-Men and Spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies, Batman Begins, is just a good, no, great movie. And I think that is what blew people away, that it wasn't just some superhero, special effect, hero gets girl, good guy wins movie, it was a truly dark and well crafted movie, and it maybe stupid to say, but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.I don't even think Burton, and his animated style(which works), could have revived this troubled series, that Schumaker wrecked, because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil, tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.So, here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie, that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time, but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. And such is the case for the Batman franchise,"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast.Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care.Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob.Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A darker, stormier knight.","Christopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to dream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and eradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..) O'Donnell.The story is as good an origin story as you'll find - covering all the major (true-to-the-comic) events, and not wasting ages on them. We see Wayne's all-important training period (previously ignored), and his connection to the Tibetan shadow-ninja clan led by Ra's Al Ghul. We see Bruce come up with ideas for his symbol, his costume, his gadgets, his car, his cave - IT ALL FITS SO PERFECTLY.That's not all - Liam Neeson is perfect (as ever, when Lucas isn't writing his lines), Batman's first mad nemesis (the Scarecrow) is genuinely frightening; with some outstandingly scary 'fear' effects.. Gary Oldman looks just like a young Commissioner Gordon (and doesn't dominate), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer give solid heavyweight support to the boardroom machinations at Wayne Enterprizes. I love Michael Gough(?) but Michael Caine is great as Alfred. It's only Katie Holmes who didn't ring true for me - not because of her performance, but simply because she looks all of 15 years old (sorry Katie). I am always blown away by Christian Bale, and this is no exception.The fights are great, the Bat-gadgets all there, the car is amazing, the plot is thorough and exciting, Gotham looks great, Batman really is frightening & menacing (and lethal!).. And the scenes with the bats themselves FINALLY get across the idea of how scary they can be.There is some humour, but it's fairly dry. The soundtrack, like all the best original soundtracks, is excellent - you hardly know it's there, but the emotions of the scene are enhanced and boosted. For the most part this is a serious Batman film, with plenty for long-time fans. This NEW Batman is one I'd like to see again. Bravo Mr Nolan, bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Everything I could have hoped for,"I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)However, I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege, you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements, he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise, every scare, every concern, every emotion seems real.Part of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again, this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.That said Bale is not just good, he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.The rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell, Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing, Katie Holmes is strong and sexy (I particularly thought she'd be insipid, she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent - which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April - speak for itself) and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wise-guy American accent that never really convinces.The emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.Don't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.Great villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action... put simply, great film. Probably the best comic-book movie ever made (that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comic-book rather than a comic-book movie, that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A first class movie.,"A young Bruce Wayne watches in horror, as his parents are killed in front of him, later in life, he vows to remove the criminal element from Gotham City.A word on Christopher Nolan first, I am a huge fan, I think of Inception, Dunkirk and Interstellar, but his magical trio of Batman movies began here, a movie that put the franchise back on top.I'm not always sold on origins movies, there have been several misfires, this is one of, if not the best, it feels very organic, at no point does it try too hard, or overdo it, the balance between story, introduction, action and character, pretty much perfect.The Cinematography is incredible almost twenty years on, the choreography, fight scenes look terrific, made at a time where the purpose of the music was to assist the film and not to drown it out, it is also excellent.Christian Bale was perfect casting, one of the best actors in the business, he is first rate, the balance between Bruce Wayne and Batman is spot on, what a skilled actor he is.An incredible supporting cast, Cillian Murphy is equally as good as Bale, putting in a fiendishly creepy and sinister performance as Crane, Freeman, Caine, Neeson, Oldman, I don't think it could have gotten any better than this.Fantastic, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Finally!!!,"I got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, ""This is it! This is the movie!"" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
DC Finally Got It Right.  This Is A Grittier And Darker Batman Story,"Batman Begins is a well told story of the origin of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale). It covers a lot of the same ground as Michael Keaton's original Batman, but goes much further in depth in many factors of his creation. It goes into great detail about subjects such as how he got his costume, what exactly it is. Same goes with the Batmobile. We also find out why he chose to be bat-like.One of the more interesting aspects here is how it shows Bruce's father, Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), and how he molded Bruce's life and instilled good judgment within him, a point which is misunderstood about him by most people he comes in contact with. Thomas, too, teaches Bruce valuable lesson, such as ""We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves up"". This is pretty close to the theme of the movie or motto Bruce Wayne lives by. The resemblance of the father & son is pretty good, too.I also thoroughly enjoyed the training Bruce Wayne endured becoming ""invincible"". Bruce is trained by Ducard (Liam Neeson) in many ways like a ninja (The concept of Batman IS similar to a ninja). He is taught many valuable lessons in this temple and is shown no mercy. Eventually, we even see his first real enemy as a superhero/vigilante.Although I am not positive as to how true to the comic book this movie is, I am sure it took a few liberties, as did Spider-Man. Most of the small examples I have noticed are for the better and make for a good story. The Batmobile is more believable as an expensive armored vehicle that the military would not spend the money on than a juiced up Corvette (or whatever that was). Same with the Batsuit.Katie Holmes is excellent as Rachel Dawes, a D.A. who is not afraid to go after the big villains in court. Also worthy of mentioning is Michael Caine as Alfred the butler. I do not believe they could have found a better man for that role, although I could not get the image of Caine as Austin Powers' dad out of my head when he was on screen.Finally, in my opinion, Christian Bale makes a much better Batman than the three recent previous ones in Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney. Something about him makes Batman darker and more mysterious. Hopefully, DC Comics and movies have learned from their mistakes and we will not have to worry about Batman picking up a sidekick in this newest installment of the Batman series. 9/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What's all the fuss?  It's just OK,"Batman redone. It gives us a new origin of Batman (Christian Bale) and how he got his powers and such. He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman. His first two villains are the Scarecrow (Cillain Murphy) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra's Al Ghul--who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses.OK--it's MUCH better then Tim Burton's dreadful movies but I still wasn't too impressed. I didn't like the new origin at all and it's a full hour before Batman even shows up! It does have good parts--Bale is dead on perfect as Bruce Wayne AND Batman. He also pumped up for the role (we have at least two shirtless scenes). It LOOKS great (if very dark) and it has elaborate special effects left and right (with tons of explosions thrown in too). But I was mostly bored. The training sequence at the beginning just went on endlessly--it was more like The Shadow's origin than Batmans. Also this movie was WAY too heavy on darkness and atmosphere. At one point it was raining and I noticed nobody in Gotham pulled in their clothes from their lines. This isn't nit picking but obviously it was all out there to add an ""atmosphere"" to the scene. Also when you find yourself worrying about little things like that the movie just isn't doing its job (i.e. entertaining you). However Batman's costume, the Batcave and the Batmobile are all explained pretty logically.Acting varies--Bale was just great. Michael Caine (as Alfred) matched him. Even Katie Holmes (a limited actress) was good--too bad she won't be in the sequel (this inexplicable romance/marriage with Tom Cruise is destroying her career). Laim Neeson was very dull as a teacher--he appeared to be drugged out. Gary Olman was (suprisingly) terrible as Jim Gordon--he seems VERY unsure of how to play the role. But Rutger Hauer, Linus Roache (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bale) and Morgan Freeman were all great.To be totally honest I looked at my watch more than once. I couldn't wait for this thing to get over. All the praise this is getting is beyond me. I give it a 7--and that's mostly for the acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Starts well with intelligence and invention but then descends,"It had some original stuff that displayed intelligence and thought with regards to his suit, car and weaponry. It did try to dwell on Bruce a lot more and convey some of his darkness but I found towards the end it became very Hollywood-ised. Sometimes filmmakers try to over complicate things and this was a good example.I don't know why they can't have a simple bad guy with a simple plan, why do they have to be so elaborate a plot leaving a growing feeling of inevitability that by the end there will be some big explosions, building destruction, lots of flashing lights and Batman will prevail.The inability of seeing the fighting was immensely frustrating. I don't think I saw him actually land a single punch. It seems a fight scene would be imminent and the makers would speed up the camera, ramp up the bass on the sound, scatter the scene with crunching thuds and smacks but then forget to actually choreograph a fight. Maybe believing that if we heard the thuds and saw some activity on the screen that the audience would imagine the rest and think 'wow, what a scene'. I'd much rather have two or three clearly thrown punches or kicks than 1-2 minutes of whirling cape, bangs and crashes and people falling to the ground.It's a shame that they re-launch the franchise in a blaze of 'this is going to be darker and different' which it certainly starts off doing before descending a little bit into Hollywood banality. Why not have the courage to really shake things up, have the bravery to maybe end it badly (taking T3's lead) or just not conform to the normal formula.Showed promise, had some clever stuff and made more of an effort than some in the franchise but still nothing to rival Batman:Mask of the Phantasm as the best batman ever made in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Comic-book films grow up at last,"I've just come back from a preview screening of Batman Begins. I went in with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan's previous efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This film grips like wet rope from the start. I won't give away any of the story; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing in a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane to great effect.What's impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Parents thinking of taking their young kids along, think twice. When we left, a terrified 8-year-old boy was being comforted by his parents. Some of what's up there on screen really is the stuff of nightmares.Of the cast of Brits chosen to bring this American tale to the masses, Christian Bale convinces in his dual role, while Michael Caine as Alfred comes up with the humour just when the film is in danger of taking itself too seriously. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson provide able support, as does Morgan Freeman.Most refreshing of all is the way that Nolan and co have come up with a way of bringing comics to the screen that does justice to the often adult source material in a way that, say, Daredevil, tried and failed to do (although the director's cut is better). If the Dark Knight doesn't return after this, there's no justice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Is Back and Better Then Ever,"This film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we've scene of the Dark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini and Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn well care. Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be.Much has been said of the film's ""reality"" quotient, and I'm here to say it works. Nolan talks about how Batman's strong because he does push-ups, he gets around because of his gadgets, and by introducing each of them with a plausible explanation, we forget to quibble and go along with it. The technology may be fantastic, but it's believable. And, unlike the ""reality"" of something like Daredevil, Nolan doesn't forget his ideals halfway though and start having Batman wire-jump thirty feet into the air.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The BEST movie of the year!!!,"I just came back from a special screening of Batman Begins and I must say this is the best movie I have yet seen this year. All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film; it incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping & laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming that they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the talented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the intensity, physique, and charm you'd expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of ""the young girl"" or ""girlfriend"".I hardly ever see action films nowadays because I don't want to waste my time watching a conventional, corny, over-digitalized,plot less film. To be honest, I gave this film a chance not because it was a Batman movie, but rather because of the talented veteran actors as well as being a fan of Christopher Nolan's previous films. Whether you're a fan of Christopher Nolan or just a Batman fanatic, you'll enjoy every single second of the movie. People of ALL ages will appreciate this film. The violence in this movie is not vulgar, but rather sends out a lot of great messages of loyalty, respect, and humility. Not only is ""Batman Begins"" the best of the Batman series, it is the most unconventional.

Let's get serious...the real Batman has arrived!...,"BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a ""darker"" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.From the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale). The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow. There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes. And there are plenty of them.But the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations--not just cartoonish figures. There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney. Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice.Looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy. He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces, and Gary Oldman.The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.I can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.Praise too for Cillian Murphy, who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness, underplaying his role (as most of the others do) so as not to become a caricature, as so often happens in these Batman enterprises. If it's a series of running gags that you expect--as from previous Batmans--you won't find them here. The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.Well worth the wait. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish.Warning note: Perhaps a little too intense for children, but adults are certainly going to appreciate the fact that the real Batman has arrived.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best thing to hit the Batman name EVER!,"I thought this movie was absolutely spectacular, I took me by surprise. I never thought I would see a Batman movie with depth and that showed the true fear that is the character Batman that he brings to his enemies. Christian Bale did a excellent job and I truly look forward to him in another Batman Movie!The story was absolutely amazing and in my humble opinion very original. Raj Al Ghul is an excellent villain and to portray him in the way he was portrayed was top notch, not to mention he was played very well. Many people I talked to complained that the actor who played him was not of Asian decent. However I believe it truly didn't matter at all.Not to mention Alfred was great. Gordon (later Commissioner Gordon) was excellent as well.No other Batman Movie has portrayed Batman truly as the Dark Knight and as I said already I truly look forward to more along these lines.-ND",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Worst of the trilogy, but still a cinematic masterpiece.","Christopher Nolan really outdid himself on this one, and so did everyone else involved in this movie. The trilogy is easily one of the best of all time, and I barely have any complaints.Before I explain the good parts of the film, I'd like to discuss the one problem I think several people will have with it. The story. I, personally, didn't have an issue with it. In fact, I thought it was very well delivered. However, if you are looking for a more ""Classic Batman"" movie, this one isn't for you. Scarecrow doesn't show himself fully in costume until around the last third of the movie, and the film doesn't have Robin either. It focuses more on Bruce Wayne and the amount of effort and redemption it took for him to become the masked vigilante we all know and love.If you're more interested in the violence and the criminals in the film, I'd recommend ""The Dark Knight"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Or, go check out Batman 1989. Absolute classic.Now that I've cleared the issues with the movie, I'd like to discuss the positive.Christian Bale's performance as Batman is absolutely badass. The way he explores himself throughout the movie is such an emotional journey. Adding onto this as well, Alfred and Lucious, the two sympathetic older characters, are both absolutely amazing, lovable characters. Gordon is also a pretty good character with an interesting relationship with the Batman.Overall, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, but it doesn't beat the rest in the series.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Summer Blockbuster . Nothing More. Nothing Less,"BATMAN BEGINS rejuvenates if totally regenerates a film franchise . After Tim Burton's idiosyncratic vision of the comic strip , the film series became very stuck with the Joel Scumacher version . You wouldn't really blame Warner Bros if they'd ended the franchise there and then due the law of diminishing returns .Indeed it might have been seen as something of a risk casting so many big name ( Read expensive ) actors in one movie . The fact that on its first week of release it only entered the top ten weekly box office must have frightened the studio executives , only to have their fears extinguished where the movie rallied strongly spending two weeks at the top followed by several weeks in the top tenCertainly it's a film that reboots everything that's gone before . It tells the early life of Bruce Wayne while never referring to a need for a sidekick in the shape of Robin the boy wonder . Instead we see some one whose life is ripped apart by murder and is later perceived to be let down by the justice system and Bruce Wayne is not someone who will meekly let this go . In effect Bruce Wayne is now written as a comic strip version of an avenging angel along the lines of Travis Bickle /Paul Kerzey / John Eastland and all your other favourite vigilante anti-heroes from cinemaOr at least that's what should have happened . Unfortunately after this motivating incident , which also takes in an involving sequence set in a Chinese gulag the film then starts playing out as a Hollywood Summer blockbuster . In many ways it's like the old blockbusters from yesteryear featuring a host star names and highly regarded not so big name character actors all brought together in one film . The great shame is that most of them are given little to do . It's a film that has a plot written around its set pieces and the characters are just as mechanical . They're not characters like people are in real life , they're generic action hero , generic action hero's sister , loyal butler , stand up police chief who is slightly dumb etc etc by actors who could be have been unknowns . This is a great pity for a film whose reputation suggested to me it was going to be much better than a simple Summer blockbuster/franchise movieChristopher Nolan is a good director , though the recent hype with INCEPTION with claims that he's "" the greatest director of his generation "" might leave him with some baggage . What Nolan has always been good at is editing and continues this with BATMAN BEGINS . The way he inter-cuts scenes is what makes them effective . But at the end of the day it's merely a Summer blockbuster with big names , car chases and the occasional explosion",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A Batman that is stylish, dark and gritty- simply brilliant!","My only criticism of this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is a little too long. But it is an extremely good film, that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film's sophistication). People may find this blasphemy, but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight, but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is stylish, dark and gritty, pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film ""contradicts"" the 1989 film. Perhaps so, but what I can say in the film's defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies.Visually, Batman Begins looks absolutely incredible! It could very well be the most beautiful visually of the Batman films, with beautiful cinematography and a simply dazzling view of Gotham City itself. Another asset I appreciated was that the music score didn't overpower the action, in fact it gave some atmospheric flavour to it. As much as Danny Elfman's scores were outstanding and definitely memorable, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard do a great job with the score.The script is taut and well-written with lines that really make you think along with some occasional offbeat humour, the plot isn't convoluted or predictable but original, the film moves briskly(the second half was marginally better in terms of pacing to the first half though but that is in no way a flaw) and the action is explosive particularly the climax and the bat-mobile car-chase. Also Christopher Nolan's direction is excellent.The acting, aside from the visuals is what drives the film. Christian Bale is for me the best Batman since Michael Keaton. In the role of Batman he is suitably dark and brooding, like Batman should be, and as Bruce Wayne, he is dashing, handsome and ambitious. Katie Holmes actually surprised me and in a good way. She wasn't bland or annoying, I actually found her sympathetic and surprisingly good. Liam Neeson is also very good, though he has been better, while Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson and the excellent, underrated Gary Oldman are also solid in their roles, while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always.Overall, a brilliant film that is visually stunning, gripping and atmospheric. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Again? Well, not quite.","The name of David Goyer among the writing credits made me fear the worse. After all those Zig Zag and Blades appallingness you can hardly blame me. So, you may imagine my surprise to discover that Batman Begins is not only better than the previous Batmans but much better. The genesis of the character as well as inedited insights into the seven mystery years in the life of Bruce Wayne makes the whole enterprise engaging even thrilling. Christian Bale is an American Psycho Batman, pouty lips and unexpected sexual presence. Katie Holmes is lovely, with a sharp intelligence and a riveting imperfect beauty. Michael Caine fills the shoes of the butler with wit and charm. Gary Oldman, looking more Oldman than Gary, adds another surprising characterization to his already impressive gallery. So, very nice. There is still hope in hopeless trends. Who knew.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
heavily overrated,"quote. When I heard they were making another Batman movie that explored the origins of Batman with promises of a much better conceived portrayal of the dark knight, I was very excited. Then, when I heard that Christian Bale who's famous for his dark and sinister characters in ""American Psycho"" and ""The Machinist"", was going to play Batman, I got even more excited. Then, the announcement that Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame was picked to direct it, and I was almost certain this film was to not only be the best Batman movie in the franchise, but the best film of the year! Then I saw it.Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. The movies seemed to fall flat in a number of places. For starters, let's begin with direction. With Christopher Nolan in the drivers seat, I kind of expected a tight, clever plot with a less formulaic film style then what was presented. Sure, I mean Nolan had to stick with the script that was given to him and not tamper with the story of Batman. But I felt that the story could have been better displayed. The action scenes in the movie were too quick and flashy, leaving the characters on the screen virtually indistinguishable from one another. What I took away from the film was that it was loud and there were a lot of flashy action sequences where apparently something happened. The film seems to move too quick in some areas and too slow in others. I mean, was the entire process of becoming Batman completely necessary. At least the previous films left some sense of mystery of who Bruce Wayne was and where he got his bat gadgets. I mean, who really cares when it comes down to it? It took away from the plot of Batman Begins.Let's talk about the acting - subpar at best. Hollywood actors should have to have licences to act then Katie Holmes should have hers revoked for her role as a Assistant DA. She was about as convincing as an attorney as Denise Richards was as a nuclear scientist in that stupid James Bond movie. She was supposed to play Bruce Wayne's (Bale) love interest but the on screen chemistry between the two is laughable. Bale's acting was OK, but not like anything we've seen him do in the past. I think if he portrayed Bruce Wayne more like his psychologically tormented character Trevor Reznik in ""The Machinist"", we would have had a better movie on our hands.All in all, this movie wasn't anything special. It was your typical Hollywood formula, good guy versus bad guy, special effects extravaganza with no real value at all.A very forgettable film with bad acting, unnecessary scenes, poor direction and a penchant for overkilling the point. Yes, we understand Bruce Wayne doesn't like bats, and he has to overcome his fear and bring justice to the city of Gotham and yadayada.....blahhhhhhhhh! This oversimplified account of the story of Batman should have been given a different title - ""Batman for dummies and for people that like things that go vrooom and boooooom!"" In its defense, however, it was better than that god awful ""Batman and Robin"". If you really want to watch a good Batman movie, watch the first one. end of quote. the best it can get is 5. I voted 1 just to try to make the result balanced a bit.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A reboot that works,"British director Christopher Nolan is better known for his lower-profile thrillers such as the excellent MEMENTO and the brilliant INSOMNIA, but his first big-budget Hollywood blockbuster is still in the same league as the other two: a tremendously inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking, which breathes a whole new life into the Batman saga and proves to be the best film of the series (shame it took till number five to get it right, but that's life). Nolan dispenses with any previous cast or story lines, instead taking Batman back to his roots, and the result is a tough, violent, realistic adventure which isn't marred by any of the comic-book campness or flights of fancy which spoiled the others. Batman is just an ordinary guy here, without any superpowers, but instead his Bond-style gadgets allow him to become the caped crusader by night.The casting is extraordinary and the ensemble all give outstanding performances. Bale is terrific, finally getting some of the acclaim he deserves; I've been watching this guy for a few years now and he's been great in everything I've seen. Caine is cast as Alfred the butler, and supplies genuinely warm comedy and wit. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are friendly allies, although their roles are relatively minor. Katie Holmes is the attractive love interest and she, too, is surprisingly good. However, it's the villains which have the best parts; Liam Neeson has his best role in many years and is fantastic in it, whilst THE LAST SAMURAI's Ken Watanabe is creepy as a cult leader. Cillian Murphy (28 DAYS LATER) is truly memorable as weirdo bad guy The Scarecrow, whilst Tom Wilkinson is almost unrecognisable as a hardline gangster. Even Rutger Hauer is in it, and that's gotta be good, seeing as he's been stuck in DTV movie hell for a decade.The film is long ‚Äì 2 ¬Ω hours to be precise ‚Äì but the suspense and action keep it moving. There are car chases, fist fights, massive battles and lots of other stuff going on. The plot keeps you guessing all the way through and there are plenty of surprising twists. My only complaint is that the action is cut too fast, and too close, so that it's pretty hard to see what's happening, but the excellent soundtrack helps make up for that. Still, a minor complaint with what is otherwise a flawless film ‚Äì let's hope they all team up to make some more classics like this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good start to Nolan's trilogy,"Director Christopher Nolan is rebooting the Dark Knight with a ever darker style. It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer, Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham, he invents Batman.There are two things that keep this from an even more impressive start of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The first is Katie Holmes. She is not up to the task. She is still playing that little girl character from Dawson's Creek. She doesn't have the seriousness or gravitas to play this gutsy lawyer character. It's a big character, and not just another girlfriend.The second is that Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) isn't a big enough villain. The evil plan has too much of a silly Bond feeling. It is too unrealistic in a Batman movie that is suppose to be realistic. It leaves a bad taste for the climatic ending. Other than those two, this is still a great start to the trilogy. It sets the tone for the final two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The bat is back***************,"All i can say is thank you Chris Nolan,,,I still think you will have to be a magician to beat Tim Burton's Batman film's but Nolan has is well on his way to becoming Houdini. This is a film that describe's Batman as he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has Nolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it appears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and recruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an extremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director to do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good films like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a joke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making franchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on Gotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing likeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and more because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes batfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it has an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in succeeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The villain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more corrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to clean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and lifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely one to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did..",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
And i thought the Combination of Tim Burton and Michael Keaton was as good as its gonna get?,"I loved Batman and Batman Returns, Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's Batman were really good, and seemed to be the best we were ever going to get.I'm glad to say that i was wrong, Christopher Nolan has taken the character of Batman to the very beginning, fleshing out the characters of both Bruce Wayne and Batman down to the finest details. Nolan's use of realism in the creating the Batman character makes him more believable than ever.Christian Bale quite simply personified the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and actually puts everyone else's portrayal in the shadows. Bale is supported by a wonderful cast, including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and more, but i found Cillian Murphy's performance as Dr. Jonathon Crane to be one of the finest in the movie.Overall Batman begins is an very honest, detailed and compelling adaptation of the Batman character, that is worthy of the recognition it has received.

By far the most intense of them all,"I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Better the second time around...,"The first time I watched ""Batman Begins"" I can't really claim to have been overly impressed with this origins story, and I remember finding the characters sort of plain and the story equally so.Now, several years later, watching the movie on TV, I am a bit surprised to say that the movie is actually a lot better this time. And the storyline actually had more depth and flavor than I remembered.Christian Bale is unquestionably the best chance for portraying Batman and Bruce Wayne, and manages to take the character and his performance one step further with each successive movie.The characters in the movie were adequate, although the Scarecrow character wasn't really fully utilized, nor given as much time on the screen as I would have liked.

Character development in a Comic Book/Plot movie?  What a GREAT IDEA!,"Saw a free screening on Tuesday. I must say, I had my expectations low for this one, as the previous Batman franchises was just cartoony, over the top, and flat out mind dumbing. Why do studios continually think that spending money on 'bankable stars' and special effects will make a ton of money on box office receipts? Granted ""Batman Begins"" has a pretty sizable budget, but they made the right decision with casting actors that can act and hiring a director that shares the same vision of the comic book. You will not see any caricatures of the comic book, but rather be immersed in how Bruce Wayne has that internal conflict of morality as he becomes Batman. Christopher Nolan takes his time developing Bruce Wayne's character in the image that Bob Kane had with his own flair to it. Anyone familiar with Nolan, Christian Bale, and Cillian Murphy's work will not be disappointed with this movie. Make no mistake about it, it is a dark movie, which is what makes it so great. Nolan uses CG effects very sparingly (thank God!).I rarely give movies a 10 out of 10, as I am pretty brutal with ratings, but Nolan resurrects a failed franchise. Personally, this is what Batman should have been all along - The Dark Knight! Anyone who is a Batman, Nolan, Bale, Murphy fan will not be disappointed.

A big cinematic experience,"I can only say what several critics have said before me; at last they capture the essence of the Batman legend on film!

It's relentless in its quest to explain why and how a man of Bruce Wayne's wealth and public persona would dress up like a bat and battle crime. This is the core of the movie, and it treats this with confidence and conviction. When a movie believes this much in the story it's telling, it's much easier for the audiences to believe in it as well. This is a big cinematic experience, and it shouldn't be missed.

Outstanding Batman 'Prequel',"This latest Batman film disappointed a lot of people....but not me. I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn''t have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and fount it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman.The first hour of this ""prequel"" dealt with his origins. If you're a fan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films, this part in the film should not bore you. It was like a documentary to me, about a topic I was interested in. In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more.Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman. It's too bad there have been so many actors playing this role, ruining the continuity of this latest series. I hope Bale continues with a few more efforts with this character.It was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of ""Alfred."" He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story. Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role, or romantic one, as I expected, and that was fine with me. I just enjoyed looking at her face, leaving it go at that. Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner Gordon in all the other episodes (but, once again, played by another actor.)The film ends with what would be the beginning of the first Batman, featuring ""The Joker.""After having seen all the Batman films several times, I now think is the best of them all....perhaps an unpopular choice, but that's my opinion.

"Dark, Brooding and Stunning.","Batman Begins, the much hyped, much publicised 'reboot' of the Batman franchise is finally here and boy what a treat it is! I was a big fan of Tim Burton's take on Batman, his portrayal of the dark knight as a brooding and reluctant bringer of justice, I always felt fit perfectly with the imagery of the comic books and gave a great feel to the whole Batman mythology. The following outings of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, were less than splendid though. Over-blown campy nonsense with two-dimensional characters being upstaged by a campy over the top rouges-gallery of villains.So here is the re-boot. The beginning. Batman begins breaks from the convention of other comic book films. The first act of the film is told through flashbacks and does not follow a linear editing style. It gives a fantastic insight into Bruce Wayne's feelings towards his origins and his motivation for becoming the Dark Knight. It traces his path from young boy, to troubled young man; unable to vent the anger he feels for injustice he has suffered at the hand of the criminal element.Bruce Wayne attempts to confront his demons head on, but soon realises he is just one man in a corrupt and frightening world. The film takes us on the journey Bruce endures in trying to find what it is he needs to do to come to terms with his past and to guide his future. He travels the world and seeks out a means to better himself both mentally and physically. He trains with masters of martial arts, to learn the fighting skills and mental strength he will require to bring justice back to Gotham. This all provides the very convincing back-story of the transition from Bruce Wayne to Batman.Without giving too much of the plot away, Bruce travels back to Gotham and begins his quest for justice. It shows how he equips himself and the conflict he has within when dealing with the criminals of the city. It also shows what other Batman films have failed to show. The trouble of living a double life when you are a billionaire playboy. Bruce has to find balance between his public image as Batman and his public image as a rich, businessman and socialite.The film climaxes with an awesome final act, showcasing immense fight scenes, brilliant use of the new Batmobile, gorgeous sets and intense acting. The final scenes set the film up perfectly for any sequels and all the while maintains the sense of realism and down to earthiness that Nolan promised.Batman Begins is well written, well-shot and combines amazing special effects, set design and acting to form a perfect final package. This is without a shadow of a doubt, the best comic-book movie I have ever seen. Christian Bale puts in a sterling performance as Bruce Wayne, often reminiscent of his role as a businessman in American Psycho. He is also very convincing of a man driven to fight injustice, a man with a troubled past and a man seeking what he must do to come to terms with it. He is also entirely convincing as the all-action hero Batman, disposing of criminals with his expert martial arts training enthusiasm for justice.The supporting cast is perfect. Michael Caine is an inspired choice for Alfred. There is good chemistry between him and Bale and you are left convinced that they have a quasi-father/son relationship and that Alfred genuinely cares for his young master. Gary Oldman plays a brilliant Sgt Gordon, the last honest copy, torn between misguided loyalty to the force and an honest will to protect the innocent. Cillian Murphy plays a reserved, but entirely psychotic proto-super villain and Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, as always provide strong character roles. Holmes was a fine leading lady, but I couldn't help feeling she didn't really have enough to do in this film, however only a minor criticism.Batman Begins is a dark film, centred on strong themes of fear, over coming demons of your past and the fight for justice in a corrupt world. Unlike many comic book films, this film is not in anyway aimed at children. It is not strictly adult in nature, but follows intelligent character development, adult conflict and complex portrayals of the characters. Most comic book films introduce your hero as good because he wants to save the world and the villain bad because he wants to take over the world. Then the action begins. This is not the case with Batman Begins, it gives insight into each character's motivation and reasons for their actions, it does not expect the audience to blindly accept anything on face value.Well done to Goyer and Nolan for producing such an awesome movie. When I left the cinema, everyone in the audience was grinning at the end of the film, knowing they had just seen the beginning of something rather special. Bring on the sequels!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A great summer blockbuster ¬ñ dark, interesting, exciting and more than an antidote to Schumacher's childish vision of the character","Bruce Wayne is not a happy fella. Being trapped in a cave full of bats as a child left him full of fear, and he can only blame himself for the death of his parents at the hands of a typical street thug. However time has perverted this hurt into a bitter, hollow anger that has led him to the Far East where he fights criminals behind bars, seemingly to seek to quench his thirst for what he sees as ""justice"". Taken into a remote training facility for the League of Shadows by Ducard, Wayne learns the arts of deception, movement, combat and others but when he understands that justice is death for this group he leaves and returns to Gotham City. In his absence, the city has fallen into corruption and crime and, seeking a symbol of fear for the criminals, Wayne uses his skills and considerable assets to try and bring down this rule by way of a vigilante personae ¬ñ The Batman. However, with few allies in this fight, will he be able to counter more than the smaller fish in the pond?Although I don't agree with those IMDb users who have put this film into the top 250 ever made, I do see why they did it, because after the decreasing returns of the modern Batman films I was almost relieved that Begins made a massive leap away from the childish mess that Joel Schumacher had produced. Although not perfect, Nolan's Batman is dark where Schumacher's was day-glow; interesting where the other was puerile; exciting where the other was tiresome; this Wayne is a person where the other's was a child's action figure; this film almost stays in the real world where the other was set in some fantasy world that Schumacher must see when he shuts his eyes. So I can see why people love this film so much ¬ñ it is such a massive jump up in quality that it is easy to see it as the greatest film ever made; compared to Batman & Robin this IS Citizen Kane. The plot sounds silly at the start but the structure of flashbacks and desolate reality make you forget of the lack of logic (or even explanation) behind Wayne being in prison. From here the training is swift and exciting while more cuts give us the back-story we already know. Back in Gotham Batman truly begins and the build up is as good as the delivery ¬ñ he is not full of quips, in fact at first he is barely seen. While building the usual ""baddie with a big weapon"" story the film blends characters, other baddies, themes and action so naturally that it makes it look easy ¬ñ but Schumacher will assure you it is not.Nolan's direction and the design of the film are big reasons for it working; although the material is fantastic, somehow it all feels like the real world and not like B&R for example. It feels gritty and it makes the characters more real and therefore interesting. Also appreciated is the fact that it is not only dark in visuals but also content. Personally I would have liked Wayne to have been more twisted and confused but what it did was good enough, more important though was how scary bits were ¬ñ the Scarecrow, the paranoid visions, all combined to produce some dark images. Oh, and many thanks to the genius parents who saw this film advertised and thought ""hmm, a darker Batman film with a rating for over 12's ¬ñ I know, I'll take my 4 year old to see that""; needless to say several families in my screening will not be aware of the ending of the film ¬ñ who'd have though a 12A would frighten pre-school children? Tossers.The cast do well with what they have. Bale is a great Batman and I struggled to reconcile the man I saw with the man I saw a few months back in The Machinist. Although the script only gives him basic emotional building blocks and not a real inner struggle, Bale still does well with it and far from being the straightman to Batman's entertainer, his Wayne is the most interesting thing in the film. Neeson makes for a good trainer and his darkly interesting character does enough so that we accept the mythical body he represents. Holmes is OK, pretty good but really I could have coped without her character. Caine is a great choice for Albert and he seems to enjoy it. Freeman may have just followed the Alec Guinness model of taking the payday but he is also enjoyable Q to Bale's Bond (bet they wish their franchise had gotten him first). Murphy is interestingly creepy even before he becomes genuinely scary as his villain. Oldman does less than he is capable of but he is still a good addition ¬ñ ditto with Wilkinson.Overall this is not one of the best films ever made but it is a great summer movie and, more importantly, it is a massive improvement on the Batman that Schumacher gave us ¬ñ everything that it failed to do, this does well. A worthy blockbuster that is engaging, dark, exciting, scary and fun ¬ñ well worth seeing and probably one of the better blockbusters this year.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Better Batman,"I attended the 6:35 pm showing Wednesday (opening) night at a suburban multiplex in Minneapolis. It was a very sparse audience of mostly 50 to 60-year old men, some of whom had dates of equal vintage, which seemed like a very odd audience for this type of film. Perhaps it was the day and hour, but it certainly wasn't the audience I expected.Though better than the most recent ""Batmans,"" this visually impressive actioner fell a little short.In this prequel we learn how Batman came to be, starting with a nightmare. Stuck in an Asian prison at the base of a glacier encrusted peak, Batman-to-be Bruce Wayne awakes from a flashback of his childhood, where he fell down a well and was terrified by swarms of bats. Orphaned when a common thief kills both his parents, Bruce embarks on a personal journey for seven years. Inter-cut with his former cosseted life as the only child of a doctor mogul, is the quest of this current young man, living among criminals in order to understand how their minds work so that he may someday vanquish evil. Now imprisoned for some criminal act, he rather quickly frees himself, lured to the aerie of Ra's al Ghul.There he undergoes ninja training by Ducard (Liam Neeson) who spews aphorisms more akin to Steven Segal than the Dalai Lama. Much mumbo jumbo later, Bruce Wayne evolves into a skilled killing machine, only to reject the role of executioner of bad guys, and membership in the elite League of Shadows, the position for which he was groomed. He burns down al Ghuls house and returns to Gotham to fight evil on his own.Constructing his Batman persona and superstructure with the aid of his wise and loyal butler, Alfred (charmingly played by Michael Caine), Bruce Wayne becomes Bat-man because it symbolizes a fear he has conquered. As he reacquaints himself with Gotham he eventually finds that his father's company, its legacy chairman, most of the Gotham police, and Ra's al Ghul are all tied into the dirty workings of Gotham's king of corruption, Carmine Falcone. When Falcone has the man who murdered Wayne's parents killed to prevent him from testifying against Falcone, Bruce confronts him for fostering corruption. It is then Bruce quickly learns that insulting Falcone only puts those he loves, Alfred and his childhood girlfriend, Rachel, at risk. The conflicts between all parties are satisfactorily entangled in a heinous plot to destroy Gotham, and is then skillfully unraveled by Batman with truly impressive action sequences.But it only gets fun after a long 55 minutes into the film when Bruce finally gets a handle on himself. Until then the film is a bit tedious. But when the super toys roll out the basement of the Wayne corporate office building, the thrills are non-stop. Morgan Freeman plays a wonderful cameo as purveyor of cool technical gadgets, including one helluva Batmobile.Unfortunately, many of the bons mots of the film are lost to poor enunciation on Bale's part. While Caine, Neeson, Oldman, Freeman, Holmes and just about everyone else in the film speaks clearly, Bale lets the words sort of fall out of his mostly open mouth. Only after he dons the slick iconic body armor of Batman does Bale close his mouth and enunciate. Hard to believe the oral transformation was part of the movie's dramatization, but one can only hope.While most of the dialogue is workman-like, spare, and to the point, it becomes almost ludicrous when the characters presume to say something ""deep."" Most notable are when Neeson, early on, delivers his melodramatic utterances, and, toward the end when Holmes proffers the truly incomprehensible gibberish about the Batman person who she loved and might someday see again. On a more positive note, Holmes put in a genuinely adult dramatic performance, which suggests a successful transition from TV darling to serious big screen actress.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Exceptional,"Batman Begins is a very powerful and exciting movie, with a powerful message. It is among the most exciting and nerve-wracking movies I've seen.The story can be cut into three parts, but basically the first two are the build-up, which in my view is the only big negative part about this movie. The first part shows Bruce learning and evolving. The second part is about him preparing for the fight and learning how to live a life as two people. The third part is the payoff and it's absolutely perfect. It's a lot of action with some genuinely surprising twists. The movie shares the same message as Star Wars, which is not to seek vengeance and revenge, because it is the dark side. It's the easier way, while the true and the right way is the hard one, which Bruce follows.In the beginning of the movie there were a few I found the acting bad and the first fight sequences were very strangely edited, where I couldn't see what was happening. But these things evolved and the cinematography was great overall. Nothing was exceptional in the technical parts, there was nothing artistic about it, but it kept me locked in, which is the cause of exceptional work. The casting is perfect, there are so many amazing acting performances, my favourite being Michael Cane.Batman Begins is a truly amazing, fast-paced, exciting movie with a long build-up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great Story. Finally Batman backs.,"The movie is pretty great. Is quite brilliant how it explains the way Bruce wayne learned to fight and all the abilities Batman has, where and how learned the escaping techniques and all that stuffs. Its nice to see how he is becoming Batman, and acquires all the weapons the instruments and the bat suit. The bat mobile is quite impressive!! it is not a car, is a tank.....amazing. One of the other thing that really stand out are the characters. All of it has a very well defined paper, and the performance is spectacular. Michael Caine doing Alfred is really good. Christian Bale rolling Bruce Wayne is really good too, but what is most spectacular is that he gives Batman back that darkness he has lost in the last two horrible movies, Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Because that's what Batman is; is a Dark Hero. The only thing that didn't like me was that the person who killed the parents of Bruce wasn't the Jocker, so ins that way they didn't respect the original story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Finally Another ""Dark"" Batman Movie","Forget all that colorful, candy coated, over-the-top, comic book style trash that poisoned the last two Batman movies. Joel Schumacher should be embarrassed for creating Batman Forever and Batman & Robin which became the ultimate low for the character since his creation in 1939. This new film thankfully has nothing in common with those embarrassments. Batman Begins is a prequel to everything we have seen before. It takes us back to young Bruce Wayne as a boy. The film has a very dark, gritty feel to it. In fact, I found it hearkening back to Tim Burton's unique style found in the original Batman movie with The Joker and Batman Returns with The Penguin and Catwoman. If you liked those then you will love this new one. I think it is even better.Without ruining it for those who haven't seen it the new Batman Begins shows the transformation that took place from young Bruce Wayne to Batman. It truly recaptures what the original story about Batman was meant to be. You witness the initial training, the beginning of the bat-cave, the early gadgets, and of course crime fighting at its finest. All of this is carefully executed to keep your attention and entertain you without overloading you with special effects and other Hollywood tricks. I dare say it may be the best Batman film ever made. Sequels are on the way of course.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
*The Dawn of a Dark Legend*,"""Batman Begins,"" directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2005, serves as a revolutionary reboot of the Batman franchise, breathing new life into one of comic book history's most iconic characters. Anchored by a gripping narrative and a deep exploration of fear and identity, Nolan's vision sets a compelling foundation for the Dark Knight saga that follows.The film delves into the origins of Bruce Wayne, played masterfully by Christian Bale, charting his journey from a troubled heir to a symbol of hope for Gotham City. Through a series of transformative experiences, including his training with the League of Shadows and mentor Ra's al Ghul, Bruce grapples with his inner demons and the haunting memories of his childhood. Bale's performance encapsulates the raw vulnerability and intense determination required for such a multifaceted character.Nolan expertly weaves a storyline that resonates with audiences on both an emotional and philosophical level. The themes of fear, morality, and justice are recurrent throughout the film, inviting viewers to ponder the complexities of vigilante justice in a city plagued by corruption and crime. The realistic portrayal of Gotham, enhanced by gripping cinematography and atmospheric score, underscores the film's dark tone-an essential aspect of Batman's legend.The supporting cast, featuring standout performances from Michael Caine as the loyal Alfred and Liam Neeson as the enigmatic Ra's al Ghul, adds depth to the narrative, enriching Bruce's journey with pivotal relationships and philosophical debates. The dynamic between Wayne and his allies, including Commissioner Gordon, played by Gary Oldman, showcases a sense of camaraderie in their struggle against the criminal underbelly of Gotham.""Batman Begins"" heralds a new era for superhero films, prioritizing character development and storytelling over spectacle. By grounding Batman's mythos in a relatable world, Nolan sets the stage for future adventures while compellingly answering the question of what it truly means to be a hero. This film is not merely an origin story; it's a profound exploration of the darkness we confront in ourselves and the light we strive to protect. As the first chapter of a larger narrative, ""Batman Begins"" is a powerful and thought-provoking journey that resonates long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Captures the tone perfectly. A+,"Last night, I went to check out Batman Begins, and I only have one word for the tone of this film: perfect.Absolutey nailed. Blasted out the park. A grand slam.The folks responsible for this adaptation of the Dark Knight simply ""got it."" 100%.Batman is a persona that was created to inspire fear into the hearts of criminals. A creature of the night that hunts from the shadows, strikes without warning, and vanishes into the darkness like a nightmare. The character is never meant to be seen by the general public, he is merely meant to exist in their whispers, an urban myth that is talked about in hushed tones throughout Gotham City.Batman does not have a ""Bat Credit Card"", and he doesn't attend charity auctions or d√©butante balls. He doesn't drive around the city streets in the Batmobile in broad daylight, waving to cheering citizens. He doesn't have a ""Bat Phone"" that connects him to the commissioner. He doesn't wear a costume with rubber nipples or operate vehicles with spinning neon turbine engines and open cockpits. He doesn't crack jokes like, ""It's the car, right? Chicks dig the car."" All of these things are wrong, wrong, WRONG...and this movie understands that. It understands that and washes all of these injustices away until they are nothing more than a faded bad memory. Screenwriter David Goyer and director Christopher Nolan have given us a film that treats the character with respect; a loud, thrilling masterpiece that doesn't insult your intelligence or bombard you with inappropriate campy antics.Christian Bale gives us a Batman that will scare the living crap out of you. His voice is a gravelly, menacing sound, and when he yells at some poor schmuck to get some information, it's downright terrifying. He swoops out of darkened alleys, hitting fast and furious. He's brutal, cold, and calculating. In short, he's everything that anybody who ever put that cape and cowl on is not. Perfection.The villains are also amazing, but a huge part of their contributions to the overall brilliance of the film is their failure to dominate it. The previous Batman movies were plagued by these cackling idiots in ludicrous costumes who pushed Batman to the back burner. In Batman Begins, we finally get to spend some time with the hero, learning who he really is behind the mask.Not to imply that the villains are poorly fleshed out or inconsequential to the story - quite the opposite in fact. Cillian Murphy is a very effective Scarecrow, turning in a subdued, but intensely creepy performance as a warped psychiatrist who uses fear gas on his victims, unleashing horrifying hallucinations. Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) is a shadowy Tibetian criminal warlord named Ra's Al Ghul, who watches over young Bruce Wayne's training with Ducard, played by Liam Neeson. But things are not what they appear with this situation, and a shocking twist comes into play towards the climax. The rest of the cast is solid, especially Gary Oldman, who finally gives us a competent, intelligent James Gordon. Essentially, the movie is about fear. Confronting it, learning from it, using it, and conquering it. It's a dark, serious film that leaves little room for humor, but some sneaks through in the form of some witty exchanges between loyal butler Alfred (a brilliant Michael Caine), and Bruce Wayne.This movie is awesome and a complete triumph for DC, Warner Brothers, Nolan, and everyone else involved.. Run, don't walk, to the theater. Amazing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Very Good,"Batman Begins (2005)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Hooray, I finally enjoyed a Batman movie. Everything wrong with the previous four films is corrected here and since this movie got everything right I can now forget the first four films and just hope future sequels contain the same level of darkness, character and story development. What I enjoyed most about this film was that the characters were so well written and the Bruce Wayne character was given just as much strength as his Batman ego. I wasn't sure what to expect from Christian Bale but I'm glad the director kept his darkness and didn't try to lighten him up as an actor. The supporting players were also very well acted with a cast to die for. Liam Neeson, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are serious actors and they helped bring some seriousness to this comic book tale. It was also great seeing Gary Oldman playing a good guy. I always love rooting for his villains so rooting for him as a good guy just added more charm to the film. The only real weakness I found with the film was the poison gas, which just never really grabbed me as anything too interesting.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
tears...,"yup, this film made me cry. it really did. being a hardcore batman fan, i assume i know every little secret, history, background about the dark knight. i've waited 13 grueling years (discounting batman forever and batman & robin for reasons far too obvious) to see a decent BATMAN film. Not only is Batman Begins decent, it has got to be one of THE BEST FILM EVER! i watched the film on its last screening together with my friends in Alabang. after the movie, the entire theater was deserted and i just sat there, still trying to catch my breath. It is that damn good.Christian Bale plays the perfect Batman/Bruce Wayne. Charming, handsome, and ""rich,"" as Wayne. Terrifying, maniacal, sadistic, and blacker than black as Batman. ""It's not who i am underneath, but what i do that defines me."" Michael Caine as Alfred, humorous, he is the rock of the Batman family. Almost always, the exchange between Bale and Caine where Christian tells him ""You still haven't given up on me, have you?"" Caine answers ""Nevah."" Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. Quite different from the character in the real Batman mythology (which for me is the comic books), but important nonetheless. He's told in the film as the one who supplies Bruce with all of his ""spilunking"" stuff. :) Morgan plays it brilliantly, from his face in the Tumbler while Bruce is driving, to his deadpan humor near the ending of the film. ""Didn't you get the memo?"" That got one of the biggest laughs in the theater.Liam Neeson, Liam Neeson. Awesome! As Henri Ducard and the real Ra's Al Ghul, he was cold, beyond reason. Cold, bad-ass in a great way. Esp. the scenes where he and Bruce were in their ninja suits playing a game of ""hide-and-seek"" with all those ninjas. Some of the best lines came from Neeson's Ducard character. ""Are you ready to begin? Katie Holmes. She's actually the ""weakest"" link as far as all reviewers or critics are concerned, but for a fan, well, she actually is. Not weak, but pretty much, the film could have gone without her. Having her die at the end of the movie would have made an even better way to start the Begins sequel given Batman's occasional experiences with deaths that he feels responsible for. (i.e. the drowned girl in the VENOM series, Jason Todd) But she does put some nice boy meets girl syndrome during the early years of Bruce. (Oh, speaking of history, Bruce Wayne did NOT finish college nor did he finish in Princeton) And, imho, the end scenes where she and Bruce kissed was ABSOLUTELY YUCKY! i dunno, but for me, it was totally unnecessary but seeing as how the protagonist and the girl should kiss even once in a movie scheme held up, well, there ya go. ""You better run!"" Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow actually should have gotten more screen time. He was really scary even in his ""doctor"" mode. the first time we get to see the mask during his talk with Falcone, awesome. We really got to see the extent of how this lean, geeky fellow could actually become one of Batman's worst enemies. Ken Watanabe, very limited screen time. Doggone good nonetheless.and who could forget...Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. ""I have to get me one of those."" Damn right. ""I think you're trying to help."" Can't wait for the next Batman sequel just for the fact that i'd love to see more of Jim Gordon's interaction with the Batman.Overall, this movie gets a perfect 10 out of 5 stars :) This movie has it all. Great plot, dialogue, action, and an array of Oscar caliber actors, definitely, Batman renaissance has begun. Batman Begins.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I am amazed that I liked it...,"I hated ""Daredevil"". I didn't like either ""Spider-Man"". The ""X-Men"" movies were mediocre. I can't say that I remember the ""Superman"" movies fondly. The 1989 ""Batman"" was dull. I hated all the ""Batman"" sequels. ""Catwoman"" was abysmal.In fact, by my definition, a superhero movie usually equates to a moronic, silly and childish piece of crap designed specifically to make tons of money with merchandising and Burger King tie-ins.I hate them. I hate them. I hate them.In fact, I resent the genre for angling the entire medium of film toward a younger demographic. Every major release in this day and age seems to appeal at least somewhat to kids in order to capture the massive dollar amount that they generate. I say... ""Fuck the kids""! This is an adult world. They can have it later. That's why I almost always appreciate a film that ignores the 13-25 year-old demographic and delivers a literate and intellectual story about adults and for adults.Okay, that rant is over for now...In fact, the only superhero film I even remotely liked was ""The Hulk"". Not surprisingly, it was the one superhero film that didn't do too well with the younger demographic. It was arguably the least financially successful superhero film in the last 20 years. (Not counting the joke that was ""Catwoman"").So, I finally arrive at ""Batman Begins"", a film I presumed would follow the trend of silliness evident in all the other movies of this ilk.I actually liked it?????? What the hell??????With movies like this, so popular and so familiar, I usually dispense with the plot summary. So I will delve right into the opinions...I loved the look of this film. It maintained the slightly somber feel that accompanies the Batman saga, but it wasn't afraid to venture into daylight from time to time. Heck the first third of the film takes place in the snowy mountains of somewhere or another... I wasn't paying attention.My biggest gripe with comic book films is the lunacy of the plots. I usually cannot suspend my disbelief at all. However, ""Batman Begins"" had me from the get -go. I was buying the story... it didn't seem ridiculous to me. SHOCKING!!!Another thing that surprised me was that the villains weren't absolutely ludicrous. Comic book villains are usually so dumb and over-the-top that I lose all sense of belief. Here, they are relatively subdued... I liked that a lot.The only problem I had with the film was the insanely stupid 'Batman Voice' that Bale chose to use. What the hell was that all about? Very silly indeed!The acting was rather impressive all around... Especially from the supporting cast. Only Katie Holmes left me wanting for more. She was rather dull. I liked the turns by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman... they brought some added weight to the film. Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy were both solid as the bad guys. And apart from Bale's silly voice, he was a very good Batman... his face carries the emotional weight of the character and doesn't let the character venture too far into camp territory.I will say this though... Superhero movies by their very nature are not capable of a grade in the A-range. It would have to be tremendous just to merit a B+ from me. The silliness of a man bouncing around in a spandex suit with pointy ears just will not allow me to go any higher. But ""Batman Begins"" was about as good as I could have imagined from a film in this genre. I teetered between a B and a B+... but because of the pleasant surprise, I am going to reward it with a B+. ""Batman Begins"" is the best in it's genre because it isn't too silly It isn't too campy. It isn't too childish. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It strikes the right balance. It is geared to a slightly older audience than your typical popcorn flick. I had a really good time with this one!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Hypocrisy Of The Fanbase Begins,"Let's get this out of the way first. Joker didn't kill Batman's parents and Ra's al Ghul never trained Batman, nor is he a white Irishman.I couldn't care less how accurate a movie is to the comics, if it can stand on its own merits. Being accurate doesn't automatically make it good and vice versa. Batman fanboys are a finicky bunch, they conveniently forget about ""muh source material"" if they get validated that they're not watching ""kiddy stuff"". If they consider a movie ""mature"", any shortcomings will be ignored. For all the talk how ""grounded"", ""realistic"" and ""mature"" this movie is, it has a lot of silly and pretentious dialogue.Some questionable performances. Bale's Batman is more funny than threatening. The less said about Katie Holmes and Tom Wilkinson's Bugsy Malone take on Falcone the better. First hour, with Bruce is training, is solid. After he returns to Gotham, the movie takes a nosedive into a cartoonish farce. And then there are the fight scenes. Incomprehensible, Transformers-esque ""What am I even looking at?"" mess.Plot is straight out of some Z-grade movie, complete with secret society trying to destroy a city with a stupid doomsday machine. Water vaporizer? Really? That's the best Nolan and Goyer can come up with?Highly overrated.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The start of something truly spectacular.,"This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed, if it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere truly spectacular.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Simply The Best Comic Book Adaptation Ever,"Being a fan of Nolan's previous work, I went into this with high expectations, and yet somehow, my expectations were surpassed. My congratulations to the entire cast and crew for making such a phenomenal film.It all begins with the story. Nolan and Goyer didn't just adapt from the comic book, they re- imagined and re-invented Batman and his world while staying true to it. I might even say what they did was in some ways better than the comic book. Things in the comic book that would probably seem preposterous in a live action film are brought to life in an intelligent way, like the reason for the costume, and the reason for the villains and their costumes. I won't go too much into the story, because I think it's best for people to go into this film knowing as little as possible.Christian Bale IS Bruce Wayne, and IS Batman. It will be hard to ever see someone else play the role. The look on his face when Joe Chill walks out of the courtroom... That demonic voice he gives Batman... The way he tries to hide his pain when he's told that ""the apple has fallen far from the tree""... an incredible performance. The rest of the cast is fantastic too, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman dishing out some great humor.And the film looks great. Gotham actually looks like a real city (with nods to Blade Runner), the lighting is nice and contrasty, and Batman is believable as a flesh and blood character. Even the flying scenes are handled nicely. It's hard to talk about this film without giving things away. If you haven't seen it, please see do. You won't be disappointed. I'd like to thank Warner Brothers for letting an intelligent and talented filmmaker make this film without much interference. Please make more like this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman whips out his bat-balls!,"Well, it's official. Batman has gotten his balls back. This film is dark, extremely dark. So dark in fact, there are a great number of scenes filmed, I kid you not, exactly like a horror film. Now, I'm a huge fan of the ""real"" Batman movies. You know, ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" which were done by Tim Burton, starred Michael Keaton, and were carried along by Danny Elfman's rousing musical score. Let's not forget, that old Batmobile from those films. This tank-like monstrous new Batmobile may very well be the coolest car I've personally seen in a movie in ages. Of course, if you're a fan of those rather putrid, embarrassing ""other"" Batman films (Forever & Robin), then you may very well not like this movie. Because it doesn't totally suck like those films did.Basically, this is the story of how Bruce Wayne thought of, created and became Batman. In a nutshell. However, it also tells, in the most personal way, of his struggles with the concepts of justice and vengeance. It shows us how he trained to become the ultimate fighter of evil and corruption. It introduces us to a different villain from the previous four films¬óand does a mighty good job of it, too. Even as a side note¬ówe're introduced to good old Commissioner Gordon¬óbefore he's police commissioner. So then, it also tells a bit of his ""beginnings."" We see the beginning of the Batcave and find out just how Bruce Wayne was able to, to quote the Joker, ""¬Öget those wonderful toys."" On top of it all, if you ever thought Michael Keaton was the only person who could adequately, correctly portray Batman on screen, you just may change your mind here¬óI never imagined Christian Bale would do such a remarkable job.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--The action is fast and brilliantly choreographed.--The dark mood is finally back¬óthe way Batman is supposed to be¬óit has even less ""camp"" value than Burton's films!--The Batmobile, as I said, is incredible¬óand has some great sound effects to boot. Supposedly, it was designed by the same person who created Keaton's Batmobile.--Christian Bale is so good, he almost causes you to forget about Kilmer and Clooney¬óthank god!--Michael Caine's powerful performances¬óhe's the major player keeping Bruce Wayne's humanity in check. More so than Katie Holmes, whose performance, while good, was a tad weaker than Caine's in this respect. She did an interestingly good job as a tough lawyer, however.--Bits of comic relief here and there¬óthat don't ruin the movie!--Brilliant atmosphere.--Excellent acting all around.--Not claustrophobically over-crammed with ""Batman"" villains like the last two films. The only major villain is the Scarecrow, and another character whom I'll leave up to you other movie goers find out.--Excellent tension.--Fantastic cinematography.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The music is good, but for those of you out there like me¬óyou may miss Danny Elfman's beautiful score.--Gotham City is not as Gothic as it should be. However, the film has slightly more modern twist that makes it more ""believable"" than the previous films. Especially those last two, which, if you haven't guessed it by now, I hated.--Early on, the story deals a lot with flashback sequences¬óa couple are a bit confusing as to where they belong chronologically. They may have indeed been chronological, but only seemed like a steady story with flashbacks. Still, it gets the point across.--The film seems to be set-up as either a new Batman series, or a prequel to Tim Burton's original Batman. I guess I'd be happy with either¬óso long as they keep Christian Bale and don't sell out to that campy crap again.The Bad:--Scarecrow seems a bit underused.--We had to endure ""Batman Forever"" before we got to this brilliant piece.The Ugly:--We also had to endure ""Batman & Robin"" before we got to this.

A Legend Re-Born,"Two Words: Batman Begins.The Batman franchise has been resurrected and it is better than ever. I can't stress enough on how good this movie is. Christopher Nolan directed (and co-wrote) a darker Batman that is portrayed perfectly by Christian Bale. A new youth and energy has been drawn out of the Batman legend and displayed perfectly. All of the performances in this movie are stellar, and each one does not seem out of place or pointless. The music keeps your blood pumping with the action and never lets up. And speaking of the action, you haven't seen anything until you see the Batmobile in motion. This thing is mint. I honestly wish that I could write something a lot better about this movie and go into great lengths of describing each piece of this glorious pie; but in all honesty, I will simply ruin the movies for others. I am not one to keep secrets. So please end my torment and go watch this movie. Then I will have people to talk to about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
All about Bale.,"This movie is truly inspiring to us Batman fans out there. It's hard to believe that Christian Bale once weighed 130 lbs for one role and then shot up to 220 lbs, before trimming down to 190 lbs for Batman. This man is truly devoted to his work and it shows. Just look at certain interviews about how he portrays the character Bruce Wayne. It's almost as if Christian Bale does research and takes notes on Batman before he starts acting the part out. He makes all the right moves because he surrounds himself with a great group of actors. We can all relate to Bruce Wayne's character in some way and this is where we can thank Bale. Who else could've done it better? BATMAN IS BACK THANKS TO Christian BALE! I just hope the best is yet to come and he sticks with this role.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good Beginning...,"To start... I am not a comic book reader and thus will not be making any comment on the history or development of Batman based on the comics. I am purely a fan of the character based off the Tim Burton Films and the old Adam West series that I enjoyed as a child, and the animated series.As the title suggests this is only the beginning. As I am sure Warner Bros. is expecting this to be a hit the movie, it establishes the back-story of the Dark Knight in great detail. I enjoyed the film immensely. If I had to find fault with the movie it would be that I felt the editing was a bit muddled during some of the action sequences, thus making it harder for the viewer to follow the events. I thought the casting was well done and that each of actors talents and personalities fit the character each was portraying.Perfect popcorn eating summer flick.....",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the Best of Batman series so far produced !,"The movie viewed in Imax screen gives one an unforgettable feeling. The visuals are excellently prepared, locations are out of this world and overall an excellent cinematic experience.The movie surpasses all the previous Batman movies so far produced.The movie has a very faithful story line, may be a little deviation from the comic but nevertheless a very good take off on the original. The screen play has been excellently written and picturised very near to natural surroundings of the magnificent Gotham city.The technological excellence & technical effects are something to be seen to be believed. The Batman suit designed, the way he glides using parachute techs and other gadgets , ammunition and the Batmobile used are all very well brought out convincingly.This Batman movie is really an outstanding piece of cenema, leaving one & all in a great feeling of watching one of the magnificent work, ever produced so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Excellent revamping, surpasses the other installments","I wasn't extremely thrilled with Return of the Sith, and so I went to see this film hoping to get a little more for my dollar since the trailer made it look pretty decent. I've got to say, it was pretty slick. Gone is the ridiculous plot and corny humor of the past installments. This movie has a more serious storyline than its predecessors, explaining the origin and training of the Dark Knight to-be and then delivering butt-kicking goodness. High points are the nearly believable explanations of Wayne's acquisition of technology (suit, gear, ride), the edgy cinematography with abrupt, mid-conversation scene changes, and excellent supporting acting by Neeson, Cain, Oldman, and Murphy. I'd say the low points are the rushed nature of Batman's coming of age, but I guess that's understandable given the necessity for Batman vs. Gotham time the already long duration of over 2 hours. And sorry, but I'm not going to say anything nice for Ms. Holmes because I never was a big fan of hers and I'm already sick of the media fiasco over her and Tom Cruise. Anyway, if you want a Batman movie that isn't as over the top as the last ones and is as believable as possible, this is the movie for you. I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being the top critically acclaimed action flick of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins is a masterpiece!,"Chris Nolan's 2005 Cult Hit 'Batman Begins' is one of my all-time favorite films. A fantastic film in all aspects! Nolan presents Batman like never before, he justifies everything and that too in the most interesting manner. I've seen this flick at least, 5-6 times and I keep loving it more and more and more. A winner all the way!Pluses: Each and everything. Astounding direction, yummy screenplay, crisp editing, first-rate camera-work and skilled performances: Bale is outstanding as Batman. He plays Bruce Wayne also with complete ease. Liam Nesson is fantastic. Gary Oldman is outstanding. Morgan Freeman is effortless. Katie Holmes is good, ditto for Murphy. Tom Wilkinson is superb.Minuses: Nothing.On the whole, 'Batman Begins' is cinema at its very best. A true masterpiece! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
My New Favorite Movie of All-Time,"Christian Bale is superb in this film, directed by Christopher Nolan. This is the best heroic movie ever produced, and it sets the stage to become the most phenomenal production the world will ever see.Additionally, Christian Bale is the best Bruce Wayne, and Batman I have ever seen on film. Although Michael Keaton was good, Bale exceeds his performance, and excels in this film with epic features and excellency in all aspects of heroism.I highly recommend this film to all, as it may be the best movie ever produced, in my opinion. Furthermore, Michael Caine is a wonderful supporting actor, and he makes ""Alfred"" impossibly believable during the film. He provides character to the Wayne family. Lastly, Katie Holmes makes a great appearance in this film, and has a strong character who tries to fight the impossible growing criminal society of Gotham City.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Bat is Back,"Over the years the Gotham City that was once a dark place lined with evil and corruption, in desperate need of a hero, deteriorated into a circus tent of Hollywood displays with over-dramatic architecture and special effects... Where criminals dance around in blacklight sensitive face paint and so-called villains compete for best comedic performance. Behind all the bright lights and all-star celebrity casting, we lost grasp of what the saga is really about: Batman.Batman Begins opens with Bruce Wayne's discovery as a little boy of an underground cave where he is traumatized by an attack of massive waves of thousands of hideous bats. From this incident came an instilled fear that will forever torment Bruce Wayne. After the death of his parents, a deep hatred towards crime grows more and more until Bruce decides to vanish from Gotham City. He learns the skills of an ancient vigilante ninja organization, developing not only the skills of martial arts but most importantly the mastery of fear- skills that will ultimately be the best weapons in facing the evils that will reach Gotham City and to avenge the death of his beloved parents.Batman Begins restores the integrity of the Batman saga and goes into an even deeper conflict... his constant struggle with fear and his deep hatred towards everything evil. What the other Batman movies lightly touched on, Batman Begins tells vividly. Why a billionaire would devote his life to fighting evil. Where he gets all his nifty convenient gadgets. Why Bruce Wayne can take on 30 armed guys all on his own and without a gun. And finally why he dresses up as a bat... after all ""A guy who dresses up as a bat... clearly has issues."" And Batman does and should have issues, especially after witnessing first hand the death of his loving parents, deaths that he feels partly responsible for. The other movies didn't emphasize enough the true anger Bruce Wayne has towards those that commit to a life of evil, but in this movie, Batman, effectively played by Christian Bale, is clearly depicted as a man anxious to release his anger and frustration to avenge the death of his parents.Evil is definitely present in this movie. Where the villains in previous Batman movies seem like decent people to hang out with, or in Poison Ivy's case make out with, the enemies in this movie know there is a job to be done and that there is no time to be funny- not to belittle Jack Nicholson's role of the Joker, who has a right to be funny. The depiction of the Scarecrow was amazing, possessing an evil presence unlike any other Batman villain.As much as I loved Tim Burton's work, and Michael Keaton's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman, I'd have to say that the direction of Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale as Batman put together the best Batman movie ever made. Besides Christian Bale, the casting was impressive. Alfred, played by Michael Caine and Fox, played by Morgan Freeman, are both characters you'll be glad to have alongside Bruce Wayne.It really is refreshing to see Batman and to finally learn after decades who he really is. A Batman who is angry and troubled and there to kick some ass not just for show but with a passion. Now the legend can live on with dignity and generations from now on can see the true man behind the bat... not just some heartthrob in tight pants.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best film  of 2005 so far,"The best film I have seen so far in 2005. It had everything, action and a little romance. but not enough to distract you from the main story line. Forget all the Batman films of the past and look to the future. Batman is back, bigger and better. The stunts are great, and add to the plot instead of being the hole story. And for once the supporting actors don't let you down. They actually boosted the story and helped to keep the plot moving in the right direction. Unlike those in the Btman films of the past. When Batman Begins comes out on DVD in October I will be buying the 2 disc set and I hope you will too. When the next Batman film hits the big screen I will be the first in line to see it, and being a woman that must mean a great deal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman truly does Begin....and hopefully will continue....,"I can honestly say that I am one of the biggest Batman fans around. I've been a fan my whole life. I've read the graphic novels, own collectibles, toys, etc. I am a fan-boy. Plain and simple. I could not wait for this movie to come out. 8 years since, ""Batman and Robin"" a.k.a ""A Death in The Family"" 2 years since it was announced and the anticipation was killing me. This move was just everything I could of hoped for. I saw it last night and It just hasn't hit me. I think one of the reasons a lot of people are Batman fans is he is a character we can in someway relate to. He's human, he makes mistakes, he has fears and secrets and goals. The way he is portrayed on screen has all of those items and then some. Christian Bale's performance is quite simply amazing. He gets great material to work with and he covers the 3 sides to Bruce Wayne with great transition and believability that it makes him the best on screen Bruce/Batman yet. He's read the graphic novels and the man just gets it. What also helps make this movie more believable is the seriousness of the incredible actors he is surrounded by who don't get full of themselves. Freeman, Caine, Oldman, Neeson, Hauer, Murphy and Watanabe all believe in this movie. Freeman is as always, awesome in his role as Lucius Fox explaining all of the gadgetry and sharing stories with Bruce. The gadgets are also explained really well. No-more wondering what magazine order form he filled out for his grappling hook and other items. Caine and Oldman give performances that are worthy of many fan-boys praise. They take there characters and run with them and it is exactly how it is represented in the comics. Holmes did a decent job in her role and is there not for eye candy, but to show us a little more into Bruce's head and how he deals with feelings. Neeson plays against the grain in his role as Ducard and does some good stuff with an almost unrecognized character from the comics. Hauer, Watanabe, and Murphy have minimal but important roles and really do a good job with what's given to them and have fun while playing it serious. Nolan also needs to be commended for going all in on something he believed in from the get go. He had his image of a Batman movie in his head and took it to Warner Brothers and they backed him up 110%. Taking examples from the different graphic novels and combining them to basically create a city all his own. He also brought out the best in each actor you see on screen. Goyer wrote a great script. He knew what the fans wanted and as a fan-boy himself, he delivered. The fight scenes were tight and well done and the style brutal. The fact they didn't use a lot of CGI made me enjoy it more because it added to the realism that is nowadays missing from movies that are loaded with CGI effects. The sound is simply out of this world. The sound of The Batmobile when it is first shown is something I cannot explain unless you hear it yourself. The editing and cinematography is excellent because it incorporates new techniques with old ones. This movie still has me thinking and I like that. I like going to movies and leaving just unable to think about anything else except what just happened on the screen and where it is going to go. The inevitable sequels have big shoes to fill. The end will leave you drooling over the possibilities of what's to come. This is one of if not the best superhero movie ever put on film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Overrated? Not a chance! This is excellent!!,"And so the story begins. Well, according to 'Batman Begins' anyway. This is a very long film, but if offers a detailed account of Bruce Wayne's life, and for the first time in the franchise we really get to know the character. We know where he comes from, what motivates him, and understand why he becomes Batman. Bruce becoming Batman is shown in detail, and I enjoyed that.Despite being fantasy, the clever storytelling makes it feel realistic. I liked the idea that Bruce failed on numerous accounts. This showed that - behind the mask and cape - he was still just human, and not an actual superhero with powers. He is vulnerable, he hurts, he falls, and picks himself up again. None of the other Batman films so effectively illustrated the character as a human being. Bruce overcoming his fear is also well done.'Batman Begins' is visually stunning, with a great production design, and incredible action sequences. As with all the other Batman movies, there are more than one antagonist. The first antagonist is crime lord Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). He is then dethroned by antagonist Crane (Cillian Murphy), who - in my opinion - is the film's main antagonist. Then we also have Ducard (Liam Neeson), and even Earle (Rutger Hauer) turns out to be a villain. Too many antagonists for one film? Surprisingly, here, it works well.Batman must stop Crane, who dumps toxins into Gotham City's water supply, and Ducard, who wants to destroy Gotham City. The result is an action-packed thriller that delivers! The film also features a great score by Hans Zimmer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"The tale of how Bruce Wayne faced his fears, self doubts and loss of parents to become the immortal legend and crime fighting force called Batman.","Best Batman. Most rewarding overall cast. Most dutiful to comic. Rich subtext to true fans. About intellect and character over flash and disrespect to depth. Quick motion camera is meant to make you think, as film is Psychology and Action combined. Batman brings fear to criminals, and the dread of disorientation is what makes him such a compelling mystery. Burton's was great but this is a truer Batman and it is only going to get better from here. Its like the Atlas shrugged Batman, all about competence over fatalism and decay. Fantastic. The cast was dynamic and the pacing was great if you are smart enough to not need padding and ham fisted plot devices or short cuts.

Buts SpiderMan to shame....,"After being disillusioned by just about every comic book ""blockbuster"" of recent times, Batman Begins comes as a nice surprise. The film draws a lot of visual inspiration from Blade Runner and looks all the more impressive for it. The storytelling is done at a decent pace, giving each stage just enough time to have an impact before moving on. On the acting front Michael Cane as Alfred steals the show serving as the comic relief. Katie Holmes is a bit disappointing but her role is largely forgettable. Christian Bale does an excellent job of re-imagining Bruce Wayne, even if he doesn't look quite right with the mask on. Just goes to show, with this and Sin City looks like Hollywood can do Comic Books.....",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Perfect in every way,"Having seen the screening and witnessing how on the mark this movie is, I will be recommending it to anyone who has an interest in Batman. Everything from plot to writing to acting to music is bang on. It was great to see Gary Oldman play a good character instead of an evil one. Any movie that has Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and Gary Oldman is something to see. Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne as he shows how his character came to be. The music is done by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, creating an excellent mix of emotional and action scoring. Finally, any worries about Christopher Nolan doing an action/adventure are wiped away. Go see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Rebirth Of A Legend - The greatest reboot of an origin story!,"Batman Begins (2005) is actually great reboot of The Dark Knight trilogy and a start of the origin tale of Batman, but is not the best one in the series, that will be The Dark Knight (2008). Batman Begins is strayed from the comic books. My DC comic super hero on a 1st rank will always be Batman I always love Batman from comic books, cartoons and movies more than other superheroes. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it because I thought, it was boring and I didn't got the story. I grew up with Batman (1989) Michael Keaton and I did too loved much more than this one. But than I kept watching and watching it and I fall in love it, It always entertained me. In my opinion Christopher Nolan's and Burton's Batman are all great movies.If it weren't for its amazing sequel this would be the greatest superhero film ever made. The film that started it all... a Batman film but with a more realistic, gritty and original approach. If your a fan of Batman and you haven't seen this you are going to LOVE every minute. It is smart, innovative, awe-inspiring and for a bat-fan, iconic. Christopher Nolan focuses on the origin and story behind a man standing against justice rather than the quirky early attempts. Its just a shame that this isn't as popular as The Dark Knight because it deserves the glory just as much. If your new and you've only just seen TDK, watch this purely because it catapulted this reinvention of a hero to great heights. TDK has the rise of The Clown Prince Of Crime and the escallation that was inevitable. Batman Begins has the creation of Batman and the lengths of which he had to go in order to combat injustice in a city that did not know justice. Watch this, it is a classic.What I like in Batman Begins is the origin story. I like that the movie focus on a comic book movie sadly Burton Batman doesn't follow on Batman origin story but follows more Joker story and I didn't pay for this movie to see Katie Holmes but naked and to be laid I am glad he didn't do that don't get me wrong but I don't like action hero's that always, always get a girl at the end of the movie and get laid I hate that! I am glad this was the beginning of Batman and the film took a different turn. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) did not get laid or get the girl once. I love this movie and I am true Batman fan I always was more Batman fan than a Superman fan. Bruce Wayne being trained and been ninja the long path how he become Batman the fighting the suit the climbing the wall. Car chases, action sequences are awesome!The actors: Christian Bale is an excellent darker Batman. He acted perfectly his role as Bruce and Batman the same time. I love Liam Neeson I think that actor did a wonderful convincing performance as Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul. He deserve a credit for his role that this movie redeem it self. Liam Neeson was terrific awesome convincing actor. This role was one of the reason why I become Liam Neeson fan and I enjoy his new action thrillers: Taken, Walk Among the Tombstones , Non-Stop, Taken 2 and Unknown. Rutger Hauer was awesome did you know he had a small role in comic book series Smallville? He was in Season 3 Episode 1 & 2. Cillian Murphy was great as Scarecrow! I love him and Tom Wilkinson was awesome too! Gary Oldman was amazing as Jim Gordon.Things I don't like in this movie:Batman Begins was really slow, the first hour of the movie was boring and really dramatic. The fighting sequence in this movie were shot to close with camera so we barely see a any fights between Batman and Ra's Al Ghul. Bruce Wayne blamed him self for his parents death. It wasn't his fault! The murder of his parents was too much dramatic too much for my eyes and Katie Holmes sadly I don't like her in this movie I would replace her with Maggie Gyllenhall or any other actress. I thought Maggie portrayed Rachel Dawes much better and made a better job in the sequel than Katie Holmes did. The fight between Batman and Ras' Al Ghul on a train I don't like it. Because the fight scene is too close, you can barely see who hit's who. That is the thing, that bothers me the most in this movie. The fight scenes in Burton's Batman are so much better, awesome than in Christopher Nolan's Batman and he could have made the fights scenes believable like Burton did.

The script,is excellent.It showed us cleverly Bruce's childhood (through nightmares,or memories and stuff),yet the dialogs are awesome,full of emotions and pretty smart if u ask me. Acting was superb,especially Bale deifies his role as batman.You see thats the true face of batman.Scary and rough mostly.

Decent but 20 minutes too long,"Finally, a Batman that didn't suck.It explains a bunch of things that troubled me about Batman. First, why the heck does this nutty guy dress up in a bat suit in the first place? The explanation is given, and it works. Good job, fellas.I liked the training part where Batman gets his skills and his philosophy.And the back-story about his family being killed is very good. I was into the movie the whole way at this point.Now for the bad. The action sequences were poorly edited and went on too long. The car chase bored me to tears by the end. It should be cut in half. Then the editing. It's so hyper-fast and shaky that you can't mentally figure what you're watching. It's like they didn't have the right footage, so they just flashed up everything so fast that we don't notice it. It's jarring and doesn't make for a good sequence. Check out the fight scenes at the end to get a feel for what I'm saying.I was ahead of the story, which is never good. As soon as I saw them pouring the poison into the pipe, I knew where it was going - a full 20 minutes before the characters did. That's not a good thing.Lastly, the movie was 20 minutes too long. I checked my watch 3 times by the end.PS - the logic of the villains was absurd. They hate crime and criminals, so they decide to kill a whole city instead of focusing on the criminals themselves? What? Sorry, but the absurdity of it bothers me.All in all, the best Batman flick to date, which considering how bad all of them were, isn't that impressive.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Delightfully Dark,"Director Christopher Nolan pulls out all the stops as he embarks on solidifying Batman lore with his retelling of how one Bruce Wayne became the capped crusader Batman. Nolan dazzles in many scenes and is always rock solid, never resorting to cheap humor or unnecessary special effects. This Batman is a dark tale that explains why Batman is the person he is, why he became the person he was to be, and what lies ahead. Christian Bales does a credible job in the lead. He is surrounded by first-rate performers lending their experience and acting savvy: Michael Caine as Alfred(very, very good), Morgan Freeman as Luscious(very, very good), Gary Oldman as policeman Gordon(very good) and villains Liam Neeson(very good), the ever impressive Tom Wilkinson(excellent), and Cillian Murphy(very good). Rutger Hauer is also along as is Katie Holmes(big deal huh?) I really enjoyed this film and was impressed with its cohesiveness and strong script. The script, the direction, the acting, the sets, and the special effects all blend together and make a fine film and probably the definitive Batman film to date. I know many people will compare this to the two Burton films - both good films in their own way. But this Batman is not that Batman. There are no one-liners here and there mixed in with an occasional over-blown scene. This film is a very serious take on a very serious man that has devoted his life to stopping crime in Gotham.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I had basically forgotten there was a time Batman movies were great!,"This is the movie The Hulk wanted to be, and failed miserably - the story of the man that turned himself into a legend. While Hulk failed on every conceivable level, though, this ""Batman"" succeeds.Although comparing Burton's Batman to this one is an exercise in tedium (both are great movies, although they satisfy different types of moviegoers), it may be enough to say that, while Keaton portrays Burton's Batman, Christian Bale is the comic book superhero. Keaton has an edge while showing off Bruce Wayne's strange and weird attitude, while Bale is absolutely amazing while depicting Batman as a man, driven by rage and hatred, who is willing to die to find inner peace.The only weakness I could see was Gotham city. Burton's vision of a future / past Metropolis is unsurpassed - his dark, menacing city is oppressive and hopeless. The new city can't approach the old one's power.Strangely enough, I found the actual ""Batman"" scenes not as satisfying as the whole Bruce Wayne transformation sequence. And the new Batmobile looks as if Batman has gone SUV-crazy - not a good thing (at least to me). Who cares - this is the Batman we thought we had lost ever since Keaton abandoned his mask.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"a spectacular re-invention of the series, 2nd (or perhaps as good as) Burton's 89 vision","It's always a challenge to take material from the comic to the screen, and to make it powerful enough, and entertaining enough, without getting overly preachy with the material, getting hyper kinetic with the action, or worst of all losing your audience. The last Batman film, Batman & Robin, committed the later crime, and put a stigma on the franchise for several years. But now there is Christopher Nolan, talented director behind the cult favorite Memento, and the under-rated Insomnia remake of 2002, who has taken the origins of the Dark Knight into a different direction, or at least to a better one. His film, Batman Begins, has the power, has the entertainment, and it doesn't cheat its target audience (the die-hard Batman fans) or the general public. There isn't as much humor as the first film (this film's only tiny liability), but there is that genuine dark sensibility that can take in kids as well as adults. That the story and characters are as important as the action sequences and fights is another bonus.The cast Nolan has put together is no less better than expected. Christian Bale is, arguably, a more compelling Bruce Wayne/Batman than Michael Keaton, or at the least he tries to put some feeling into his performance in ways that either Keaton didn't do or just in a different way. Since Nolan has license to reinvent the series, he changes around certain elements with Batman's origin (that I will not reveal here), and it brings about some changes in the line-up. Michael Caine is a good butler Alfred; Morgan Freeman is dependable as always as Batman's supplier; Gary Oldman this time is Gordon; and Nolan is also wise in not only Bruce's quasi-love interest (played by Katie Holmes, not too bad), but also in character actors like Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane. And there's also Liam Neeson, in an unlikely (though maybe familiar- Star Wars/Kingdom of Heaven?) mentor for Wayne to form his alter-ego.Simply this- Batman Begins works because as a summer popcorn action blockbuster, it's definitely not too dumb or tire-bound in clich√©s (not that there aren't a few, which is a given), and it keeps enough adrenaline and surprises with the action/set pieces. The classic, Gothic look of Burton's films is gone for the most part, but what's replaced by Nolan is often creepy and urban (if at least a consistent color of browns), which gives Gotham a cool edge;sometimes I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. And I liked how Nolan did certain things with the structure of the story early on- which is his specialty as a true-blue professional- in a kind of non-linear way, keeping the audience off balance but not too much to know where things were headed. Basically, if you've been waiting over ten years for a Batman movie that works, this is it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Got to see it early,"OK.. So i don't want to make this long.I went to the Wizard Wolrd Comic Con on Saturday June 4th and they had a special showing of Batman Begins at the IMAX theater in King Of Prussia. Well.. It was Awesome. I am a huge comic book fan and this made me very happy. It is on par if not better then Batman 1.The movie has a scene here or there that is only so so, but you forget about that by the end. Anything they change in history is easy to forgive too because it works so well and makes a lot of sense.All the actors did a great job. I thought to many big names would be bad.. i commend you ALL... i knew Christian and Gary would be perfect and they WERE.. Katie, Michael and Morgan i was worried about (no offense to them, just for the roles) and they did awesome. Katie Holmes actually really did a great job. I gained a lot of respect for her abilities.Overall.. SEE IT.. i would have been willing to pay so much to see it early and getting a free showing made it that much sweeter. I have to see it again on opening night and then a week later for my brothers last night as a free man.. and i cant wait...

"The greatest Bat film ever, possibly the best comic book film of the 21st century","Christopher Nolan and crew are to be commended for a job well done. If you are moderately interested in Batman, perhaps enjoyed the first film or two but was appalled with Schumacher's take on the series, you will love Batman Begins for its return to the darker, more serious side of Batman. If you are, however, a true Batman fan (by that I mean you have read your share of Bat comics and genuinely appreciate the character), this film will blow your mind.First off, let me say that Goyer and Nolan do take a lot of ""artistic license"" with the origin story; though is such a thing possible with a story that has been retold countless times? Anyway, there are a lot of new ideas thrown into the mix of Bruce Wayne's struggle - and subsequently, a lot of dimension.The mission of Batman Begins is really very simple - to bring a sense of realism and maturity to the Batman tale.When I say realism, I do not mean it is realistic. How could it be? But the film approaches the subject with the question, ""Okay - what if it WERE possible?"" And the suspension of belief works well.But besides all of that, what is really important about this film? Christian Bale. He MAKES Batman work. Never before has any television or film truly captured the intensity, the ferocious growl, the unstoppable passion that Bruce Wayne has.And this is a film about Bruce Wayne, not Batman. Which is why it works so well.I think this film would not have been possible, perhaps, without Spider-man's birth to the screen. Spider-man revolutionized superhero movies, gave some credibility to them. It showed the world that, in order to make a movie about a superhero, you have to instead focus on the alter ego - the real person.But Batman is a little trickier than Spider-man, I think. You see, the twist to this character is that, the Batman IS Bruce Wayne. Wayne the billionaire is the mask. Perhaps this seems a little simple, but the film really takes a hard look at it, and shows us two different Wayne's. This Batman does not require his costume in order to be Batman.There's a wonderful scene that shows an interaction between a little boy and the Batman. Batman attempts to stay hidden as he clings to a building in an alley, spying on a villain attempting to get rid of criminal evidence. The boy emerges from his beaten down apartment, parents yelling at each other in the background. He looks out on his rugged balcony, then catches a glimpse of the Batman - right next to him. Instead of rushing off, Batman just kind of shares a moment with him, silent at first, and the boy says with hope, ""I knew you were real. No one else believes me."" Bruce watches him a second longer, then hands him a device from his belt and disappears. This wasn't the cheesy, super-hero interacting with adoring fan type scene. It was almost like two kindred spirits, the hero feeling the child's pain and reaching out to him.The thing that is so wonderful about this version of Batman is that, while he appears heartless, he's actually full of compassion. And it isn't just the dorky super-hero type ""calling"". It runs in the family. We learn in the film that Bruce's great grandfather helped slaves escape to the North during the Civil War. We see perhaps one of the deepest renditions of Bruce's father, Thomas, as being a strong, compassionate and loving father, who's saying sticks with Bruce all his life: ""Why do we fall? So we can pick ourselves back up."" Michael Caine does a riveting job as Alfred, much more masculine (in a gentlemanly way) than past incarnations, a bit more youthful and definitely more agile. His fatherly influence warms the heart and makes us treasure every second with the character (though it might just be because of Caine, who is a phenomenal actor). Think of a ""Second Hand Lions"" type Alfred.Then there's the love interest (if you can call it that), Rachel. Honestly, I understand why they put her in here, but she really has no point to the story. She's not the reason he becomes Batman. She doesn't stop him from being Batman. She's just kind of there, a convenient voice from the past. Really, any of her scenes (aside from the kiss at the end) could have been given to Alfred, and it would have worked better. But being that she's actually such a small part of the film, it doesn't bother me that much.I won't go into the villains, because I can't say much there without giving it away. I will say, though, that they are again, very much based in realism, not in comic color poetry. There are a wide variety of villains in this film, and at the end, the promise of one very special foe in the sequel.This film ends on a definite note of continuation, as even the main titles suggest it (the title ""Batman Begins"" doesn't even flash until the last scene has rolled). But it works, because you knew that was coming anyway, right? Personally, I feel this film is a much more mature comic book film than Spider-man, Superman, Fantastic Four, X-men, etc. will ever be. While not realistic, Batman Begins is BELIEVABLE, and I will definitely be frequenting the theaters quite a bit this summer to see this movie again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great Trilogy Starter,"I still remember going to this movie and having no Idea what I was about to see. A buddy of mine wanted to see it, and I knew absolutely nothing about this movie. I went with expectations to see something along lines of another Batman movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger making a second appearance.Boy was I surprised. From the start I was hooked. This was like no other Batman I had ever seen before. It was not cheesy jokes, cheesy sets, cheesy cast, nor cheesy costumes. This was done Dark, and Dirty, and real. Well as real as a fiction movie about a super hero can be. You could say it was 100% plausible. This movie was the second best movie of the trilogy with the Dark Knight being first.But this movie was more important. It was the game changer the led the way for the Dark Knight.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
the perfect batman origin story,"Chris Nolan knock it out of the park really fleshing out the character of Bruce Wayne and giving a lot of time with him training with Ra's al Ghul a character that Liam Neeson nailed. Christian Bale still to this day is still my favourite batman but pattinson might have over taken him, but if i ever want to watch batman's origin story again this the movie that i will always come back to, i love everything about this film, the action, the story, the acting and the writing it is a perfect origin story and is one of my favourite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Mildly Psychotropic,"Those expecting a fine experience based on prior Nolan projects, even Bale ones, are bound to be disappointed. I was.There are only two redeeming elements here. The first is the mildly radical cutting of the action scenes, at least those involving fights. This technique is usually used when the budget requires confusion in details. Here it to underscore the psychotropic nature of the whole film experience.And the second pleasure is the folding of that psychotropic notion: the hero faces his fears through a hallucinogen; the plot revolves around loosing that hallucinogen to the public at large (the Batman comics always has Gotham stand for all of the world) inexplicably causing them to kill each other rather than just blissing out or having a bad day. Don't they know that about 30% of all urban livers do this anyway?And the third fold is the notion that we the viewers are partaking of that same substance. At least that's the way Nolan's sketch stood when he committed to the film. And it is the way the thing begins, until into the story creep Hollywoodisms: the first is Bruce falling into the ice as consequence of ""losing situational awareness.""Caine was once a fine actor, but since coming out of retirement, his edge is gone. Freeman was never an actor, just a friendly prop. But as the movie becomes more and more ""Goldfinger""-like, the real miscue as an actor is Katie Holmes. She has no presence at all.And try the Harrison Ford acting test on her. This is a well known problem with people that cannot act. They try so hard that their conscious mind does all the work, but their inner self just doesn't believe it. So you get the right side of the face going through all the motions and the left side remaining placid, as if it were in suspended animation.Look at Katie's face, especially at the end. Notice how Katie's dead face is on her left, asleep and her character's lines are spoken only on the right. And those lines! They concern identity: you aren't who's inside you, you are how you act.The Coens actually put actors like this in positions so they can dump on them. Nolan isn't so clever or cruel. I guess he thought he was getting the actress of ""Pieces of April,"" someone larger than the role. Not here.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This is not another superhero movie,"Batman Begins isn't another superhero movie in the line of Spider- Man, the X- Men or the Hulk. In fact, even if you don't care for Batman or any of his costumed colleagues, you can still enjoy this film as a good action- thriller. It doesn't thrive on special effects and big action scenes but offers a decent story with lots of attention to character development. The movie is fairly low tech and because it doesn't rely on computer technology in the way other recent superhero movies do, it has an old school feel to it, kind of like an early 80s fantastic film or even Superman: The Movie. Of course, Batman Begins is much darker than Richard Donner's beauty, but the evolution of both main characters from youths, coming to terms with who they are, to caped crusaders is depicted in a similar way. As far as the actual crime fighting goes, this movie puts right everything that was done wrong in Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Our hero's weapons are not covered with blinking lights, but sober and practical: no computer controlled Batarangs, but ninja stars shaped as a bat. No design costume, but military armor, decorated with a cape and mask. The Batmobile is no skyscraper climbing super car, but a rejected army vehicle put to new use that befits the general atmosphere of this movie. Batman doesn't fight villains in shiny outfits who fly around on supersonic gliders or have tentacles as arms. The bad guys in this film are real people: gangsters, a corrupt warden of a psychiatric ward, a martial arts specialist and lots of crooked cops. If you take into consideration that Batman Begins is based on the Year One comics, written by Sin City's Frank Miller, one cannot help noticing the similarity between Robert Rodriguez' newly created world and the one depicted in this movie. In fact, Sin City could just as well be Gotham City without Batman. So forget Joel Schumacher's monstrosities. In fact, Christopher Nolan has even gone one better than Tim Burton and created a credible movie with a good story, realistic characters and the filthiest setting the world's Darkest Knight has ever called home.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A vast improvement over the Batman films of the 1990s,"I enjoyed the film BATMAN from Tim Burton, though I'll be the first to admit that it was very, very dark and disturbing. I'd also agree that the Batman role in this and subsequent films was a bit one-dimensional--with a much greater emphasis on the villains and amazing cartoon-like scenes. However, despite enjoying the first film, the subsequent films were a disappointment to me as they just seemed overloaded with special effects and were a bit light on character development.In light of this, I really appreciated how the Batman character was hashed out and given much greater depth in BATMAN BEGINS--especially because it explains the long evolution of Bruce Wayne to caped crusader. Christian Bale was very good in the leading role and the story was very unusual but enjoyable to a point--though the plot did get awfully convoluted towards the end. In fact, I would say that the least interesting part of the film was the final conflict at the end, as this seemed a lot like previous Batman films--full of special effects but that's about all.Now my quibbles with BATMAN BEGINS are quite minor and I can't fault the movie too much because it doesn't pretend to be Shakespeare or a contender for a Sundance award! It is just old fashioned entertainment. Not especially deep, but entertaining.By the way, when I saw this film I was amazed at the high-priced talent organized for this film--Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman. In particular, Freeman and Caine were terrific in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One Super-Hero Film With Tremendous Depth!,"From Pasto,Colombia. Via: L. A. CA; CALI, Colombia +ORLANDO, FLFIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title¬¥s content and context....Now... Other than SUPERMAN... This is undoubtedly the SUPERHERO who has been with us the longest! Maybe, if You¬¥re like me... What appeals to You most about BATMAN is that he really does NOT possess any SUPER-POWER! And of the many movies and Series where he is the central character ...This is definitely my favorite!Just exactly what are we getting here??? Well...Warner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, but also, that it is definitely the best Superhero film ever!Director, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast...Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson & Morgan Freeman, (among others), a truly outstanding script and special effects, all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip two into a work of real depth!In the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of ""Super-Star"". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic"" which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so...What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!)On the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!)However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware...audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho.For my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had any real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had not been in many high profile films! To be fair to her, though, it wasn't so much that her
characterization was extremely lacking... as much as that her performance just wasn't up to the level of those of others in this brilliant cast!To highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched.Before rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, BEGINS might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a
comic book ""super-hero"", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything close...Let's try to keep things in perspective, O. K.?In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins... I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS!....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa√±ol, are most welcome!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Batman Begins"" (2005) is a great movie. Christopher Nolan has made an ambitious and different Batman from previous versions of the character on a big screen. This film has an all star cast, lead by a terrific Christian Bale who plays Bruce Wayne / Batman. The plot here is great and was more about Bruce Wayne & Batman. This is different from any previous films have which were more about the villain and not about the main character. At superbly paced 2 hours this film does not drag for a moment and is a pleasure to watch from a get go.Overall, ""Batman Begins"" is a great film about Bruce Wayne / Batman. It shows how those this character is born, how it was created along the way, it has a great ""devilish"" scheme and character to root for. One of the best comic book movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A perfect reboot,"This film is absolutely Outstanding! Its nails the character,the world he inhabits and everything around him Beautifully. I couldn't have hoped for a better and more cinematic experience. To call batman begins the first perfect batman live action movie would be true but a complete understatement. This is still easily one of the greatest comic book films of all time and the most thorough origin story that I have ever witnessed. The film explores everything that previous live action incarnations either never could or never thought to. The first thirty minutes of the film don't feature Batman at all but instead the audience is acquainted with Bruce Wayne as both a child and as young and troubled man. He is portrayed by the amazing Christian Bale. The audience develops a Intimate bond with him the way that we have never seen before. The rest of the cast is absolutely magnificent. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Bruce Wayne's martial Arts master. He inspires Bruce when he is at the most vulnerable point in his life. The training sequences in the snowy mountains are some of the most memorable parts of the movie for me. What impeccable screen writing! Michael Caine was born to play Alfred. The relationship between Alfred and Bruce is beautiful. You can tell that Alfred is the closest thing that Bruce has to a father. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman is beyond excellent as Jim Gordon. Finally the character Gordon has a say so in these movies. Cillian Murphy is Fantastic as the evil Scarecrow/Jonathan Crane. The weakest link in the film is Katie Holmes but she still does a good job for the most part. Her characters relationship with Bruce is very engaging even if she doesn't have much chemistry with Bale. Also she gets to deliver one of the best lines in the film ""Its not you who are underneath but what you do that defines you."" The film is gripping unlike any Batman story that you have ever imagined. The film is dark and gritty but not merely for the sake of being dark and gritty. This has a meaning story about a young man who uses a fearful symbol to exact vengeance on the criminal underworld. The character grows and matures as the film progress from a victim of fear and tragedy whose world was falling apart to a fully fledge unstoppable hero that makes the criminals fear him. The Hanz simmer score is masterful and in my humble opinion the best ever put in a batman film animated or live action. This movie is a masterpiece and underrated by fans of its slightly superior sequel The Dark Knight.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Genre Redefining Classic,"Aside from being one of the most successful and best comic book movies of all time, Batman Begins is, in my opinion, one of the most important films for 21st-century pop culture. Along with launching the career of the greatest filmmaker of his generation, Sir Christopher Nolan, the film managed to reinvent an entire genre, and its influence is still felt in cinema today.After most of the previous Batman movies from Warner Bros. - most notably Batman & Robin - were colossal failures and even considered a joke today, the studio realized the need to pivot strategy and reboot the entire concept with a completely different approach. The guiding principle was to return to the darker and more complex roots of the Dark Knight's character, reintroducing it to a modern audience with a focus on the character's origins and psychological depth.After impressing Warner Bros. With his previous works, especially the psychological thrillers Memento and Insomnia, a young and promising director named Christopher Nolan was recruited to give his personal spin on the task. Nolan's ability to handle complex characters and non-linear storytelling caught the producers' attention, particularly Steven Soderbergh, who helped convince Warner to give Nolan a chance. In a manner that now seems very typical of him, Nolan wanted to explore the character's journey in a serious, realistic, and emotional way, abandoning the fantastical and ""campy"" tone of previous films while drawing inspiration from movies like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Richard Donner's Superman. He teamed up with screenwriter David S. Goyer, who had extensive experience adapting comic books, and together they crafted a story that explored the origin of Bruce Wayne's transformation from a spoiled rich kid to a crime-fighting vigilante. Christopher's brother, Jonathan Nolan, was also present on set and assisted them in the process.The Nolans' approach received positive feedback from the studio, and Warner gave Chris full creative control to reinvent the character and tell the story in the way he saw fit. Thus began, officially, the journey of the greatest blockbuster director of this century.In their first of many collaborations, Nolan brought in the legendary composer Hans Zimmer, alongside James Newton Howard, to provide the film's score. In my view, these two played a significant role in transforming the film from a comic book movie, as we were used to seeing them until then, into the unique masterpiece it is. The soundtrack is one of the most iconic in the action genre, combining dramatic and emotional music with epic, nerve-wracking action scores when needed, as Zimmer does so well. In my opinion, this is one of the film's most outstanding aspects, which would later evolve and reach new heights in the sequels of the trilogy.Naturally, the casting of the film played a central role in shaping the tone and world with the unique characteristics Nolan sought to create. At the time, Christian Bale was known for his versatile performances and extraordinary dedication, making him a leading candidate in Nolan's eyes-a choice that seemed unconventional at the time. In hindsight, many consider this a very wise decision, as Bale is still regarded as one of the best Batmans in live-action adaptations. Beyond the physical transformation Bale underwent (another thing he's famous for), his portrayal of Bruce Wayne as an arrogant and spoiled playboy, contrasted with his dark and calculated performance as Batman, is praiseworthy.The one-of-a-kind Cillian Murphy, who originally auditioned for the role of Bruce Wayne, also caught Nolan's eye. Though Murphy wasn't chosen for the lead role, Nolan was very impressed with his presence (especially his gaze and eyes) and offered him the role of the villain-the Scarecrow. Murphy's chilling and masterful performance added a psychological, even slightly horror-like, element to the film. Above all, it marked the beginning of a wonderful friendship between Nolan and Murphy, who have collaborated many times throughout their careers, with both winning Oscars for Oppenheimer a little less than a year ago. For the role of Alfred, Sir Michael Caine was Nolan's first choice. There isn't much more to add here, and I think most people would agree that this is the most successful cinematic interpretation of the character to date.In its first half, the movie is a complete drama. It takes quite some time before any action occurs or even before Batman is seen in costume. In my eyes, this is one of the things that highlights how incredible this film is and how it prioritizes the story, characters, and plot over cheap thrills. As a hero origin story, it was important to Nolan to establish the world in which the film takes place, give the audience a deep understanding of the characters and their motivations, and let the story flow naturally until the ""action"" part of the plot arrives. While this approach has since been adopted by many blockbusters, not all of them do it as smoothly and naturally as Nolan.The film's ending is also quite unconventional. Some might say that by the end, the conflict is not entirely resolved, and those who were in theaters in 2005-before the age of social media and spoilers-probably remember the audible excitement in the theater during the last 30 iconic seconds. This is another point that sets this movie apart from others in the genre: it manages to leave the audience wanting more and presents a long-term vision for the world it builds while still delivering a satisfying resolution to the story presented in the film; a growth in the right direction in the shadow of the escalation in Gotham City that builds the tension towards the next movie. All this within the main plot, without relying on post-credit scenes or cameo appearances.Batman Begins essentially laid the foundation for Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, which is still considered one of the most acclaimed and influential trilogies in modern cinema. While the sequel is regarded by many as the best in the trilogy (and one of the best films of all time), it's only fitting to give Batman Begins the credit it deserves for its tremendous impact on the comic book movie genre. The film set a new standard for superhero movies and opened the door (essentially serving as the blueprint) for more mature and realistic comic book adaptations that followed, such as Zack Snyder's Watchmen and, of course, Iron Man, which launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The film was a massive success, both critically and financially, and was praised for the dark and realistic approach it offered the superhero genre. Critics and audiences alike lauded Nolan's work, who was relatively ""unknown"" at the time, as both director and screenwriter. As an incredible success story for Warner, and in typical Nolan fashion, the film revived the franchise after the disaster of the previous movies and earned over $370 million worldwide. Down the road, the entire trilogy grossed over $2 billion during its theatrical run worldwide.On a more personal note, Batman Begins is one of the movies I love revisiting every now and then. While I also believe it's not the best in Nolan's masterful trilogy, it's the one I've probably watched the most times.From the wonderful music, the deep character exploration, the enjoyable action scenes, the captivating story, and Nolan's perfect execution, Batman Begins retains its status as one of the best comic book movies of all time. Despite reinventing the genre and setting a whole new bar for it, I always feel that it's somewhat unfair to categorize it as a ""comic book movie"" because, despite my immense appreciation for the genre, the film stands on its own as a masterpiece of psychological crime drama/thriller and often feels more like that. To this day, it's the best take on Batman's story in my opinion, especially for his origin story-a fantastic way to reintroduce the character to the public and start a trilogy that tells a story with a beginning, middle, and end.And beyond that, as a big fan of Sir Christopher Nolan, perhaps one of the reasons I keep returning to this movie is that you can think of the story behind it as a Hero Origin Story in itself - the one of the greatest filmmaker of recent times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

best batman movie ever!!!!,"After the dreadful batman forever and batman and robin I was a bit skeptical about Batman Begins. I was worried it was going to be awful like the other 2 before it.

And the acting was superb,I liked how Nolan took a different direction and decided to make everything believable and very realistic. Christian bale is the perfect batman,In fact everyone was perfect in their roles!!! In my opinion its better than Burton's batman. I also liked how Nolan made Gotham dark like Burtons Gotham unlike Schumacher who made Gotham all cartoon like.

Great Version of the Batman's Origin,"This is probably the best of all the Batman films. What makes it so is the fact that, as it title suggests, shows the how Bruce Wayne went from being orphaned as a child, to the Dark Knight. It was also great to see them show a little bit of the relationship between young Bruce and his father. This relationship was only hinted at in the comic books, but you can see why the deaths of his parents really after their tragic murder. You also see how after his parents die how the anger builds up inside of him to the point where he almost makes a very tragic mistake that almost ends his quest before it begins.As far as the cast is concerned, Christian Bale is excellently cast as Batman. He shows the almost split personality of Bruce/Batman that is apparent in all the books. Michael Caine is also excellent as Alfred. This is the first time that you pretty much see Alfred as more than just a confidant, but as a father figure as well to young Bruce. Katie Holmes is also good as Rachel. She does a lot more than just play the damsel in distress role that other actresses in the series have. She pretty much has a great deal of spunk that hasn't been seen in all the other actresses, especially Kim Bassinger. Morgan Freeman is also great as Lucius Fox. For those of you who may not know, he is one of the more important characters in the latter day Batman stories and Freeman captures the character well in his portrayal.This is definitely the best of all the ""Batman"" films.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best Batman Film!,"At first, when i heard that there is going to be a new Batman film, i thought it would just be another cheap attempt to make some $$$. And so the days past, and i started to be more interested in the story(especially with Chris Nolan as the director). One by one, great actors started to sign on for the film(Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Micheal Cane, Gary Oldmen, Morgan Freeman) and i was all over it. My friends thought it would be really bad and even the great cast and promising trailer didn't really interest them. And then finally i saw the film..... and i was amazed! Chris Nolan has created something other than the Tim Burton Batman we saw in the 80's(and i'm not even going to mention Schumacher's ""2 flops in a row"" Batman). He has made Batman the way he is, dark, anti-social and filled with revenge. Batman Forever and Batman & Robin were flops because the films were too much concentrated on the villains. Batman Begins, however, was centered on Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and defeating his fears. This film is truly the best Batman film ever made, and possibly the best film of this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best Batman movie ever!!!,"The most well made and mature of all the Batman capers. Probably the first time a comic hero has not been presented like a seemingly inane and kiddish character.

It came as a pleasant surprise to see this six footer enacting the role of this superhero with stupendous control and grace and did not let his fans down in any way whatsoever.Batman has always been a rather mature superhero adored by kids and adults alike and this one time his gray character was brought to the forefront as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Christopher Nolan Has Lifted ""Batman"" Up to the Masterpiece Level","I've seen all of Batman movies and they were OK at best and sometimes awful .. I nearly lost hope of this series but when I heard that Nolan is directing the next Batman .. I braced myself to a very good movie at least and Nolan hasn't let me down .. it is the only Batman movie that you could call a masterpiece even people who liked it less consider it a very good movie and the best batman (so far). This movie is loaded with class A starts (like other batman movies) but they are the best of the best .. Liam Neeson & Michael Caine were very good .. Morgan Freeman wasn't at his best but he was OK at least .. Christian Bale is a unique actor and I think he will show us great performance in other movies to come in the future .. he is the type of actor he will try everything and anything that makes his performance good .. keep in mind his awesome performance in ""The Machinist"" .. he has a great facial expresses that he uses very good .. Gary Oldman wasn't very good but wasn't bad either .. Cillian Murphy also was very good .. even Katie Holmes was good. The visual effects were convening and were so realistic that sometimes I feel that they didn't use much of computer effects. What can I say about this masterpiece !! in short, Christopher Nolan worked hardly on this movie and he surely has lifted it up to the masterpiece level .. everything sounds prefect in this movie. Do not miss it ..it is one of the best in 2005 and absolutely the best batman movie (so far) ..

The Dark Knight Returns,"""Batman Begins"" finally has captured the true spirit of the character of Bruce/Batman from the comics. This live-action adaptation has been smartly directed, scripted, and cast to produce the more realistic dark nature of a human hero out to avenge his parent's murder with every criminal that threatens his Gotham City. It's the best of all the Batman movies, and stands tall next to the godfather/blueprint of all superhero movies, 1978's ""Superman"". Where ""Superman"" left off with a more campy telling of it's superhero, 'Begins' ushers in a more adult, serious take on it's mythic hero, dispensing with any camp and treating Batman seriously, grounding him in a more realistic environment that is more accessible for the audience without dumbing down the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I actually clapped when the credits rolled - so did about 10 other people,"You know the story, you know the outcome, but nothing is lacking here. Thank God, even Rutger Hauer underplays his part - how good is that? The cast is perfection (yes Katie Who? does a fine job) and I won't mind looking forward to the sequel, the remake of the sequel, whatever they will call it. Bring the Joker on. Makes a real case for the fact that the right cast means absolutely everything. This is entertainment and comic book characterization come to life. Christian Bale's Batman makes Ben Affleck's tortured Daredevil character look absolutely ridiculous (sorry, maybe that is really not giving Christian enough praise - he deserves all he gets). Since we are in for a few more years of comic books as movies dominating the scene, I vote for more like this - made for adults, not children, with superb casting, and Hans Zimmer (with the help of Lisa Gerrard, maybe Moby, and the like) scoring the music. I felt that in no way was I cheated here - unlike so many other movies that I see where the corners that are cut are bleeding so profusely that you can't help but notice. See this on the big screen. Worth every moment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Perfect Batman Film!,"I went to the midnight showing last night, and I've also been to see it again this morning, and both times I left feeling thrilled and excited. I've been waiting for this film ever since it was first announced and let me tell you it doesn't let you down one bit. Now I don't want to go through explaining the story, I just want to say how good this film is. It's the best Batman film ever, now I'm a big fan of Tim Burtons, but after seeing this, I couldn't imagine another Batman or another version of Gotham. The film expelled on all levels. I remember the anticipation I had before going to see Terminator 3, but felt really let down when I came out. But not this one, I just couldn't wait to get in and see it again. So I've been twice already and I'm planning on going again tomorrow morning. I'm going to stop babbling on, but if you go to see three films this month, go see this first, then star wars and then Mr & Mrs Smith. This is the best film of the year so far and the best comic movie alongside Superman The Movie! PS Thank god this movie eradicates the camp Joel Schumacher versions. Long live Batman!'",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins,"Well, first off, I must say; Bale, as mentioned before, is perfect as Batman. His acting performance in the movie is just outstanding, therefore my high rating. The movie itself, plot, dialogs and so on, its nothing out of the ordinary, but then you start to think about those 90's Batman movies. This just seem more realistic, more ""Bruce"" than ""Batman"" and with the perfect acting from Bale, it makes all other Batman movies look really dull and daft. They managed to put in a few funny lines as well, Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman gave the movie that extra ""casual"" yet serious, although funny touch to it all. I am impressed, more Bale, more Batman! Continue in style.danrozen,swe",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What's Left When the Magic and Fun is Gone,"This new take on Batman just doesn't seem to work quite right. Nolan tries to basically get Shakespearean with the character and completely ignore the first four films. In some ways that works but in other ways it veers off into a Batman universe that makes no sense and becomes basically a movie that seems like he's attempting to have Batman seem more realistic to being like a person in our real universe. This is where Nolan fails. The magic and fun of Batman evaporates quickly. A man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime has a humorous element to it that Nolan completely ignores with this incarnation and everyone in this universe acts really dumb about it and their reactions to it make little sense especially Gordon's character. A lot of what Gordon does lacks logical sense and he never seems to really question the mental state of the person he first sees dressed as a bat. He's portrayed like some idiot willing to eventually put complete trust in someone he knows practically nothing about running around in a bat suit. His reasons for being so trusting are never clear. Does he know something everyone else doesn't? Bale's performance was pretty average but not as compelling as Keaton or Kilmer. He also tries to have a Batman voice that sounds ridiculous. The only reason for this film's critical success is that it struck a cord with the comic book fan die hards. It certainly didn't do that impressive box office numbers. Now with news that Nolan is going to present The Joker in a sequel, I see a potential disaster waiting to happen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Finally...,Batman Begins is definitely the best Batman movie to date and one of the better movies of 2005 and of all time. The real credit to this movie should go to director Christopher Nolan who has produced a brilliant movie. This movie is so great because it does something that the other Batman movies didn't..... show exactly how different (and better) Batman is from other heroes and superheroes. The acting was brilliant (with the exception of Katie Holmes). Liam Neeson would be my personal pick from this movie.But I am a bit surprised that some people are complaining about the confusion surrounding the action scenes.... for god's sake that's how it's meant to be. The confusion surrounding the fight scenes is another factor that makes Batman different.All in all it's a brilliant movie. The only thing that wasn't working for it was Katie Holmes. But I still gave it 10/10.Can't wait for the sequel.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best Batman Movie of all time is finally here!!!,"This is my first post after joining the IMDb. And what better way than to start with my favorite Super Hero. Last night, I attended the opening night showing of Batman Begins. I came out of that theater in total awe and I am totally and completely amazed. They have finally made what has got to be the best Batman movie ever as well as the most real interpretation. I have to agree with Christopher Nolan's goal about making this movie turn out the way the first Superman movie of 1978 did and they executed it to the fullest. A true origin movie of Batman.This movie has a very high caliber cast. Christian Bale is an unknown to me since I've never seen the Psycho movies at all. Other than that, you had an excellent, well known cast for support and villains. If Christopher Reeve could make you believe that a man could fly, then Christian Bale will make you believe that a man with a tortured soul whose driven to fight crime after the deaths of his parents could establish an identity as a Caped and Cowled Vigilante. And for once, his is not upstaged by the villains. Katie Holmes was great as Rachel, though she still looks like a teenager. Although they've never found a tall, thin, bald English man with a thin mustache for Alfred, Michael Caine is superb in the role and you can definitely believe him in the part of Alfred Pennyworth, manservant and surrogate father figure. Gary Oldman was perfect as James Gordon. He literally looked like the character with the hair, mustache, and glasses. They finally found the right looking Gordon. No one's ever done that before.For the villains, Cillian Murphy was excellent as the Scarecrow. The costume totally took me by surprise, especially the mask, but like Wayne and Gordon, Murphy literally looked like Jonathan Crane. He seemed born for the part. I also liked Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. I can't think of anybody better for the role and I was amazed to find that Rutger Howard as Richard Earle was the same guy who played the killer in the Hitcher. I've never heard of Ken Wantanabe, so I can't comment on Ras Al Ghul, but I will say I liked that Ras was part of this first movie. In the 1989 movie, I asked myself ""Where Was Robin?"" In this movie, I'm asking myself, ""Where's Talia?"" Ras's daughter? And the Lazarus Pit? And Ubu? I could imagine if they had been included, a tempting romance for Bruce and the consistent use of the word ""Infidel!"" by Ubu. Oh well, I was glad to see Ras himself.The musical score was superb and Gotham City for once, looked like the real Gotham City, not that twisted Nightmare Before Christmas Tim Burton look, nor the Neon lit weird Gotham Vegas style of Joel Schumacher's but the real Gotham City and it's inspirations of New York City!! Last but not least, I love the new musical score and I already can't wait to get the soundtrack. Though I was puzzled that there was no main title, whereas the theme is heard throughout the movie. I only hated one thing. The new Batmobile. I just can't accept is as a tank like vehicle. My favorite Batmobile will be the one from the two Tim Burton films. Overall, I give Batman Begins the the perfect rating and my comment that this is how it should have been made in 1989. 2 Thumbs Up!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This one is really worth your time and ticket money,"I liked the world Tim Burton created for his Batman movies pretty well. Let's face it, for a real fan of the books, the TV series and one movie were a real disaster. Burton, at least, wasn't making a camp spoof. I was less impressed with the Joel Schumacher take on the Caped Crusader, however and really didn't think the franchise was going in the right direction. They really hadn't found the right combination of Bruce Wayne and Batman in a single actor, either.I was eager to see Batman Begins, partly because I liked Momento and the remake of Insomnia, the two films I'd seen by the director, Christopher Nolan. I also had respect for Bale's work in previous films And I'm always up for a new take on Batman, my favorite of the classic-era superheroes. I liked him precisely because he wasn't super, just a man with an obsessive need to fight crime and the physical skill and money to do it in style.This movie delivers. It has more the feel of the Dark Knight and Year One books rather than the classic ones, and it exists in the real world, or at least in a world that could easilly be real. I may see it again and it will be a keeper on DVD when it comes out.I'd read some criticism of some of the casting and performances. I didn't see it. Some have quibbled that Katie Holmes looks too young to be a crusading ADA. Well, she's twenty-five, just like many of the bright young attorneys in a big DA's office. I believed her. And Tom Wilkinson holds his American accent well and I could see him as a big-city mob boss of the current era, polished but still brutal.As for casting Christian Bale in the title role, he is Bruce Wayne and Batman and you can see the transition as he moves from one to the other. Not everyone can act in the Bat suit. Bale can and he carries it off very well. This Batman is the right mix and I hope he's signed on for more in this series. And there should be one.The long and the short, if you love a gritty Batman, go see it. If you haven't liked the previous WB Bat movies, this will change your mind. It isn't a kid's movie -- some of it is pretty intense -- and if you think it bears any resemblance to the animated Batman stuff on TV, think again. There were a couple of kids in the theatre when we saw it and they looked scared.Highly recommended. A Ten with extra credit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins Again - This Time With a Vengeance,"Anything I say about this film will sell it short. I was originally skeptical when I saw the Urban Assault Vehicle in the trailer, but my fears were calmed when I saw it in context. Everything about this film is perfect - the acting, the directing, the mood, the plot, and all else. It is rare to see such intricate storytelling mixed with bone-shattering intensity in the action department. And fans of the comic will not be disappointed with this apt translation.I hope Chris Nolan directs all future Bat-movies, because his lighting and architectural canvasing was so perfect, it outdid Tim Burton's interpretation (which I previously thought impossible). As of this review, IMDb has rated the movie #117 of all time, and I agree completely. This film has universal appeal. Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne, Katie Holmes actually acts for once in her career, Liam Neeson is the quintessential villain. Other stars shine brightly. I can only hope that Crispin Glover becomes the Joker in the sequel. Highest possible recommendation...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins,"After Tim Burton reinvented Batman for the movies in 1989 with his darker and disturbed vision.The subsequent sequels directed by Joel Schumacher got sillier and campier. Also Warner Brothers could not keep hold of their dark knight. The replacements Val Kilmer and George Clooney just did not look right in the batsuit.Christopher Nolan was bought in to launch a new series of films. He went back to basics with a prequel and a reinvention of the character.The first third of the film is an origins film. Bruce Wayne travels the world learning combat and find his purpose in life. He encounters the League of Shadows led by Ra's al Ghul in the Far East. However Wayne rejects their twisted message of destroying Gotham.He returns to Gotham as Bruce Wayne the playboy, his family company being run by an unscrupulous executive.However Gotham is a corrupt cesspit run by organised crime. Wayne develops his Batman persona with the aid of prototype technology developed by Lucius Fox.Christian Bale does his best Clint Eastwood impression when he has his bat suit on. There is enough playfulness in his public Bruce Wayne identity.Batman Begins is a much needed return to form for the Batman movies. In part Nolan takes this opportunity to fulfil a lifelong ambition.

Batman succeeds at being Batman,"Now, I'm no Batman expert, but I do know that the tale of him is supposed to be dark and serious. And if I'm correct, this movie certainly succeeded at emulating that feel. Sure, it isn't Star Wars Episode III, and the first Batman movies were certainly more fun (Batman Returns is still my favorite), although this movie probably was the first to accurately translate Batman to the big screen. Living up to my expectations from the trailers, I certainly recommend it to Batman fans.All in all, I give it a B.

The bar has been raised -- and reshaped into a bat,"Sometimes, a movie comes along and blows away your expectations. Sometimes, a movie comes along and redefines a genre. Sometimes, a movie comes along and gets nearly everything right. In the world of comic book-to-movie translations, I doubted it could get much better than Spiderman 2. Spiderman had great acting from Tobey Maguire and Alfred Molina. It had great visuals. It delved into the emotions and motivations of a superhero. But there was that pesky, awkward romance, ruined by Kirsten Dunst's I'm-always-embarrassed look.Batman Begins take everything that went right about Spiderman 2 and replaces all the wrongs with tastiness. It's the creamy goodness inside Spiderman 2's empty Twinkie shell.In the past decade, the Batman saga has been, to use a terrible pun, rather two-faced. There have been a few great performances in the movies, but they have, overall, failed miserably. Possibly the crowning failure was director Joel Schumacher's decision to put nipples on the batsuit.Thankfully, those nipples are now gone. The painful dialogue, the laughable plots, the poor acting -- it's all gone in this iteration.With Christopher Nolan (Memento) taking over, the franchise was bound for some redemption. Nolan's personal philosophy results in his potential to be the anti-Lucas. Where the Star Wars creator relies excessively on special effects, Nolan avoids them when at all possible. Among the few computer-generated graphics found in the film are -- well, nothing, really, aside from some swarms of bats.Something about this film works perfectly. Likely, it's Bale's convincing performance as Batman. Where others have tried and failed to make Batman something more than a black suit and mask -- and it's no discredit to them, seeing as how the suit and the mask are his defining features -- Christian Bale turns the character into something more. There's a human element the superhero. He is constantly wrestling with his emotions; his parents died in front of him when he was a child, and he had his only chance of revenge -- at peace of mind -- stripped from him.Or, maybe, the point at which this film separates itself is refusal to turn itself into a joke. While the X-Men movies and Spiderman movies are fantastic in their own right, they tend to have a certain dark sarcasm about them, an intentional foray into classic action humor. Batman Begins does not. There may be three or four laughs in the film, but they don't take over the film. Even without the laughs, the film is enjoyable.Or, quite a bit more likely, it's the raw emotion in the film. It's the passion, the anger, the guilt, the sorrow. I felt as though the film was tossing me around like a kitten would a ball of yarn.The supporting acting, too, is fantastic. But, honestly, how could one expect any less from the likes of Michael Caine (Alfred), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox), and Liam Neeson (Ducard)? Sprinkle other spot-on performances (Ken Watanabe -- The Last Samauri -- and Katie Holmes play their parts perfectly), and this version of Batman can't fail where others did. It can't fail where Spiderman 2 did.Everything is subtle, not overblown like one may expect to find in a summer blockbuster. Not completely flawless, no -- but close enough to have raised the bar for comic book movies far beyond its previous resting place. If the Fantastic Four trailer is any indication, I doubt we'll see another superhero film like this in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman is REAL!!!,"Where is Gotham City? I only ask because this movie makes you feel as if you could actually go there, as if it actually exists somewhere. I liked Tim Burton's Batman, but Christopher Nolan's vision is so well paced and so real, that it is, in my humble opinion, the first REAL Batman movie. Christian Bale brings Batman to life with all of the emotion of a real person, I guess it takes a real actor to do so. The supporting cast is a group of actors with so much character that they could have had there own movies. Alfred is awesome. So many great movies stumble some during their running time, but this one did not miss a step. 10 out of 10. I wonder if Bruce Wayne would give me a loan?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best movie of the year.  Christian Bale is a knockout in Batman Returns,"By far--the best movie this year--and the best Batman movie ever. Whoever had the vision to cast Christian Bale as Batman deserves the award of the year. This movie was my introduction to him and the impact he had on me was similar to the impact I felt when I first saw Russell Crowe on the screen. What a talented actor! (both of them). The movie was not camp. It was serious and intense and made you almost believe that there could really be a ""Batman"" out there someday. The villains were menacing and nasty without being cartoonish and campy. The background story on Bruce Wayne was detailed and very welcome. It laid a strong and credible foundation for everything he did. The other actors were also strong in their roles. Morgan Freeman is simply irreplaceable. What will we do if and when he retires? And what a turn-about role for Gary Oldman! He's another of my favorites. I'll never forget him in Dracula--absolutely superb. But this movie belongs to Christian--no doubt about it.

"It isn't bad, just not that Entertaining","This is one of the few movies in which I actually watched the sequel first. Maybe that is why I didn't enjoy this movie as much as the critics and audiences who praised it to no end. While The Dark Knight wasn't perfect, it goes down as one of the best sequels of all time, mostly because the film it is following, was incredibly overrated.I may have mentioned before that I am not a big fan of superhero orgin stories. To me, they have way too much talking and exposition, and the sequels would handle the action, and thus be more entertaining. Now I know that they need to set up why Bruce Wayne became Batman, but do we really need to spend half the movie. I swear 20 percent of the movie is flashbacks. And when action does happen, it's horrendous. The action scenes in this movie are shot so poorly, and edited so sloppily, I can not tell what's going on. Christopeher Nolan is a fantastic director, so why did he choose to shoot the action scenes this way? So sense most of the movie is exposition, and the action scenes are terribly shot, the movie just isn't very interesting.Now, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, for all it's faults, it does do some things extremely well. I did like Bruce's backstory, and found him becoming Batman to be kind of interesting. If it didn't take up 50 percent of the movie, I wouldn't complain too much. I really like some of the characters: Alfred, Gordon, and Dr. Crane. I thought Scarecrow was a much more interesting villain than Ra's al Ghul. The film looks amazing, the acting is good, and there are a few funny lines.Batman Begins isn't a bad movie, it's just not particuarlly entertaining. The action scenes are horrible, and the set up goes on for too long. I admit it doesn't feel too long, and I really like the ending with the setup for a sequel. And I can see why the film is loved by so many people. When it first came out the last Batman movie we got was Batman and Robin.The movie was OK, it was descent. Not one I will watch over and over again, but far from a terrible movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Will change the comic book adaptation genre,"Every now and then, an innovative and groundbreaking film emerges and changes the genre by taking its genre and combining others. Film schools teach you that talking head movies don't work, but Godfather showed that captivating dialog and memorable characters could drive a movie and capture an audience's attention just as well as action. When this summer is over, Batman Begins will do the same thing for the comic book genre. It shows that a reality and character driven set piece can work for these types of movies.There are NO superpowers in the movie. The villains rely on mastered sword fighting, physical athleticism, and cunning as their vehicles to create chaos. And although there is action, which is done masterfully, (The car chases and hang glide scenes will blow you away)the story is moved completely by its lead character and not the events surrounding him.The movie is a journey of self discovery. One man's struggle to deal with guilt and anger. And minus the batsuit and batmobile, this movie could stand alone as a powerful drama about self discovery, and would probably even merit Oscar consideration. The acting is superb and this is the first comic book movie to ever leave me with a lump in my throat. The relationship between Alfred and Bruce is completely genuine and heartfelt.So enjoy the movie and be prepared for an onslaught of copy cat films to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"If cinemas had sofa's as we would be hiding behind them, and as Batman Begins flies onto our screens","Hit director, Christopher Nolan, brings us another action packed picture filled with special effects. Amazing actors enhance the action within the frames as feelings never felt before are released as you are pulled into the action. All the film needs now is an audience to surround with wonder.The Storyline twists and confuses but also captures and enchants as you follow the life of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and how the tragic death of his parents, affects his opinion on Gotham City. He realises though his experiences how he can make this town a better place. Until his only friend becomes his only enemy, and he feels like the whole world is against him.Gotham City is like no other; with crime ridden streets and dark alleyways, (put there with an intention) it's the perfect setting for Batman's home town. Underground caves surround the grounds of Wayne Towers (Bruce's Fathers business) so secret plans can be laid down to save the city. In these chamber-like rooms with miles a space scientific projects have been stored- never to see the light of day again. Or will they? Michael Cane plays a naturally calm and convincing Alfred. The butler, who serves the Wayne family, adds humour with witty one-liners and a down to earth character, which brings the whole picture into reality. His soft nature is what keeps Bruce from doing what he shouldn't.Christian Bale is extremely talented actor with the skill to comfortably present his character to the audience. Watch his change in character when he is in different situations. This is how the secret of his identity is kept.Heart pacing music creates an astonishing atmosphere to match the high detail and quick moving scenes. Blink and you're bound to miss something! Emotions run riot as you follow with your ears, the intense mood changes and roller coaster story. The clever changes in music tell you what's going to happen before you see it. There is a surprise round every street corner, so be careful you go.Using crystal clear camera tricks and long fast shots, Batman begins is shown in all its glory. Nolan has cleverly followed all the flight, agility and sweeping actions the creature's movement and has captured it on a screen. Quick cuts emphasis the speed of the film and how the story happens in such a small section of history.Overall the techniques used in the film bring it to life and generates a feeling that you are really there, in the one and only Gotham City.

But what three!,"While I enjoy Tim Burton ""Batman"" immensely, I cannot stand this one. What are the problems with ""Batman Begins""? Well, I can name at least three ones. But what three!Reality. How come they put Gotham City into the real world together with Rome and other true-to-life cities? It is simply laughable. In the Burton movie Gotham is such an amazing ethereal place that it just frees your mind. And here we have a dirty town next to New York or whatever.Background. In certain amounts the background is great. But when everything gets explained, stretched out, chewed and re-chewed with a detailed psychological analysis of the characters... it gets boring and nauseating. In ""Batman"" (1989) we had two psychos. They just clashed and the whole Gotham was a battlefield for the two maniacs who did not have to back themselves up with the loads of facts from their lives - they were too stylish for that paraphernalia and too insane. And what do we have here? Numerous flashbacks which are annoying. The main character's idiotic samurai-like training as if he were going to become a Jedi knight from ""Star Wars"" trilogy (and there is also that actor who performed in ""Star Wars: Episode 1""). Scrutinized explanation of the technology performed by Mr Morgan Freeman and of the way it can be purchased. Deep speeches delivered by the evil and good guys that resemble the notorious rubbish talks from ""Matrix: Reloaded"".Actors with profound performance. What the hell is wrong with the performance? It's too self-imposing. I feel as if these actors are going to burst from inside ¬ñ their self-importance is simply overwhelming. I feel the need to shout at the TV-set: ""Come on guys! It's ""Batman"", not ""Born on the Forth of July""!"" Those serious talks and big serious faces resemble scenes from ""Godfather"". Fine, they are making a deep criminal saga out of a comics booklet. Just brilliant.That's enough to lower the mark to a 3-out-of-10 level. The conception has been ruined. It's no match for the ""Batman"" from the 1989. By the way, I tried to watch this movie twice. For me to watch it from top to toe was unbearable.My verdict: unwatchable for the most part of its running time, but at least not completely tasteless and repellent (its major achievement). 3 out of 10. I would never bother commenting this one but it's on the top list while ""Batman"" (1989) is not. I cannot take this for granted. Thanks for attention.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Batman Fans Have Been Waiting For,"When I went to see Batman Begins I tried not to go into the theater expecting too much because that's usually how people end up getting disappointed. However, I found that once the day arrived I couldn't help it. Batman has been with me since childhood and I feel strangely connected to the duality of the Bruce Wayne character. I've always felt that I could relate to him. He is by far the most interesting comic book character simply because he is a real hero. As most people know, Batman is powerless, in a superhero sense. He is a normal human being. As strange as it sounds, that 'flaw' is what makes him an inspiration. He shows us that ""It's not who we are underneath, it's what we do that defines us.""After Joel Schumacher desecrated Tim Burton's vision of Gotham City, I had little to no hope for the future of the series. Burton's movies were good, but they lacked the emotion and depth that drives Batman. Batman Forever had potential but seemed to rely more on star power than actual plot. With big names like Val Kilmer, Nicole Kidman, and Jim Carrey they had virtually guaranteed themselves success at the box office. Batman and Batman Returns had big stars, but at least they were inspired. A few years later, Batman and Robin was released, or as I like to call it ""Batman on Ice"". That was the day the bat died. With pretty-boy George Clooney in the batsuit, Arnold Schwarzenegger as a ridiculous Mr. Freeze, needlessly homoerotic costumes, and a horrible plot it was easily the worst Batman to date and, as I figured, the final nail in the coffin.When the first shots of Batman Begins were coming out, most notably the pictures of the Batmobile, I wrote it off. I figured there was no way they were going to pull off a realistic Batman. My anticipation slowly built up after about a year, however. And I must admit, I was wrong. Christopher Nolan picked up the pieces in every way, shape, and form possible. Batman Begins has spectacular effects, great casting, and a great plot. I can't really think of any way it could get much better, besides being longer.Let me say that no one pulls off Batman like Christian Bale. He's tormented, likable, dark, and honorable, but most of all, believable. Believability was something that George Clooney lacked in a big way. Cillian Murphy was dead-on as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. One line sticks out specifically, ""Would you like to see my mask¬Ö?"", a line so simple, but expertly delivered. It's a shame there wasn't more of him. Morgan Freeman was excellent as always, and Liam Neeson hasn't lost his touch either.The scenery is breathtaking, especially in the training scenes. I was impressed at how in-depth Nolan was willing to go with it. And then we have Gotham City. While not quite as fantasy oriented as the Burton/Schumacher rendition, it's a pleasant and welcome change of pace. It's gritty and grim, and most importantly, realistic. Gone is the elaborate Gothic architecture that adorns Burton's films. The new Gotham City is packed with trash, corruption, and crime.Christopher Nolan has delivered something I never expected, but am pleasantly surprised about. While the film has minor flaws, such as too many quick cuts from fight scenes and some loose ends, they are minor and don't take away from what is one of, if not the best comic book movie to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Finally a real comic book adaptation for the dark knight  WARNING!(minor spoilers),"I saw Batman Begins on opening day and let me say WOW. I was very impressed at the way this movie was put together. First I would like to give props to director Christopher Nolan (Memento) for creating such a more believable Batman then its predecessors (B, BR, BF, B&R). I like how the first half of the movie focuses on the character of Bruce Wayne and not Batman. This allows viewers to get a more detailed description of why he became Batman and his reason for choosing a Bat as his persona. The Cast was well assembled having the likes of Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne), Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes), and Cillian Murphey (The Scarecrow). But what made this movie work were the more older veteran actors such as Morgan Freeman who plays the helpful Lucius Fox, Rutger Hauer as power hungry Earle, Liam Neeson as the mysterious Henri Ducard/Ra's Al ghul , Gary Oldman as the honest Jim Gorden, and Michael Caine as the insightful Alfred. These characters are the ones the made the story move. I recommend everyone to see this movie. There are many plot twists that only Christopher Nolan can conjure so go see it 4/4 ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Frighteningly superb,"After an excellent film, a great film and two diabolical films, there is finally a brilliant Batman film. Tim Burton's Batman offerings were undeniably superb and eclipsed their follow ups in greatness, but even then there were severe weaknesses in the Batman franchise's transfer from page to the big screen. Burton didn't manage to fully shake Batman's unfortunate ""camp crusader"" persona that the Dark Knight picked up from the terrible 1960s TV series. Though considerably darker, the high camp, pop art undertones that were never intended in the Batman comics were still present in Burton's films. Then of course, ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"" took that to an incredibly unnecessary extreme. Batman was lost. Thank heavens for Christopher Nolan. Obviously as disillusioned with the failing franchise as most of the disgruntled comic book fans, Nolan has managed to not only restore the dark, Gothic ambiance of the comics, but also take Batman to new heights, and ""Batman Begins"" is far more than a comic book adaptation. For the first time in a Batman movie, Bruce Wayne's introduction and character foundation is so fascinating and emotionally charged, that you are not merely waiting for him to put the Bat suit on for the first time. Being the first chapter chronologically in the Batman saga, Wayne's character pre - bat is essential to the success of the narrative. His motive for wanting to fight injustice and his childhood traumas are told so beautifully that the movie would almost work well enough if the Batman alter ego never came into play. But, of course, when he does, Batman really begins. Christian Bale is quite simply the best Batman audiences have ever had the privilege of viewing. For the first time, Batman really is a symbol of fear, as was the comic's intention. This is all thanks to Bale's flawless performance as the dark Knight. Criminals and do-gooders alike fear Batman. But, frightening as he is, he is just another Superhero in terms of fear when it comes to Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. With the genius use of hallucinogens to enhance the fear, Scarecrow might just be the most frightening antagonist since ""The Exorcist's"" demon. The point of view shots from his victims are a more effective alternative to his character than just giving him superpowers. That way, Nolan manages to hold onto the film's overall sense of reality and drama. The film's most effective aspect is the darkness. The stunning set piece creates a nightmarish world that is pure fear incarnate, and with fear being the film's driving force, the darkness is perfectly placed. All of the supporting actors, bar none, are without imperfections in this movie, particularly Katie Holmes, who proves that she is more than a tabloid friendly teen idol. Its just a great shame that her performance in ""Batman Begins"" was very much overshadowed by her bizarre relationship with Tom Cruise. Michael Caine is severely amiable as Alfred, and the eternally impressive Gary Oldman delivers yet another excellent performance. But of course, it is Bale who steals the show. Obviously relishing the role, Bale makes Batman a character we've never had the privilege of meeting before. More than a straight talking superhero armed with one liners. Batman, thanks to Bale, is now an emotionally unstable, fear inducing warrior. Batman Begins is free from superhero clich√© and camp humour. It is, finally, a real Batman movie. The dreaded prison break scene is no less than amazing, and the subsequent parade of justice and optimism, combined with a considerate reference to a legendary Batman enemy, make this film perfect from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What should have been!,"Batman is back and he takes the form and exudes the aura he should have had in the beginning. All previous versions, with mild exception for the first, were travesties that made a lot of money. It is nice to see a movie about a hero that truly shows the battle that they go through in their own minds. In order to understand why they do what they do we must be able to grasp how their minds have become twisted.This movie completely blind-sided me......I was expecting another popcorn superhero movie and walked out of the theater uttering....""Damn!"", over and over again.

Batman Begins is what marvel intended.,"At last it appears evident that Hollywood have listened and made the superhero more believable. Batman through Bale is an honest character easily related to his alter-ego. The enemy is normal (compared to the green goblin and nuclear man!), and the City although futuristic allows the audience a certain mystical sincerity. Bale is strong as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The underpin to the story line depicting how Wayne became Batman is well written and acted. There is of cause the usual moral picture painted through Wayne and his childhood friend emphasizing that revenge is a negative motivation in cleaning up Gotham. Good kit and a great car... 2008 is marked up for the follow up with Bale in the lead role again, keep up the good work and we hope Superman is as REAL.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Landmark in Comic Book Movies,"I don't know about you, but I was tired of comic book films. They turned out to be OK, mindless fun. After a while this gets tiring.This movie, however, is different. It has depth, interesting characters, and an even more interesting story. It's got action, humor, thrills, chills... It has everything you could want in a movie.Critics have had three major complaints: The dialouge, the fight scenes, and the new Batmobile.Dialouge- Yes, there are cheesy one-liners. But come on, this is Batman! Every super hero needs to utter cheesy one-liners as they beat the crap out of a thug and/or supervillan. This part added to the fun factor.Fight scenes- They say the editing was to quick, and you couldn't tell what was going on. They don't realize that this is supposed to happen. When Batman attacks, it is chaotic, and the attacked do not know what is going on.New Batmobile- I loved it. It was actually different. We got away from the sleek design that we had seen again and again... We got something new.All in all, a great film that I definitely recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good action movie!,"I really think that Batman Begins has all the ingredients for a good movie. Interesting characters, nice actors, interesting story, yet I seem to be one of the few reviewer thinking that this movie is merely a good movie not one of the greatest movie of all time. This is a pretty rare opinion, I'm well aware but I can't help missing the great hype here. I'm certainly a fan of superhero movies, but this one feels just like a good adaption of the whole theme, not like a movie revolution.Maybe I do prefer heroes which are a little bit more complex or twisted, let's say Watchmen or Iron Man; in that case you might ignore my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A movie that redefined what a summer blockbuster should be like,"Many wonder why Batman Begins is in the top 100 on IMDb top 250. The answer is simply this: This movie redefined what a summer blockbuster should be like.The summer blockbuster before this was supposed to be a mostly an action/effect based film with a mix of comedy and drama, however the movie in the end was about and memorable for the action and F/X. Batman Begins however, did something different. It had the action, though little F/X. But it made the dramatic elements of the movie just as important as the action. The comedy element stayed the same as it before, thus creating this new genre of film: A dramatic action blockbuster.Nolan and Bale are the two big people to thank for this new genre. Nolan direction and Bale acting combined created this genre that made you think about the world and your actions, BUT IT ALSO was a fun film that entertained you and had great one-liners.The messages that you learn from this are valuable in life and ones most should follow. They are real.However, there is also that fantasy element thrown in this, where your mind is suspended in disbelief, such as the batank ""flying on rooftops."" This element is actually necessary to the film. For without this, the film is just this character-drama. And without the other element, the film is just another action-film. But combined, you get this dramatic-action that you just can't help but love because there are just too many reasons to love it.If you're an ""art house"" guy, you can love the film for the character drama. If you're just a regular movie-goer, you can love it for the action. And if you're like me, who is sort of a mix, you can love it for everything as it has everything from all the genres.Batman Begins may not be considered to be one of the greatest to most, but most can not deny that this film has redefined what a summer blockbuster should be. From now on, all blockbusters quality will be judged upon this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The dark & gritty Batman comes to the big screen,"What we see in this movie is the ""dark & gritty"" (TM) Batman, which was introduced by Frank Miller in 1986 in the comics mini-series Dark Knight Returns, which was an alternate future version of Batman. But Miller also gave the ""real"" comics Batman the dark & gritty treatment in the seminal Batman: Year One story, which is perhaps the greatest Batman story ever created (also because of the effective artwork of the excellent David Mazzuchelli), and which chronicles, among other things, Bruce Wayne's initial (pre-Batman) martial arts training in a remote mountain region. In the comics, a creative force as strong as Frank Miller was bound to yield massive imitation by less original comics creators - and so the early 1990s saw the Batman character getting consistently and increasingly dark & gritty, to the extent that the entire Batman universe was based on that darkness and grit.So the question is, does this work in a movie? Well, in my opinion it didn't even work in the comics, so, no, for this and other reasons I don't think it works in the movie, either. I always preferred the pre-Miller Batman, whose comics were driven by the stories and not simply by mood and style.Batman Begins is not a bad movie. It has many good things. The story has lots of great ideas. Most of the changes to the Bat-mythos were thoughtful and effective. I even loved how the Batmobile had to jump over a moat every time it left and entered the Bat-Cave.Unfortunately, the movie is atrociously directed. Everything is much, MUCH too dark, and considering how bad-looking the terribly cut fight scenes are, the fast-moving action and scatter-shot dialog are particularly grating. Most characters beside Bale's and Neeson's don't have enough to do, or get no significant characterization. Oldman's Gordon is wildly underplayed, and I could never separate Michael Caine from Michael Caine, which I needed to do if I were to find him convincing as Alfred. I think the structure and editing of the movie was terrible, and the decision to make a comic-book movie so dark that you could hardly see what was going on, was a monumentally bad one. It was a decision made, no doubt, to emphasize the medium of the movie over that of the comic, and it made the director attempt to create some kind of art movie - and apparently many people feel he succeeded. I didn't.And I thought the special effects were another big problem. There were too many of them. Why did the plot need a hallucinogenic drug, so faces could twist and horses could breathe fire? Because, I'm certain, the movie-makers felt they had to deliver the special effects spectacular that they thought superhero movie audiences have come to expect. A commercial decision, thus, to blow some dough on unnecessary SPX, just because the audience probably would think it was a cheap and unimportant movie if it didn't have any. So, no, I was not impressed at all; rather the opposite.And unfortunately I have to make one more serious complaint. Ra's Al Ghul was very cool and very well played and everything, but his scheme was ridiculous in the extreme. Through centuries and even millennia his ""league of shadows"" (the actual size of which is never shown) would destroy civilizations (oh, or just cities) at the height of their decadence, like God striking down Sodom and Gomorrah. And now they'd decided that Gotham City should be destroyed? I'm sorry, but I find it ridiculous on at least three levels. First, wouldn't they target more than a single city? What use will it be to destroy one city? But, of course, this would depend on their man-power, which we are never made privy to. Maybe they're just, like, twelve guys. It certainly looks that way. Second, Ra's had been planning to destroy Gotham for, like, twenty years or more?! So, basically, he's been focusing all his resources on just Gotham for at least two or three decades, while events in the rest of the world has had no bearing on the situation? That's preposterous. And third, where's the sense in going in to help exacerbate the decadence and crime and corruption before delivering the death-stroke? They are totally becoming the very thing they would destroy. And sure, they're the bad guys and all, but shouldn't their scheme have SOME modicum of logical coherence? Apparently not. So anyway, not a great, successful movie as far as I'm concerned, but the typical commercial fluff with a hurried narrative and a holey rusted plot, Batman.6 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
one of the best superhero movies ever made,"Batman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.the movie basically tells the story of the genesis of the caped crusader.obviously,there is a fair amount of character development involved,which you would expect based on the title.but not so much that the film becomes tedious.Batman is shown as more of a full dimensional character than in previous incarnations.this version is also more faithful to the comic.Director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a director,pacing the film very well.there are also some touches of humour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce Wayne.The villains are also more fully realized than in most movies of the genre,instead of simply being devices for the hero(the protagonist)to have a villain(antagonist)to defeat.Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are standouts in their respective roles,as is Liam Neeson.Katie Holmes Has yet to reach the level of maturity require for her role,so she is a bit weak.This Batman movie is less cartoonish than previous efforts,and is closer to the realm of realism(relatively speaking)the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting superheros there is much more substance.in fact more substance than style,though it is just stylistic enough.All in all a brilliant depiction of the origin of the caped crusader.this movie sets the bar high for its successor,the Dark Knight,which is to be released sometime in 2008. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best of the Bat,"I believe this is the best Batman film yet. This one explained how he is and what he does better than the original Burton/Keaton film's feel of ""I'm Batman, I can, Deal with it.""

Batman uses fear in such great ways this go around. There were comical moments but not enough to throw off the darkness the film meant to portray.

Great entertainment,"Very fun and entertaining. If you like to go to the movies to have fun...see this film. It has adventure, action, true emotion, brutal realism, interesting characters, and a fun story. I watch a lot of movies, and I have to say that this was the most fun I had at the theater in a long time. Also, if you are a fan of the true dark Batman from the comics, you will be very pleased. This movie fully explains why a man would dress up like a bat and fight crime. When Bruce Wayne finally dons the bat suit, it doesn't seem ridiculous at all. Don't bring young children under 10 or 11 to this movie expecting a campy, goofy film. This film is dark, with brutal violence and very scary images. An example of this would be the character the scarecrow. The Scarecrow uses a fear inducing toxin to make people hallucinate, and you get to see some of the hallucinations. Also the story is quite complicated for a young kid to understand. If you have a tough kid who loves movies, don't worry about it.Overall, this movie was awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Quite simply the best batman to date,"I have to say that after seeing it for the first time I was thrilled. After the second time i confirmed what i thought. this is without a doubt the best batman film ever made. whether you're a fan of the comics or not everyone should love this movie. Anyone who doesn't at least enjoy it somewhat can only be one of those types who always have to go against whatever is popular just for the joy of going against the majority.Bale is the closest Bruce and bats to the comics I've ever seen and i hope he stays on for all of the sequels in the new franchise. Micheal Caine actually turns Alfred from an old nanny to an important character with a lot to add to the story, and the film perfectly sets up why there are so many frigging villains running loose in Gotham, in fact it sets up three specific villains by the films end.I pleas and beg with everyone out there who thinks they're too grownup or cool or just not a comic person, give it a chance i bet you'll love it.

bale!!!!,"who is batman? from now on it is without a doubt in my mind that Christian bale is the ultimate batman. i know this is shocking to hear as Micheal Keaton was moody, dark and superb but bale has something that no other screen batman had, the sense of rage, anger and the actually possibility of snapping emotionally like the original DC comics. Batman always seemed he could snap, and bale, an expert at psychological roles (american psycho, the machinist) actually looks like breaking down in parts of the film. but this film is not just about bale. Bow down to the king of creepy, Cillian Murphy. what a change from the scruffy git in 28 days later to the smirking and outright shocking scarecrow. the first time scarecrow appeared on screen the cinema sounds near threw me from my seat. personally, i can't wait to see him in red eye.then there is Micheal Caine, humorous, confident, great acting (as always) and for the first time relaxed. Alfred is not some posh pompous servant but a helper, an essential part of the team which was neglected in some of the earlier films. there are too many good performances in this film to mention, so i'll leave it with this, marvel have got their work cut out!!!!

I've seen two superhero films this year and enjoyed two superhero films this year, they would be The Incredible Hulk and this one.Batman Begins tried to make a superhero movie realistic, and does a good job of it. It's not cheesy, it's dark and not made for young children.It also has some humour in it too. Alfred often reminded me of Q from the 007 films, witty and funny. The humour in this film saves it from being 100% dark and dry.I'll hopefully be going to the cinema to see ""The Dark Knight"" soon, it looks amazing too and it's supposed to be even better than this one!

A truly impressive comic hero come to life,"Just returned from my very first press screening (thanks to my movie-geek brother having a football tournament today *g*) - and I've got to say, there's something to be said for seeing a movie without commercials and noisy teenagers¬Ö Especially when it's as atmospheric as Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan's vision of how the Dark Knight came into being.I must admit right away that I'm not a real Batman fan - I've seen the Burton/Keaton movies and remember enjoying the old TV show, but that's pretty much it. But I was definitely impressed by this movie and enjoyed every minute of it. Christian Bale makes a beautifully tortured Bruce Wayne and his journey towards becoming Batman rang true. Most of the other characters were also perfectly cast ¬ñ especially Michael Caine as Alfred brings humanity (and humour) to an otherwise pretty dark movie.The only things that can be criticized, in my opinion, are the moments when the movie takes itself too seriously and falls for some clich√©s, which admittedly are hard to avoid with a well-known topic like this. Also, I wasn't too impressed by Katie Holmes as the obligatory (and way too young-looking) childhood sweetheart/damsel in distress. But that might just be me and shouldn't stop anyone from watching this.Batman Begins sheds some interesting perspectives on Batman's past, especially by introducing some of the familiar faces and names in a manner that didn't feel contrived but improved the story (other than in a certain space saga, one might be tempted to say). Awesome popcorn cinema, with a realistic and yet fantastic feel that draws the viewer right into the dark alleys of Gotham City",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

This Movie Raises the Bar for this Genre,"Batman Begins is by far the best comic based movie I've ever seen. I know that is a bold statement but there are a couple of reasons I say this. The depth of character is terrific. The motivation of the nemisis is far more complex than usual. It's not just, ""I'm evil and wanna rule Middle Earth."" Bruce Wayne struggles to become great. His insecurity induces him to strive. He grows as a person and as a hero as the movie develops.Lucas, who's wisest of all characters, Yoda tells Luke, ""Do or do not. There is no try."", a truly silly line as we all know we grow through our failures so long as we don't quit. Bruce's father, by contrast, asks, ""Why do we fall?"" With perfect pause and delivery he continues, ""We fall, so we can learn to pick ourselves up."" This is but one scene where Nolan sets the tone and timing perfectly.The filming, dialog, action, characters, plot and oh yes, the acting are all superb. I rarely leave a movie completely satisfied and almost always have something I'd change. This movie is my first 10. I only wish I possessed the skill to better articulate my appreciation.

The best movie of 2005,"""Batman Begins"" is the best batman film made so far. While Tim Burton's 1989 movie is already a box office classic, Batman Begins has all of the gritty power that made Batman famous in the first place. Chris Nolan has done what Tim Burton and Joel Shumacher couldn't do, which is make a comic book film true to the actual comic. While Nolan's direction is amazing David s. Goyer's script is great.The film starts with a tortured Bruce Wayne traveling the world, when he meets his soon to be mentor Henri Ducard played by Liam Nesson. his training wins him a spot on Ra's Al Ghul's League of Shadows. Bruce decides to pass on the proposal and heads back to Gotham. Soon we see Bruce transform into a fierce hero bent on cleaning up his city.The film's supporting cast including Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine make Batman Begins far more than just a kids movie. The only mediocre part of the film comes as Katie Holmes's performance as Rachel Dawes. Other than that, this picture is worth watching over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman has been saved!!!,"I knew from the beginning of production of this film that the Batman franchise and legacy was in good hands. Although the choice of Christopher Nolan as the director is an unconventional one...I knew he could make crap into gold with his talents. The cast is unbelievable, the special effects are dazzling enough that they don't steal from the story like in previous superhero films. Also unlike previous superhero films(namely the other Batman films) they don't hand the movie over to a mega-star actor as an over-the-top villain. They rather give talented actors enough screen time to get their character across.The story was very much true to the comic book. It explains the origins of the character of Bruce Wayne, and proves that you don't need to be ""Superpowered"" to become a super-hero. The film starts with Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale), as a hermit traveling the world (mostly in areas reminiscent to Japan) starting fights with thugs and petty criminals to shadow over his guilt over the death of his parents, Thomas Wayne (played with sincerity by Linus Roache) and Martha Wayne. He is greeted by the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson),who promises that he and a legendary warrior Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) can teach him to turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. Bruce takes him up on his offer and learns to become a warrior of justice. But when he is asked by his mentor, Ducard, to kill a prisoner, he refuses...claiming that his compassion is the only thing that separates he and his enemies. Bruce is nearly killed as a result, only to survive and return to Gotham and become the hero he was born to be.He begins with his Bat-Suit, weaponry, etc., and of course the Tumbler (bat-mobile). Along for the ride are his trusty Butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), the head of science divisions at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), the only decent Cop left in Gotham, Sgt. Gordon (Gary Oldman), and his old flame, now the assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (the ever annoying Katie Holmes). Things are worse than ever in Gotham...Carmine Falcone, a mobster, owns most of the city's officials, and as he runs drugs and gambling, those officials turn a blind eye to his malevolence. Things get extra precarious when Falcone sparks up a deal with Dr. Jonathon Crane aka The Scarecrow and his employer...Ra's Al Ghul. Now Batman must put his trust in his allies's hands and turn his fear on his enemies to save Gotham from a Truly horrific fate.Most of the performances are nothing short of incredible. Bale shines as the caped crusader and Bruce Wayne. Proving that he can play characters other than say American Psychos. Bale shows many different sides to Bruce. You can tell by looking in Bale's eyes that his innocence has been shed long before it should have and now he only has his fear to guide him. As Batman, he does something different. Unlike Michael Keaton (still one of the best), Val Kilmer, or George Clooney...Bale shields his voice by sounding and behaving almost like a vicious animal, creating a voice that sounds like Alec Baldwin after drinking one too many shots of vodka. Caine does an Oscar worthy job as Alfred. He does more justice to the character, showing him as more a father figure than just a hand servant. Caine especially can nearly bring tears to your eyes when he speaks of how he'll never give up on Bruce. Liam Neeson didn't really surprise me with his Jedi-like mentor of a character in the beginning, I just saw it as Neeson being Neeson, but he really proved me wrong by the end of the film. (Spoiler ahead) Neeson returns at the end of the movie only under his real name...Ra's Al Ghul. Not surprising considering he looks and sounds like the character from the comic books. Neeson goes from teacher and father figure to oozing with villainy and suave sophistication in his fight scenes w/ Bale.As for the supporting cast...Morgan Freeman is fantastic as a no nonsense scientist at Wayne Enterprises. Freeman adds an elegance, strength, and above all, presence to this movie with very little screen time...much like Marlon Brando in Superman. As for Katie Holmes ...she does what she has to do in the whole ""...it's what you do that defines you."" fortune telling crap, which I really didn't care too much for. But, in the end, her character comes off more as a self-centered pain, who wants to be noticed as a hero, which is not the way her character was most likely supposed to be played as. Gary Oldman does what Neeson does...he plays against type. Neeson is usually cast as a mentor/good guy...and now shines as a heavy. Oldman is usually cast as a psychotic and over-the-top villain...but he now plays a sincere and trust worthy cop...and works great with Bale. From the first shot of Oldman as Gordon, consoling young Bruce after his parent's death, you get the feeling that he's a good man, one with a conscience and dignity. Murphy does an especially good job as the Scarecrow...many would complain of his reality based re-creation...but i think it was the only way to do it without turning the Scarecrow into a cartoon character. Murphy also emits a great villainous flare with the delivery of lines like ""The Bat-man."" Tom Wilkinson and Rutger Hauer contribute well to their side-villain performances. Wilkinson seems to enjoy himself with his Italian, tough guy accent, and Hauer fits the role of a greedy, corporate S.O.B. very well. As for Ken Watanabe, he fills out quite well as the ""Ra's Al Ghul"" we meet in the beginning. Iv'e always admired Watanabe and his choice to play such a small but vital cameo still puzzles me. Never the less, after his ""Gotham must be destroyed speech."" I don't think I could see anyone else play the villainous role like that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Oh well, my rant here contains more 'remarks' than actual criticism, so I'm going to spill my guts anyway. Although a very good film (and definitely a vast improvement over those dreadful Joel Schumacher films¬Ö) there's something essential missing in Christopher Nolan's reprising of the Batman-franchise: comic-book darkness! Whether intended or not, ""Batman Begins"" doesn't seem to take place in an imaginary world where good battles evil but in a real-life drama setting where every individual has to fight for survival¬Ö Basically not a bad idea at all, but it's not exactly the ideal setting to have a man flying around, wearing a bat-suit. Bruce Wayne ought to be a superhero but instead he's an emotionally and physically vulnerable man with phobias and no sense of morbid humor. Also, the gimmicks and designs are a lot less exhilarating than they should be. For example: the Bat-mobile here is nothing but a car-tuned Hum-V and Gotham City looks an awful lot like an (even more) pauperized version of New York. Yes, the script is very solid and the cast is terrific¬Öbut by no means this ""new"" Batman can live up to the unequaled and blackly ingenious Tim Burton movies that launched the hype about 15 years ago. The film's opening (featuring a young Bruce Wayne on a meditation tour in Tibet) is long and complex but very interesting and a rewarding intro to the new Batman myth. When the story is then transferred to Gotham city, the movie becomes more action-packed and the class-A cast receives the opportunity to show off their talents. I particularly liked Gary Oldman in the (for him) awkward role of honest cop, Tom Wilkinson as the mighty underworld gangster and Rutger Hauer as the greedy and corrupt business manager. I personally found Michael Caine to be unfunny and sophomoric in his role of Alfred the butler and it was sad to see the role of Scarecrow played by a bizarre young nerd.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best Batman ever... is still the cartoon. But this still beats nearly all the live-action versions.,"On the surface, there's nothing really wrong with ""Batman Begins"" that replacing a sorely miscast Katie Holmes wouldn't cure (perhaps she's in the cast because they felt they had to have someone American there besides the excellent Morgan Freeman). It's very dark, very thoughtful and ideally cast almost from top to toe, with Christian Bale making a fine Bruce Wayne and Batman, Michael Caine giving the movie some genuine warmth as Alfred (and pretty much stealing the movie, along with Freeman's Lucius Fox), and it never treats the audience as anything less than adults.But what keeps me from exulting over this as much as many others is director Christopher Nolan's approach; his desire to keep it real - most reflected in the new Batmobile; goodbye stylish long gas-guzzler, hello compact all-terrain vehicle which, frankly, is quite ugly - makes ""Batman Begins"" ultimately sacrifice excitement in favour of grittiness, and the movie pays for it in the third act. The first two-thirds are enough to make it better than all the other live-action Batman movies except Tim Burton's first effort, for sure - but the exploration into Bruce's psyche and what made him become the Caped Crusader, complete with training at the hands of a Ramirez-meets-Obi-wan Kenobi type played by Liam Neeson, comes at the expense of the villains (notably a terrific Cillian Murphy).While there's very creepy imagery, and the decision of Nolan and primary screenwriter David S. Goyer to not allow the villains to upstage the hero is a wise one, there's such a thing as space - ""Spider-Man 2"" proved that you can develop the bad guys without sacrificing the hero, and that really needed to be done here. That, plus some very non-thrilling action moments, means that you're admiring the proceedings without getting truly pumped up. (And the less said about the disappointing score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, the better.)This is still very much worth seeing, but the hands-off, clinical approach means the 1992 animated series is still the Dark Knight to beat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Dreadful Beyond Belief,This movie was absolutely dreadful. Christian Bale as Batman was just absolutely ridiculous not to mention Michael Caine with his accent. There were several points in the movie I burst out laughing at Bale's delivery of lines. It was like he practically growled as if to sound menacing. I think the public at large just has no idea what is an accurate portrayal of Bob Kane's comic character. To me the closest I think was the original 1989 Batman movie. The absurdity of Batman Begins was how serious it was trying to be which made you laugh at it rather than with it. The Scarecrow was the most disappointing villain of any of the previous Batman films. He was completely boring and just downright stupid. This film was such a complete insult to the fans who have stuck with the movie series through the good sequels and the bad. Unfortunately a new generation of children think this is cooler than a Batman that makes much more sense and has an element of fun to it. Tedious and bland is the only way to describe this new reinvention of the Dark Knight. Next!,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Refreshing!,"This film is a whole lot different than the other Batman films.I was never a fan of Batman films, but my friends told me that this film is really good, so i decided to go to the cinema and watch it myself.I was surprised by the difference between this film and the previous Batman films i watched.The film has a really good story, The fights are great, the Bat-gadgets are all there, the car (tank) is amazing, the plot is thorough and exciting and there is some nice humor throughout the film that make it that i have enjoyed the film very much.I am really looking forward to see the new Batman film in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Best of the Batman films so far.  Deep, dark, and refreshingly serious","I never thought Christian Bale could displace Michael Keaton as the best batman, but, sorry Michael, the deed is done.Batman fans should find no surprise in the darkness of this tale depicting the early life of Bruce Wayne, his transformation into The Batman, and one of his most harrowing adventures. I avoided reading reviews before seeing this. As a lifelong comics fan, I felt this film deserved an open mind from me. After seeing one of the trailers, I became convinced that this film was going to be based on Frank Miller's The Dark Knight, a legendary take on the 1930s Batman origin story inked in the 80s by the man who later gave us Sin City. But no, this is a fresh and original Batman film, including the significant elements of the original, but adding its own very carefully thought out embellishments. While it has all of the darkness of The Dark Knight, it has all of the plot elements of the original, and more.The familiar Batman story is told early in the film, but by the time we are allowed to focus on Wayne, he has grown into a young man. Wayne is depicted as a troubled drifter whose traumatic early life has left him seeking understanding in all of the wrong places. Bayle plays the character to the hilt - with his detachment, repressed anger and heavily depressive tendencies sustained throughout the entire film. Susceptible to any guidance that might provide him with a chance to right the wrongs he has seen, he falls under the spell of Ra's Al Ghul high in the Bhutanese Himalayas and becomes an apprentice in the League of Shadows - a secret society of ninjas who purge the world of corruption in a merciless manner. Wayne's martial arts training is where the major story arc begins.This is easily the most serious, intelligent, and adult of the batman films. It is well filmed, relentlessly fast-paced and intelligently scripted. Batman Begins also sports a phenomenal cast. I am aware that a few people felt that Katie Holmes was miscast as Rachel Dawes, but I couldn't agree less. She did a good job as, basically, the only woman in the film. The rest of the cast did not miss a beat either. The very likable Michael Caine makes a great Alfred, though I have to admit I was concerned when I first saw him on screen (having never gotten over some of his weaker efforts).With Sin City and Batman Begins coming out in the same year, it is easy to imagine that - after decades of struggle - the comic media has finally successfully broken into serious commercial films. Let's hope it's here to stay!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best Batman movie to date,"This is probably the best Batman movie to date, because it wasn't flashy like Joel Schumacer made in the last two. Also it wasn't extremely dark like Tim Burton made the first two. The cast lived up to my expectation which were very high, like they all for all movies. Now George Clooney sucked as Batman, so did Val Kilmer, Michael Keaton was good, but Christian Bale rocked. He had the charm of Bruce Wanye, and the badassness of Batman. Michael Caine as Alfred was just so genius, and putting Morgan Freeman in the movie was just amazing. He (Morgan Freeman) was just so great.So all in all I highly recommend fans and non-fans to see this movie, you will be amazed at the depth of the story and just the pure greatness of the way it was crafted.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A refreshing New Batman Start,"First of all, I have to say that I enjoyed the previous Batman series, directed by Tim Burton for several and then by Joel Schumacher. As good as that series was, this start of a new series would fall flat if all it does was copy the last one.But this series (and it will be a series it seems) certainly has its differences. It was less fantasy based and more realistic. To be sure, Batman still does some pretty amazing things. But this time, at least some of it seems more believable. At the start, Batman even loses a few fights - at least as Bruce Wayne. And he even seems to have a few fears. And Gotham City, almost appears to be similar to a real city. This Batman is more realistic, somewhat similar to the Spiderman series that is also going on. In both cases, the audience knows that the hero is still human and actually has a chance of losing and is concerned about that.This realistic approach works, and works well. Not only did our group greatly enjoy the movie, but we are very much looking forward to the next ones in the series. The acting, casting and direction were well done. And of course the action was both creative and fun - as one might expect.The premiere that I went to see was not as crowded as one might expect. However, those people that were there stood up and applauded at the end of the movie. One seldom sees that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
absolutely brilliant,"I'm shocked that the film i loved when i was a kid, has come back in such a way, especially after the terrible forever film. what can i say that already hasn't been said, everything about this film was brilliant apart from Katie(child looks), but she cant help that. i recommend that everyone goes out and watches this film, it makes all the other superhero films fall short in comparison(including spider man). also what i like to say is that all the comments i heard before the film was launched have been blown out of the water, such comments as ""it will terrible because it has a British batman"". how wrong they where, with the film being of mostly British and by having a British director really paid off, it was made how it should have been and not hollywooded up like the originals. why the film is still of Hollywood it seems they are looking at us brits to bring the life back into movies which has been missed i.e LOTR, Harry potter, and with many more in the works all i can say is keep it up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"Very good, but missing something?","I have to admit that I had really high expectations of this movie, Christian Bale was the perfect candidate to revive the Bat franchise, Christopher Nolan surely had something fresh to bring to the prequel (Joel Schumacher we will never forgive you).Overall this film looks great, if a tad bit depressing in places. Nolan does a perfect job of the performances, (Michael Caine, on excellent form, though a little underused....I thought). Sadly Nolan fails in the action department, and this lets the whole film down for me. When Batman kicks ass the fight scenes are poorly framed choppily edited and annoying to watch.A decent second unit director should have definitely been considered, I'm not asking for Yeun Wo Ping to bring in the strings, but having someone who knows how to frame a fight sequence would have helped.Many of the blockbusters have suffered this year because of poor action choreography. Revenge of the Syth looked great, but again George Lucas can not direct a decent lightsaber duel to save his life. The ultimate face off between Annakin and Obe would have been outstanding if George had of brought someone in who knew what they were doing, poor camera angles, missed opportunities, no sense of danger or struggle, (Samuel J we will forgive you, but you did look like a muppet, and yeeees!!! you did go out like a sucker!!!) To get back to Batman, I'm not slogging this movie off, I will be definitely adding this to my DVD collection, but why spend all that money on a good looking movie when the fight scenes look like they where done by the numbers. If this where my movie, I would be gutted pass off action sequences like that.8 out of 10, might have got 9.5 had the action delivered!!!

Good direction for future installments,"After Batman & Robin I have not counted that I would see anything worse (or better for that matter) with Batman on the big screen. And, surprise surprise, here it is - a good Batman movie, with great Christian Bale as Bruce W., and fantastic Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon (he finally got a positive character, that nut). And it's just the top of the great names here, followed by Rudger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine as Alfred.The movie itself is much more comics-faithful than any previous part. It's dark and bleak, although not that sinister as Batman comics can be (especially from the post-Frank Miller era). We finally can have a good look on Gotham and how vast it is. I didn't like though the bad guys, one of which is a loser with a bag on his head, and the other a former Jedi master, who also happened to train Bruce Wayne in martial arts.

"Great, fast, myth-making, beautifully filmed...a Nolan movie about Batman","Batman Begins (2005)I saw this for a second time last night as kind of homework before seeing ""Dark Knight Rises"" and it is a marvel of movie-making, for sure. It's also filled with crazily exaggerated legends and it gives depth to many characters who have become as important to Batman as the evil enemies he faces. It has a few sections that are expository that slowed it down, but not for long, and some of the action scenes are astonishing technical feats.This is the first in what has turned out to be a trilogy, and it begins at the beginning, much like movies have done for Spiderman and Superman. Besides being far-fetched (the ninja fighters training our wandering orphan in some mountain retreat are the same ones who sacked Rome, etc.), it at first creates a different kind of movie, less about fighting evil than developing the skills and psychology to be superhuman. And those blue poppies they inhale--well, they comes into play later, too.So Bruce Wayne gets initiated, returns to Gotham, and slowly gets his equipment compiled, much of it stuff concocted by the wily and reassuring Mr. Fox, played by Morgan Freeman. The butler, played by Michael Caine, is in on the secret duality of our man from the start, and helps him in both practical and moral-boosting ways. It's all exciting and yet warm at the same time. You really wish there was such a Batman, with friends.Where the movie thins out, even as the action gets increasingly over the top, is even the slightest logic to the plot. You really have to just say, okay, this is a comic book world, and there really might be a plot to destroy Gotham simply because it's reached its peak of civilization. And there really might be a little machine with enough microwave power to vaporize the entire water system of the city. Just go with it.Certainly we have no trouble believing Batman can come and go like magic, glide with beautiful memory fabric wings, and shoot his rescue rope (like Spiderman) into faraway nooks. We all want to do this, and Christopher Nolan, the director, makes it dramatic like few others have. As many have written, this is the second best adventure hero movie ever. That might be true--there are a few others in line in my book--but it is probably easier to agree that the second in the trilogy, ""The Dark Knight,"" is better than them all.But this led to that, and it's a great movie for this type. I mean, there are different kinds of movies that might leave you moved and even changed afterwards. Those are great movies. This one is a great movie experience, pure unapologetic entertainment. With lots of human moments and enough depth you can even watch it twice. I just did, and it worked.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Stunningly good,"It's not merely the best Batman movie, it's quite possibly the best comic-book movie ever crafted. Seeing it on the big screen last night was a thrill, the kind of thrill provided by the original ""Star Wars"" or ""Raiders.""Breathtaking cinematography combines with genius editing to replicate the comic experience in a way no movies have-- the experience of gorgeous art telling a tale in panels that aren't necessarily sequential nor do the spell out what's happening in a pedestrian way.I'd suspect that Frank Miller would be impressed by this film.The action sequences are so well-crafted and presented in such a unique way, I was reminded of the feeling I got watching the U-Boat landing in the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan."" The difference is that Spielberg shot his wad in those first grueling minutes and was unable to return to that momentum during the rest of ""Ryan."" In the case of ""Batman Begins,"" Nolan teases us with an ingenious prison fight sequence that is actually built upon--even topped--as the movie progresses.This is finest E-Ticket ride, a roller-coaster that builds momentum to a thrilling conclusion that leaves the audience in wild applause. An intelligent, complex, brilliantly executed piece of film-making that just so happens to present the most authentic picture of the Dark Knight we've ever seen. Go ahead, file away that old 1989 copy of Tim Burton's ""Batman""-- there's a new sheriff in town and his name is Christopher Nolan.It just doesn't get any better than this.

Excellent Way To Begin A New Franchise,"Going into the theater I had a lot of high expectations for Batman Begins. I am a die hard fan of the Batman movie franchise that started with Michael Keaton, and I was hoping that Christopher Nolan would breathe life back into the lungs of a fading dynasty. Keaton's Batman, was a very dark films, yet Bale's depiction takes it to an even darker level. This Batman is more of a man than an impervious superhero. Batman Begins depicts not only Batman the hero, but also the man who is trapped behind the mask. Christian Bale's Batman is the most intense and ruthless Batman yet. He seems to be the Batman straight out of Arthur Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"". He is more violent, more angry, and seemingly more vengeful than any Batman of his time. It was a real treat to see a Batman movie that deals directly with Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman, as opposed to flirting around the premise of simply being out for justice. This movie was less focusing on the action sequences (which were exhilarating) and more on the character development, which is the true heart of the Batman legacy. Batman Begins was a beautifully made movie, with powerful dialogs and excellent acting. It was so worth the ticket price that I wouldn't have minded having to pay for a few guests. Can't wait for a sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A kick up the arse to the whole franchise,"I am reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of either loving or hating this film, because it appears that is the popular thing to do when reflecting on the films of 2005. I still feel that it is worthy of a great deal of praise as it brought new life to Batman after a series of failed films in the 90s.This is the story of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), the man behind the mask, and how he came to be Batman. When he returns to Gotham City after a long time of absence in an unnamed Eastern country, he is met by a brutally corrupt world of organized crime and few traces of the city his parents once built. Bruce isn't fighting one villain like most superheroes, but an entire hierarchy of bad guys.As far as superhero films are concerned, Batman Begins is a fantastic achievement. It features an equally fantastic cast and while each actor perhaps does not get to shine to their fullest in their respective parts, you feel the weight of such a respected ensemble at all times. It is also a positive thing that every individual cast member does not overshadow the film and instead they are almost chameleon-like in their parts, like Gary Oldman as inspector Gordon. They all just add up to the greatness of Batman Begins. The film is not completely flawless in its casting or in all respects for that matter (Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes were simply not good) but these 'flaws' are are not really harmful for an otherwise great film.Batman Begins has all the lighthearted comedic relief that is necessary for a successful superhero film AND complexity and darkness to give it depth. Best of all, it never varies between these extremes, but has an even balance of comedy and tragedy throughout. I did not like Spider-Man because it was too stupid and I did not like Hulk because it was too dark. Well, I have found my favourite in Batman Begins and it brings the best of both worlds. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
New Beginning,"As a longtime fan of the Batman comic I am always glad to hear a new Batman movie. The amazing thing about the Batman character over most other super heroes is that Batman has NO powers. He is just a guy, a rich guy yes, but not super human in any respect. Unlike Superman or most other titans, this guy can be killed and won't come back from the dead, of course the comic brings in new writers and they start another story line parallel for the character.Which is what Batman Begins is all about, a new take.I am a big fan of the Tim Burton Batman film. Batman Returns is a good movie, but it didn't work as good and wasn't as much fun as the first film. The Joel Schumacher films pretty much turned it into a ride at Universal Studios Orlando. Batman and Robin was a sad deprecation of a once great character. Bruce Wayne and Batman had only a small cameo in a movie that seemingly tried to fit every Batman villain in the past 30 years into some part.Thank you David Goyer and Christopher Nolan. Essentially they have turned Batman into a Michael Mann film. Batman Begins is the story about a man who has a tough job to do in a dirty place. He isn't a machine and doesn't live in a video game. We know why he does what he does. For the first time since the first Spiderman, we get an action movie that tells us why the character is in action. The insert scenes of flashbacks of Bruce with his father go a long way in adding up our main character.Thanks to a beautiful, forceful score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard the brood of Gotham and the force of the Batman character come to life in a big way.All the actors in the movie play their necessary parts and because they are all so distinguished, we never question if they are even necessary to the plot, frankly we don't care. All the actors are so good we want to see them on screen and just hang out. It is the same feeling I got when I was a kid watching Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, John Wayne and Walter Brennan sit in a jail and sing just to pass the time in Rio Bravo. Good work by all involved.Comparisons to the elder Batty film of 1989 will come up. Which one is better? Not sure, I think Nicholson was so dang good as Joker for me its a hard call to see anybody reprising that role. Overall I think both films compliment each other.Just as legends in history can be told and retold with pieces of the story changing every time, comic book stories that are so well grounded like Batman can be retold.The band may be different, but the song remains the same.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Comicbook fans will feel a bit annoyed by some oft points, but's good enough. It's dark and how Batman is supposed to be. Keep in mind this is better than the last four by a landslide.

"The darkest, deepest,  most mysterious Superhero film ever!","Well, I had heard great things about it, ans since I want to see The Dark Knight later in July, I decided to view it...Yes, it is based on a DC superhero, but this film is certainly anything but 'a fun action blockbuster'. The film starts off with a Bruce Wayne, and it keeps going, so as the audience can see a bit of Bruce's past. I thought these scenes, giving Bruce a lot of development as so we can care about him, they were very well done. They have a certain different 'tone' than other blockbusters, and certainly different than other great Marvel superhero films like Spider-Man and Iron Man. I cannot compare it to those, because I found those to be perfect blockbusters. They were fun and were greatly-written. This film, is really not just fun. From the beginning, it starts off deep. Bruce Wayne is certainly thought over before the film was made, and since I have never read a Batman comic before, I cannot compare it. This film is more about the meaning of one man. It is about self-discovery(reminded me of Spider-Man 2's theme).BUT it is not just about that. The film explores into a deeper meaning, among a huge city called 'Gotham'. The struggles that this city is going through, a certain 'depression', the film explores human motives. This is where the crime takes place. Never before had I seen this type of film really go into crime a lot. Unlike other Marvel films, there is no really 'one villain' that the superhero has to fight. There is more like interwined crimes taking place. The film explores crimes that go in a city, crimes that have to do with mind-manipulation and court orders. I found myself thinking about Tom Wilkinson's role in 'Michael Clayton'. I thought his role here was a bit similar. And just like in Michale Clayton, he gives a very good performance. As a matter of fact, everyone gives a great performance. Liam Neeson starts strong in the beginning of the film, and other criminals, that include Cillian Murphy, also surprised me. Cillian Murphy, I believe, is a very underrated actor. Christian Bale gives all his best for the role of Bruce Wayne. He really portrays his deep meanings and thoughts well, as his character changes throughout. Morgan Freeman does a very nice job, his character is sort of not as 'dark' as the others. The only person who I was spectacle about was Katie Holmes. She wasn't a bad actress, but in her first scene, her voice annoyed me. But as the film continues, I got used to it. She did a nice job, and we could really feel for her. Of course, the reason the actors are great is because of the amount of quality in the screenplay. Sure, it did seem a bit 'comical' at times, but hey, it IS based on a comic book, and it was still very dark oriented. I liked that this film had a lot of deep meanings. It stands out from other action films, because it really is about something else. It works as a thriller very well too. So many scenes rely on suspense. It is also a mystery, and the important thing, is that it keeps us hooked. And it does!!! It does not have a lot of unrealistic action scenes. All the action scenes are very well done. If the Academy Awards had a category for Best stuntwork(it should) this film would win it. There were really not many visual effects. I'm glad it did not rely on it so much. Films don't need so much of it to be good, as this film proves. All in all, this is one of the best action films I have ever seen. I have to say, it ranks up there with Spider-Man 2 as the best superhero film ever, and maybe, in terms of long terms, it might win after some time. After seeing this film, I cannot wait for The Dark Knight!!!! It looks even darker and deeper, and in this Batman world, that is really what me and more fans are looking for in terms of quality...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Well worth a look,"Once again, director Chris Nolan has produced another stunning addition to the film industry. Having never really been a fan of comic-book films, i was reluctant to watch any of the batman films, however i must admit i was drawn in rather easily to the ""Dark Knight"" franchise. Perhaps viewing the sequel before this instalment is not the best approach, however i was so surprised by the breath-taking quality of ""Dark Kinght"" that viewing the prequel seemed the only sensible option. With stunning camera-work and highly effective lighting, the production team have created an environment scourged by crime and corruption, and successfully highlight the ""evasive"" nature of the batman to a superb standard, adding a subtle humour to the script which draws a dry smile to almost any face. Christian Bale is sterling in the title role, providing both the hard-man attitude to drive the justice-seeker of batman, but also the charming and sociable everyday man he appears to be on an average day. In recruiting such actors as Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson to support the main man, Nolan has ensured that every role is carried through by top class acting, with both believable and easily likable characters. The film takes a while to get going as the first scenes seem irrelevant until the story develops, and the 'Eastern' nature of these scenes may put some people off the viewing, but staying to watch the whole movie is definitely recommended A great story, fantastic acting and stunning special-effects, Batman Begins is a perfect tribute to the Dark Knight franchise and a fitting exploration of the origins of the man behind the mask",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Utter Waste of Time,"A lot of little fanboys rigged the rating for this lackluster sequel. This is no way as good as they want you to think it is. It's a complete joke. There are so many elements of this film that are just all wrong. Christian Bale was basically playing his ""American Psycho"" character in a bat suit. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were brought in as window dressing. Freeman looked like he was slumming it and all in all out of place. All I kept thinking the whole time he was on screen is why is he in a Batman film? Is this really a Batman film? The reality is it's another completely different movie made to appear like Batman. Not much of the plot made a whole lot of sense. And as for Katie Holmes? I was wondering even more aloud why she was in a Batman film. Oh the agony of all. This movie sucked and the fanboys just can't admit to themselves. Overall it was a rethink that was a complete waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Incredible, more than what I expected.","I was really in a hopeful mood when I went to see Batman Begins. I was measuring the movie, not against Schumacher's previous Bat-films, but by the Loeb/Lee ""Hush"" storyline in the Batman comic books, simply because that comic story is better by far. This, I must say, is the the best Batman movie yet. It really blew my mind. There was character, depth ... they really did their best to figure out why of all things would a vigilante dress up as a bat and fight crime in a metropolis. Their effort shows. Warner may have pumped more into the marketing than they could have possibly done, but they have the quality movie to prove it. I myself have to say if there is one Batman movie you must see in your lifetime, this should be it.This is Batman, rewritten for modern times, and how he came to fight crime in Gotham City.Murphy does an excellent job as the Scarecrow. They pulled off the League of Shadows as well without it looking too much. Christian Bale is excellent. You can tell there was high hopes for this movie and I don't know how production did it but this is a Batman movie everyone will enjoy.

I can name major and minor aspects of the movie that hit bullseye on everything to do with Batman. All the original 4 Batmans are crap compared to this one. And yes, it really does out beat the first movie. I don't care what anyone says, Joker doesn't even stand a chance against this version of Batman. The one thing that people overlook about being a Batman fan and a critic of this movie is the fact that at the end of the movie. Batman chose to deal out his version of justice. Batman was and has been in between good and evil from the Year One comics. For people who saw this movie, he chose to do what he did at the end of the fight in the train. That was and still is Batman's version of justice. I am so proud of this movie that I'm not going to download it and I will respect the copyright of it and will wait for this movie to come out on DVD. This movie deserves your $7.50. I plan on seeing it again this weekend and next paycheck. This really is the movie that you have been waiting for. This is a movie of a lifetime that will truly represent future superhero movies to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the Best Comic Adaptations Ever,"Saw an early screening of Begins this weekend and I must say, it lived up to my expectations.Something had to be done to rescue our hero's good name. Thankfully, Batman Begins, the start of a whole new series chronicling the origins of the Caped Crusader - does all that and more.Where Burton's Batman claimed to be dark, this one is genuinely menacing. It's a violent and truly scary film.Everyone in the movie does a great job in their role ( except Kate Holmes which had more to do with the character then her ) the movie is a trumph of epic proportions. It doesn't leave out much to the imagination, everything is set up to the last drop.One of the best comics adaptations ever and I cant wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Almost Perfect.......still beyond my expectations,"I went seeing this movie already knowing too much about it. I had read the leaked script almost a year ago. Had avidly followed every news about it. But I was surprised to find the movie to be so fresh for me.The biggest strength of the movie is that it is reality based. The movie bases the myth of Batman in a real world. Maybe it demystifies batman a bit too much. But its a very entertaining to watch how they pull off a believable masked vigilante in a city which could be New York City.The cast is impeccable. Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is a study of study of a troubled should tormented by the anger and despair of not being able to avenge his parents' mindless murder. His Batman is certainly the most accurate till date. He portrays it like a madman looking who believes that he really is more than human. The support cast is fabulous. Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Michael Cain, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Cilian Murphy play the characters so well that I totally bought some of the lines which might sound a little over the top otherwise. Katie Holmes is bearable, she does enough to do justice to a well written character. Though I would have preferred the character to be Harvey Dent. Cilian's Scarecrow is really creepy.The action sequences could have been done better, but still are very entertaining. The Batmobile car chase is really thrilling. The fight sequences are brutal but a bit too speedily edited.The ending leaves you wanting for more. There would surely be sequels.The movie really captures the essence of Batman. One of the best lines is delivered by Katie Holmes at the end. She says to Bruce something to the effect of ""This is your mask, the real you is Batman"". That to me is the essence of the myth that is Batman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good but Not Great,"18 June 2005. I didn't go rushing into this movie, my wife made me. Thus, as soon as I could I was looking for things I didn't like about Batman Begins and naturally I found plenty of problems with the movie.First off, let me say, I think that the whole switch to quality production and the look of the movie was great (though I still prefer comic adaptations to be more comic-like such as Sin City). The basic storyline and the substantive backbone of this movie is superior in terms of past Batman versions. This was a good movie but it had its major problems.The first thing that made me uneasy was the very first image of bats (that were not realistic). The second thing that made me uneasy was the use of the flashback technique. Personally for a movie like this, it would have flowed much better in linear, chronological order so I didn't have to bounce back and forth, I wanted to see the beginnings of Batman along with Bruce Wayne as he experienced it. There was so much development, that unfortunately, the length of the movie made it prohibitive to really fill out the details of Bruce's personal growth. I found the editing jumpy and uneven, disorienting, I felt there were too many gaps in Bruce's experiences..Mr. Wayne found this rare flower so easily, climbed the mountain was easily. His martial arts training was a pale version of Elecktra's or for that matter Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas or even Karate Kid.Mr. Waynes transformation into billionaire playboy didn't seem natural and just happened suddenly from one scene to the next.The martial arts, there really wasn't any scene with anything that could be considered quality fighting - it was all a blur. My hats off to Jennifer Garner and Angelina Jolie both of whom really took their fighting practice to heart. The car chase scene again was pure copy, especially the two shots where the cars are lined up in a formation pattern, aligned for the chasing cars that really appears artificial.Gary Oldman didn't have the script lines that would allow him to really breakout in this movie - as the comic relief, there was the possibility to really shine.Cillian Murphy was the most intriguing character in this movie, one par with Sin City's Elijah Wood's performance.Some of the dialogue, some of the scenes just didn't work for me...the kingpin being so easily ensnared by Cillian Murphy's doctor role. The fight in the beginning of the film with the League of Shadows just seemed too little and too much at the time. I would have settled for the whole building to blow up and Bruce Wayne simply escape, but instead we get this not to believable beam falling to end matters and the fight scene just didn't seem to merit the supposed ability of the master.The first time we get to see the Batmobile jumping roofs (but the first instance the audience doesn't actually get to see the first jump).The strength of this movie like Spiderman is that we get to experience superheros but vulnerable in a real, genuine way.I enjoyed this movie but not as much as others. It was substantive and reflected the essence of Batman. But in its actual presentation, there were too many holes for me to enjoy it completely.

The Perfect Batman Movie,"The best batman movie by far. Everything they did was spot on. From the murder of Bruce Waynes parents, to his training to even how he became batman. I saw elements of Frank Miller's novels and the original batman comics. Very impressed. As for the gadgets, only the bat boomerang was missing, although they perhaps tried to introduce a more realistic gadget in the bat stabber. The reason why this movie is so successful is because it tells you everything you need to know about batman. Many people forget that Batman is a detective, in this film you saw Batman doing investigative work. Batman also installs fear and interrogates his opponents you saw that in this movie. However one thing I was deeply impressed with that the film highlighted was that Bruce Wayne is the disguise. In the comics Bruce acts like a drunker billionaire to protect the people closest to him. Batman is his real persona. I've read other reviews and some of them are complaining wheres the fun, its too serious. Thats the whole point, Batman is dark and grim and Gotham in the comic books is considered to be one the worst cities in America. All I have got to say is go and see this movie. This really is the beginning of Batman, this is how it should be. So where does the franchise go from here. It would be nice if they could introduce Nightwing and the Tim Drake version of Robin. As for villains, they could use firefly, ventriloquist, Mad Hatter or maybe even Sin Ztu introduced in the latest batman game (and of course the joker). Bane would be good but only if they used him properly. I hope more DC comic book films are made,then they could do a justice league movie. Now that would really be a smash hit. As for Batman, welcome back to the big time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
beginning is great but computers took over in last fourth,"We have had so many batmans that rehash the same stuff, car chases, explosions, and much computer enhances cities and ranks of people that is is wonderful to see the beginning of Batman told as if no one had any knowledge of his origin. Then we proceed with the saga like we want it to go and it is rewarding and satisfying. But at the end it just couldn't last and we get the 2005 enhancement with too much computer work on screen and explosions that blot out the story. The cast is way beyond hoping and is superlative. Michael Caine in a Batman movie!!! And others to match suit. This is a show worth watching if you're a Batman lover. It satisfies. If you must have noise, car chases, etc., it has that but not enough to satisfy those who like cataclysm. I liked it. And I'm 83 years old.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The fact this film received 8.6 suggests just how the public has lost their touch with film.,"Of course, when in comparison to many of the films released this year, Batman Begins stand higher than others, and I might say that as a stand alone film it is quite entertaining. However, it would be blasphemous to consider this even a door step in comparison with Tim Burton's masterpiece, which starred Michael Keaton in his signature role. The original, a realization of a comic legend, only received 7.4 on the IMDb scale. It confuses me how the general public thinks these days. Are they comparing Batman Begins with the other films released during the year, or are they being serious about it exceeding the original? Here is what I think about Batman Begins............It doesn't even feel like a Batman movie. It misses the point completely. And I hate the excuses of 'making a new Batman film for the new generation'. THE NEW GENERATION ALSO NEED GOOD FILMS. I agree with the casting of Christian Bale, a great actor and once a child prodigy (most memorable in Spielberg's Empire Of The Sun), however he alone could not save this film from disaster. Christopher Nolan is a respectful director, but did he really think he could create his own Batman? Or was it a cash-in opportunity?The Batmobile - every time I looked at it, it made my face grimace. I understand the director wanted a modern prototype of Batman, but this.......what a contraption. The Batman suit did it worst for me though. The new re-done Batman symbol is pathetic. It looked more like the Nazi Eagle than the original symbol that really looked like a Bat. Why does Nolan require Batman to be modernized anyway? It is the Gothic, 1950's film noir style of the original film that made Batman a household name. The whole atmosphere so vividly created by Tim Burton in the original was breathtaking and bought a comic book to life. Christopher Nolan wanted a more serious approach to Batman, for it to be more realistic. The fact Batman is wearing a Bat suit is ridiculous enough anyway, and so the fact that the director sees the legend of Batman as serious totally misses the point of THE BATMAN LEGEND. It is just a comic book, and so the unbelievable can still be believable. It doesn't have to be explained, because it is simply fiction. Like the larger than life Gotham City Tim Burton vividly bought to life and much like in the comic book itself, it is just a story that takes us to another world - and utilizes our imagination. We don't have to make Batman real. It's like explaining how Superman flies.Although the film ran for well over two hours, and felt way overlong, the characters were poorly developed. I felt, walking out of the theater, like I didn't get to know the characters. It didn't feel like they were communicating in any way to the audience. Alfred, played well by Michael Caine just didn't click with me¬Ö.nothing to do with the veteran actor. He just didn't have enough screen time or dialog for me to feel anything between him and Bruce Wayne. Also, the death of Wayne's parents in Batman Begins compared to the same death in the original, is like comparing the song ""Rain drops are fall on my head"" to ""adagio for strings"". Nolan was attempting to make a dramatic, touching scene and failed miserably. It seemed almost ridiculous ¬ñ like an episode of Bold and the Beautiful. They should have made this scene the focal point of the film, so we could feel Bruce Wayne's pain and understand his Legend. I thought 'Scarecrow' was an effective villain, and he scared the hell out of me first time he revealed himself. But he too could not have saved this film from inevitable down fall.Worst of all, fighting scenes were atrocious. Unlike the Tim Burton classic, I couldn't see what the bloody hell was going on on screen. Close-ups, over-layered by shaky cameras, over-layered by quick-cuts so as we don't see how well the actors really fight - what a joke. Sure the story is great, but we came to see Batman kick the enemies butts. Some nice CGI effects were added to the film well, but they could not assist Batman in anyway, because they literally weren't really needed. I think people have either forgotten Tim Burton's unmatched atmosphere of Batman or what makes a good film. From Beginning to End I didn't feel like I was watching a Batman movie - it felt more like a normal action blockbuster we see too much of. It missed the whole Gothic exterior that made the original film larger than life and at times scary. The actors, including Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all did great jobs, apart from a few. It was the sets designs, the suit, the Batmobile, the normal look of everything that made this just a boring entry that shouldn't even be called 'Batman'. It is definitely better than Val Kilmer and George Clooney's mediocre sequels. However for this film to get a higher score than the original is like spitting in Tim Burton's face and forgetting the greatness of how film used to be made. Let's not forget one of the most memorable movie scores of all time from the original that assisted to define THE BATMAN. I can only predict that Batman Begins, only in a few years, will be laughable.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Batman movie I've been waiting for.,"It's about time.I've been reading and collecting Batman comic books pretty much my entire life, intrigued by the plausibility of this dark hero: no radioactive spiders, no alien orphans, no magic. Just a guy (yeah, a really, really rich guy) who decides to discipline himself and dedicate his considerable resources to fighting crime and corruption, and hoping in vain to somehow fill the horrible void left by the murder of his own parents. Somewhere between childhood and adulthood I stopped believing that with the right training I could be Batman, and started believing that with the right vision, Hollywood could make a believable Batman movie.Sure, I have a not-so-secret affinity for the campy nostalgia of the Adam West/Burt Ward TV series (although for sheer goofiness, I really love watching the two serials from the 1940s). And I was thrilled when Michael Keaton finally brought the Batman to the big screen, but dismayed as thrill morphed into embarrassment as each successive Batman film got farther off the mark. When George Clooney got done with the franchise, I was pretty sure it was dead.And may it rest in peace. Because Batman Begins threw all that out the window and went back to the roots, the core of the character, and gave us real insight into the conflicted heart of a reluctant hero. What separates this film from previous attempts is that we genuinely care about Bruce Wayne as a violently orphaned child, we sympathize with his natural desire to kill the man who killed his parents, we understand his retreat from the familiar, his global wanderings, his lack of focus, his willing apprenticeship, and the reawakened sense of his own ingrained morality. We see the boy become a man, we see the victim become the protector, we see the coward become the fearless hero. And we really care about him, about his family, about his obsessive drive to purge the demons of his own soul, and his gnawing need to protect the city Gotham from itself.Yes, there are interesting villains trying kill people and destroy Gotham City. Yes, there are pretty woman and fast cars and some clever one liners. But mostly there is Bruce Wayne becoming the Batman, and coming to terms with his own dual identity. There is the broken boy grieving the loss of loving parents, and there is the man who finds peace in preserving their memory, and justice in preserving the peace.Batman Begins is not without its flaws, but they are few and forgivable. It is a well-told tale, great direction, and superb acting. I, for one, can't wait for the next installment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

When it all started getting much bigger, i was worried. That has gone now as what we have here is quite simply the best batman film ever and possibly the best comic book movie ever, though its a tie with Sin City which also happens to be the most faithful.The story was great and not lost under action set pieces, the action was great, the score top notch, great cinematography etc etc.I really cant recommend this film enough and advise you go and see it.

Nolan has made the best Batman film to date,"How quickly in Hollywood has the term 'reimagined' become a clich√©? With a heavy does of jade in my mind, I went to a preview screening of Batman Begins. When I left, I realized I had left that jade back in the theatre. Did I go back for it?Not this time.Batman Begins is fantastic.Christopher Nolan has come back to form, awakening a sense of awe in contemporary cinema under the guise of genre. Working from a script he co-wrote with David Goyer, who himself penned the seminal modern genre film Dark City, Nolan takes a blank canvas and shows us he understands how to resuscitate a franchise that has been driven into the ground by conventionality and bombast. You don't just change actors, or art directors, or even writers: you must wring the very fabric of story dry of what pervaded the earlier films. There is no dark carnival of Tim Burton to be found here. What he develops now is a para-realism that hearkens to the writing style of Frank Miller, adding a realistic, emotional weight to the Dark Knight (ninja?). Christian Bale convincingly portrays Bruce Wayne as lost soul who possesses the will and the strength to fight the good fight, but not the direction. In his journey of discovery, we see Batman in a new light: he is now part Everyman.There is an almost quiet majesty about this story. Have no fear, this does not mean this is not an action film, only one that one that does not alienate a thinking person. Nothing happens in the film without giving the audience a sense of understanding. Yes, this Batman is not about a black and white morality; rather, it is about trying to synergize a coda of that with a more mundane world. Yes, there are super villains, including a wonderful turn by Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane, aka The Scarecrow, but here they are possessed of twisted motivations, but not outright villainy or malefaction. Theirs is the evil of blind ambition and a purity ethos that moved nations to global war in the past century in our world. Gotham is in peril beyond the decay of years now, thanks to this ambition.In further distancing the film from its predecessors, Nolan brings in moody elements of horror and noir. Batman operates by instilling fear into his adversaries. We now witness this, from the discovery of the Bat Cave, to the stalking of drug smugglers at the docks. This is not four-color territory: this is pulp as if Hemmingway would have seen it.The whole cast is wonderful, especially Michael Caine as Alfred, who becomes Bruce's compass to his memory of his slain parents, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, who becomes both weapons master and key support who complements Batman's burgeoning enterprise. Gary Oldman gives his most understated, yet organic performance to date as Lt. Jim Gorden, a good cop who sees Batman as an ally that we all know will last a lifetime.After seeing the plethora of origin stories, not the least of which concluded the Star Wars saga, finally we have a refreshing take on an old character, as well as on a summer blockbuster. This film is a fine achievement that deserves a wide audience. We have a beginning that should have been the start of it all. This is a must see for the summer of 2005 and beyond.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Engaging, top notch action and refreshingly good for a franchise movie.","Oh my god, what a good movie this this. It could have been a banana skin for Warner Bros., but director Christopher Nolan has produced a fresh take on an old subject and done it extraordinarily well.""How does one man change the world?""It's a question that haunts Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale). The death of his parents, murdered on a Gotham street outside the Opera house has filled him with guilt and anger. Disillusioned with life and seeking the means to fight injustice, he travels the world to educate himself in the ways of the criminal. Emerging from this phase in his life, Bruce starts to become the Bat man and what an adventure it is.This film really is great. Primarily filmed in the UK with bits in Ireland, Iceland and Chicago, this is yet another American backed film, shot in the UK with British/Irish and Welsh actors aplenty. Of course, they are mainly playing Americans and doing it very well.Refreshingly, Gary Oldman is playing a good guy and Tom Wilkinson is playing a bad guy. Cristian Bale is perfectly cast for the Bruce Wayne/Batman role and it was a real kick to see Rutger Hauer back in the big screen in a major film. At least with Rutger, his performance didn't once make me think of Blade Runner.This was not the case with Liam Neeson as he, in essence, reprises his role as Qi Gon from The Phantom Menace. Katie Homes puts in a decent performance and Morgan Freeman is a good as ever. Michael Caine was brilliant as the butler Alfred. His accent turns from butler British to London, East End Cockney by the end of the film. He has a few classic lines and I'm sure that when the sequel is made and believe me, there has to be one, he will star prominently.Batman Returns will be a massive hit. Excitingly, there is also an IMAX release.Verdict: Best film of the year 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Promising Start.,"If there's one superhero figure out there who has been tossed around and re-imagined just as much as ever-so bloated Superman it's his fellow DC Comics star Batman. From his original dark conception in the forties on paper, to his campy popularity surge in the sixties with Adam West, the bat-man is a figure that has been a consistently present in American pop culture. As is usually the case with franchises however, such popularity usually gets the better of the product, quality declines and years will go by with little to no interest in what was once in such demand. Such has been the case with Batman, and up until 2005, the superhero had been on the backburner for a good eight years. Enter Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan's much anticipated re-imagining of countless other re-imaginings, and from the opening scene it's evident that Batman may just finally be getting the respect he deserves as a formidable and mature superhero; his audiences have grown older and so has he. By no means is the movie the classic it could have been, but it's a fine effort nevertheless and delivers a compelling and welcome look back at how it all began for the dark knight.The story rather suitably starts at the very beginning, detailing the rise of Batman and the fall of Bruce Wayne. Thankfully Nolan devotes the majority of the focus of Begins on such development; crafting a protagonist that is strong of will, but doesn't always have things going his way. There's plenty of the grit and the darkness that played such a major role in the establishment of the comic book's character, and while at times ¬ñas Scarecrow states- the film can take itself just a little too seriously for its own good, the consistency and strength that resides within the ominous tone is fitting in order to fulfil the main character's motivations. Still fuelled by the resentment and guilt over his parent's death as a young boy, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) seeks to rid the city of Gotham of its criminal infestation by injecting fear into those who pray upon the fearful. Through this exposition we are treated to significantly more detail and important characterisation than cinema audiences have thus far only been thrown in sporadic scraps in between all the campy action in previous instalments. To be sure, Begins is most reminiscent of the original Batman directed by Tim Burton in its murky, cynical viewpoint of criminal justice and moral ambiguity, but the key advantage that Nolan has over Burton here is a much more solid script with plenty more character to invest in. This is why, acts one and two are the movie's key parts, where focus is primarily on these characters and their relationships not only to each other but to their personal anxieties and conflicts.All this extra padding makes for some interesting and at times, utterly compelling drama that involves suspense and action. Unfortunately however, a distinct lack of focus in the antagonists' lair and a throwaway, tedious romantic subplot hinder complete engagement with the feature. As villains, Tom Wilkonson, Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphey are a little too blas√©, and put far too back into the mixture of things to be as threatening as the director seems to presume they are. In contrast to the brilliant, multi-textured relationship between Wayne and butler Alfred (Michael Caine), and even the downplayed, rather short-lived rivalry between Wayne and his parent's killer (which carries the greatest amount of emotional resonance within the film), the chemistry and hero/villain conflict here is perfunctory and little more than merely satisfactory. As a unit, the villains fulfil their roles as sources of personal torment for the bat-man, but only according to how the rules state they should be; there are no original, memorable qualities outside of Murphey's sometimes zany psychosis, and the sense of threat is limited to formula and plot only. As for the romantic interest that resides within childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), the chemistry is even worse here, and Nolan once again shows that he is all dazzle when it comes to character's inner struggles, but shows very little skills in the ways of producing outward relations that touch the heart as much as they should.It's of no surprise then that the final act of the movie, which focuses largely on delivering the explosions that most of the budget goes to pay for, is notably (and ironically) dim in comparison. The action is fine and dandy sure, but context is given the back seat and of course, with very little personal threat attached the whole ordeal thanks to underdeveloped villains and love interests, suspense is extremely limited. Sure enough, we care for Bruce, and we will surely find ourselves cheering on for a happy ending just out of habit, but in the end the outcome and eventual climax feels obvious and underwhelming. It makes for good popcorn munching entertainment sure, but after eighty minutes of solid drama with subtle shades of action, the final act is one that can grow tedious quickly. As a whole however, one can't complain; the structure, although lopsided when it comes to balancing out drama and action, is nevertheless straight forward enough to maintain interest and engagement. Most characters are given ample time to at least reach some level of respectability, and the action, although a little over the top for the sake of spectacle, is fitting enough for a blockbuster action movie. It has its low points and its high points, but thankfully the majority is of a great standard; enough to at least satisfy those looking for a much more modern and mature adventure for Batman. Add this to the fact that Bale delivers what is without a doubt the finest, most realistic rendition of Bruce Wayne to date, and you have yourself a more than competent outing to indulge in that is likely to please audiences old and young.Jamie Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Batman Begins, but the fun ends.","I've long found the idea of Batman‚Äîa billionaire playboy who dresses as a bat to fight crime‚Äîjust a little too ridiculous to take seriously (and I guess I'm not alone in that thought, given the cartoonish approach taken with the character in the past); however, after the Clooney-Schwarzeneggar debacle that was Batman and Robin, which took camp to a whole new level, a darker, grittier look and feel was inevitable for any franchise reboot.Directed by Christopher Nolan, Batman Begins portrays Bruce Wayne/Batman (played by Christian Bale) in a far more sober and reflective manner than ever before; the script, by David S. Goyer focuses strongly on Wayne's inner conflict between seeking revenge and delivering justice (while neatly addressing some of the character's more questionable issues‚Äîmost notably, how he learnt to fight and where he gets his cool gadgets from).With a fine supporting cast, impressive production design (Gotham city is suitably gloomy and rain drenched and Batman's suit, accessories and vehicle are impressively utilitarian) and top-notch special effects, I certainly can't accuse Nolan of not pulling out all the stops.And yet Batman Begins still feels strangely lacking. Nolan's fussy direction is partly to blame, the action scenes a chaotic blur of close-ups and quick edits that seriously diminish the level of excitement, but perhaps the film's biggest problem is the simple lack of fun and imagination. Compared with the 80s/90s movies, Batman Begins' new approach feels frustratingly conventional, afraid to be even the slightest bit daring or playful for fear of being compared to its immediate predecessor.I'm not for a second suggesting the reinstatement of rubber nipples on Batman's body armour, but Nolan's grim vision has gone just a bit too far in the opposite direction for my liking.6.5 out of 10, but not good enough for me to round it up to 7 for IMDb.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Spider-Man who?,"Since ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" came on the scene, the comic book movie genre has experienced new life. Those films were filled with action, witty dialogue and good acting. ""Batman Begins"" is certainly no exception. It leaves the previous movies in the ""Batman"" series far behind- in fact, it's no use comparing them. The movie is practically seamless; there are very few complaints to be made about it.Christian Bale is the perfect Batman. He brings a new perspective and depth to the character that is unmatched in any other comic book film. The supporting cast is also extremely good, including such great actors as Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman. This cast takes the movie far beyond just a comic book film. They make it into a movie that stands on its own, even if you've never heard of Batman before.The movie itself is excellent. It manages to avoid most of the corniness that is evident in many comic book film adaptations. True, there are a few moments where the script leaves something to be desired, but these moments are very rare. When they do occur, the actors make them much less corny than the moments could be in less capable hands. The action in the movie is present, but it doesn't take over.In short, this movie is a must-see. You'll notice that I didn't discuss the plot at all; that is because it contains many unexpected twists and turns and revelations. The attention to detail is incredible.

A True Comic Fanboy Review,"I've come to realize that I've attempted to watch this movie five times, and I've never made it past the first hour and fifteen minutes. I either fall asleep from sheer boredom, or I lose interest and get up. But, as a huge, massive comic book fan boy (Batman tattoos and all), I keep trying to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. But it has yet to win me over even in the slightest... Plus, who can watch Katie Homes in anything?I saw about 20 minutes of the sequel, and wasn't blown away at all.

Christopher Nolan: The Man Who Gives Us Batman,"I would personally like to thank Christopher Nolan and his team for creating the intricate clockwork of Batman and bringing him and his fears to life. The film winds its way through a series of short flashbacks, telling the story of a man taunted by his fears, confused with emotion and the eternal heartbreak of loss.The world in which Batman Begins describes truly does reflect the very essence of the inner turmoil faced by Bruce Wayne not only as a man, but as a child. Gone are the merchandise-indulging opportunities, flashy, trashy neons continually flashed with strobe lights and replacing it is a world on the brink of destruction and at a crossroad.The movie deals with vengeance, revenge and hope. The hope that despite all that is evil and corrupt in this world the inner strength of one person can help save us all (with some help from a few friends and a couple of billion dollars).Christian Bale not only acts as Bruce Wayne, he owns Bruce Wayne. His description of Batman is deeply powerful and effective. His eyes, and his somewhat pursed lips display power and authority.Michael Caine's portrayal as Alfred is the mechanism by which the true human side of Bruce Wayne is extracted and the chemistry between the two is touching. Gary Oldman's role as a the street-wise and honest cop torn between doing what is right and turning a blind eye to corruptness to catch the bigger fish, is one that I look forward to being expanded. The relationship between Bale and Oldman will become and integral part of future Batman films.The rest of the cast simply add to the viewing pleasure of the film notably Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman. Katie Holmes does a nice job working with Gotham's District Attorney, though sometimes it is hard to ignore her youthful persona.The action sequences are simply sensational, fully showing us a world of Gotham that resembles a mix of inner city Chicago with the feeling of the back streets of hong kong.The film is Batman as it should be; a journey of self identification and a quest for justice. Dark and often literally quite frightening, Christopher Nolan has given us a Batman that truly adheres to the very principles on which the dark knight is based upon.-matteo OK",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What Other Batman Films? See This Movie!!,"Just saw this tonight (Thursday 16 June). When I first heard of the project, I thought ""Another one? Christian Bale???"" I forgot all that in a hurry! This film is what the others should have been. I found it more credible and realistic than the others and the acting gave it the depth that the others failed to create. The ""new"" Batmobile ROCKS! Essentially, scrap the other shows as this is not really a ""prequel"" it is a fresh start. The telling of the parent's demise and the origin of the ""Dark Knight"" has been retooled, which supports this as a new series even though it hasn't been long since the last Batman. Great to see Sir Michael, the guy from ""28 Days Later"" and the guy from ""The Full Monte"" working on this with the impeccable Mr. Freeman. Best movie I have seen this summer. 1. Batman 2. Crash 3. Cinderella Man.Cheers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Let the intimidation begin!,"Now, I suppose I'm what you could call a longtime Batman fan. (Er, not of the comic books, though. I hardly ever read comics because, frankly I don't have the time for it..) As such,I was pretty much first in line to see the latest incarnation of the Dark Knight on the silver screen. So, I thought I'd post a short review here.My history with the previous four Batman movies (Okay, so technically there were five films before this one if you count the 1966 movie.) is as follows: I loved the first movie, liked the second one and thought the third one was kinda meh. As for the fourth one, let us never speak of it again.Now, onto Batman Begins..Seeing that Warner Bros. had assembled a massive all-star cast and crew (Chris Nolan, David Goyer, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Ken Watanabe..) when I went to see it I figured that it would either:a) rock, b) be OK, or c) be the next IshtarTo my great delight, the answer is most definitely and without a shadow of a doubt the first choice. For one, the acting is impeccable. I wasn't quite sure if Morgan Freeman could really shine in his role, but he does, as always. As for Christian Bale, though I knew that he is indeed a very talented actor, I also had my doubts about him being right for the part of Bruce Wayne/Batman. But he takes both sides of the role and does them justice, and then some (I'll be damned if there isn't a tiny bit of American Psycho's Patrick Bateman in his rendition of Bruce Wayne as he provides this vain and shallow alter ego to his true identity, which is oddly appropriate). Alfred, played by the stately Michael Caine, excels in his role and manages to bring out new dimensions of his character. In fact, just about the whole cast shines, and essentially all the characters feel much more fleshed out in this movie than the previous iterations.As for the action, stunts, music, audio and special effects, they are all exquisite and expertly executed. One thing that I noticed is that for the most part there is a distinct lack of CG effects, as Nolan opted to take a more traditional approach to the special effects, explosions and such. The result is a satisfying visual experience that has a great feel to it. The CG in this case simply provides the icing on the cake, instead of trying to be the whole cake, as is the case with too many action films today..I did have one minor gripe about the film. The angles during the fight scenes were kind of close up and quick-cut, unlike Asian martial arts films where the camera is drawn further back to give a better view of the action. But, as I said, this is a very minor gripe, and it doesn't detract from the experience in any significant way. In a way it also fits in very well with the visual style of the film (you'll see what I mean).I have no reservations about saying that I absolutely loved this movie, and this is something that I don't say often about movies. Non-fans need not worry, either, as Batman Begins is very accessible to newcomers. To sum it up in three very short sentences: It rocks. Go see it. NOW.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
If you have any doubts... let them go. This is Batman.,"This is not a continuation of the previous franchise. This is completely independent and completely original. Nolan's vision of Gotham City is amazing. If you liked Burton's version of Batman, you'll love this film. If you DIDN'T like Burton's version of Batman, you'll be relieved by this film.Goyer's script is very solid, but it's not what makes the film great. It's 85% Nolan's direction, 15% acting/casting. Katie Holmes has the weakest performance, yet it doesn't at all detract from the film as a whole. The focus is on Bale the entire time, with the occasional brilliant performances from Oldman, Freeman, Neeson, Caine and Murphy.The film is basically split up into two halves: the first is about Bruce Wayne, the second is about Batman. It's preparation, then action. And each half will keep you on your toes the whole time. It starts off unlike anything you'd expect and builds the whole first half. When Wayne finally gets back to Gotham, the audience is ready for Batman and knows exactly what Wayne is feeling about the loss of his parents, the corruption of his city and the fear of losing it.This is not a stupid action movie. It's a character-driven drama, with some amazing action in it. If you have any hesitancy about seeing another Batman movie, let it go. You've got nothing to worry about. This is how Batman should be portrayed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Dark Knight Reigns,"Well, this movie in my view is the best of all the Batman movies. Christian Bale lived the role, he brought to the screen ""The Real"" Batman, dark and scary, which was depicted by the creator Bob Kane.Right from the start, how Bruce Wayne is a victim of his own fears, the way he takes in his own fear and becomes fear himself is terrific. Ending was great, the scene where Gordon shows him 'The Joker' card. I hope they remake all the Batman movies right starting from The Joker. It would be great for all the Batman lovers.Comparing with Spider-Man, you can't compare these two. They are super-heroes but they are in a different league of their own. Spidey has super powers while, Bruce Wayne uses his money and brain to become a super-hero. Thats where we have to draw the line.Oh, and by the way THE BATMOBILE IS FANTASTIC.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
God bless the British. They got Batman right.,"Batman Begins - The beginning chapter of the Caped Crusader(played spot-on by Christian Bale)'s exploits in Gotham City. Chalk it up to the Brits to finally get a Batman movie right. Now don't get me wrong. I liked elements of Batman and Batman Returns, but for all of the beautiful sets and bangs and whistles, Batman was a 2-dimensional supporting character in his own films, and we never saw much of anything that drove him to don the costume and battle evil. Batman needed a beginning, and now he has it. The first hour is spent delving into Batman's past as Bruce Wayne as a child gets the crap scared out of him by bats, and watches his parents get murdered right in front of him (I actually cried here, to my surprise). It's dark, gritty, and emotional. We see Bruce get trained physically and mentally. He learns to harness his fear and use it. Fear as a weapon is a recurring theme in the movie, a key tool of Batman that was somehow left out of the other movies, and the old 60's show. Batman then returns to Gotham and vows to put a stamp on the corruption and evil.Christian Bale IS Batman. He is so subtle but dark and bold, easily the best of the Batmans. Micheal Caine is witty, warm and father like as Alfred. Morgan Freeman makes a nice addition as well as Lucius, the man that gives Bruce most of his equipment. Gary Oldman is excellent as Gordon, the last good-cop in Gotham, a character ignored for some reason in most of the other movies. Katie Holmes isn't exactly a stand-out player in the movie, but she has some moments.Gotham is full of villains, but none of them (thankfully) are allowed more screen-time than Batman. Liam Neeson plays an interesting mentor character as Henri Ducard. He's far more three-dimensional than most mentor characters in this sort of film. Cillian Murphy is undoubtedly my favorite of the villains as Scarecrow. He's scary, disturbing and just plain crazy.Overall, this is the most fun, dark, gritty and most human of the Batmans. It's not all slick and well-oiled. My initial impression of the new Batmobile was ""okay..."" but It's grown on me. It sort of like a cross between a tank and monster trucker's wet dream. The chase scene with it on the rooftops was incredible.There are no buildings that look like cathedrals no one would build, like in the more Gothic Batman's 1 and 2. There are no gadgets beyond what someone could create in real life. But it has strong character development, and a good screenplay (and the few one liners spouted here and there are not groan-worthy), and a dark, gritty nature that is so good it just has to be fattening. My one wish would be to see what this new fighting style created for the movie looks like. The shaky camera captured a gritty down and dirty nature, but I would still like to see what the moves look like. But that's a small complaint compared to the rest of the film. this gets an A",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Works at its best, when it isn't a batman film.","In my opinion the very fact that this film was a batman film is the element that weakened it. It seem to work so much better when it was character building, in the first 40 minutes. I found as soon as our hero put on the black cape the film didn't work, it lost its attention to detail, sloppily slipping in and out of sentiment. I think Christian Bale is a great performer, his performance in American Psyco and his butt kicking gun carter from the cult hit Equilibrium, have proved his presence. His performance as Bruce Wayne is deep and rooted, but as soon as he plays batman, it becomes a rather cheesy affair. The same can be said for Cillian Murphy, who is suitably sinister as a corrupted Phycologist, but his character nose dives with the cheesy lines of the Scarcrow character. I have to say this now that Katie Holmes is a promising performer yet her performance is rather poor here, not terrible though. Another problem with this film is the music, not denying the prowess of such grand performers as Hans Zimmer(Gladiator) and James Newton Howard (The sixth sense). Unforortunately these two creative forces collide like two power sources canceling each other out. The composers music worked much better when it was separated. Howards sweeping emotional score, with Zimmers synthesized epic quality. Yet personally i would have just gone with Howard, for a strong emotion suspense score. forget Zimmer as he didn't suit this film. Yet not all is lost, this is a great film, and its nice to see major studio's such as Warner issuing such, investment and creative control to a too often ridged and commercial industry. Christopher Noland, director of the masterful 'Momento' brings this film a dark edge. This film isn't perfect, but its miles ahead of most of the crap American studio's are pumping out these days. i can only hope that this is the start of an assent ion from this slump wave been having with originality and quality. 14/11/07: after viewing the film again it's clear this film is a bit of a mildstone. looking forward to the dark knight.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Simply Amazing,"In all honesty, it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was thoroughly entertained throughout, and went through multiple emotions. I seriously began to tear up at one point, and I cheered out loud at another, and laughed out loud as well. Excellent plot, great acting, and jaw-dropping action all make this the finest of the Batman films, and one of the finest movies I've ever seen. One of the best parts about the film is that the ""romantic interest"" doesn't interfere or de-rail any parts of the film. In fact, it's hardly a ""romantic interest"" at all! When you see the movie, you'll see what I mean. There really isn't much I can say, except that I went into this movie with VERY high expectations, and I still had no idea that it would be this good. At no point was I bored, and there is nothing in the film that I found unnecessary. A must see for anyone, especially Batman fans waiting for a film that lives up to the lofty standard set by Tim Burton with the original Batman movie with Michael Keaton. In my honest opinion? Batman Begins surpasses those standards. I'm not sure how another installment from this cast and director would fit into the series, but here's hoping that they do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Heighth of Hollywood Catatonia,"This was the leading film in the summer of unnecessary and instantly forgettable remakes - Herbie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Bewitched, and I'll stop here before I even get to the wretched horror of The Dukes of Hazzard. And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are low and they can't make as much money? I realize the fans and critics felt this installment took the legend seriously but sorry comic geeks. A man dressed up as a bat is something that could never be taken completely seriously without a touch of camp. That's why Burton nailed the task of dark with just the right amount of campiness. As for this film, it's neither a sequel or a prequel. Good actors with the exemption of casting mistake, Katie Holmes, good director but other than utterly unnecessary retread of the origin story. Batman has already been reinvented twice and now a third. I will give props to Christian Bale but still not up to par with the likes of Michael Keaton. And Jack Nicholson's performance that was fascinating and brilliant at the same time? That's an impossible act to follow. The villain in this film was neither scary or interesting. Boring and instantly forgettable is more like it. It's no wonder moviegoers are left in such a catatonic state from Hollywood's desperate attempts at creativity.

I don't want to reveal anything about the movie so I'll quit here.

""" What I do that defines me""","To quote Batman (Christian Bale) before he leaps into flight to save Gotham, ""It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me"". Apply that standard to the production of this movie and everyone involved has elevated themselves to a higher level. This not only puts every Batman movie or any superhero movie for that matter to shame, but I am hard pressed to recall any movie in recent years that has provided it's audience with such a complete character as Bale's Dark Knight. The cast (Bale,Caine,Freeman,Oldman,Neeson,Holmes) was second to none and it's because of the quality and intensity that such performers bring to their craft along with a truly magnificent production that enabled this movie to flourish without the mandatory nudity and profanity that todays productions seem to need to keep their audiences awake through the painful unfolding of inept plots that shamelessly pick our pockets of eight dollars. Everyone that I recommended this movie to came back to me a few days later with nothing but praise. My employees are Teamsters and Operating Engineers. They loved it. My kids loved it.

The best movie of the year!!!!!,"First of all, let me just say that there is nothing wrong with Tim Burton's first two Batmans. They were both great films with strong acting, but Nolan has really nailed it here folks. This is the REAL Batman. It's dark, scary, serious, sad, and most of all it has a real world feel that makes the whole film believable. This film does not have any make believe action sequences like in DareDevil where he jumps 50 feet off of buildings and lands perfectly unharmed. Everything Batman does in this film any man could do if he trained hard enough and had all the right tools. If you are a fan of Blade Runner that you will love this film.

"""Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up"" ¬ñ A metaphor for the Batman franchise","""Batman Begins"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic work of genius that is only beaten in the genre of comic book films by its successor: ""The Dark Knight"". One of the best all star casts of the new millennium is involved including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Ken Watanabe and Morgan Freeman as the film redefines both the comic book and the action genres and establishes the possibility of a motion picture within these genres to contain so much heart and meaning.At the age of 8, when his parents are murdered, Bruce Wayne (Bale) vows to seek revenge; however, he commences to ask himself about the difference between revenge and justice. As he gets older he meets Henri Ducard (Neeson) and Ra's Al Ghul (Watanabe); two members of a vigilante group known as the 'League of Shadows' which sparks Bruce's interest and allows him to train with the group. Subsequent to his training, he is told that he must execute a criminal in order to become a member of the League of Shadows, however, Bruce declines and finds himself fighting to the death with Ra's Al Ghul which results in Ghul's death. He returns to Gotham City and finds that the city has become a ""breeding ground for suffering and injustice"", due to this he decides to use a symbol to frighten criminals and bring justice back to Gotham. He decides that the symbol must be terrifying and formidable and that he should use his one fear: bats, as he explains ""as a man, I can be destroyed, I can be ignored. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible."" With the help of his trusty companions Alfred Pennyworth (Caine), Sgt. Jim Gordon (Oldman) and Lucius Fox (Freeman) he does his best to become a nocturnal vigilante, determined to fight against evil.The realistic and grim tone that Nolan creates in this film is one that has not been seen in a comic book film ever before. Although it does not contain popular and somewhat admired villains as previous Batman films has shown, it manages to grasp the true essence and meaning of Batman and his love for Gotham. It is also done this way for a reason; because Batman is not meant to meet villains like The Joker, Two-Face or The Riddler when he is first practising as the masked vigilante. For this is not a story of an experienced and heavily skilled Batman, this is a story of how Batman begins.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Hattrick.,"You could take that to mean the original two Batman flicks and Begins but I'm certainly talking about the 3 comic book-film sagas that have actually made it above water. 'Catwoman's, 'Punisher's, controversial 'Hulk's, etc give comic book movies a bad name justly or unjustly. 'Blade's, 'Hellboy's and 'Sin City's can subsist for costing less but the big, trans-labelled three are X-Men, Spider-man and Batman. If Superman Returns and The Flash make it next year then it'll be good to have DC back in the light for the Marvel era. RIP the Superman-Batman DC age, 1978 to 1997.I've changed my position on the original 4 Batmans since seeing Begins. Batman has to be dark, not an MTV merchandising hub. Keaton getting battered and tossed by villains is frustrating, there's the height question to irritate, but I like the darkness, laughs, noir, score, sadistic edge and tragic overtones of Burton that polarize it from otherwise rainbow superheroes. Batman Forever; interesting story, the best Batman portrayer, though unfortunate that Kilmer didn't put on enough muscle for the role, good score, animated performances. It holds up unto itself, but not alongside the others and especially Begins. Where is the credibility in two athletic young bachelor billionaires each scarred by an early family-loss co-existing in the tabloids with two gadget-rife, turbo-powered, militarily-vehicle, thug-slugging city avengers, one barely even under a mask, bearing remarkable resemblance? Robin out. Skip to Drake and Nightwing if totally necessary. Begins is realism.So Batman Begins didn't exactly wow with its gross, but that was completely predictable. Already the most enduring and arguably biggest comic book movie series, a lot of territory was covered and much of the Batman urgency was spent. Any fallout from the protested part 4, an agreeable renter but no challenge to its predecessors. The appropriate seriousness, subdued tones and discretion of the Begins trailer, not a kiddie puller and heeding to pre-suppositions. Probably above all, there was no popular villains. Scarecrow, though one of the originals, was a lurch from obscurity for the masses ¬ñ those popularised in the 60s TV show that gave Batman such an edge with modern audiences were Burton or Schumackered. Lastly, there was the shot of that Bat-mask. People were never going to flock to see a mortal in blocky rubber as they had before Spider-man, Xavier's troop and all the rest of the super-powered lot had swung. At first. Initially, it was going to feel like a step back on some level.But that is the transcendental beauty of Batman Begins and Batman: the superhero that isn't super. He wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider, he was never hit by gamma or radiation, he never left the earth's surface. What he did was don the guise of the bat and struggle manfully against organised crime and equally scarred maniacs for love of a city that had plagued the world's nightmares since metropolises first began springing up. Every thud, every leap, every drop of blood was that of a man no more super than any of us. The mask was what was truly fantastical, an overpass to power, mystery and unrelenting justice. On one side of it was a dark and fearful legend, unnatural in the word of folk. On the other was a face from high society. The cave, the car, the hook, the belt, the batarang, were Batman's super powers; what made him a one-man army where the masses that a dark metropolis could throw at his lone cause might have overwhelmed. Bruce's journey to the point of that transformation is the excitement in precisely the same way his troubles retaining his sanity and humanity beneath the mantle are afterward.Begins signals his Detective Comics age, where a bit more sunlight is allowable with his movement in the real world. At the height of population there was the entire team of Batman, Robin, Alfred, Gordon, Nightwing, Oracle, Catwoman, Batman understudy Jean Paul/Azrael and others all fighting a global cause. After such a dense and exciting first chapter establishing Batman the hard work is done and we haven't even got to the real fun yet. Do I hear a green-haired maniac's demonic cackle? Bane awaits. It may not have 'Spider-man'-ed or even 'X-Men'-ed at the box office but they'd be idiots not to think they're sitting on a Matrix Reloaded opening with part two (and no more of that legacy). Shame about Holmes, her presence was welcome, the performance was solid, and I don't want this to be the beginning of yet another infuriating Bond tradition of changing women every movie. Fisher taking up the same role is one of the first things we'll forget about once we're watching a solid sequel, but otherwise, coming up with a satisfactory way to write Dawes out is the first hurdle. And in case they're wondering, yes, a certain brain-damaged horse rider does return in part II.NO TEAMUPS! The biggest fun is ahead. What we're dealing with is the clash of a psychotic shrink with the city's deadliest nutter. I don't want, and I suspect many second the motion, another wussy villain team-up in part 2, or a sidedish baddie. Joker is the villain intent on pushing Batman as close to the edge as possible, and he'll do anything to stop someone killing Batman because that would ruin his fun and his whole cause for being. The movie that it can be at best with yet another dark alliance isn't half what a three-way powerplay can be. Dynamite. NO TEAMUPS! Like the X-Mens and the superb Spider-man 2 they have left a number of threads to take up in the sequel. In Begins they don't get to explore the duality of Bruce Wayne and Batman, where one ends and the other begins. Joker is the tool invented for that very purpose.

"""We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves up.""","First of all, I should say that after ""Batman & Robin"" it would be impossible to drag the franchise down any lower. Therefore, we would have to figure that even if ""Batman Begins"" was atrocious, it couldn't be any worse than ""B&R"". Well, we needn't worry: this one is very well done. Maybe not a ""Citizen Kane""-style masterpiece, but definitely worth seeing. I'm not surprised at all, given that it's in the hands of ""Memento"" director Christopher Nolan.As the title identifies, this movie tells the story of how wealthy Gotham City heir Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) became the Caped Crusader (is it unacceptable to use that name, considering the dark nature of this movie?). Specifically, we get to see how various and sundry incidents forced him to face his fears directly, no matter how unpleasant the situation could be. And there are plenty of unpleasant situations to experience in a Chinese prison. Ah, but a Tibetan training camp can teach a person the most unimaginable skills. And that's just what they do with Bruce.Back in Gotham City, Bruce moves back into Wayne Manor, where butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) has lived alone for seven years. In that time, gangster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has risen to prominence, bought out all the politicians, and completely turned the city into his playground. Only reporter Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) has the courage to investigate him. Now that Bruce Wayne is donning a bat costume, there may actually be law enforcement. But wait until you find out what the crime syndicate is actually planning.Far from the idiocy in the previous Batman movie, the plot here is very cleverly constructed. The aforementioned cast members all do very well in their roles. Also starring are Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, who helps Bruce pick himself back up; Gary Oldman as honest cop Jim Gordon, assisting Batman; Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane, who has a lot in store; Ken Watanabe as Ra's Al Ghul, who trains Bruce; Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, providing Bruce with all the devices necessary; plus Rutger Hauer and Linus Roache.All in all, a very well done movie.

Worth the US$5.25,"Compared to the movies I have seen these past two years, Batman Begins does an adequate job of putting batman on the screen. However, it is still a bad film.First, I have to establish that I am a fan of the comics, and I really dislike it when movies completely disregard the story and history established in the comic books.With that out of the way, Batman Begins casts Christian Bale, who is the best Batman actor I have seen, but it doesn't say much when you look at the past Batmans. The story is divided into two parts. One talking about the beginnings of Batman, and the second about him saving gotham.As always, 2 villains are cast. Raz-Al-Ghul, and Scarecrow. Scarecrow is played over the top, but that is a good thing as I believe that's how villains should be played in Batman.Raz is a different story. The Raz in the comic is much better, and this one does not do him justice. The actor is very good, but it is the way Raz is portrayed that really disappoints.Then, plot holes. Mr. Wayne wears a tux, but rides the subway. They come out of a high class opera house to the lowest slum. It just does not make sense.Katie Holmes is the most horrible thing about this film. She throws in corny one-liners as if her life depends on it.Bottom line, compared to the stuff I have seen this past 2 summers, Batman Begins is actually entertaining enough to be worth the $5.25, if you are willing to completely forget what you know of the caped crusader.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Batman Begins- A new era for the Batman,"I recently saw the movie and I was very satisfied with the result of Mr. Nolans work. Batman is one of the superheros which many people have a relationship to, and the expectations was(and still is) quite high. I think the producers and the directors have suceeded with the creation of a Batman who is up to date but at the same time the Batman we all know(dark minded and lonely). Further I will pay a huge tribute to the performance of Christian Bale. I have been fortunate to see this great actor in the past and my conclusion, after seeing Batman Begins, is that he is one of the best around. His ability to express different emotions is just great acting and with the costarring of Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Katie Holmes this has become one of the best superhero movies of all time. We can just hope for more.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Another beginning for our dark hero,"Batman Begins is a well-structured action-fantasy with elements of mystery here and there, mostly in the purpose of Bruce Wayne becoming the Bat. I thought the movie was decent, though it could've been better than how it was. The sole disappointment I had in the film was the finale between Batman and his former mentor on the toxin-carrying train. I thought that could've been left out, or better edited. I don't know, I just didn't particularly care for it. I think I'm not alone on this. I did like the Scarecrow, aka, Dr. Crane, and wish there would have been more of the guy in the movie, but that was not meant to be. I guess the writers were saving him for the sequel, which the charmer will indubitably be apart of, and I strongly believe the Scarecrow preliminary was just a start of Crane finding himself. I think he'll revive as the Joker in Part 2, which works well, because the guy looks like the younger version of the creep, with special makeup added. I look forward to Batman Continues, which is inevitable. I liked Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne more so than Michael Keaton. The guy had style. He's the perfect Batman and will be plunging further into the series.Crane- ""Is that the Bat? Is that the Batman?""You better believe it is, and ya'll will ""Face off""",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Great Concepts, Poor Execution","I just learned that Memento, this film and The Prestige were all directed by Chris Nolan. I know, ""what, have I been living under a rock or something?"" Right, but, I really liked Memento, a lot. Now, I can see a lot of similarities directorially between the three films once I thought about it. It also occurs to me that one of the things a dislike so much about Batman Begins and The Prestige is that they have so much going for them and they fail to deliver. They both have great actors, good plots for the most part, very good atmosphere and pretty good story telling on some levels. Unfortunately, they all three rely to much on some type of gimmick. Memento was done before the clever twist was so overused which helped it a great deal. It was also done in a particularly clever fashion with the story telling mimicking an aspect of the protagonist's situation. Batman Begins, while it does not rely on one major plot twist, does rely on a series of gimmicks for its main story. Even though this is typical of comic book inspired stories, Nolan does not handle these elements very well and I found it very hard to suspend my disbelief. The same thing happened to me with The Prestige. I think Nolan likes stories that have mostly dark characters that do not have any of the typical redeeming qualities we are used to seeing in main characters in stories. He seems to like characters that allow their obsessions to overtake all the other aspects of their lives. I have to applaud him for being willing to take on these types of characters. However, I think he spends so much time on their dark side that is very difficult for audience members, or, at least for me, to invest any real interest in the outcome of their story. It worked in Memento because the character had a physical flaw that made it difficult for him to deal with his character flaws. In Batman Begins, as well as The Prestige it falls flat.Perhaps it is a sad commentary on the time we live in that these films get the high ratings they do. Maybe very few people are able to believe that there is actually good in most people even some that do bad things. We went from having clear cut heroes, to having the anti-hero, to just having different shades of villains all mixing it up with one or the other arbitrarily winning. I know, the Batman fans out there are saying ""but this is one chapter in a much larger story"". Even though I am a comic book fan I look to the film makers of this genre to make the films episodic for maximum entertainment value. This was very nicely done with the Spiderman series, by the way. On the other hand, Batman Begins doesn't make me sympathetic enough to the protagonist to really care one way or another how things turn out. Save the price of the DVD and go buy some of the comics, I am sure it will be a better experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"cold, disappointing movie","Now here's the problem for me. I'd looked forward to this film after some very good reviews and a terrific score at IMDb, but after a while I seriously began to wonder where the emotional heart of the movie was. To be frank, I don't like this man batman one little tiny bit. Of course, we can see how his world was turned upside down as a boy, and the murder of his parents haunts him. But what a cold fish he is. Without a sense of where his emotions are concealed I simply couldn't empathise with him as a passionate advocate of the poor people against the corrupt and the cruel. Indeed, when he is knocking the baddies around I couldn't find much difference between him and them. I'd also heard there was a sense of fun in this film alongside the dark, Gothic sets. So where was it? Humour, passion, dramatic development. All missing. A big disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Finally, the viewer was left not really caring what happened, resigned to watching special effects for their own sake rather than as part of the story.Let's hope the next Batman movie (as well as the next Superman movie, et al) can attract some writing and directing talent.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Its made with so much love and care that almost any Batman or movie fan, can enjoy it!This is the origin story of Batman! The great Thing about it is how it is so much more than just him becoming the Batman! It is a journey of self discovery, confronting your past and embracing your ideals and what deffines you!

"What can i say? Nolan+Bale+Caine=""TOP"" Class","As mentioned above three legendary artists reuniting for a legendary character like Batman is more than just amazing. This movie clearly explains why Christopher Nolan movies are highly rated at IMDb. Recently the same trio combined for ""The Dark Knight"", a masterpiece sequel for this amazing film, which stormed to the #1 spot among the IMDb top 250 movies pushing the over-rated Godfather down. I didn't see the sequel yet but since its the #1 at IMDb, i have no doubts that its gonna be the best movie of the year. The Dark Knight also features late Heath Ledger, a legend in his own self, as Joker and he should be awarded an Oscar for it. I heard that he scared the s**t out of the audience during his on-screen presence in theaters. I can't wait to see this. ""Batman Begins"" also helped me to face my own fears without any fear and handle it myself which is earning me more appreciation. So more than just a movie its a lesson for life. The flawless narration, wonderful story, beautiful acting, adrenalin pumping action and emotional contents all packed in to one big action/drama entertainer and is always a treat to watch.

A New Generation of Batman Movies,Batman Begins is starting a new generation of Batman movies. This one if the best and it gave such a great beginning story to what happened to Bruce.Christian Bale gave a very good performance. He is a good Batman and I hope to see him continue with other Batman movies because he has proved himself to be one of the next leading Hollywood men in this time.The supporting cast was excellent too. Michael Caine gave a great performance as always as the Butler. He really brings energy to a movie.Morgan Freeman too is good as always but his part needed to be bigger. He is one of my favorite actors and I thought he was good in this movie too.Kate Holmes. She is another cute and sweet actress that I personally love to see in films.

A great starting for the story .... I guess there's more,"The movie focuses on Bruce's childhood where he gets his haunting memories from. It shows how he was to become the prince of Gotham, but things do not turn that way. How he wastes some years of his life and then suddenly how he understands the aim in life. The movie certainly satisfies the viewers that how he actually becomes a batman, and from where he acquires his skills and the stuff which is required. Well if this is a beginning of a ""james bond like series"" then it really is a very good start, otherwise, well it certainly does not cover the whole part of the story. I can say that in comparison to the other ""such movies"", the movie starts a little slow, but for fans like me, who think the more explanation the better, I can say that is this movie is much better off. Well, to be critical some of the objects in the movie do not conform to the actual comic book story, but for a part like that, I suppose they cannot have a thing like that in real. Other than that, a few details are also messed up, but then depends on how well you have read those comic books. On the whole, I can say for fans who just cannot get enough in just 2 hours out of good movies, this movie (and its sequels) are just extravagant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
There's nothing to fear but fear itself...,"It took me a second viewing to truly appreciate ""Batman Begins"". Unlike most superhero movies, it isn't stuffed with non-stop action sequences and jaw-dropping stunts. That doesn't mean there's no action, but there is considerably less than in a typical action film. The first time I saw it, I thought it was O.K. The second time, I realized just how good it was.Yes, the movie can be somewhat slow at times. But it is Batman's first adventure after all. If he were to face his greatest challenge first (as he did in 1989 movie), then each film after that would progressively feel not as good. Starting with the villains they did, the ones who aren't as well-known, was a brilliant choice.Batman is no longer Arnold Schwarzenegger without an accent‚Äî gone are the days of lifting guys off a roof with a single hand.

Hans Zimmer's score sets the background for all this. Gone is Danny Elfman's great-to-hum, heroic-sounding theme. As much as I liked it, Elfman's music wouldn't have worked for this movie.

"A better opus than the last ones, but...","I am just back from a premiere in Belgium, invited by the Warner guys and the movie was much better than the last two. From the more comic-like previous versions, this one is much darker, and much more enjoyable. There were only a couple of downsides: First, the fight scenes that were filmed 2 inches from the opponents, so you do not see or understand anything from the fight. It certainly gives you a headache after a minute or two. Second, the movie was a little too long to my taste (particularly the end) There is less action and more psychology about the Batman character, which is interesting but probably less exciting for younger audiences. The father-son relationship is particularly well-developed. Finally, the batmobile is ridiculous (as well as the screeching sound of its tires)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Dark, Stylish, and Just what Batman Needed","Batman Begins(2005)Review: This is a fantastic movie! One of the best superhero movies to date! Batman gets the presentation he finally deserves! Thank You Christopher Nolan!Batman Begins is just that, the birth of the Dark Knight. This movie is a complete character study on Bruce Wayne and Batman in every last detail. We find out many things that the previous Batman movies missed. Things like, why does Bruce Wayne want to fight crime, how does Bruce run Wayne enterprises, how he learned to fight like a demon and the big question, why he choose bats? This is a brilliant character study.We have a terrific cast to boot. Christain Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman. His acting is strong. Micheal Caine is the best as Alfred, who also comes off as a wonderful father figure. More fine acting from two veterans of Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman and are perfectly casted to their respective roles. Liam Neeson is here as well as a show-stealing performance by Cillian Murphy!Batman Begins has an awesome look of the corrupted city of Gotham. Dark and corrupting. The plot is original. The action here is fast, tight and satisfying. Not to mention and excellent car chase scene too! The villains are sinister and refreshing, the bat-cave is an actual cave below Wayne Manor, Batman's vehicle has a brand new and much better look, and the bat signal is faded and out of focus!The Last Word: Fantastic! This movie is the best! From an engaging story to tight and excellent action sequences, Batman Begins delivers the goods! This movie also has no bad language as well.

A fine production.,"Well, after being stupid enough to have listened to several critics comments about this film, how dark and great it was, I went to see it... and all in all I had to high expectations. It's a good movie with good actors, great cinematography and all that, but the action (and I am for sure NOT an action-buff at all) never gets into that higher gear that this film needs.And no matter how fun it is to get all the entire ""mythology"" of Batman explained and broken down to it's bare bones, I go home after-wards feeling a bit stupefied, like some things are not obvious enough? Thus my vote becomes sort of low. This IS the second best Batman-flick, the first with Keaton-Nicholson - of course - being number one still. A comic-book-movie should have some black comedy to it - and also some of the self-sacks Burtons original Batman had. Nolan is a great director, but he should stick to mellow thrillers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

He makes realistic films and Batman Begins should have been made more fantasy.Tim Burton where are you?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Finally, a PROPER Batman Film.","As a fan of Tim Burton, I like his Batman films, but as a Batman fan, they couldn't have been further from the Batman flavor. Or that's what I thought till Joel Schumacher killed Batman with his 'films'. It's sad when a cartoon has better writing then FOUR feature films combined, but that's all the real Batman fans were left with if they wanted well told intelligent stories about Batman and his multi-layered villains aside from reading the books. That is until a ballsy director and writer came along, those people being Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, and FIXED Batman. Goyer, I had faith in. I'd just hoped he could retain the characters' personalities. Nolan, has MORE than proved he can deliver a dark and gritty Batman film without turning it into dark camp like Burton,or something so insane and flamboyant it would never happen, like Schumacher. I think that's why this film succeeds where the other films failed miserably, because aside from a man in a rag/mask calling himself Scarecrow, and another man in a Batsuit calling himself Batman, the film is camp free, a first for ANY live action Batman representation.Nolan gives us a gritty city with slums that echo the worst from around the world, AND he makes it dark enough to be very 'Batman' without making it look unnatural. Gotham City is supposed to be ugly and decayed, a virtual urban cesspool of crime, and a nightmare for the viewer. I loved Burton's Gothic flavor, but he couldn't capture reality. Everything felt like a fantastic set, but what Nolan does, is give us something that exists. Part of the nature of this film is the internal. Fears, primal impulses, what drives us to do the things that we do. How does a well meaning person go down a path of corruption? What is a person willing to do for justice and is it that far away from vengeance? These are the things the other films NEVER touched on, or if they did, it was never done right. This film does that. It's gritty, it's a crime movie. I think it's the first time since Batman'89 where organized crime was touched on at all, which is a large staple of the BATMAN comics. The other side of Batman, which usually revolved around insanity, or the criminally insane was also focused on, and once again.. DONE RIGHT. We finally see the inmates of Arkham Asylum as the criminally insane, sadistic predators they are. They are camp free,it's done damn near perfect. The film addresses these men are too sick to be put into prison, rapists, murderers, etc.This is a film that should shatter the preconceptions the inferior films have left with the mainstream film going audience, as well, please the REAL fans of Batman. I think the only people who MIGHT throw a fit are the people who swear on Burton's films as the ONLY way to be Batman or people who loved Schumacher's films. Secondly, I think strict Batman purists might have a problem with some story development, other than that, it's an excellent film. Another great thing about this film is it shows you can have multiple villains in a comic book based film and NOT have it pointlessly cluttered. The last time a Batman 'film' attempted to use three major villains, we ended up with the messy 'Batman and Robin'. This film delivers an intelligent mature plot (which easily could have come from the books, Long Halloween, No Man's Land come to mind) which involved three villains; Ra's Al Ghul, Carmine Falcone, and Scarecrow, and balances them perfectly keeping everything in the realm of believability. Bad guys shouldn't be scheming one dimensional stereotypes, they should be real people with goals. It's the first film to understand the psychology of Batman. It's adult, without being Restricted, entertaining, without being mindless, visually stunning without being unrealistic, and finally, WELL ACTED.Bale was BORN to play Batman, my only issue is him using his angry 'I'm gonna kill you' voice from Shaft and American Psycho for the Batman character to the point where it can be a bit much. That aside, he is STELLAR. Katie Holmes as always, it's great. If you're a fan of hers, you'll love her in this, especially visually. Cillian Murphy, much like Bale, he was BORN to play Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. He did it perfect; creepy, intelligent, everything the Scarecrow is without going overboard. What Nolan Goyer and Murphy have done here is bring the Scarecrow to life, possibly making him one of the coolest on screen villains in the history of film. That's a bold statement, but I think it's warranted. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, do I need to say anything about these guys? They were fantastic. Most noteworthy for the comics fans, we have a James Gordon who LOOKS like Gordon, and works with Batman UNLIKE the previous films. We also have another great Alfred. Comical, fatherly, and all around awesome, it's MICHAEL CAINE, you can't go wrong. I'd also like to address how awesome it was that Linus Roache was cast as Thomas Wayne, he LOOKS like Christian Bale. Liam Neeson, next best thing to using David Warner.I think I have addressed everything about this film that'll give you an ideal of what it'll be like without getting too far into the plot. In order to talk about Ra's Al Ghul I'd have to get into some detail, so I'll skip my big Ra's paragraph. I'm over the word limit, so I will say it was all done perfect but the stunning Katie Holmes should have played Talia, Ra's daughter. They got the PERFECT man for Ra's Al Ghul, trust me. So many films when they add a twist like this, it's done wretchedly, but not BATMAN BEGINS. I think the REAL Batman fans will love this, and fans of well made, acted, and written films will as well. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Dark Knight Kicks Serious Ass,"The film doesn't dunk you headfirst into a world of capes, Spandex and manly jaws. It builds the Batman universe in tiny, logical increments. Bruce Wayne's war on crime unfolds as a focused, military operation, and by the end of it all you're seeing Batmobiles and Bat-Signals and accepting them as absolute necessities, not the kitsch trappings of the Schumacher movies. It's far from po-faced, though ¬ñ there's a lovely scene where Bruce and Alfred figure out how they can order custom-sculpted Bat-ears from China without arousing suspicion. At the same time, Batman Begins is rich and resonant with a sense of mythology. It doesn't wink at its pulpy source material but elevates it, convincing you that there is something inherently noble about putting on a mask and beating the living crap out of crims. And it is a brutal film. An initial, surprising burst of violence steels you for its visceral tone. It bruises, scars, punches your heart. It's hardcore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Excellent!,I was fortunate enough to be able to see an advanced screening of Batman Begins and it was more than worth the two hours that I had to wait in line to get in to it. Christopher Nolan brings the darkness and depth to Batman that the franchise so desperately needed. The film's characters and story lines all revolve around the concept of fear and Nolan makes it the perfect psychological element to this iconic superhero. Christian Bale is fantastic and even manages to hint at Michael Keaton while in the famous cowl. The rest of the cast is superb as well; Michael Caine is a riot and Cillian Murphy is perfect as the Scarecrow.

Finally Batman has been done right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Almost ten years ago Warner Bros. declared the Batman franchise as dead as a teenager in a Friday The 13th film. After the abomination that was Batman & Robin WB felt as though fans would not be interested in seeing another Joel Shumacher helmed Batman film. WB was right. fast forward a few years and Director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) & screenwriter David Goyer (The Blade trilogy) decide they have what it takes to resurrect the Batman franchise. Nolan & Goyer were right. Batman Begins is by far the best live action Batman film made. Nolan & Goyer did the best thing they could do to a franchise that was on it's way to looking like a live action Saturday morning cartoon. They wiped the slate clean and started it from the ground up, hence the title Batman Begins. Unlike the film predecessors Batman Begins stars and features Batman. Meaning Batman is the main character (He was only the main character in Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm an animated Batman movie)instead of his villains. Batman should have been titles The Joker. Batman Returns should have been called The Adventures Of Catwoman & The Penguin. Batman Forever should have been titled The Mental Misadventures Of The Riddler & Two Face. Batman & Robin should have been called.....Crap! The Movie. Batman Begins is the perfect title for a Batman movie because this movie is absolute Batman. The plot is smart & intelligent and his origin is entertaining as hell to watch unfold. Whoever casted Christian Bale as Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, & Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon please stand up and take a bow. The casting was great. If I had to compare Batman Begins to any film I'd say it was like a cross between Spider-Man & The Bourne Identity. A great origin superhero movie mixed with a thinking man's action film. This is not dumbed down like any of those other Batman films (Batman Forever, Batman & Robin) it's smart, witty, & intelligent with out taking itself to seriously. I'm a comic book geek so I take my films based on comics very seriously. Until now Batman was never done right in Hollywood. For some stupid reason Hollywood kept trying like hell to channel the spirit of the goofy, campy television series of the '60's. Well that recipe has been tossed out the window. Not only is Batman Begins (In my opinion) the best movie of the summer, the most fun you'll have at the movies this summer, but the best superhero movie (granted he has no super powers) made. I only hope I walk out of The Fantastic 4 nearly as happy as I did with Batman Begins. Long live the new king of superhero/comic book movies. Welcome to Hollywood Batman, you have finally arrived.

Bats All Over the Belfrey.,"Dark, disturbing and demoralizing take on the ""Batman"" series as director Christopher Nolan (best known for ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"") resurrects a series that seemingly limped away in 1997. The title says it all as we get a prequel to the four new age installments that started in 1989. Bruce Wayne (the very moody Christian Bale) has been an international recluse after his parents were killed in a botched robbery while he was a youngster. He finds himself in Asia of all places and in trouble with police authorities. Soon Bale is being taught the ways of revenge and vengeance with the help of a very shady ninja cult led by Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe. Meanwhile, things are chaotic and crazed in a bleak Gotham City as childhood friend/current assistant district attorney Katie Holmes appears to be the only beacon of light. A ruthless crime boss (Tom Wilkinson) and a demented psycho-analyst (the excellent Cillian Murphy) are the key characters in an exact landscape spinning out of control. Bale's return to the city sends shock-waves to Holmes and Rutger Hauer (who is running Bale's rightful business affairs). Also along for the ride are butler Michael Caine and exiled technological genius Morgan Freeman who assist Bale as he starts his transformation to his alter ego. Seemingly only one good cop (Gary Oldman) within the city is also featured in the dizzying mix. Graphically violent and pitch black take on the material as we have social and psychological commentaries that mesh with layering story lines of complex characters, intense situations and a demented would-be outcome that involves biblical undertones and even military germ warfare. With all the difficulty and depth that ""Batman Begins"" has, it still does not necessarily set itself apart from the better superhero films produced. No doubt, Nolan's vision is likely the finest product of the five in the series (""Batman"" from 1989 would be the only other in the group that could compete) but we might almost get too much data as the film leaves a lot to swallow as the numerous characters and background end up getting in the way of confusing action sequences and schizophrenic pacing. Though far from perfect, I think that ""Batman Begins"" stands very tall within its genre and represents a real highlight for the cinema in 2005. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Nothing Happens,"I have reservations for how good this film actually is for three reasons: firstly, despite all the great actors in the film the experience is emotionally unmoving and visually rather conservative. Lastly, the film is somewhat hampered by creating key urban sequences on an interior sound stage.The movie does check all the right boxes for telling a decent story though; heaps of back-story, character subtext, little motifs about childhood trauma and alienation that fuel the idea that Batman (could be) an interesting film character. Unfortunately, the success of Sam Raimi's first two Spiderman films pretty much created an endless (often pointless) superhero re-tread economy. This movie genuinely tries something different, with more dialogue, a more cosmopolitan outlook and more real-world issues than hi-tech Marvel fluff.I was left largely unimpressed upon the initial viewing of Batman Begins; its not really quite a grown up film, nor is it a stylish fantasy film. Its sort of a crime drama with a guy appearing as Batman for a handful of scenes. The excellent (and not-to-be-missed) sequel The Dark Knight was one of the most successful films of the decade, making the back-story chapters here seem reasonable in hindsight, not that you need to see this film to understand that one.Oh, yeah - what's it about? Um, Bruce Wayne is trapped in a third world labour prison in the snow somewhere in southeast Asia, a group of terrorists from the region plan to attack Gotham with toxic gas that incites terror and maybe crash into some big buildings so Bruce, as Batman, must figure out their plans and stop them from doing so. Pretty good score, but like the set-design, it pales in comparison to Tim Burtons over-hyped 1989 film. Christoper Nolans film is more like a book come to life, whereas Tim Burtons movie was more like a marketing phenomenon based around impressive art direction and bubblegum. (Literally: bubblegum, the trading cards were omnipresent at the time). Thankfully Christopher Nolan actually has a brain, and treats his audience in the same way but doesn't really hit the narrative stride and excitement that the much-loved character deserves till the next movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"We reconcile with Batman, not the Rogue Gallery !","Finally, it was the movie which reconciles the real Batman fans with the hero itself. Not a Joker, nor a Cat Woman or a Penguin, or either a Riddler can push him aside this time. As well as all the Two-Faces, Poison Ivys and a Mr Freeze to ice this all over. This is hot ! We explore here the true origins of the Bat Man, alias Bruce Wayne, whom, in fear of bats and to cure his thirst of justice after the murder of his parents, had to be picked up by a Ninja clan after serving some time in an Asian jail. However, those who train him had more than justice in their minds and Bruce must flee in order to serve justice in Gotham City, now rotten with corruption and crime all over. But he must do justice with the help of Wayne Enterprises, the company owned by his late father and that he inherited. He'll soon find out this company is as well mingled in organized crime, and it's with the help of one Luscious Fox, employee of this company, as well as the Wayne's butler Alfred, that he might find what he was looking for, and support from a childhood friend, Rachel, the D.A.'s assistant, who secretly roots for him, and Lieutenant Gordon, only ally of the Police Force who believes he is not another vigilante.Christian Bale is no doubt the best Bruce Wayne/Batman ever, as he transients his character all the way. The rest of the cast is fine, but Katie Holmes seemed young for the D.A.'s assistant role.At least, we understand now Mr.Wayne's fear, as he becomes as fearful as the bats who attacked him in the well in his childhood years, a powerful way to fight for justice in Gotham City...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Tim Burton can rest at ease...,"While Chris Nolan scored some style points, he fails to capture the magic and fun that Burton so successfully did in the early nineties before tiring of the series and letting Joel ruin it. I'm not a comic book reader so I don't give any slack to this stuff. It either works on its own or it doesn't. BATMAN BEGINS... doesn't.My biggest problem with this film was pace. The story was so big that I felt rushed through every moment and a lot of characters felt underdeveloped. Nobody was introduced with any bravado. They were just sort of added to the story. I felt that Gary (always brilliant)Oldman's Detective Gordon could have had a terrific introduction but instead he's just sort of at the police station with the terrible child actor playing young Bruce.Lots of bad acting in this puppy. Outside of Bale, Oldman, Freeman and Cillian Murphy, I was none too impressed. Michael Caine actually made a pretty terrible Alfred. Michael Gough was much better casting. Lots of people didn't have much to do like Rutger Hauer and Ken Watanabe. Although Cillian Murphy was good, his character wasn't given much to do at all. Ultimately, he was a pretty pathetic villain. And at the end of the day, the entire plot of this movie was just some half-arsed rip off of the plot of Burton's Batman.Now Jack Nicholson... that was a villain. Tom Wilkinson probably inspired a little grave rolling for Jack Palance. Even Kim Basinger is remembered fondly compared to Katie Holmes' less than believable DA turn. Although she wasn't as bad as I thought she was going to be. By the way, that little kid from inner Gotham's city? You know the one. The one who thought his friends wouldn't believe he saw Batman and then OH SO COINKYDINKY wound up with Katie Holmes in the end? GIVE ME A BREAK! PUKE!Also, the end of this film was a total rip off of SPIDER-MAN (not that I liked that one much either). Can't these writers and directors be original? There are a couple of nice things in this movie. It's not like it's CATWOMAN or anything... but seriously, folks... we're giving this thing too much credit. The score was only so-so, nothing compared to Burton's awe-inspiring score by Danny Elfman (the Prince stuff we can always lose).Below are the only superhero/comic book movies I feel have actually worked as films on their own two legs that you can see and enjoy without having read a comic book.SUPERMAN SUPERMAN II X-MEN X-MEN 2 BATMAN BATMAN RETURNSBy the way, I'm friends with someone who wrote for BATMAN at DC and they weren't too impressed by this film either.Oh yeah... and Liam Neeson's mustache was horrendous.

"So well written and acted, I really didn't know what to do with myself","I can't remember the last time a ""geek"" movie took itself so seriously. Well, OK, I can. It was Lord of the Rings. Coincidentally, these are the best genre films of the last decade. I can't remember ever being so engaged in a character as I was Bruce Wayne/Batman. Christian Bale deserves serious props.Christopher Nolan is so...solid in his directing. If you look at his small body of work, he gets awesome toned down performances from traditionally over the top actors. With ""Insomnia"" it was Robin Williams and Al Pacino. Here it's Gary Oldman.Nolan makes otherwise preposterous premises become believable. It's the same philosophy as Lord of the Rings. Those films were written and treated on film as if they were actually historically based films - like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or something.I think that is the best way to shoot a comic book movie. Take yourself seriously. I think from the latest box office receipts we can tell that people are tired of pretty pictures and explosions for the sake of pretty pictures and explosions. We want a reason to care. It's all about making your film believable and engaging from a character standpoint. Batman Begins is the first ever comic book film, I believe, in which I was truly drawn into the world, the characters, and made to care ""what happens next"". I was stunned. Bravo Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and good Lord, don't forget Michael Caine! He was BRILLIANT.

No equal!!,"This is the best movie about Batman bar none. This is an excellent film , it can't really even be classified as a comic book Super Hero movie. It is that good. Great characters , great story, and of course great action. I highly recommend buying the DVD, you won't be disappointed.Christan Bale is totally believable as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Unlike the previous movies Batman is the star of the film. Also there are no campy elements or corny one liners. And the car!! Batman's car in this movie is exactly what a vigilante would need or use in the real world , because a sports car can be stopped, not this baby. No neon lights, no huge fins , no nonsense, Batman's new ride is awesome. Keaton did a fine performance as Batman , but I had a hard time believing he was Bruce , and physically Batman.

I love this movie - Batman finally gets his proper treatment,"I am a big Christopher Nolan fan, so when I heard he was making this movie, I was excited. When I finally saw it tonight, I was definitely not disappointed. I was gripped from the opening shots. Witty, ironic humour mixed with drama and excellent action all made for a gripping tale for this soul. To me, Bale looked fantastic in the bat suit - so much so that it didn't look like Bale at all. I thought the rest of the cast were perfectly placed, particularly Sir Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. As a fellow Ulsterman, I was very happy to see Liam Neeson doing his thing here. Cillian Murphy was very good as well, as far as I'm concerned - he was the source of some quite chilling moments.

Batman vs. Spiderman vs. Superman,"When asked who your favourite superhero was, these 3 are some of the biggest household names. We have now seen all of them portrayed in a recent movie (or 3 in spiderman's case) and we are confronted once again with the burning question of who is the greatest...To compare all of them, batman is the most human with no extreme alien qualities such as web or superhuman strength. Batman relies on technology and his incredible fighting techniques to destroy his enemy. It is impossible to relate to any of these superheroes yet the human factor of Batman makes him a far more interesting character. That and his car...Spiderman is of course a legend, he needs to keep up the much more difficult facade of Peter Parker compared to the other 2 heroes. The popularity of spiderman is noteworthy and the 3rd movie is a testament to this.Superman is the least imaginative of all the superheroes mainly because his superpowers are clich√©d and unimaginative. The latest superman movie was by far the biggest waste of film in the last 50 years. Never before have I hated a movie so passionately. Smallville however is a different story, it has all the makings of an awesome beginning to superman. Except.... As with so many series, if it takes off in its first season, the writers crave a bigger paycheck and in their endless greed the storyline goes straight to hell. Sad but true.So, in conclusion Batman is the clear winner in this skirmish with Spiderman in a close second!

Darker rebirth,"It seemed the past few years many things began ... again. Yes Superman returned, but it was a beginning too. Batman begins is one of the best efforts of this latest craze that emerged. And the director is playing a key part in this.Christopher Nolan is of course not the only man to ""blame"" on the success of this reinvention and of course re-birth of Batman (after part 3 and 4 you could be excused, if you thought it was over for Batman)! Where the new Bond (21st installment) was about to throw away the complete history of Bond as you knew it, Batman ""just"" reinvented the style of the two first movies. Yes I liked the first two Batmans, but I do also think that Nolan's Batman is better. Beginning by the costume (completely dark, instead of having something yellow on his chest, that would be like an easy target to shoot at) and goes on, with the man behind the mask.

The real Batman,"Batman Begins was a movie I liked marginally when I originally saw it, but have grown to like it better the more I see it. Christian Bale plays the renegade billionaire Bruce Wayne who mysteriously disappears for several years while studying the criminal mind and element in the Far East. He is found by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the League of Shadows. This organization uses Ninja tactics and sees itself as the guardian of the world. The League of Shadows exists like a Star Chamber, taking actions against criminal elements government courts will not deal with. This secret league was responsible for the sacking of Rome, and the London Fire. Now, they wish to level Gotham City. Bruce barely escapes after learning their battle tactics. Returning to Gotham, he dedicates himself to ridding the city of Falconi, a ruthless crime lord who has the city in his grips for decades. In fact, the man who killed Bruce's parents worked for him at one time, making the stakes higher. Wayne uses his clout to look into weapon systems his company developed. He find some body armor. An unusual car. A cape. He forges them all into his new persona, Batman. While he brings down Falconi, someone else gets to him first: Dr. Jonathan Crane or the Scarecrow, played by Cillian Murphy. His gas agent causes people to go insane by releasing their worst fears. Apparently, he is working with the League of Shadows and release his chemical into the drinking water. We also meet a young cop named James Gordon (Gary Oldman), who is trying to go against the crooked police department. Another player is Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), an attorney who works for the city. This is how Batman should have been. Director Christopher Nolan deftly puts Batman into the real world. While I enjoyed Tim Burton's concept for Batman and Batman Returns, it was foreign - removed from reality into an uncertain time with uncertain technology. What Nolan does is give us not only circumstances, but also consequences for a man driven to the edge. I also enjoyed his use of non-linear time, which he seems to be a fan of. It keeps the audience interested and puzzled until the third act when it truly unfolds and fully makes sense. Also, Chrisian Bale does a wonderful job as a man conflicted. He hates the criminal mind and believes they should be stopped. Still, he cannot bring himself to kill those he hates. He also deals with his own hatred and propensity towards vengeance. The other performers also give great performances. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as the company man who leads Bruce Wayne to the interesting toys. He tells him how they work and how they should be used. Michael Caine gives the best performance as Alfred Pennwise, the faithful butler to Bruce Wayne. His charm, charisma, and dedication are portrayed so well. I was even moved by Gus Lewis as a young Bruce Wayne who took the role seriously and gave us a boy who truly blamed himself for his parents' death. The best scene is when Alfred comforts his loss. This was one of the best of the superhero movies of the last ten years. I hope the next one is done just as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman for the Coldplay generation.,"The moral absolutes of comic-book movies have never seemed so relevant as now, as Star Wars: Episode III and Sin City brilliantly showed ( Yellow Bastard's castration will go down in history as the great shared moment of anti-Bush catharsis. ) But Christopher Nolan's dreadfully earnest Batman Begins is too obvious in its attempts to draw parallels with America's current malaise, and may ultimately tip the scales back to Joel Schumacher's neon-ribbed codpieces. Nolan strikes me as a calculating, soulless filmmaker who should be making movies about Rubber Man, as he twists himself into a Superpretzel trying to please the comic-book mavens, the intellectuals, the Friday-night date crowd, the SUV driving suburbanites, the sensitive artistes AND the action fans. But a Batman movie is not the place for him to trot out his knowledge of German literature and philosophy ( Novalis and Nietzsche, primarily. ) It sort of reminds me of all those Yale grads who end up writing sitcoms and Pixar animated features, and who drop various arcane references in order to pretend to themselves that they haven't sold out. This movie may seem to have integrity at first, but a closer examination will reveal just how made-by-committee it is.What really torpedoes the project, though, is something much simpler -- Nolan has no style, no juice, no cinematic blood in his veins. Did anyone really want to see a Batman movie directed by Sidney Lumet? Who wants to see anonymous drug-runners, cops with greasy mustaches and dull British character actors in this kind of movie? The only supervillian, The Scarecrow, is played by 20-something Cillian Murphy, and his scenes with the equally juvenile Katie Holmes make the audience feel as if they're sitting in on a laid-back acting class on Santa Monica Boulevard. There is a lack of imagination in the action scenes that will become fatally apparent to even the most impressed fans once they get this movie on DVD. This film is born to collect dust. There's not one memorable setpiece in the entire movie, nothing like the museum sequence in Burton's Batman that could put this over the top -- just lots of generic karate shot close-in. The big showdown at the end is like something out of the Speed movies.Ang Lee's version of Hulk -- the underrated trailblazer among the Serious Comic Book Movies, and the one that will stand the test of time -- is the perfect marriage of pop thrills and myth-savvy credibility. Almost every scene is memorable, from Hulk's eerily quiet rageout in in the desert, to his Shakespeareanly wordy confrontation with father Nick Nolte. It not only starts out as realistic and plausible as this Batman, but has the courage to plunge into the irrational and abstract at the end. Batman Begins, by contrast, is a dead weight, a humorless 70's cop show tarted up with cod philosophy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Sweet redemption for the Dark Knight.,"This one threatens Tim Burton's first as contender to the throne. The only advantages remaining for the original (modern) Batman are the atmosphere (Burton is the real dark knight here) and Jack Nicholson's irreplaceable Joker.My only real concern was with the plastic look of the cityscape miniatures, a problem I recall from most every other Batman movie. I still have yet to be sold on Gotham from air, though everyone is moving through it much more convincingly. Otherwise, the Gotham grounds are appreciable, from the Manor mountainside to the undercity. Wayne's travels also give Wally Pfister plenty of vistas to capture, starting right away with the detention camp and further up.For Batman Begins' length, it makes great use of the cast. Purists might balk at the large cast of villains (Joe Chill¬óthe elder Wayne's murderer, Carmine Falconi, Scarecrow, and Ra's al Ghul), but they all essentially serve to represent different aspects of the true villain, Bruce Wayne's own tortured psyche. No, I didn't ruin the movie, unless you came to watch exquisite Bat-gadgets, squeaky Bat-nipples on body armor, or anything in gaudy balloon letters. Batman has always represented the driving power of personal guilt, and this comes across well in Batman Begins.Christopher Nolan makes quite a bit from his mostly British casting, especially the paternal (and Irish, yes) Liam Neeson. I missed Gary Oldman as Not-Yet-Commissioner Gordon, expecting him to be a usual villain; regardless, he made a good, standoffish young lieutenant. The Asian in me wishes that Ken Watanabe was put to more effective use, but I believe he was given barely enough screen time. There is only one (other) marginalized character, though her involvement is still integral to the plot.One could take the story in different ways, as there are many different interpretations of the Batman mythos. Personally, I didn't read all the comics¬óI thought Lucius Fox was a mortal enemy just from reading previews. Nolan and (David) Goyer's screenplay barely skims the ""World's Greatest Detective"" aspect, presumably from Wayne's lack of training in that regard at this early point. And it certainly isn't linear until the save-the-city action kicks in. What we are given is an entirely plausible origin for one of the bastions of legendary fiction. Batman's design in this iteration borrows more from Jane's Monthly than DC serials, taking the Batmobile off the hot-rod track and onto urban streets.A few spots of humor help to expand the fear dynamic, especially where Alfred (Michael Caine) and Fox (Morgan Freeman) are concerned. Plenty of inventive Foley and an ethereal Hans Zimmer soundtrack help round out this ""Episode One"" of the comics-to-movies world. So long as the focus remains on quality rather than spectacle, the world of Gotham will remain a viable backdrop for the Caped Crusader.

Yuck,"ChristopherNolan made a lot of serious mistakes in this film. First, casting Christian Bale who has all the charisma and gravitas of a pumped-up Pauly Shore. But so what? This film is an obvious feeble stab at resurrecting a moribund Batman series that should have gone to a peaceful demise 8 years ago. Katie Holmes? Please. Probably a nice kid, but she'd barely survive a casting call for summer theater in Akron, Ohio. The pretentious, plodding script is lugubrious, morose and utterly incredible--even for a comic book. What is this nonsense about Shangri-La and Ninja gibberish and psychobabble about fear and revenge? Don't even ask about the ludicrously lame scenes of battle and urban catastrophe--pathetic. The editors should be taken out and shot. But wait! No! They had nothing to work with! If you need one simple proof of how rotten this is, just consider the great character actor Gary Oldman embarrassingly mired in this bat dung. I did however love Rutger Hauer as Donald Rumsfeld. Michael Caine should have paid to have his scenes deleted. Morgan Freeman, the default Black eminence in many recent films, phones in his routine performance. Liam Neeson, a superb actor, is again relegated to a murky back-story clich√©d role as in Gangs of New York and a couple of later Star Wars pics. One standout in this mess is Cillian Murphy as a preening, smarmy uber-yuppie.

Whoa Baby,"Okay, Katie Holmes looks like her eyes are going to slide off her face, but everything else in the movie was great. Who would have thought that Micheal Keaton would be supplanted as ""the"" Batman? Christian Bale was fantastic. He has the build, the brooding brow, the spark of mischief Batman seriously needed. Keaton had it all but the build. Casting is everything in a movie, and obviously they went all out on this one. From Gary Oldman(on the side of the light, this time)and Micheal Caine (who works in any movie and usually makes them better than they were before) to Liam Neeson and even a small part by Ken Watanebe who shined in ""The Last Samurai"", the cast truly made the movie. (Even Katie). And apparently Katie makes much better choices in work than her boyfriend. The plot was simple, yet elegant. We all know the story of Batman, where he came from, why he does what he does, and his backdrop, Gotham, and the crime within the city. We are given reasons for the crime, another good performance by Linus Roache (Riddick)as Bruce's father, and some great performances by the villains, especially Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow.

Batman Begins Anew!!!,"All I have to say is wow after seeing this film. Unlike some of the earlier incarnations of this franchise, I have no qualms about calling this a film and not a movie. The acting is first rate and the story makes a tortured hero very believable. The movie returns to a darker Gotham, which if not as dark as Mr. Burton envisioned, is perfect in my view. The movie is not campy or special effect laden; it instead focuses on the characters and the story to drive it to success. I had doubts when I saw who was cast as Batman before the film, but Bale does an excellent job. He is perhaps not the best actor to don the suit, I personally thought Kilmer was the most effective in the persona, but he is excellent and never during the course of the film do you doubt his reality.

The True Dark Knight,"Christopher Nolan has done what no other movie director has had the courage to do. Make a Batman film with such dedication to the character that it simply is the best comic book character adaptation I have yet to see.If you are prone to reading attention disorders, you might has well skip this thread. I warn you up front it is a long on so you might move on, nothing for you to see here. If you are interested in an in-depth review which will contain some spoilers, then let's dance for a bit.Christian Bale has hands down stole the mantle of the Batman and made it his own. Nolan was wise enough and also had the insight that the Batman is actually a hell of a lot more of an interesting character than the twisted villains that have stolen the limelight in the previous films. Bruce Wayne/Batman is a very complex multifaceted human being. Anyone who follows the comics knows that Batman is borderline psychotic. That is his appeal. Nolan knows this, uses it to the fullest and fleshes out the character from his comic book incarnation and makes him flesh and blood.The development takes us back to the tragedy that spawned Bruce's thirst for validity. The child actor who played Bruce Wayne as a boy was for me the scariest choice that Nolan had to make. He chose wisely. We see Bruce's grief and isolation through this child as well as the surrogate father Alfred becomes. Yet even Alfred, played wonderfully by Michael Caine, cannot cross the threshold into Bruce's private hell. He can only stand back and be there for the young Wayne. We also see why Bruce Wayne chooses the bat as his symbol and his mantle. The scene when the adult Bruce meets his fear in the cave is truly inspiring.So how did Bruce Wayne learn all his tricks of the trade? Nolan takes us somewhere to Tibet where Wayne gets introduced to the League of Shadows under the mysterious Decard.. Note here, Liam Neeson delivers the performance as a mentor far exceeds that of the one in Star Wars. Here given a choice at the height of his training, Wayne chooses different and departs the League that exists under the rule of Ra's Al Ghul. Then portrayed by Ken Watanbe.Nolan doesn't want to candy coat Batman. He knows his source material which makes this film stand out and frankly shame all the ones that proceeded it. Yes, I said shame. Because that is exactly what the previous films did to Batman, especially the ones done under Joel Schumaker. Who not only nearly destroyed the Batman franchise for Warner Bros. but also tried his best to destroy Val Kilmer's career when Kilmer started to clash over creative differences.This is the Batman that Miller wrote about. Obsessed, driven. It is also the first time that a director took the character from the ground up and using the source material bothered to explain just how Wayne got all those wonderful toys. Especially the Batmobile. I have read that many saw pictures of the Batmobile and wept. They wanted the Giger toy car from the previous flicks. This car is NO toy. It actually does what it does in the film This is a realistic piece of bad ass ed machinery that you definitely do NOT want on your tail. It is awesome and fear inspiring. The car itself should be considered part of the cast.In fact another stroke of genius is that Nolan doesn't overplay the cast. Gordon is played just how I envisioned him from YEAR ONE. Oldman looks just like a Sgt. Gordon I loved the little homage scene where he is taking out the trash and you see inside his brownstone apartment spying his wife eating with a very young Babs .Trust me, it is all there. Nolan made the Batman's universe real and believable.Also Nolan explains Wayne's world and shows its complication. From his drunken playboy routine that is his real mask, to the battle to get control back from the power mongrels at Wayne Enterprises. Like I said, Bruce Wayne has a complicated world. Here he has to hide his true self under the guise of a foppish Bruce Wayne. Bale displays the conflict here excellently. He has to play the buffoon so no one will know just exactly he is up to. This isolates him further limiting the number of friends within his circle. One friend, Fox, played by Morgan Freeman, who stated he took the role because Batman has always been his favorite character, supplies him with the beginnings of his arsenal. But his true confidant is Alfred, who has some of the best lines. The chemistry between Bale and Caine work so well that Alfred is actually a main player.If you are looking for huge CGI effect, watch Spiderman again. This is more gritty, the only effects are the subtle ones and the insidious effects of the Scarecrow's fear toxin. Wait until you see Batman behind the eyes of the Scarecrow after Prof Crane has had a dose of his own medicine. ""Dr Cane is not here anymore..."" Note: Don't expect a Danny Elfman score either. This score his deep, brooding and ominous. There are no frills here...just base instinct rumbling through your psyche. Well done. Warner Bros wised up. They followed a fan site named www.batmanonfilm.com for sometime after the demise by Joel Schumaker. They realized that here was a sounding board for fans of the character and learned painfully that their marketing dept was wrong. Batman is not for kids and be warned, this really isn't a kid's movie. It is a grown up film aimed at the comic book audience that grew up ages ago.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
In the same league as Burton's films,"Batman Begins is raved about as one of the best superhero movies ever and I don't exactly get it, I don't wanna make it seem like I didn't like the film because I did.Batman Begins is absolutely thrilling, Bale and Neeson do terrific jobs and it's also paired with one of the best and scariest DC villains.But the character work seems uneven to me, I didn't feel any connection between Bruce and Rachel and Rachel was terribly written.Also, some of the fight scenes are legitimately terrible, and Scarecrow's defeat was one of the funniest things I've seen in a superhero movie.Bruce Wayne was a great character but I just feel Rachel could've had more, and there isn't any explanation for what he can do with his voice, and he won't kill a literal murderer but he's fine killing like 50 innocent people.But Nolan's direction was exhilarating and the film looks great, a good start to one of the most iconic trilogies in film history.And I'm gonna give Batman Begins a B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
My brief review of the film,"A well made action film, especially of its sort, it constantly tackles below surface ideas, such as justice, fighting crime, fears and corruption, while at the same time the film offers exciting action on the surface. The visual effects are very effective, and the overall visual style suits the project very well. Cillian Murphy is worth noting for an intriguing performance, even if the rest of the cast members only act adequately. The film is somewhat slow to build up, focusing on some of the story elements for too long, but once the film gets going, it is superb. There are certain imperfections that one generally accepts in these types of movie blockbusters. Yes, the on screen romance is dull, but at least here it is not a useless subplot. Yes, some of the characters are inserted just for laughs, and not to add anything to the story. Yes, even some of the necessary characters have pointless moments of comic relief. Yes, the special effects tend to go over-the-top here and there. However, do all these points really matter? If you are expecting a flawless masterpiece then they do, and you will not find such a film here. But, if you just want to see an action film that is a cut above the rest, this is a great example: a film that is engaging both below as well as above the surface.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman has been rescued,"I just had a private screening at the office of our local distributors and I would like to urge, make that,strongly urge all of you who have lost hope on another Hollywood driven Batman franchise to go see this film.You could very well say that this is an action movie which is character driven. And even though we're still talking about a guy in a bat suit, that is only secondary to the very believable motivations and actions of someone who: a)saw his parents murdered in front of him and grows with an unfulfilled hunger for revenge and b)has all the economic means to pursue that hunger in whatever fashion he chooses to.But worry not batfans, Nolan has prepared a pleaser which delivers every ounce of darkness this character has always been short of in previous films. Be it from impressive open shots featuring gargoyle like poses above Gotham or from menacing close ups, Nolan and Bale's character does inspire fear.Definitely not suitable for children, Adam West fans and followers of the *gasp* last two installments of the series.The brainy ones will be pleased as well, since the film does a magnificent job in explaining every gadget's practical origins and most of the character's decisions. Moreover, you never forget that it is Bruce Wayne, mere human, the one facing danger.This in particular only accentuates the connection with the character. It is not the undefeatable super hero who no one worries about, it's a man who's stretching the very limits of what a person can do.Bruce and Rachel's relationship is not pure saccharine. Alfred is both father figure and right arm, with equal parts tough love and brilliant dignity.References to the historical Batman are plenty and well placed, making this the most satisfying Dark Knight flick I've ever seen. Hope this helps.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A daily comment from Midget Emma: Batman Begins (2005),"This is the best superhero movie ever. Although that is yet to be seen because I haven't seen the The Dark Knight yet. The reason this rises above the other superhero movies is that it such a much more believable and well told story then the other movies.This tells us how Batman became the dark knight and what made him who he is. We see Batman become a warrior and return to Gotham City and face off against his first nemesis the scarecrow. He is also reunited with his first love Rachel played by Katie Holmes. The Batmobile was awesome it was a tank basically. The bat suit was great. It looked like a samurai suit. This movie had almost everything that made Batman. The Batmobile, the bat suit, the bat cave, the love story and the evil villain. Batman was a renegade in this movie. So that means no terrible sidekick called Robin.There is always a love story in a superhero movie and this one does throw out that tradition. This one is between Batman and his childhood friend Rachel. Rachel is a DA and she is fighting in court while Bruce Wayne is being a playboy. I found it to be a pretty damn realistic love story. A good love story is hard to find in movies these days. Even the love story is a reason to watch this movie.Now to the villain. The Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy in a great performance) was great he was scary, creepy and a total evil person. He uses a gas to poison his victims and that causes them to see there fears. He was a very satisfying villain. Another reason to see it.Now to the acting. Christian bale was a great Batman. He suited it so well. The only thing that was weird was the voice he did when he was Batman. When he was Bruce Wayne he was excellent. A total different performance between the two. Michael Caine was superb (like always) as Bruce's butler. It didn't even seem like he was trying. Gary Oldman is one of the best actors today. Whether you are watching him as Sirius Black in Harry Potter or Zorg in The fifth element he is always giving us a different performance. Again he is gave us a totally new performance in Batman Begins. He is different in every movie he is in. Katie Holmes played Batman's love interest. Let me just say she pulled it off. She was good but unfortunately she was worst performance in this movie. She just didn't get above the rest of her co- stars. That doesn't mean she wasn't good. But she has been replace in The Dark Knight by Maggie Gyllenhaal. We will see how she does in it.I highly recommend this if you like superhero movies or have seen the other Batman movies. This a great addition to anyone's collection.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Brilliant!!,"This was definitely the best movie I saw all summer! i think i saw it 3 times and loved it every time. I also saw it in IMAX and that was such a thrilling experience. I've never seen such a great ensemble of actors. First of all, Christian Bale was absolutely perfect for the role of Batman. His acting is absolutely phenomenal and he brought a new edge to the Dark Knight and i think this franchise really needed that and i have to tip my hat off to him for buffing up for this role after being so sickly skinny for The Machinest- now thats a dedicated actor. Michael Caine was definitely the comic relief of the movie and brought some pretty funny one-liners, but overall this movie was a serious, emotional thriller and thats what made it so great! Morgan Freeman was also quite funny and enjoyable to watch as the somewhat sidekick of Batman. Liam Neeson was brilliant as usual, but Katie Holmes I was not completely happy about, but the movie still turned out great and I'm definitely buying it the day it comes out on DVD. I just hope the special features are as great as the movie. To top it off, I also thought the music was phenomenal as well. This is definitely a must see and #1 on my list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bruce Almighty,"""Batman Begins"" (2005) directed by Christopher Nolan, takes us to the origins of Bruce Almighty aka Dark Night aka Batman. I have to admit that I have not seen any Batman's movies; so it made sense to explore the beginning of the legend, to find out how the billionaire Bruce Wayne ended up as a masked crusader who fought restlessly against the sinister forces that prey on the innocent and threaten to destroy Gotham City.Never been able to forget the murder of his parents before his eyes for which he felt guilty and responsible, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) traveled the world fighting injustice with small-time criminals until one day mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) finds him and offers him the training with a mysterious and powerful League of Shadows, the organization presided over by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). The League of Shadows is dedicated to restoring ""balance"" to a world in which ""criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding."" Part of Ra's Al Ghul and Ducard plan was the total destruction of Gotham City. Bruce refuses to participate in it and returns to Gotham City where under the mask of Batman, he fights the corrupted city officials, the powerful mafia boss (Tom Wilkinson in yet another memorable performance), and the villainous Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, the show stealing performance from a young actor).By the end of the movie, we will know why Bruce chose Batman as his alter ago, we will see the original bat-mobile and will meet his friends and allies for the first time that include his trusted butler who has been always more than butler but a family member, Alfred (Michael Cane), the head of the science department in his corporation, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman plays a combination of God and Q) who can or have already invented anything, and honest police officer, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman is very believable in his rare good-guy role. He also has the best quote in the movie. When watching bat mobile in action, he exclaims, ""I've got to get me one of these!""Directed by a very talented master of dark and atmospheric films with deep and interesting characters, Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" is gripping and emotional adventure which is equally interesting for the viewers of all ages and backgrounds.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Good, but did not hit expectations","(There are kind of spoilers but not really) I will be complaining about this for most of this review, although this is a good film, like I said in the title, it did not hit expectations. Lets talk about the good things first, Christian Bale's acting is phenomenal and I am glad they made this movie about Bruce a lot more than The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. This movie has a good plot, I just found it confusing, and some of the lines were too quiet for me to hear, you could just say ""Turn it up"" but if I turn it up too much the loud lines break my ears. Now to complain, of course I shouldn't listen to all reviews, but I was expecting a lot more from this movie than I got, the first hour is pretty boring, and while the second half is more fun because Bruce became batman, its still not super fun until the last 30 minutes. It's kind of like The Iron Giant in that way, but I think I liked The Iron Giant more. Those are my main complaints with this movie, although I have some smaller complaints such as how the villain is not nearly as good as The Dark Knight or The Dark Knight Rises, but that is just expecting too much. Overall a good film but not that close to being a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Gotham Divine...BATMAN matures..'campy'  turns to concrete,"With all obvious accounting, the Batman Magic' is back! Not since Michael Keaton, when the first modern and great, big screen Batman appeared in 1989, has there been such a commotion made about a new Batman movie. I had not seen this in the movie theater, but as with the first I started seeing bumper stickers and baseball caps and posters of the Batman Begins logos and the like, that's what let me know this was different, than the others. The first Keaton one, I saw it right-off-the-bat! No waiting, with this there had been so many in between, that seemed to be slipping more and more with every new installment, that I simply 'balked' at the thought of Batman 'Again'.Well after I had caught my breath I was astounded at the beauty of the first scenes and how this film instantly whisked me into the whole story. Amazed, as I watched 'Bale' brought on the 'Knight' with a new era of and a fresh-feeling crisp new character/hero. Liam Neeson, enters from out of nowhere and he is a thing of beauty. A solid-cast mentor/trainer in the fine art of crime fighting. Neeson is a pillar in the 'Begin' set. As the grueling training comes to a successful end, there comes the time to re-enter his broken life, complete with his estate and butler. Michael Caine is delightful as the classy care servant 'Alfred'. There was some real genius, to place Caine in this position, he fits to a 'T'. Rutger Hauer, is an acting hero of mine from way back and this was just an unexpected treat of a performance that he had in the story. Gary Oldman, is versatile, Tom Cruise wishes he was as good as Old' Gary. Oldman is inspirational with every labored breath that he took. I was amused too, at one point as the Batman made a surprise appearance at Gordon's (Oldman) home, on the steps Batman informs him of the situation and as he answers Oldman is doing a perfect 'Christopher Walken' styled delivery, just in those few sentences. That gave even a wider performance overall. In the hotel, I laughed as Bruce Wayne having friendly dinner conversation with colleagues from his company when asked about the news of the Batman, says ""A man dressed as a bat clearly has some issues to take care of."" Schluffing it off, as just another crazy man in the dark city. Pure gold.I must say, that Katie Holmes seemed a little too young for me in the beginning, albeit she came through toward the end with a satisfying role. Tom Wilkinson, playing the big crime boss, was reminiscent of the days of Nicholson (the Joker) with the late great Jack Palance,(Boss Grissom) but surely didn't reach the criminal element that these two gave off in stellar performance's in Burton's 89' Batman. At one point in the prison holding room, Wilkinson seemed to be acting much like Dan Hedaya, as he was speaking to counsel as the crime lord.Morgan Freeman is wondrously refreshing, and apart from other roles he has played, I enjoyed Lucius Fox for everything that he (Freeman) gave it, simple, easy and likable. The other players all found excellent fitting surrounding our main names. There was a lot put into this one no denying it, I was overtaken by the classic yet new styling of the camera shots and the places that the story took us to, and last but not least that Bat-Vehicle is something that every Hummer 'wishes' it could dream, wake-up and become. The Bat-S.U.V. for all your needs.Thoroughly penetrating in delivery, this has a strength and smoothness in it's style, it is a solid tailor-crafted action/drama ...a sure fire hit.

Holy Hot Mess Batman!,"Ohhh where to begin? I had been hearing so much about this movie. ""Oh it is so much more like the original batman comic books"". ""Finally a serious Batman!"" ""Christian Bale is the best Batman"" Blah blah blah. All three statements couldn't be furthest from the truth. This Batman film was the least like the comic book in so many ways I don't have room to write them all. I just cannot get over how many people are acting like this did something ""better"" or ""more stylish"" than the previous Batman movies. All the movie really did was make a complete departure not only from the universe of the previous Batman films but of the comic book world of the character created in the first place. The visuals were striking but no more striking than Burton's. The actors' performance were OK but Christian Bale as Superman was much the weenie at times and downright boring. Very very little is left the same from all previous representations that all is left is use of character names and places. Is that particularly innovative and creative? Uhhh no I don't think so. The action of the movie if you can really call it that was hardly groundbreaking or anything particularly exciting. Overall very slow moving at times and incomprehensible.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best Superhero Film of the Decade ... so far,"There is a moment towards the climax of ""Batman Begins"" which illustrates why this film is an exceptional superhero flick. During a stunning car chase sequence, Batman (aka Bruce Wayne), our hero, crushes a number of police cars, at the very least injuring a number of policemen. Once Bruce Wayne returns home, he is reprimanded for showboating by his loyal butler, Alfred. In this sequence, the strengths of the film are neatly summed up. An exciting chase sequence is mixed with ambiguity surrounding our protagonist with questions raised over what is necessary for good to triumph. Indeed, at some points during this film, we are left asking what is good and whether it is triumphing at all. In short, this film merges superb action, clever character work and intelligent moral and philosophical questions all the way through with perfect balance.During a decade where the box-office has been stuffed with super-heroics of all shapes and sizes, this film remains the best super-hero film of the decade, with the only imminent challenger to that crown seemingly being its own sequel. Even the ""Spider-Man"" films, which together with the ""X-Men"" films can lay claim to starting the major revival of the genre, are able to beat this. But the comparisons are strong and the influences upon each other even stronger. ""Spider-Man"" arrived in 2002 and boasted strong character work as well as blockbuster action sequences. ""Batman Begins"" was deep into production when ""Spider-Man 2"" arrived in cinemas in 2004 with even stronger and detailed characters, better visual effects and action sequences that were greeted with applause the world over. The bar had been raised by the time the Dark Knight's origins were brought to the screen a year later. Expectations were high and the pressure was on.Nolan had the guts to do what he thought was necessary to make the franchise credible after the disaster of Joel Schumacher's ""Batman and Robin"" from the late nineties. Out went the camp Batsuits and cheesy dialogue, the comical villains and supernatural design. In came a gritty, realistic Gotham with as much backstory as the central character and villains who were not cartoonish. This is a world that is not dystopian but downtrodden and at the centre of it is Bruce Wayne who we find in prison, a lost-soul.Nolan devotes a relatively action-free hour to the central character, his past and the genesis of Batman. He is trained with brutal methods, whilst we are slowly shown the origin of his fear of bats and the death of his parents. He faces questions of justice and identity before resolving to return to Gotham where he slowly confronts his fears, his guilt and his anger and becomes Batman.Once the suit is donned, the film hits top gear. The action sequences and set-pieces come thick and fast. We meet our villains (excellent performances from Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy), though the nemesis remains a mystery until late on. We discover the childhood sweetheart, now District Attorney, Rachel Dawes (a competent but unpopular Katie Holmes) and other lead good guy, policeman Gordon (another brilliant supporting performance from Gary Oldman), not to mention faithful butler and serial scene-stealer Alfred (long live Michael Caine). The philosophical questions, already established in the opening half-hour, are expanded upon (a detailed exploration of justice being the main one, with both protagonist and antagonist believing that they are carrying it out) whilst the world is filled in and Nolan's canvas expands.But the focus never shifts from Bruce Wayne, who is complex, interesting, sympathetic and expertly performed by Christian Bale. For all of the action (and there is enough of it, with none of it disappointing) the most enduring image is an astonishing shot of the Dark Knight silhouetted against the dawn sky as he stands at the top of the skyscraper surveying the metropolis below. It is a beautiful spine-tingling moment that, in an image, shows the strength of the film. This is an in depth exploration of a fascinating central character done with style and in a thrilling manner. This is not just the thinking man's superhero film. It is every man's superhero film with action and intelligence working together to brilliant effect.The bar had been raised once more and it became evident in what followed. About a year and a half after the release of this reinvention came a similar change of direction for the Bond franchise with ""Casino Royale"" followed shortly by a trailer for ""Spider-Man 3"" which seemed to be heading into ultra-dark territory. Spider-Man's identity and soul where going to be at stake, but the film itself failed to match Nolan's effort. In fact, in the attempt to raise the bar once more it fell well short of previous efforts.And here we are, three years later, with the sequel ""The Dark Knight"" about to be released, and still Nolan's film sits on top of the pile. Why has no-one matched it? Is it something to do with the character or the director that makes ""Batman Begins"" unique? The franchise is not unique, but the director is. All you need do is look at his other pieces of work (especially the intelligent ""Memento"" and the intense ""The Prestige"") to realise that Christopher Nolan is a director of great intelligence, ability and style. Another film like ""Batman Begins"" from another franchise is not impossible, it is just very difficult.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The sound of excitement,"There are not too many surprises in BATMAN BEGINS in terms of plot -- after all this time, let's face it: We know how things will turn out for the Caped Crusader. No, the real surprises are in the style of the film, which Christopher Nolan adapts from a whiz-bang comic to a modern era. He takes his time developing the familiar story about how billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne (a ripped Christian Bale; his biceps are the size of cocker spaniels) goes from orphan to avenging angel with the help of a mysterious mentor (Liam Neeson). Batman's skills, we learn, are those of the Ninja, and Gotham City exists in a world of its own, neither present-day New York nor some retro-fitted '30s idealized set. The cast is exceptional, the sound design spectacular (although the editing gets a little frantic and confused). It owes more to Alec Baldwin's THE SHADOW in its mythologizing and mystical treatment of the hero, who here is at the center of the action, not peripheral to the villains. In fact, this is probably the Batman movie Tim Burton wishes he'd made: Brooding, contemplative, paced like a novel. Holy prequels, Batman! (c) AWJ",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Studies the man behind the mask instead of the bat-nipples and gloss.,"""Batman"" is all about a man who battles his enemies and inner demons. It's about fear, acceptance, morality and reality: Batman is not a superhero, contrary to popular belief. He doesn't have extraordinary powers. He's human, physically and emotionally. That is why Batman has always appealed to me, and I imagine many others feel the same way.I don't read comics, so I can't be one of the many angry fans who claim Tim Burton's 1989 adaptation was poor; but as a film, it didn't really focus on the psychological aspects of the story, so I can see their point. Michael Keaton was an unconvincing Bruce Wayne ¬ñ he wasn't believable as a suave playboy or a ruthless billionaire. Jack Nicholson was fun as the Joker, the sets were gloriously dark and Gothic, but at its heart the film was as cold as its exterior. There was nothing of actual substance ¬ñ seen today the film is just an entertaining comic book-movie with good visual design that could have been better.The sequels came and went, none of them living up to the original, and the casket was sealed in 1998 with ""Batman and Robin"" ¬ñ considered by many to be one of the all-time worst films in existence. (And I agree.) The problem, I think, is that all these films ignored what is explored so proficiently in ""Batman Begins: the fragmented mind of a billionaire who grew up under the constant shadow of his family's legacy, and never wanted to accept his reality; a man who learns to hate crime (and more specifically criminals) after his parents are murdered before his eyes by a lowly street thug.Bruce Wayne is a fascist at heart ¬ñ but has enough moral fiber to resist devolving into an executioner. ""That is the only thing that separates us from them,"" Bruce says in ""Batman Begins."" And that's something that the film latches on to ¬ñ amongst other topics ¬ñ and what makes it not only the best of the ""Batman"" movies, but also a great film by any standard.I admire the technical skill of this production. The fight scenes are fast and blurred ¬ñ I usually hate this, but it works well in ""Batman Begins,"" because we're meant to fear the unknown. Sounds are used to great effect. Cinematic ally, Batman becomes a movie monster on occasion ¬ñ the scene where a group of smugglers are picked off one-by-one in the darkness, with scattering sounds overhead and screams and gunshots piercing the silence, brings to mind Ridley Scott's ""Alien."" In another segment, Batman questions Crane while he is on drugs, which results in some truly terrifying images that will shock children who are familiar with Batman as a flawless hero.I also like the fact that Christopher Nolan ¬ñ who admittedly does not prefer using modern special effects ¬ñ bases his film around the characters so much indeed that he uses very little CGI. Apart from a few action sequences and swarms of bats, most of ""Batman Begins"" is real, and that really impressed me. (I do not like modern effects, either.) I could tell the city was real, I could tell the Batmobile was real, and I could tell Batman was real. Remember the segment in ""Batman and Robin"" where they surf 30,000 feet above ground on pieces of an exploding rocket ship and look like cartoon characters? There's none of that crap here.Bale is perfect as Batman, and the best yet, because he fits every aspect of the character; he is believable as a smug, ruthless playboy. We can see him as a troubled young man haunted by his past and an unbearable sense of guilt. And in the suit, he looks confident without being comfortable ¬ñ he's still learning how to adapt. We can imagine how far he will progress in the sequels when, at the end of ""Begins,"" he has finally become the Batman we all know.The movie is grim like Burton's but more realistic, and not as glossy and perfect; the suit is imperfect, Batman's technology and secrets are exposed, the Batmobile is ugly and efficient, and the bat cave was originally part of the underground railroad and doesn't have any gadgets or special super-duper display cases for the suits. (I never did understand the point of encasing the Bat Suit in a special shiny glass container when no one was supposed to even see it except Bruce and Alfred.) ""Batman Begins"" is to Burton's ""Batman"" what Burton's ""Batman"" was to the Adam West version. It's darker. It's surprising. It's better. This is the best ""action"" film of the summer ¬ñ one that doesn't favor CGI over characters or huge overblown action sequences instead of humble moments of dialogue. Sure, there's action. There's a cool fight sequence aboard a train. But because the characters are given depth, we actually care about them, which is something George Lucas could learn from.In an era when bigger is better, and audiences are used to Batman making his appearance on-screen in mere minutes of each film, ""Begins"" does something completely unexpected (and risky). It actually takes its time. Bruce Wayne doesn't don his famous suit and cape for the first hour of the film ¬ñ and when he finally does, the costume isn't fantasized. It's imperfect, awkward and ugly. And best of all, there are no bat-nipples this time. All considered, is it really so surprising that ""Batman Begins"" has only made a disappointing $71 million in its first week? Audiences are not used to blockbusters of such depth and beauty.Note: I had to trim my plot summary in this review because IMDb has a 1,000 word limit.

Christian Bale is definitely convincing, and with Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy (oh my god, so gorgeous!) and Gary Oldman (funny, I didn't recognize him...) in the same movie, I don't really know who else we could ask for, they're all simply brilliant! The movie is pretty long but time passed really quickly, and I liked the alteration of action, jokes and deeper stuff, like the introspection that is bound to happen.

Actually, with all due respect, forget Tim Burton's moody, dark take on the hero, too: this is the Batman film fans have been waiting for ever since Bob Kane created the character in 1939.Burton's movies were great in terms of atmosphere and mood, but still left us with some questions: why did Bruce Wayne become Batman? What made him choose a bat as his symbol? Where did he get all his gadgets from? Christopher Nolan answers all these questions in a gritty, realistic superhero opus that combines a big budget, an uncompromised directorial vision and some of the best writing and acting the genre's ever seen.The story (written by Nolan and David ""Blade"" Goyer) focuses on Bruce Wayne (a superb Christian Bale) returning to Gotham City after a very long time spent abroad, trying to find himself and learning martial arts from Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson,excellent). While trying to get his company back, he also decides to fight crime in order to avenge the murder of his parents, but he can't do it as a normal guy. He has to become something else, a symbol or, as Ducard put it, a legend. Hence the Batsuit: ""Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies share my dread."".The script is bulletproof, much like Batman's costume, and so is the look of the film: Nolan, an experienced director of psychological thrillers (Memento and Insomnia), takes inspiration from Burton's brooding aesthetic but tones it down a notch, keeping the movie firmly rooted in a world that is as real as possible (the only hint of grandeur is contained in the music, a masterclass in film scoring that stems from the combined effort of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard).For the same reason, all the characters are undeniably human: sure, Bruce Wayne does dress as a bat, but he has a plausible reason for doing so, and his gadgets, designed by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), are all based on existing military technology - there's no James Bond extravaganza here. Rather than the Justice League or, even worse, Robin, sidekicks are limited to the indispensable Alfred (Michael Caine, brilliant as usual) and Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, same as Caine), with a little help from Katie Holmes (not bad, actually) as a potential love interest. Even the villains are, by superhero standards, normal, Tom Wilkinson being particularly great to watch as an Italian-American mob boss. Granted, there is a slight concession to Burton's typical imagery in the form of the demented Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy, best Bat-nemesis since Jack Nicholson), but just like the rest of the film, it works astoundingly well.Verdict: quite simply the best superhero movie ever and the best film of summer 2005. I'm already waiting for the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Satisfying Revival of The Batman,"Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins follows the story of Bruce Wayne's childhood up until he decides to become, the Batman. Unlike the more commonly seen bright and happy Superhero films with predictable plots and repetitive structure; Christopher Nolan brings to us a more serious, gloomy, and realistic Batman where the main highlight is Christian Bale's stellar performance as Bruce Wayne and The Batman. Throughout the film, we see the evolution of Bruce Wayne and how his surroundings shape him to eventually become The Batman and it is a thrilling ride. The characters and how they interact with Bruce Wayne do have a lasting impression which adds to the growth of the characters. The film is an experience where we witness how Batman comes to existence, with a wonderful score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard and Nolan's exciting use of practical effects; The Caped Crusader was most definitely brought to life.Batman Begins is an origin story done right and Christian Bale's masterful performance will surely mark him as one of the greatest actors to ever portray the Batman. Additionally, Michael Caine's fabulous performance as Alfred Pennyworth complimented Bale's and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox was a fantastic move by the casting team. Batman Begins is a consequential film and it cements itself as one of the darker superhero films. This is also demonstrated through the film's use of darker tones and minimal use of saturated scenes; there is also the use of warmer and cooler tones in which the lack of neutrality certainly suggests to the audience that there is not a lot of room for happier scenes. Subsequently, as much as it is a Superhero film; there is also something that we can arguably take away from the film. By the end of Batman Begins, if you have paid attention; you might find that you have learned something new or perhaps even receive a tip on life. At the end of the day, Batman Begins is a fantastic watch if you are looking for a Superhero film that avoids the happier conventions and I would even go as far as to say that Batman Begins is not just a Superhero film but also a dark crime-drama which will satisfy even the most hardcore Marvel fanatics and those that do not even have a preference for Superheroes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Boring and formulaic at best,"Oh my! I am a great fan of action movies. Everyone had told me so many good things about 'Batman begins' that I grabbed the (zone 1) DVD as soon as I could get my hands on it and counted the hours which had still to go before the night. I finally sit in front of my screen, ready to immerse myself into a good movie and...find myself yawning after ten minutes. And things go so bad that it's even difficult to just list the problems. Let me try and give you some ideas:1. Extremely poor plot. 2. Extremely poor script. 3. Bad directing/lighting/editing for ALL action sequences (and some other sequences too). 4. A musical score which is, well, not really a score. 5. Bad acting by everyone but the five actors with a 'name'.The overall feeling is that you are watching a completely exploitative movie, conceived from the beginning (no pun intended) as a particularly stupid crowd pleaser. The idea seems to have been: put into the movie all the material which has now become standard after a few decades of action movies, do not do anything even remotely original, be as simplistic and formulaic as you can, spend a lot of money in hiring well-known actors, and you'll do fine. The worst part of it all is: apparently, the filmmakers are right, most people did enjoy the movie! Makes me feel desperate. Honest, this movie is BAD, BAD, BAD without even being funny. It's boring, verging on the insulting.I will not insult Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher by comparing any of their movies to 'Batman begins'.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Action of Spiderman2 and Depth of Unbreakable with Nolan's Darkness,"That sums it up. The action was enthralling, keeping me on the edge of my seat most of the time and giving me multiple starts, and the characters were so well developed that I felt like I knew them. Nolan skillfully developed the characters with flashbacks and asides as the action of the storyline progressed, so the viewer feels no loss of forward momentum at all. The scenes are dark and twisted, Nolan's style, and give great thrills. The many great character actors (McCain, Freeman, Oldman, and Wilkinson) gave the new Gotham a deeper feel as well, and were a delight to watch. I liked this movie very much and look forward to its sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
All hail the new king!,"Over the last 10 years, we've been suffering through crap known as Batman movies, nothing since Batman and Batman Returns has been worthy of Batman. When I first heard about this movie sometime last year, I was not very interested, because of I figured it would be another Batman Forever. But I was mistaken, I should be slapped for even thinking that. This movie is aptly titled, because it is, in every aspect, a new beginning for the Batman franchise. I loved Michael Keaton as Batman, and thought I'd never see his equal, but Christian Bale pulled it off masterfully. He has dethroned the first two, and I don't foresee him losing it any time soon. I highly recommend seeing this movie, not because everyone else is going to see it, but because it is a masterpiece. A modern classic, fitting of the Batman legacy that is the Comics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Better Beginning...............,"I did not want to want to see BATMAN BEGINS. Viewing it in the theater required the temporary lifting of my boycott of mainstream American films. I've been dragged to far too many ""blockbusters"" in my day and have dished out ten hard-earned dollars for disappointment in return. Hollywood does not make films that very much interest me, but when I saw the credits block for BATMAN BEGINS (the cast, the director, the crew) I was intrigued. I eventually broke down and went to a matin√©e showing of BATMAN BEGINS and was greatly impressed. This however does not make me wrong about Hollywood. It simply shows that if you have a strong creative force behind a film, not even the devil himself can suppress it completely.BATMAN BEGINS begins at the beginning of the Batman saga. As the film opens we meet a younger, more troubled, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) who, while imprisoned in Asia, is approached by the mysterious figure of Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard represents the League of Shadows, a cultish organization of men who have extreme views on what is right and what is wrong. Wayne trains with them, but ultimately cannot accept their philosophy and returns to Gotham City where, as a small boy, his parents were murdered. We discover that it was a failed attempt at revenge for the death of his parents, as well as a fateful confrontation with a powerful crime lord (Tom Wilkinson), that drove him east to live the life of a criminal. In Gotham he reunites with his family's trusty servant Alfred (Michael Caine) and his childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes). He also reunites with his family's vast fortune and resources. Troubled by his demons and the moral decay of Gotham City, he begins to fashion the alter ego of Batman. Under this guise Bruce Wayne starts to take back the the streets of Gotham and purge his own feelings of remorse over his parent's demise. He makes a connection with ""one good cop"" Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and builds up his armory under the watchful eye of Alfred and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who is head of the Wayne Enterprises warfare technology department (which answers the question ""Where does he get those wonderful toys?"" from 1989's BATMAN). When Batman disrupts a routine drug sale, he discovers that there is a deeper conspiracy that threatens the whole of Gotham City. I'll stop there, although the plot should be pretty familiar to those who followed the comic book/graphic novel series.BATMAN BEGINS adapts a much darker tone than the previous films. The psychological profile of Bruce Wayne, as well as the other characters in the film, are explored with much more depth and care than one would expect. Director Christopher Nolan (MEMENTO, INSOMNIA) who, along with writer David S. Goyer, has fashioned an exciting, yet observant , story in which to place their well executed set pieces. Nolan is a young filmmaker who seems to have a firm grasp of technique. He treats the characters not as pawns in a video game, but conflicted people who do things for a reason. In a field that is dominated by CGI effects that make the impossible seem implausible, the action sequences in BATMAN BEGINS have a certain gravity to them. The fight scenes are murky and tight; the chase sequences are ruled by the laws of physics and not by the laws of the cheap thrill. This film also moves away from the comic book bad guy as such. The characters set against Bruce Wayne are not ""bad"" in any clear sense, but fragmented individuals who have adopted misguided ideals. They have no quirky deformities, brightly colored hair, or freeze rays and it is because of this fact that the foils of BATMAN BEGINS are all the more frightening because we can identify with them on a certain level.I don't think that I've ever made specific mention of any casting agents before, but they deserve special mention for BATMAN BEGINS. John Papsidera and Lucinda Syson have assembled an amazing group of actors. Christian Bale seemed an unlikely choice to play the lead role; the chance pays off, as Bale plays on Bruce Wayne's inner conflict and creates a character that is more than just a rugged jaw line under a mask. Liam Neeson is perfect for the role of Ducard, as a man who is more comfortable issuing sage advice, but can still fight masterly if provoked. Michael Caine does wonders with his limited screen time, as does Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, Tom Wilkinson, and Cillian Murphy. It is great to have an actor like Rutger Hauer in a film like this and even better to see Gary Oldman in an important supporting role. It would be interesting to see the whole Batman saga restaged with this same cast and crew, but it seems unlikely that another film would be made, seeing that BATMAN BEGINS leads directly into Tim Burton's BATMAN. As a stand alone work BATMAN BEGINS is a strong film, and it is easily the best of the series. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A comic book movie that makes sense!,"Set in the fictional city of Gotham, Batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne became what he was destined to be. Jumping between Bruce's child-hood to his adult life, then to present time, this movie shows what influences and experiences affected his decision to become the Dark Knight of Gotham, a story which a lot of people don't know. This movie is for anybody who's ever wondered ""Hey, how did this bat guy get to be so good at man to man combat? Or, where did he get all those gadgets and that bat mobile? Or, why did this guy just decide to dress up and fight crime? Or even, why choose a bat?""Now, not being a huge fan of the Batman franchise (especially in the last 10 years) and even knowing that Christopher Nolan was directing, I didn't expect much from this movie. I was thinking to myself ""Oh brilliant! Another Batman movie, another weak idea for a comic book movie, another excuse to make a high budget movie jammed with loads of CGI and explosions. How could anybody possible think they would be able to milk anything new and unique out of a franchise that has been squeezed dry by almost every star of Hollywood and still hasn't had any real success?"" Very open minded I know, but how could you not be skeptical?However, I was most pleasantly surprised. Unlike your typical comic book movie, Batman Begins avoids the temptation to include those cheesy awkward moments and one liners that make you nauseous. But, this movie was anything but typical; it was the most original and down to earth comic book adaptation in years. The storyline actually made sense and was believable, unlike the other movies, it never leaves you thinking ""But why was he¬Ö or But how can he¬Ö"" The acting was convincing, Christian Bale had just the right persona to give the effect of a man with a lot on his mind and a lot bottled up inside him. Morgan Freeman was his calm, cool, collected (and very smooth) self. Michael Caine did a good job in his type-cast role as Alfred the butler, and Katie Holmes' performance was better than expected. However, the most refreshing and skilled new actor in this movie, in my opinion, was Cillian Murphy in his role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, who seemed to be the wild card of the cast as he was the only actor who has previously only had cameo roles in films ¬ñ but he did an astounding job of his role. I am positive we will be seeing much more of him in the future. The directing was superb; the use of lighting and camera angles really gave Gotham that gloomy and dark feel about it. The moral of the film: We fall down so we can pick ourselves up again seemed completely valid in any context and was completely relevant in the film. But the best part was¬Ö No nipples on the bat suit!Unlike previous installments in the Batman franchise, this is not a kid's movie. It is darker, deeper and more down to earth than all the rest. But it is welcomed by me and I'm sure the majority of the people in this large, movie loving world.Overall I would give this movie 8 out of 10 stars, because at the end of the day, a superhero movie can only be so good. But it is great cinema and it is wished that skeptics (as I was), may give this film a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Realism in a comic book story,"PERSONAL REACTION: The reason I have loved Batman since I was little is because it was technically possible for a man to do the things he did. It was not probable, but a lot of stories aren't probable. The story was always about more than good versus evil. The Batman stories are about self-sacrifice and a dedication to perfection of your craft. Christopher Nolan understands that aspect of the fascination people have with the Batman story and uses it to ground his movie.CASTING: Casting for this movie was excellent. As Bruce Wayne Christian Bale is perfect. I believed in his obsession with justice. Bale seems more comfortable as Wayne than he does being Batman but that works for this film since the story is about Wayne discovering Batman in himself.The rest of the cast does an above average job - especially Gordon and Dr. Crane. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Foxx is warm, intelligent and likable but brings nothing to this role that he has not brought to every other film he's done.OVERALL: The movie is well directed, well acted and above all... realistic. It incorporates many of the greatest 'scenes' from the Batman comic series (especially Frank Miller's ""Batman: Year One"") blended with an all new plot created for the film. A harmonious blend sure to please comic aficionados and new comers alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Another Batman?,"First of all, this movie was fantastic.

I'm pleasantly surprised. However, my question to all of you is this: Why does everyone seem to think there is going to be a remake of the first Batman? And with some kind of name like Batman: Rise of the Joker. BATMAN BEGINS was clearly a PREQUEL, people. The end of the movie clearly set up the connection to the first Batman. And that's it.

Top notch superhero movie. A great movie for fans and wannabe fans.,"This is an outstanding super hero movie. I had a lot of fun, even though I loved the Tim Burton Batman movies, and did not really want to see this movie made. Batman's super powers are not so super, and the treatment of the mental and spiritual nature is more in depth. I liked the tie between the childhood fears and the batman character. It was refreshing that there was no 007-style comic relief. Top performances by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. The art direction was solid, but not as great as the Tim Burton films. The movie gets 8 stars because it is a great movie only in its own universe of super hero movies. It does not really tell a universal story--only a story about how a guy becomes a superhero, which of course is make-believe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"This movie not only answered the why, but it answered the how","There are great scripts (probably a lot more than we've seen), great directors, great actors, and so forth, but very often, the combination just isn't there. Whether it is a great script and bad acting, bad script, but the acting and directing allow the movie to be pulled off.In 'Batman Begins' all of these elements come together to form what could be something right from our real lives. From the get go, we have a terrific, well penned script. One that dives into the heart and soul of the main character, bruce wayne. We need to understand why someone does something, not just to watch them do it on the screen.The cast was superb. There seems to be a consensus that Katie Holmes was the only actor that didn't fit too well into the movie, but I disagree. I thought her performance was excellent, and fit fine in with the rest of the cast.Christian Bale, it would seem, was born to play this role. I will admit, I was actually scared when Batman reveals himself for the first time.What truly makes this movie stand out though, is how Nolan not only handles the why, but the how. Yeah, OK, Batman has the coolest car, but where did he get it from? How was the batsuit conceived? How was the batcave explored, and so forth? I didn't leave the movie thinking to myself, ""how was he able to do that?"" Even the crazy stuff, like the chase scene, it all made sense.This movie was so well crafted, I felt I could've watched an entire movie about the transformation of Bruce Wayne.There are scenes in the movie when we see some bruises on Bruce, and we've never seen that before, on a ""hero."" He truly is human.There are also parts that separate Bruce's past (can't mention any, but those who have seen the movie, it involves a lot of fire), and the change in management at Wayne Enterprises, seem to end one Chapter in Bruce's past, and lead him into his future.This movie is way up there, and anyone should see it. If you've never read any batman comics before, no problem, this movie was made with you in mind.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best Batman Film....Ever!,"I just went to an Imax screening of Batman Begins and all that I can say is...wow!This film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we've seen of the Dark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini and Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, and heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you care about his plight. Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be.Realism: Much has been said of the film's ""reality"" quotient, and I'm here to say it works. Nolan talks about how Batman's strong because he does push-ups, he gets around because of his gadgets, and by introducing each of them with a plausible explanation, we forget to quibble and go along with it. The technology may be fantastic, but it's believable. And, unlike the ""reality"" of something like Daredevil, Nolan doesn't forget his ideals halfway though and start having Batman wire-jump thirty feet into the air.The suit works. It's practical. It's plausible. It's the most ""real"" Batman we're going to get. It's not Sandy Collara's Dead End (and I say thank God for that). There are a few moments when the mask doesn't sit just right, but those are ridiculously insignificant nitpicks when the rest of the film works as well as it does.Acting: The acting all around is top notch. Everyone in the film is quality and they really pull through in their respective roles. Personally, I love Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. He adds the slightest extra cadence to each syllable, turning the dialog into something more than was written. As for the man himself, Christian Bale is far and away the best Batman ever! I was never conscious of watching a movie star take on Batman the way it was with the other films. You watch Bruce Wayne grow and transform and become Batman, and nothing gets between that.Storyline: I really don't want to spoil the best bits, just because you need to see them for yourself. However, please know that the film works, and on many levels.Highlights: 1) Batman moves in flashes, just the way he should. He takes out one guy and disappears into shadows,leaving the others to collectively s hit their pants. It is that cool. 2) The fear gas is very well done. You see the effects from multiple perspectives throughout, and none is better than when a certain someone sees the Batman while under the influence. 3) The hints at the end of what's to come are great!Cheese Factor: There are one-liners, yes, and just about all of them work fine because the words from the script are acted out and made plausible. A few aren't as strong, but they're not of the cringe-worthy variety.Nit Picks: 1)Editing. Early in the film, during some of the flashback and training sequences, the editing of certain scenes feels a little clipped and truncated. My friend put it right saying it felt like you were watching an extended trailer for the scene as opposed to the scene itself. It works though¬ódon't get me wrong¬óas these scenes really propel the narrative forward. 2) Action scenes. Most of these scenes stay pretty close and tight, in medium shots instead of wides, rendering some of the action a giant blur (granted, the Imax didn't help that any). There were a few times I was wishing to see things pulled back and revealed a bit more. Again, it still works. 3) Score. It's downright brilliant in parts. Only problem I had is there's no instantly-recognizable, hummable main theme. Kinda the way it is with Spider-Man.Conclusion: You might think this is all hyperbole, but the movie is that good. I left the theater buzzing in a way I haven't in a long time. I mean, Episode III was phenomenal, but leaving that was leaving satisfied in a different way. It was the end of something great and grand. It was completion. Batman Begins is the start of something new, and every step taken has been the right one.

Good,"The image of Gotham City this film paints, is dire. Dysfunctional families live in decaying shacks, without money or food. Violent dogs are barking everywhere. Disagreements are settled by fistfights or, in some cases, by bullets. The film is more than just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live, but I was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us as a part of the human race who live better when we're on a leash. Batman doesn't like being messed with, especially when nobody has a reason to mess with him. He doesn't give them one, but when he fights back at them, the consequences are played out throughout the film.

Let's be honest people. This movie was a joke. There was much about the plot that didn't make sense, the villain, the universe that was previously created by previous Batman movies should not have been ignored and discarded to start over with this mish mash, and what exactly the villains were plotting.

Pretty decent. Worth waiting for.,"Dark dark dark! Christopher Nolan understands there's a reason he's called ""the Dark Knight""! Most of the other reviews have said pretty much all that needs saying, although from the negative ones I read through it seems to me they didn't really 'get' the character. Batman is like Mephisto from Faust, out of the shadows, come from Hell, to avenge the innocent, and settle accounts with the guilty ... that is what makes him so scary, and that is why this movie succeeds - he is a frightening thing, and until now, he's only ever been portrayed like a carnival attraction, with no real menace to him. Nolan depicts it beautifully ... but what the hell was that 9/11 review about, though?I will say the fight sequences could have been more interesting, visually, but I think we can let that one slide ... the suit weighs a ton, the scenes were dark, and you can only learn so much hand-to-hand combat in six months.

The Dark Knight Returns!,"Christopher Nolan undertook the difficult task of bringing back Gotham's savior and managed to pull it off in style. Nolan's tribute to the 'Caped Crusader' is a clean break from the twentieth century franchise that included Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney donning the mask of the great DC comic detective. The chiseled Christian Bale takes on the mantle of the 'Dark Knight' as Nolan delivers a gritty, edgy and, dare I say it, more realistic Batman than his predecessors, who inadvertently ended up making a parody of the superhero and his exploits.Bale delivers a troubled and dark Bruce Wayne who in is complexity is more credible then the Bruces of the past. As Batman, he fits the mold although his delivery could use some work.Cillian Murphy is far too pretty to play an arch villain like 'The Scare Crow' who, surprisingly, didn't pose much of a threat and would be laughed at if considered a true nemesis. On the other side of the tracks is the world's favourite girl next door, Ms. Holmes, who still looks like she belongs at the creek. Though their efforts are both apparent and commendable, they still come across as children caught up in a game for grownups.Michael Caine brings emotion, humor and charm to the character of Alfred the Butler as is Gary Oldman believable as the helpless but good, Sergeant Gordon. The original Hitchhiker is back too, with Rutger Hauer's convincing portrayal of the ever so sinister Earle who runs Wayne Enterprises until Bruce comes of age.Liam Neeson's performance is the big surprise in this movie of all stars, which also includes Oscar winner Morgan Freeman and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe from 'The Last Samurai.' The audience can always expect a great performance from Neeson but in this flick he really hits the mark especially with the physical demands of his character. Not to be out done by the other heavy weights, Tom Wilkinson, also an Oscar nominee for 'In the Bedroom, is up to par in his performance as the immoral underworld boss, Carmine Falcone.The action scenes are shadowed by darkness, literally. The audience doesn't get the opportunity to fully appreciate the fights mainly because they take place under limited lighting. On a brighter note, it's enjoyable to see how Bruce Wayne actually transforms into 'The Batman' albeit is at an accelerated pace.With the combination of a worthy Batman, a great cast, a plot that's not totally predictable and a more REAL and gritty feel, 'Batman Begins' is an enjoyable feature that leaves you waiting anxiously for the next installment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Dark Knight Rising,"I've been wondering how director Christopher Nolan would handle a huge budget on a Hollywood film designed as a revisionist franchise launcher of a previously lucrative and iconic brand name. It had disaster written all over it. I'm overjoyed to announce, the young director has stuck to his auteur guns and delivered not another ho-hum comic book extravaganza, but a deep, dark, psychologically complex thriller. Nolan and his very capable team of writers hired by Warner Bros. have taken the simplistic and tired story from comic book land (your archetypal crime-fighting costume wearing hero) and through luxurious exposition and compelling character development, deliver a taut and suspenseful drama for mature adult audiences to savor.In the lead role of Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale finally delivers on the promise of his compelling indie roles and has taken his cult status to mainstream audiences with a confident swagger that has ""great actor/huge star"" written all over it. Bravo to the studio execs in their risky casting. He works this role on every level, and the audience is rewarded at every turn under the skilled director's hand of Nolan. The rest of the supporting cast is fantastic. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Cillian Murphy, and an unrecognizable Gary Oldman as Gordon (what a great piece of stunt casting) are all perfect. The only complaint is the otherwise lovely Katie Holmes, who is as distracting on screen with her lack of acting chops as she has been off screen with her shenanigans as the new Mrs. Tom Cruise.The only other distraction is some of the choppy editing in a few of the actions scenes. Early on, they are so darkly lit and badly edited that it's hard to tell what is happening. This is all forgiven though with the white knuckle Batmobile chase sequence and the edge-of-your seat careening train car finale. As far as I'm concerned, I don't care if Nolan didn't focus on making the action scenes more perfect. He's clearly a man more interested in setting a mood to highlight character development and ratchet up the drama. He's quickly developing into a master of psychologically driven suspense. He just might be able to inject life into some other stale genres in the future.When all is said and done, the greatest achievement of ""Batman Begins"" is that it makes you forget the weird dystopia of Tim Burton's iconic original from 1989, and totally wipes from your memory the abhorrent Joel Schumacher directed sequels that sank the series in the late 1990's. Thanks to Nolan, the writers, and Bale, this film stands tall on its own, and should weather the test of time as inevitable sequels will come to pass.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Fantastic fantasy rises above its genre,"Went in expecting a couple of hours of fluff action movie escapism, and instead was treated to the best film of the summer.Having villains who have honest motivations you can almost agree with, and heroes whose vigilantism you can almost disapprove of makes for a movie asking real questions about what is ""right"" and what is justice vs. vengeance. It's not every movie that shows both sides of a war.Great and unexpected plot twists, incredible action sequences, especially the big batmobile chase, lush filming, all the explosions an action film should have, and yet a thought provoking story of loss and love after all.

Excellent New Superhero Film,"So I like this movie. Sue me.Maybe it's because it's got Christian Bale, one of (in my opinion) the best actors of our times, or maybe because it's a powerful story in addition to being a cool fight/special effects movie, or maybe because I've always liked Batman for his lack of ""powers""--and this is the first AWESOME film done on Bruce Wayne--or maybe just because it made me think. And I like movies that make me think.The one weak point that I saw was that Katie Holmes didn't deliver as powerful a performance as the rest of the cast, but since her acting isn't awful, just average, it can be overlooked.So if you want a movie that doesn't let you just veg (but that keeps you eating popcorn at an incredible rate), and you're looking for something more in your superheros than merely beating the bad guys and getting the girl (though he does that, too), Batman Begins is the perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The defining Batman movie so far. Superb!,"I rarely buy DVD movies anymore, what with my public library's vast collection for free, and the absolute dearth of worthwhile movies the past few years. But I bought this one, the deluxe special edition, such was my anticipation of a superb movie.I was not disappointed. If anything, it is even better than I had hoped. I am still a fan of the other Batman movies, but this one is on another level by itself.As the title suggests, this Batman movie really is the story of how it all begins. From the experiences of Bruce Wayne, the child, to Bruce Wayne who begins to fight crime and accept his new role as savior of crumbling Gotham City. It has less of a comic book flair, more of a real gritty look at a mortal man learning the skills to become a superhero, cuts and bruises and all.Christian Bale was so good as the skinny machinist in the movie of that name, he is quite a contrast here as the muscular but svelte Bruce Wayne/Batman. I think Michael Caine was a perfect choice to play his loyal assistant Alfred.The essence of Bruce Wayne's preparation for his crime fighting role is in a faraway place in snowy mountains, where he is mentored by the character played by Liam Neeson. Much later, this character shows up as a menace that must be defeated.I believe Katie Holmes has received unfair criticism as Rachel Dawes, the childhood friend of Bruce's who now works in the DA's office. I enjoyed her role in the movie and think it fits well.I am so used to seeing Gary Oldman play a bad guy, it was refreshing to see him as the good cop who, in the end, becomes a key player in Batman's fight against the men who want to destroy Gotham.Always dependable Morgan Freeman turns in another perfect performance as Lucius Fox, smart and loyal employee of Wayne Industries, under-appreciated until the very end, and who helps Bruce Wayne assemble much of his fighting toys and Batmobile.(As an aside, it is interesting that so many actors from Europe were playing 'American' roles with American accents, including Christian Bale, Rutger Hauer, Tom Wilkinson, and Gary Oldman, but they all pulled them off quite well.)""Batman Begins"" - a new favorite of mine. The DVD picture and sound are great as expected, and the BD picture is even better, with very nice and interesting extras.SPOILERS -- SPOILERS. As Bruce Wayne begins to realize and accept his mission, the crisis arrives in the form of bad guys, led by Neeson's character, planning to destroy Gotham by putting a debilitating chemical into the water supply. But it only is activated via the lungs, so they also steal a powerful microwave generator which can vaporize water in the water supply. Bruce and a couple of others get inoculation, the plot is foiled by Batman, assisted when the high-speed train carrying the generator is made to crash and the villain is also destroyed. At the end, Batman gets the calling card for his next nemesis, 'The Joker.'MAR 2024 update: First time I watched it on a QLED, UHD TV screen and with the BluRay disc it is a great picture.June 2014 update: Just watched it again on Blu-ray and it still holds up ver well.January 2011 update: I watched it on Blu-ray and the additional clarity and sound are definitely worth it for a movie like this. Because it was filmed for IMAX.July 2008 update: We watched this again today as a prelude to the new one, 'Dark Knight', hitting local screens today. My opinion of this one has not changed!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
a powerful reboot,"Prior to watching Batman Begins i had my doubts. However, they were dispersed in that movie theater. This is a great reboot of the franchise. I particularly like the way it had been made realistic and closer to reality.Of course, we still stay in the realm of fiction, but Batman's gear and vehicles are just a step beyond what you'd see in a typical action flick, even a James Bind movie.The layer that elevates Batman Begins from your average comic book hero is a vague social message. Yet, i didn't think much about it and proceeded watching Bruce Wayne dealing with the bad guys.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
It's good?  It's good!,"This is a film. Not a movie, but a film.I never cared about Batman, and, to be frank, after a decent first chapter, the movies all sucked. But, when you get the guy who wrote and directed Memento -- that artsy cult classic Memento -- to direct and co-write ANY movie, you can expect solid results.The results here are staggering.I can understand your skepticism. It is, after all, a Batman movie, but it almost seems designed to appeal more to movie fans than Batman fans. It never adopts that ""superhero/comic book"" movie feel. Instead, Christopher Nolan crafts a sincerely dark and disturbing movie. Batman himself is scary, guys. Just one encounter with him would scare me out of a life of crime. The portrayal of the villains' plot: downright chilling, I kid you not. If I saw this movie as a ten-year-old, I wouldn't be able to sleep that night. Heck, I may not as a 21-year-old. Using his trademark style of storytelling, Nolan weaves an ongoing flashback into the present timeline, at least in the movie's early stages, and turns a story about a comic book character into a deep, confounding, ""question-stacking"" thriller -- one where the mounting list of questions leaves your mind in a state of numb befuddlement until, in a beautiful climax, it all suddenly makes sense. The first five minutes of the movie will hand you your first such quandary: what the heck is Bruce Wayne doing in the Himalayas? Intrigued yet? And here's the thing: they make it all believable. They have a rational explanation for everything -- from what makes a billionaire such a good fighter to where Batman got all his ""wonderful toys"" -- and, believe me, they explain EVERYTHING. The ending satisfies all your demands, which is a breath of fresh air for a superhero movie.Then again, you're not really watching a super hero movie. You're watching a story about a MAN named Bruce Wayne, and that all-too-frequently overlooked idea finally hits home here.Near the closing stages of the movie, I began laughing to myself, stomping my feet in giddy amusement, and resisting urge to jump out of my seat, stretch my arms to the ceiling, and exclaim, ""THEY GOT IT RIGHT! THEY FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT!"" This one's an instant classic. People will still be talking about it thirty years from now.Still skeptical? So was I. Go see it and prove me wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"NOT the Batman film I've been waiting for (Just like that, Marvel wins)","Let me begin by say that I am a Bat-freak, and I have read most Frank Miller stories. Having said that, I felt that Goyer's Batman Begins script comes off like a sloppy forgery of Miller's Batman: Year One miniseries (down to lifting the last scene with the Joker's playing card), with villains inappropriately thrown-in. The Bat-Tank is an idea from Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns and it is also tossed in, not to assist the story, but to pander to a motor-crazy American culture in a moment of pimp-my-Batmoblie obviously inserted in the script by a Warner Bros. marketing team after reviewing last year's Hummer sales.I don't mean to totally hate-on a film without cause, after all this IS a step above the Joel Schumacher versions of the Dark Knight, but only slightly. This film has none of the visual resonance or thrilling pleasure of Tim Burton's Batman movies, also Katie Holmes' character is used to twice rip-off the Burton movies. Most offensive was at the end when a familiar line is used, badly, to reveal that Bruce is the Bat to the female lead, which is exactly like the mistletoe line in Batman Returns only much more lame. So lets say I was still expecting better, and I also felt that many of the 'jokes' that were designed to relieve the tension fell flat, like Gordon seeing the Bat-Tank and saying 'I gotta get me one of those.' I did like Garry Oldman's version of Lt. Gordon, but he wasn't used in any interesting such as the personal crisis Gordon faces in Miller's Year One. For me, Nolan's style for capturing the fight sequences was a total misfire, as you could rarely see a single landed impact through the over-editing. ASIDE FROM NOT BEING THE DEFINITIVE BATMAN MOVIE, IT IS JUST NOT A GOOD MOVIE PERIOD. I wasn't expecting perfection, just an enjoyable evening in Gotham City and they didn't even give me that. I had read some reviews asserting that Frank Miller fans and the Sin City crowd will be satisfied with this one, which can't be the case. If Warner Bros. wanted to make the Frank Miller people happy than they would have done a film of the real Batman: Year One with Darren Aronofsky directing, as originally planned 3¬Ω years ago. Also, everyone was saying how serious and realistic this film was, and yet the climax of the film was so overwrought with separate elements that it became laughable. Goyer's attempts to clumsily tie the too-many strands of this film together with a death-train headed straight for the Wayne Enterprises building which will poison and evaporate all the water in Gotham within an instant. Come on, we can do better than this. This is a horrible idea for the ending of any movie, and to me is comparable in many ways to the very silly ending of Batman Forever.I found Nolan and Goyer did not learn from the mistakes of Schumacher, electing not to emphasise a single villain and instead orchestrating a rather lame pageant of familiar characters without focusing on any of them. In Batman Begins, the genocidal cult-leader Ra's Al Ghul isn't the charismatic megalomaniac as he is in the comics and cartoons and the Scarecrow is limited to an Arkham administrator / mob chemist. I am a dedicated DC comics guy, however if this is any indication of the type of DC films that are on their way into theatres, then Marvel has already won the biggest battle of them all. Both the Spider-Man and X-men films were far superior to Batman Begins, and in particular Spider-Man 2 had compelling action with a story that featured the allegorical properties of the superhero. I am sorry to report that Batman Begins offers us nothing more than action sequences which are obscured by 'stylish' editing in an endlessly hollow feature.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Loved it !!  Go See It !!,"Well I did get to go see an advance screening of this movie Tuesday night. First preview I saw a few months back I had NO interest in seeing this film. After a few more previews I thought I'll go see it eventually but not immediately. I did get to see it early & was completely surprised. I didn't think Christian Bale would be believable, he was. I really liked how it gave you more insight of how the persona of Batman was developed. Many of us already knew but it is nice to see the story unfold in front of us & not start with a huge explosion and go over the top from there. The beginning was a bit dark but I was hoping for that too as this was ""The Beginning"" and he was dark, brooding & vengeful in the beginning.

There isn't one element that outshines any other; from the writing, direction, casting, production/costume design, music, editing and more, they all ""fit"" perfectly like a grand artistically designed mosaic.(The audience I was in Friday, June 17, 2005 at a 730pm show was filled with a cross-section of New Yorkers, young & old, multi-ethnic/socio-economic and they showed their appreciation through their clapping, exclamations of surprise, humor and wit, often during the entire film.

Brilliant!,"After too many superhero movies coming out in the past few years, I had one expectation of Batman Begins - it's gonna be LOUSY! But no, it was superb! Was slow and dark in parts, but didn't bore one bit. Being directed by Christopher Nolan, of Momento fame, the movie carried its darkness and depth from beginning to end. Batman is a dark night, and is better shown with lack of glamor and more realism.From how he became a good fighter in the far east, to how he becomes Batman, makes a bat-suit, gadgets and the bat-mobile, is emphasized with great detail. This movie made a good tribute to the comic character with such dedicated build-up.Christian Bale was a better Batman than I had anticipated, and finally played a role that would get him recognition among normal movie goers. He would have got that recognition had Equillibrium not been released after the Matrix. Michael Caine was just brilliant as Alfred, got to speak his cockney accent and portray the polished butler appropriately. Katie Holmes looked like a teenager but managed to behave grown up, as an A.D.A. She's still adorable as she was in the days of Dawson's Creek. Morgan Freeman surprised many by taking a smaller role in this movie, but adds color to his resume and will probably be playing a greater role in the sequels to follow, if there are any and if he casted. Liam Neeson, quite similar to Quigon Jin in Star Wars, impressed as Bruce Wayne's fight trainer, and his evil ways were shown well. Ken Watanabe, made an excellent entry into Hollywood in the Last Samurai - so much that he got nominated for an Oscar! His role in Batman Begins wasn't major, probably getting his numbers up and did a decent job of not talking much and fighting only once. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson supported well. Oldman has played an American many times before, although he is English. Wilkinson, on the other hand, is better off keeping to roles where he plays Brit rather than an Italian American wise-guy. Finally, Rutger Hauer makes a big comeback to mainstream Hollywood and seems like he will have a greater role at least in the next episode. Doesn't mean he is likely to play the JOKER. Cilian Murphy was decent as the Scarecrow. Looked like a girlish version of Tom Welling (Smallville) as the alter-ego, maybe just to show his shaky nature.Good special effects, good acting, good direction, good story flow, and a great ending make this movie watchable and enjoyable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Amazing two-part film; the most epic Batman of them all...,"This movie was simply amazing. This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is just cinematic ally overwhelming. The plot, the characters, everything is fleshed out.Batman does not make an appearance until an hour or so into the movie, and to be honest if the movie had ended right before it I wouldn't have minded. Batman was not the important part here. As a matter of fact, the movie sort of fell apart a bit after Batman was introduced. The absolute greatest part of this movie is the hour-long homage to Samurai and Gong-fu movies. Bruce Wayne is presented as a warrior, someone looking for his path. For the first time in any Batman movie, we get to see that Bruce is the real hero. In the other movies it's so simple to think of it as two personalities, but here we see Bruce Wayne donning a Batman costume, not turning into Batman.This movie was just spectacular.Minus one star for having the Scarecrow's role diminished at the end.

Christian Bale's Sh*t Begins...,"You could also put it this way: the *rse-end of C.B. smells like a bat.Why on EARTH and in the name of all the SAINTS in HEAVEN did they cast C.B. for the role of Bruce Wayne?A British director? Yes of course. These days they can't find American directors. The director of memento and insomnia, apparently suffers from insomnia himself.There are a job lot of British/Irish actors: Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, C.B.

We already know how Bruce Wayne's parents were killed and how he vowed to uphold justice and protect the weak blah,blah,blah...The introduction of Henri Ducard a.k.a. Ra's Al Ghul played by Neeson is the pillar of the plot. Apparently Al Ghul trains Bruce Wayne(?) who later becomes a thorn in Al Ghul's side. So why on earth would Al Ghul train him in the first place? (laughable plot!)Wayne later uses the gadgets made by his dad's biz and uses them to create the early Bat-sh*t-suit(version 1) and save the day.So there you have it kiddies, if your suffering from measles, flu, diarrhea, it would HIGHLY recommend this flick.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Luckily Katie Holmes got a big diamond from Tom Cruise this a.m. at the Eiffel Tower so her future may not be too dependent upon her acting ability. Christian Bale was definitely not believable as having class and polish in his role of a young millionaire. Also, does anyone else think Cillian Murphy would be a good one to cast in a young Bo Derek role? Just throw a long blonde wig on him and he could pass for what she looked like in the mid 80's.

Realism,"The fighting scenes were lacking. That's about the only negative I can say about this great movie. Much of this film was spent showing us Bruce Wayne's past, and how he became Batman. Painstaking effort was put into keeping everything looking and playing out realistically, and it pays off. You are never brought out of the movie due to some ""comic book"" excuse. The villains were great, and the acting was spot on. Bale's face in the Batman costume looked a bit odd at times, but he pulled it off. I am not one of the people that loved Keaton as Batman, so I enjoy this guy who looks like he can really kick ass.

Excellent Batman,"""Batman Begins"" is certainly the best among the five movies of this great hero released in the theaters. After 1776 reviews in IMDb, I do not know what I can write that have not been written before. In my opinion, this film begins wonderful with the director, Christopher Nolan, of the fantastic ""Memento"", one of my favorite movies. The cast is a constellation, composed of excellent actors and actress: Christian Bale is awesome in the role of the troubled and confused Bruce Wayne; Michael Caine, as Alfred, elegant, gentle and tough, is also perfect; Cillian Murphy, Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson, Hutger Hauer are very evil bad guys; Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman complete this lovely cast. The special effects are very good, and the cinematography recalls ""Blade Runner"", with rainy and dark locations. The story explains the origins of Batman since his childhood in Gotham City. The soundtrack fits perfectly to the scenes. It is amazing to see that there are bad reviews of this movie, which is a very above average entertainment.

"Classic Superhero, Fresh Story-Telling = A New Classic","Batman has come a long way since the ""Pow & Bang"" days of Adam West and company. Lucky for us, the Batman evolution has proved to beautify and deepen the character. Not so lucky is that we had to sit through all the rubbish before a writer struck gold.In a decade where most of the blockbusters are unoriginal story lines or remakes, you have to be impressed with what looks to be a new trend: changing our superheroes. Like Spiderman's Peter Parker who started out as a wimpy boy-next-door, 'Batman Begins' takes us to a place we never imagined Bruce Wayne would be: prison, a strange Asian training grounds, and finally a darker, more realistic Gotham. Indeed, almost everything becomes ""realistic"" for Batman ¬ñ from the psycho logicality that helps Bruce Wayne find his purpose in life to the creation of the 'Batman' ¬ñ we are made to believe that a Batman could actually exist.What impressed me was discovering the heart and soul of Bruce Wayne, (played flawlessly by Christian Bale). He is a real person with people issues and must do the right thing, the best thing, to succeed. Not the wrong thing - so many new movies are prominently displaying that wrong actions are OK so long as you do them for the right reason. Or even the wrong reason.) Not even the ""good"" thing ¬ñ settling for second best or compromising to come to a solution that will please everyone. Bruce Wayne must give of himself and become a true hero. An old-fashioned type of a hero who actually didn't get the somewhat annoying Katie Holmes in the end.Having seen most of the 'Batmans' over the years and allowing myself to become accustomed to their cheap entertainment, I excitedly applaud 'Batman Begins' for taking Bruce Wayne, Gotham, and Superhero movies to a new level.by~ TMT",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Batman,"Batman is a franchise that was nearly ruined in the Joel Schumacher days. I have been a fan of the 90's animated series, Tim Burton films, and the comic books to a limited extent. Batman Begins redeems the entire franchise from movies to animated series in recent days.The movie opens with Bruce as a child falling into a well housing bats. Maybe a tiny bit hokey, but this new ""fear"" explanation works better than just taking the Burton route and just leaving his origins alone.Action sequences are often handled using close ups, the kind often seen in movies like Braveheart or Gladiator. The problem with close ups is that it can be hard to tell what is happening on screen. The DVD explains that the shots were designed to put the audience in the mind of the villains. We are having just as hard a time telling where he is going to hit as they will. Artistic, but maybe a little too much.My only real problems with the movie lie with the microwave emitter. Firstly, the emitter should be ""cooking"" everyone within it's range or beam or whatever; and Second, When the toxin is released into the air, none of the people attack each other, they act as a zombie mob wanting to attack only those not afflicted by the hallucinogen.My gripes are only minor and can easily by the sheer genius of the film's undertaking.

Michael Caine as Alfred is also excellent, i have loved Michael Caine for years and he is Brilliant as Alfred. Liam Neeson is a actor who i do like very much and he is very menacing in his role.

Believe the hype. Amazing movie.,"This is the greatest superhero film of all time. Basically.After seeing this film more than two years ago, i just had to comment on it. This film you can watch over and over again and never get bored. Its a super super enjoyable film.Batman is done right for once! He is given a real, substantial story, which takes up a lot of the film, which is not a bad thing. Compared to this, all the other batman films, even Batman '89 is pants. Granted '89 had the joker, but look how it starts, with batman just there. In begins, it explains, and it pays off greatly.The acting is pin point perfect. The direction is perfect, Christopher Nolan was known for indie movies, but he's now proved he can do more genres, with making this batman film. In a way this doesn't feel like a batman film, apart from the guy dressed as a bat. Its a lot darker, a lot more realistic, and a hell of a lot better!If you haven't seen this film, i strongly recommend you go and and buy this now.All we can do, is wait until The Dark Knight - The follow up, same cast, same director, but with the joker. I think that could be the only batman, or superhero movie that could ever top this.Do you know what? I think i'm going to go watch batman begins again...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Better than I thought it would be,"I have a strange relationship with the Batman franchise - I never really *want* to see the movies, but when I do, I generally enjoy them. I even like ""Batman and Robin"", but that is probably because it has stylistic links to the ""Batman"" TV series of my childhood (campy and played for laughs). Before anyone writes hate mail to me - yes, Clooney was wrong for the role, and the film strays way away from the story as set in the first two films, but I'm not a rabid Batman fan, and taken on its own merits (?), it is no worse than a lot of other films.So, to ""Batman Begins"" - sheer apathy made me buy it on DVD. I wanted something to watch that evening, and I recognised the title, so I bought it. I knew nothing about any of the younger members of the cast (Christian Bale, Katie Holmes - who?), and expected nothing but brainless entertainment. In many ways I was not disappointed, especially in the first twenty or so minutes - all that washed-out rubbish in China or Tibet or wherever, and the thoroughly lousy acting of Liam Neeson reprising his thoroughly lousy acting in ""Star Wars Episode 1"" - that man is going downhill fast! However, I began to buy into the Bruce Wayne character as a result of Bale's acting. He was a nice amalgam of the Keaton and Kilmer versions of Wayne/Batman - there is a strand running through the roles that makes for some sort of coherence.Beyond that, I saw a fairly pathetic supporting cast (Katie Holmes - nice breasts, but can she act?; Michael Caine - ""I always wanted Geilgud's role in ""Arthur""""; Rutger Hauer - ""I don't care what I'm in as long as I'm paid""), a weak story that seems to have been written by committee, and so little light that you can miss whole chunks of action, but I still enjoyed it far more than I expected. Christian Bale may turn out to be a great actor - he certainly carried this film on his own.In general, I have now watched it a couple of times. It could have been better made, the director could have tried to get stronger acting out of the supporting cast, and the story could have been better, but on the whole it is a thumbs up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"A serious Batman, a great film.","Without rehashing the many good reviews posted about this film, I'll just comment on how it was perceived by an aging baby boomer who, like many, grew up reading Batman comics (among others) during the late 1950s and early 1960s. While they were termed 'comic books', many kids took the character seriously. His portrayal in those early comics was done in a serious manner, with barely a hint of humor. That was the indelible image I maintained about the character thereafter. I recall how disappointed, indeed angry, over how Batman was portrayed in the (to me) idiotic television series of the 60s. I was livid that he had been turned into a buffoon. Wild horses couldn't get me to watch that wretched program, even to this day. When Tim Burton's first film version was announced, I was excited. I had enjoyed Burton's other films, and expected great things. I was, once again, disappointed. In spite of the big budget, great costumes and nifty special effects, it just didn't deliver what I had hoped it would. I didn't care for the garish color, the 'villians' were a joke and frankly, Michael Keaton was a curious choice for the role. Subsequent films in that series were even worse (I presume, since I stopped watching them after the second Burton film). Batman Begins, however, hit the mark! Christian Bale was a superb Batman, the development of Bruce Wayne/Batman was thorough and logical (for a comic character, anyway), the sets impressive and the action exhilarating. As others note, finally it was done correctly. I found this version to be as definitive as one could get, and feel that off all the efforts to bring comic book characters to the screen, this was the most successful. Granted, some others have faired well, such as the first two Superman films with Christopher Reeve and the two X-Men movies. Even Spiderman was reasonably good, although the special effects drug the first one down a bit. To those Batman fans that, like me, have waited decades to see the character done as he should be, this is the one. A couple of minor criticisms would be the casting of Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow. While he did a good job in '28 Days Later', he seemed too juvenile to be believed as a psychiatrist. And, while Katie Holmes was okay in the role, I had a hard time looking at her without thinking of she and Tom Cruise and all of the Scientology controversy, since I did not see the film upon it's release, but on DVD later. Which brings up the final point: those who intend to purchase this film on DVD would be advised to seek out the widescreen DTS surround version. It provides much better surround separation (as DTS generally does) compared to the Dolby Digital version, and the full-frame edition leaves out too much picture information, which negatively affects the enjoyment. A truly excellent film, with a sequel now in production (which will apparently feature The Joker, based upon this film's ending). Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A perfect reboot.,"After the disaster named 'Batman & Robin' which came back in 1997 people had gave up on the Batman films. But in 2005 Christopher Nolan came and rebooted it with Batman Begins and it was almost perfect.The movie is really good but there's not that much in depth to discuss about so I'll only talk about the things which i personally didn't liked it and those are the batman suit, christian bale's batman voice & action sequences. The batman suit in this movie is probably one of the worst superhero suits in general I've ever seen, man it looked so bulky on bale like he's a skinny guy and not some buffy dude like affleck the upper head portion was so bad looking and the details except the bat logo on suit were so unnoticeable. The second problem is bale's batman voice I don't know why bale chose that voice it's not good and the last complaint is the action sequences which is a huge drawback of nolan's movies.Apart from this three complaints it's a really really well executed movie as a reboot/introduction to a superhero. The cast was amazing (except rachel) everyone did great job.I'll give a solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Rebirth.,"With this one Christopher Nolan rebirthed a legend, and it's head and shoulders above all the rest of the Batman movies and most superhero films I've seen in general. This is just a great film, with some dazzlingly dark graphics and well choreographed, if not rather choppy, action scenes that meld perfectly into the moody, shady Gotham City that Nolan has created. That's the best part about this new Batman series; the fact that Nolan has crafted the most perfect Batman setting and mood ever laid down to film thus far. Nothing else can touch this one right now.The only flaw in evidence is that sometimes the movie itself is as choppy and quick paced as the action scenes, and some of the dialogue feels forced, and Katie Holmes isn't that great, but who cares about that? Just see this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The only thing wrong with the Batman,"There was one thing I disliked about Batman Begins, KATIE HOLMES. The other acting was great, she was horrible. I have to agree with others the acting talent in this movie was superb. I enjoyed the story, I especially enjoyed the acting of Liam Neeson and Gary Oldman. Of course Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine always come through. This movie has put Liam Neeson at the top of my favorite actors list. He was very believable in his role. I did not think I would like Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, but I was wrong he was terrific. So, as I said before the only thing wrong with this movie was the choice of Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Hopefully she will not be in the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Comic Book Movie Ever,"This was one of those rare times where I left the movie theater in awe of what I had just seen. There were some lines/scenes in the movie that were incredible and Christian Bale does an unbelievable job. This is the best comic book movie ever and I am a huge fan of both Spider-mans so it was hard for me to say that. All the secondary actors (Freeman, Holmes, Neeson, Caine) did a great job as well. Holmes performed better than I had expected and Morgan Freeman kicked ass. The fighting scenes had a ""dark"" quality to them as it wasn't just all action but a lot of lurking in the shadows and stealth methods of taking opponents down. There was less focus on the gadgets unlike Batman's of the past and more of an emphasis on just getting the job done. Every punch sounded bone crunching. This movie was definitely worth the price of admission and I will probably be seeing it again in the near future",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman as he always should have been!,"Christian Bale made an excellent Bruce Wayne/Batman we see his more human side and his weakness in this truly fantastic re-branding of an old product.The acting is superb ad very believable and while it maintains true to the characters it also updates them to fit into the modern era and creates a perfect framework to build on.With the more recent efforts to maintain the Batman saga falling far short of expectations this one hits all the boxes and allows Batman to have a brand new start, lets hope this time it stays at this level of quality.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
wish WB would do the same with other franchises...,nothing left to be said about the movie. it was pretty damn good!!!! Just hope Warner Bros will stop screwing the other great franchise:Harry Potter. they've made nothing but a parody/mockery/caricature of the books.Lord Of The Rings is really not that great a book but a great movie. Harry Potter deserves to be made like that; seriously and true to the books.and not like the insane action/comedy its made to be.Here is to Hoping Warner Bros don't screw up the all-important 6th and 7th movies.Because i bet they've already screwed the 5th one!!!!,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Good, not as good as the originals though","I have to admit, I am a fan of the original Batman films, Robin and all. I feel that any other Batman remake or reboot out there would be insufficient to me and would not meet my expectations like the originals did. This is the obvious reason why it's taken me seven whole years to sit down and finally watch the bloody movies (also the fact that I saw the preview for the dark knight rises, and it looked pretty good, so i had to do my homework beforehand).With that being said, the movie is good. It's not as excellent as some have portrayed it to be, yet it is not a movie i didn't enjoy. There are highs and lows to every movie, and this one is no exception.I'll admit, the first half of the film had more lows than highs. Christian Bale was a mopey, drab, depressing Bruce Wayne, someone I found I could not relate to nor enjoy as a main character. I know he was searching for himself and had lost his parents, but his overall dark mood left me a bit cold. While the movie itself was supposed to have dark undertones throughout, overall it was a bit TOO dark for me. Being over-saturated with drama and darkness does not make a movie great - rather, it's the humour (even subtle, made to match a dark movie), the action (or climax, depending on the kind of movie), the relationships and more that are all added together to make a perfect blend. For the most part, I do not feel that was attained.With the second half of the movie though, it reached more of what my expectations were. The action sequences were full throttle and left me feeling revved up, Bruce was much more likable after turning into Batman, some subtle (but very well done) jokes were thrown into the mix, and the relationship between Bruce and his childhood friend (Katie Holmes) was much more believable than it was in the first half. In fact, by the end I was hoping they would get back together in DKR (but seeing as she's not credited for a role, i guess not). Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Alfred the Butler all deserve nods for bringing in some much needed alleviation from the gloom that is Batman Begins.Overall, stick through the slightly slow-paced and sluggish first half of the film (save for a couple of fight scenes, primarily the one at the beginning), and you will very much be rewarded with the great second half!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Boring,"The beginning was slow at parts but pretty good. The last 2/3 of the movie was very bad. There was no entertaining bad guy other than Scarecrow who didn't have enough on screen action. Batman and Batman Returns were good because of their colorful and enchanting atmospheres and entertaining villains, this movie lacked both except the Scarecrow who wasn't in enough scenes. The movie is very boring and it can cause you to miss a major or major plot points so you just have to assume what the story the rest of the way because it is too hard to catch on. Without understanding the plot you can clearly see Katie Holmes is wanted by the bad guys because she is a DA and that the movie is about stopping the guys with drugs and stopping the plot to destroy the water supply. Michael Caine is good though he doesn't have enough screen time to develop a bond with him. Christian Bale is non charismatic, as were I believe the past Batmans in the other movies, but it doesn't have to be about Batman, it can be more about the villains, with some Batman, as long as it is entertaining.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The most realistic Batman I've ever seen,"Hello to all movie lovers, I would like to comment on the movie ""Batman Begins"". I have watched every single Batman movie there is and I got this feeling that this particular depiction of Batman is the most realistic.

This is the real batman,"'Batman Begins"" at last penetrates to the dark and troubled depths of the Batman legend, creating a superhero who, if not plausible, is at least persuasive as a man driven to dress like a bat and become a vigilante. The movie doesn't simply supply Batman's beginnings in the tradition of a comic book origin story, but explores the tortured path that led Bruce Wayne from a parentless childhood to a friendless adult existence.The story of why he identifies with bats (childhood trauma) and hates evildoers (he saw his parents killed by a mugger) has been referred to many times in the various incarnations of the Batman legend, including four previous films. This time, it is given weight and depth. Wayne discovers in Gotham that the family Wayne Corp. is run by a venal corporate monster (Rutger Hauer), but that in its depths labors the almost forgotten scientific genius Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who understands Wayne wants to fight crime and offers him the weaponry.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The ultimate comic book based film,"Prior to seeing this film, Batman Forever was my favourite. There was something about it that wasn't in Burton's films.I felt that Burton's 2 films in the series were too dark and at times not easy to watch, whereas although Schumacher's Batman Forever (lets forget Batman and Robin) was very good, it was a little too humorous. Begins finds the balance perfectly and therefore makes for compelling viewing.I don't want to ruin anything, but everything about this film is flawless. It's up there with The Aviator, The Life Aquatic and Crash as one of 2005's best film in my opinion.Bale is brilliant as the young Bruce Wayne. Caine is always good, as is Morgan Freeman. Gary Oldman is also superb.Simply go and enjoyCheers, Rob",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A masterpiece!!!,"Being a comic book fan and creator, I truly can relate to this movie.I've always been a huge fan of Batman. When the late great Bob Kane gave us Batsy he gave us the world's second biggest superhero (second only to Superman).My personal opinion is that those two carried DC Comics for years and still continue to do so.I mean really, who cares about the Green Lantern, and Martian Manhunter, the JLA is all about Supes and Bats.Batman had not really been taken seriously as a superhero for years(thanks to that horrible 60's television show). It wasn't until Tim Burton put his spin on the Dark Knight did people start to respect him again.Tim Burton and Michael Keaton reinvented Batman for what he was. A dark figure that was supposed to strike terror into the hearts of those who did evil.Joel Schumacher destroyed that respect Batman had regained with those two horrible sequels in 1995 and 1997. (Batsuits with nipples, ugh).Just when I thought the Batman movie franchise had died forever in comes Batman Begins.I took my kids to see this when it first came out. We enjoyed it then and since I just picked it up on DVD yesterday, we enjoy it even more now.Christian Bale does an even better job at Batman/Bruce Wayne than Michael Keaton did and I did not think that was possible.Wonderful supporting cast and they kept it a bit on the scary side, which is what Batman was always meant to be.The director lets up see Batman in the criminals' eyes. A supernatural horrific figure.I especially love that thing they did with his voice to make him sound more sinister.It was interesting to see how he got his start as the first half of the movie is him training to be the Dark Knight.Unbelievable movie and I have watched it already four times since buying it.My co-workers are all asking me to borrow it.Buy your own!!!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Note those who not seen this new Batman film, this is not the normal summer blockbuster special effect/CGI packed movie. This movie has soul. The plot is pure and simple and really defines Batman.

As for the other Batman movies...this new one even blows the first Batman movie away!!!! This movie is the REAL Batman.

Batman Reborn,"If you hadn't caught on to the fact that the success of superhero movies lately has been because of origin stories, then this film's title should have rung the bell. ""Batman Begins"" is all about Bruce Wayne: the man, the mystery, the legend and dives straight into the heart of one of comics' most infamous crime-fighters. It's exactly what a lover of the modern superhero film could hope for. Not only that, but this total rebirth of the Batman franchise is actually preferable to the original two films. While those films may have a place in your heart, trust me that ""Batman Begins"" will make you shun half the original films, deny their existence, and insist that Christopher Nolan direct 3 more--which he very well could.""Batman Begins"" is essentially a character study of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Bale). Bale's version of the Caped Crusader is excellent. He's tough, ruthless, gutsy, gets down both the playboy and the hero and is also somewhat mysterious and feels hard to crack. The film's first 45 minutes are all about telling his story--the death of his parents and an incident with bats-- which fuels his anger as he trains to fight his fears and develop the martial arts skills that being Batman will require of him. The rest of the film is Wayne's return to Gotham City to become Batman and try and save a corrupt city.I don't want to get too much into the plot other than to say it's of classic superhero diabolical nature. Some might be let down that the film's lens is so firmly fixed on Wayne, it doesn't permit for a strong antagonist. It's not as much about the bad guys themselves, but what they stand for and how they clash with Bruce's morals and ideology. To be blunt, ""Batman Begins"" is relentless with its thematics, constantly pushing the themes of overcoming fear, crusading for justice and making a difference all while staying true to one's self. The focal point of an overwhelming percentage of the dialogue is on getting these themes across. As much as that is the case, I can gladly say that nearly all of it feels natural and not awkward, which is impressive. It is simply so common that Nolan makes it part of the film's feel.Don't hear me wrong, ""Begins"" is loaded with action and gadgets and has the distinct feel of a comic adaptation. It even has enough one-liners and ""this time the joke's on you"" lines to make you giddy, but it all relates back so flawlessly to the themes, which is really where this film does its best work. Next to that, Nolan imagines an excellent Gotham City that feels both very real and very comic-like.My only real beef with the film is the weak link in its all-star cast chain: Katie Holmes. She's so hard to believe and 90% of those lines that do feel cheesy come from her. I think it's something to do with her really tight cheeks. A performance worthy of noting on the other end is Cillian Murphy as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. He's excellent at doing both the real and the very characterized acting.Anyone who was skeptical of such a quick rebirth of this franchise will be more than pleasantly surprised by this film. This has the potential to be an incredible franchise by the time Nolan and Warner Bros. are done with it--perhaps one of the best superhero franchises of all time. Its combination of both the real and comic book universe has infinite entertainment and overall quality potential.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great Effort -The Best Batman Film,"With the plethora of super-hero films currently being released and in production, and with most of them being generally poor, Batman Begins had a lot to prove. I was never a fan of any of the other recent Batman films, I found Tim Burton's effort too heavily weighted in favour of Jack Nicholson's Joker, who was just annoying and a bit over the top generally, too Hollywood for me. Joel Schumaker's efforts were pretty awful all round. Batman Begins has a great cast. Christian Bale is excellent, trouncing Keaton, Clooney and Kilmer by miles. He looks like he can handle 10 thugs, and has an edginess to him. Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer make up the rest of the big hitters and they do not disappoint. The best side of this film is the origin and development of Batman, we are told at length how he came to be who he is, how he learnt to beat the crap out of thugs, how he acquired the gadgets, etc.. This makes the film more human and believable, which in a fantasy super hero film is a big achievement. Very highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The man behind the 'Bat'.,"My Take: Darker, more menacing than any of the earlier BATMAN films.After Joel Schumacher brought back the pure camp of the dated 60's Batman series with his painfully annoying BATMAN & ROBIN, brilliant director Christopher Nolan gives us back the Batman we'd wish to come back. Nolan gives Batman a new breath of fresh air, maybe more than what Burton has given in his two brilliant Batman episodes BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS (which still stands out as my favorite Batman movie). BATMAN BEGINS is less about the superhero junkie and more on his human side, which means it devotes more on dialog, character development and gritty action than the usual fantasy that we got to know. This is not the Batman for kids, but any fan of the dark knight will still be rewarded by the overall impact. This is looking through beyond the Bat suit and into the characters past.Christian Bale makes an ideal Batman, but most of all, he makes an ideal Bruce Wayne. And since the film is more about Bruce's life, his performance is potent and believable. The film also shows us that Bruce isn't exactly the instant heir to the Wayne fortune after his parents untimely murder. We discovered that he first becomes a prisoner due to a hard fight to survive. After which, he is trained by the mysterious League of Shadows, a sacred legion devoting themselves to fight injustice in a vigilante mannerism. After refusing to accept their justice, Bruce goes his own way, taking his deepest, darkest fear (the fear of bats) as his symbol to fight crime and injustice in the crime-drugged streets of Gotham city, ruled by underground drug-lords and crime-boss.The film is less the fun, and is very serious, but this is pulp fiction at best. The film's change of pace is necessary and appropriate, making it an ideal modernization to the character. Instead of wasting Batman's character credibility like Schumacher's biggest mistake, Nolan brings back the dignity and human spirit of the character. Supporting characters like Alfred (Michael Caine), tough city detective Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and others are great real people that surround the Batman's ""real"" life. The script provides many great and memorable lines and Nolan keeps the characters and story involving while also providing good doses of action all the way.I'd call BATMAN BEGINS a great prequel/sequel, but it's more of a great restart. It makes a wonderful return to form. Like Alfred said: ""Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. Welcome back!"" Yes, welcome back, and, to Warner Bros., forget about the mistake of green-lighting BATMAN & ROBIN, all is forgiven.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best Batman film yet.,"As the title hints, ""Batman Begins"" is not a sequel to the three (the latest previous attempt doesn't count) recent installments featuring the Caped Crusader, but rather a new dawn that unabashedly ignores any established precedents. The end result is as intended, breathing brilliant new life into a series that had unfortunately become a laughingstock.The script's blueprint invigorates the film. Because of the audience's general familiarity with the title character, ""Batman Begins"" is able to concentrate on his origin and motivations rather than the crime fighting itself. Like ""Superman"", the best superhero movie ever, the film spends a significant portion of its running length on the how and why instead of the what. We observe the fears and struggles that Bruce Wayne faces, which simultaneously humanizes him and heightens his mythic status.This course of action is primarily executed over the first ninety minutes, during which a depth beyond the typical perfunctory introduction of motives is established. Batman's fearsome aura, the source of his power in both the fictional world of Gotham and the real world of moviegoers, is detailed, resulting in a movie more fascinating psychological thriller than standard adventure flick, although the action scenes still shine, one Batmobile-charged chase in particular. Eventually of course the inevitable protagonist-antagonist showdown evolves, and then the movie deteriorates slightly, but by that point ""Batman Begins"" has reached such heights that neither the slight come-down nor occasional cinematic conveniences and niceties (why the kid?) derail the picture.Aiding in the climb to excellence is the best supporting cast of any Batman film, filled with respected and recognizable faces who nail roles as they suitably show more restraint than many in the prior versions. Cillian Murphy is extra creepy as the the shady psychologist Dr. Crane; Liam Neeson authoritative as Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor; Gary Oldman, even though you half-expect him to go psycho at any moment, evokes an excellent world-weariness as Detective Gordon; Michael Caine adds strength to the butler Alfred; and Morgan Freeman as Batman's pseudo-Q is...well, has Freeman ever been anything less than superb? Other talented actors like Tom Wilkinson (crime boss Carmine Falcone), Ken Watanabe (the enigmatic Ra's Al Ghul), and Rutger Hauer (the business head of Wayne Enterprises) round out the predominantly male cast interestingly loaded with Brits. As the mandatory female love interest, Mrs. Tom Cruise...er...Katie Holmes, is fully adequate and attractive, although her part could have been played by numerous actresses.All that talent matters little if the man behind the cape and cowl falters. But Christian Bale never wavers in either portion of his role. I'll say it...Bale is better than Keaton, Kilmer, or Clooney, combining the best of the two former actors. As Bruce Wayne, he surpasses Keaton's charming playfulness and Kilmer's suave businessman with a twinkle befitting the younger man. As Batman, Bale possesses a masked intensity that blows away all of them, embodying the tortured soul through menacing facial expressions and a daunting physical presence that none of his predecessors maintained consistently.Beyond an omnipresent score (from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard) that is unrelenting but still mostly unobtrusive, a solid script and high production value lay the foundation from which the aforementioned excellent work is built. With the feel of a ridiculously polished (as it should be for $135 million) independent film, the Chicago-based Gotham City is edgier and darker than ""Batman Forever"", but grittier than Tim Burton's noir-ish films. Those were bleak by design, while Batman Begins seems to draw its bleakness from beyond mere physicality, from a hope-starved story that matches its dismal yet chimerical backdrop. Instead of the fact-based world of Spider-man and his New York City, Batman and his Gotham sport a fantasy-laced makeover that better allows for distinctions between good and evil. While moral murkiness fits some films (""Mystic River""), superhero flicks work best with clear-cut distinctions. By creating a city with a sense of elevated reality, director Christopher Nolan and company imbue ""Batman Begins"" with a stronger soul that thrives on the film's dominant theme of fear, compounding the movie's allure.All aspects collectively tap into the mysterious and powerful Batman myths better than any other movie in the franchise. We now know not just who and what Batman is, but how and why he exists.Bottom Line: ""Batman Begins"" is the best on-screen incarnation of the Dark Knight yet. A high 8 of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

We see a true origin here and not something rushed over in the first 20 mins, Christian Bale is playing Bruce Wayne for roughly the first half of the story.I remember initially having a problem with the fight scenes as they were all shot so close up but Nolan said that this was done intentionally to make Batman seem like an unstoppable threat or something like that. Everyone is perfectly cast from Michael Cane as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy.Still holds up as a great Batman story start to finish complimented by a soundtrack from James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer.

"""Swear to *me*!""","First, a recap - after the success of the 1978 Superman film, Warner Brothers was eager to bring another DC Comic book character to the big screen, so naturally, they turned their eyes to the only other DC character who could rival/match Superman for pop culture icon status, Batman (although Wonder Woman is in third place). For ten long, seemingly fruitless years, Warner Brothers and DC struggled to bring Batman to the big screen in hopes that the Dark Knight could have back-to-back success with his big brother the Man of Steel (at the same time, sadly, Superman's film franchise went into a slow, steady decline), with various writers, directors and actors coming, going, jumping on, jumping off, jumping back on, jumping back off again, etc. But then Tim Burton, then a new visionary talent on the rise, came along with just enough familiarity with Batman and just enough strength of will and vision to make it happen, and with the backing of the success of ""Beetle-Juice"", Warners Brothers were just crazy enough to let Tim have a go at it, even if it meant hiring the seemingly less than ideal but in the end very effective Michael Keaton to play the title character. Then in the summer of 1989, with Superman's never ending battle for truth, justice and the American way having died on the big screen, Batman stepped in to fill the void, and a phenomenon of epic proportions so rarely seen before or since was born. Then came 1992's ""Batman Returns"", which was also a mega-hit but inspired a backlash from parents who found the film to be too dark and mean-spirited for their kids (parents reportedly had to drag crying children out of the theater that summer). In response to this and speculation that Batman couldn't hold the fort, Burton was politely asked to step aside and his friend Joel Schumacher came on board with a new Batman, Val Kilmer, stepping in for an MIA Keaton, with the flashier, more light-hearted ""Batman Forever"", which was also a hit despite taking a great deal of flack over stuff like rubber nipples on the bat suit. But then everything came falling down with ""Batman & Robin"", which many complained was too campy while the 2nd film had been too dark, and which featured another new Batman, George Clooney, playing the Dark Knight as a light-hearted scamp (Kilmer at least tried to capture the essence of Batman) in a film that proved to be too much of everything - too garishly bright, too over the top in spectacle, too overly produced and over-exposed it forced the WB to give Batman a time out, leaving Joel Schumacher with a long and bitter battle on his hands as he fought to rebuild his reputation as an actually good director while Clooney went on to bigger, better things.But Warner Brothers wasn't quite done with Batman just yet. After all, he's one of the great iconic comic book characters alongside the X-Men, Spider-Man and of course, big brother Superman. And once again the WB and DC struggled to get the movie Batman back on his feet, but it would require slimming/trimming/toning it down and going back to basics. Once again, writers, directors, and actors came and went in the seven years between now and then, but finally things came together with director Christopher Nolan, writer David S. Goyer and star Christian Bale. But how to make it fresh, appealing, new, not simply a rehash of the previous films but still undeniably Batman? By going back to the beginning, delving into what the earlier films only hinted at or lightly touched upon, so much so to the point that in the beginning it doesn't even feel like a Batman film.The result is the familiar but well told origin story of how Bruce Wayne lost his wealthy and warm-hearted parents to a random mugger, Joe Chill, but still in connection with criminal kingpin Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). Years later the conflicted, spiritually lost adult Bruce (Bale), torn between a genuine desire for justice and his thirsting for revenge, embarks on a journey unto which he confronts his deepest fears, trains and hardens himself to his very limits and then, coming back to Gotham City to become symbolic avenger of injustice, the Batman, aided by loyal man-servant/surrogate father figure Alfred (well played by Michael Caine). Additionally, Batman must fight not only Falcone but the Scarecrow/Dr. Jon Crane (a lightweight Cillian Murphy), and Ra's Ah Guhl (played by Ken Watanabe and Liam Neeson, the latter in a rare villainous/anti-hero role that he plays very well), and he must reclaim his father's company from the unscrupulous Rutger Hauer with help from Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox, make an alliance with Gary Oldman's Sgt/Lt./eventually Commissioner Jim Gordon, and rescue his foxy/sexy childhood friend turned lawyer brunette Rachael Dawes (Katie Holmes at the beginning of the Tom Cruise fiasco).Batman/Bruce Wayne is well played by Christian Bale. At times reusing his ""American Psycho"" performance, Bale hits a few flat notes but on the whole he's the best new Batman anyone could hope for: 6-feet tall, good looking, muscular, and actually possessing good solid acting ability, here's hoping they don't lose him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Batman I Awlays Wanted,"This is the Batman movie that I have been waiting for, not the quirky Tim Burton Batman, and not the Adam West super cheesy Batman and definitely not the terrible terrible George Clooney Batman (love you George, but that was just wrong on every level) but the real honest to Gotham BATMAN. Batman Begins is a completely phenomenal film that is great on every level. Christian Bale did an absolutely amazing job as Bruce Wayne and Batman, and then there is the rest of the cast, Neeson, Murphy, Wilkinson, Oldman and Watanabe, are you kidding me, heck, even Rutger Hauer was great. Overall Christopher Nolan has made a total master piece, a real Batman that is based in reality with all that that implies, and this only gets better when paired with the next two chapters in the saga. 5 Beards Out Of 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Amazing depth of story and originality but lacks Tim Burton's glamour,"I have to admit that Batman Beginning is the most realistic and original comic based movie ever. It's so realistic that I started to relate the character's thoughts as my one. Obviously, to everyone who knows Batman he does not have any super powers, he just have fighting skills, wealth, wits, and LOTS of weaponry gadgets. I really enjoyed watching this movie, once that is maybe twice because Katie Holmes is in the movie. Now about the casting of the movie, you have ""American Psycho"" meets ""Joey Potter"" that's all I need to say. Their lines were so limited to a few corny puns and most importantly ""Psycho"" and ""Potter"" didn't really click at all. The supporting cast of Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman truly deserves the props for their brilliant acting. In conclusion, this movie is a blockbuster and is much better than Batman 2-4 but still falls short to Tim Burton's original Batman, who selected a much better cast of Keaten, Basinger, and Nickleson. He defined a more glamorous Gotham City, here Gothem looks like New York City.

Promising new Batman film ruined by a fatal flaw,"Batman Begins is the latest film entry in the Warner Brothers Batman franchise that I've been looking forward to, even while my interest was marginally low as a Batman comic fan (I contemplated skipping the movie). I own Batman Black & White, Batman: A Death in the Family, et al and I enjoy reading the comics immensely for well-constructed stories. I thought Christopher Nolan's new vision of the rise of Bruce Wayne as a cleverly intelligent billionaire playboy and a valiant crime fighter would herald the beginning of a promising new Batman movie franchise after the abominable failure of Batman & Robin.After the screening, I had difficulty evaluating the quality of the film - flat-out mediocre, weakly fair or shockingly bad. I attribute my disappointing impression to the one fatal flaw that ruined the film for me, as far as the movie-going experience is concerned: editing.Batman Begins is the distant cousin to Armageddon. Editing is what totally ruined the movie experience for me when it kept visually pummeling the viewer who was trying to follow the story amidst bizarrely chaotic action, marginal character development and fairly impressive direction by Nolan.Don't get me wrong, Batman Begins is close to being a good quality movie on the surface level. It's good to be different that spurn the conventional norms to make a truly unique film. But the crime at the scene pointing to the fatal outcome is maddeningly pretentious MTV-lite editing style that killed my interest in what happens in the movie. Some of the action scenes are so chaotic it's confounding and difficult to follow coherently from scene to scene. I thought Edward Scissorhands was brought in to become O.D. on the combined in-take of cocaine, speed and caffeine in editing the film to shreds to render it barely watchable for those who rise above the general audience's attention span of a goldfish.Batman Begins starts differently pertaining to the development of the main protagonist Bruce Wayne. At this stage, I thought the movie is going in the right direction that stands to purge the bad memory of enduring Batman & Robin at a sold-out movie screening the opening night in June 1997. But as the film progress, the film editing takes precedence in how the visual style should look. It may represent the fast-paced action of the latest comic book series, but for me it gave me a migraine headache. And the film got too predictable. There are the plot points in which I correctly guessed to be divulged, although I liked the creatively constructed plot twists towards the ending. It's fair enough to develop the story to take in the wholly fresh new direction, but I didn't find it compelling because it's very clich√©d.Christian Bale shines throughout the film in spite of the excessively self-indulgent editing. He's a damned good actor and he shows that he can carry the movie without bearing a burden on his shoulders. The supporting actors in the film are basically cardboard cutouts as fairly underdeveloped characters suffering the savage hands of the auteur hack editor Lee Smith with the approved oversight by Mr. Nolan. No emotional impact and attachment whatsoever. Katie Holmes is close to terrible as District Attorney Rachel Dawes in Batman Begins - courtesy of Dawson's Creek acting school. No chemistry whatsoever, either - so bland it makes William Shatner's interactive chemistry with Kirstie Alley in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan seem convincing. Furrowing your eyebrows and pretending to be too serious do not equal good acting. Katie Holmes's miscasting is one of the worst flaws that undermine the film besides rotten caffeine-induced editing. And the ending is so blatant in its opening a slot for a sequel that it felt tacky instead of subliminal.Batman Begins is a forgettable film typical of the summer blockbuster movie mentality. The only memorable sequence is Morgan Freeman & Christian Bale test-driving a pre-modified custom-built Thundertank...er, Batmobile and it was amusing to watch as it pokes fun of itself with a self-acknowledged wink of humor.Christopher Nolan did a fine job speculating on the legacy of Batman's beginning, but the editing basically destroyed the film so it registers a negative response from a jaded moviegoer like me. Christopher Nolan and his team of editors should watch Ingmar Bergman's Fanny & Alexander and The Seventh Seal for noble film art in slow-burn psychological character development intensity with slow-moving but precise editing and learn what can be artful while developing an otherwise overwhelmingly commercial film.Batman Begins is worth seeing in a dollar theater. Otherwise, it's a waste of hard-earned money for a brief, limp escapade of following Bruce Wayne's adventure and vendetta with lesser psychological and visceral impact than expected.** out of four",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best superhero movie ever,"I'm not a huge fan of superhero movies. Many of them turn out to be too corny or predictable. ""Batman Begins,"" however, is a rare treat. This film shows how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) conquers his fear of bats by facing his fears and becoming a superhero with bat-like ability. It's truly a fascinating story that shows Wayne from his childhood to his battle with his first villain, the Scarecrow. Christian Bale proves to be the best movie Batman ever. This film also has an excellent supporting cast, featuring Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, and my favorite, Morgan Freeman. This film includes an excellent balance between humorous and serious moments, making this a very interesting and entertaining ride.

The movie that should've been made in the first place.,"I've heard that what can make or break a movie in peoples' minds is 3 memorable scenes. Batman Begins had several. The whole movie was so well done, the cinematography of the mountains, the interaction between Ducard and Bruce, Alfred and Bruce, young Bruce and his dad, Bruce and Fox, Batman and Gordon and so on. There's stellar acting by all the great actors in this movie besides Bale. The car chase scene with the Batmobile was the best I've seen in a movie in the last 10 years outside of the Matrix Reloaded, which was only great because of all the CGI. Plus that it was filmed here in my hometown of Chicago, what more can I say? The movie and acting were so good that I'm willing to overlook Katie Holmes in the worst casting decision of the movie. She looks and acts like Joey from Dawson's Creek playing lawyer.What a difference when you put a movie in the right hands for a change. They finally woke up after Sam Raimi pulled off Spider-Man into two great super hero movies. When you put a film in the hands of a great director in Nolan, great screenplay, and great actors, it's no reason why this film is rated 8.3 out of 10 here on IMDb. This is truly the Batman film that should've been made in the first place. Instead Warner Brothers went from the talented yet bizarre Tim Burton to the crap that Joel Shumaker turned it into.

The REAL Batman,"I've been a Batman fan since childhood, but more so in the last fifteen years or so since married life. My husband and I subscribed to all of the various Batman comics and followed them religiously for many years. I have to say, we were truly excited when we saw a new version of Batman released in movie format. And it's a new version unrelated to any of the previous bad incarnations. It truly has no connection, not even a loose one, to any other Batman movie. This movie is so wonderfully true to the REAL Batman of the comics. It is wonderfully dramatic and is so complete.

Great film to watch again and again!!!,"""Batman Begins"" is a cinematic triumph that revitalized the superhero genre. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film delves into the origins of the iconic caped crusader, offering a fresh and gritty take on the beloved character.Character Depth and Conviction:
Christian Bale takes up the mantle of Batman, surpassing previous portrayals by Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and Adam West. His performance is both brooding and intense, capturing the inner turmoil of Bruce Wayne.The movie doesn't merely supply Batman's beginnings in the tradition of a comic book origin story; it delves into the tortured path that led Bruce Wayne from a parentless childhood to a friendless adult existence.Realism and Atmosphere:
Unlike earlier Batman films, which reveled in extravagant special-effects action, ""Batman Begins"" is shrouded in shadow. The cinematography, reinforced by superb sound effects, creates an immersive experience.Gotham City feels authentic and gritty, a place teetering on the edge of chaos. The bleak vision of the city adds weight to Batman's mission.Supporting Cast:
Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor, brings gravitas to the screen. His enigmatic presence and sword-fighting skills add depth to the narrative.Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox provides Batman with cutting-edge technology, including the iconic Batmobile-a rugged juggernaut that defies convention.Slow-Burn Transformation:
Bruce Wayne's evolution into Batman is gradual. We witness his clumsy attempts, his foolish chances, and his inventiveness as he crafts his alter ego.The film respects the audience's intelligence, allowing us to invest emotionally in Batman's journey.Themes of Fear and Justice:
""Batman Begins"" explores fear as a driving force. Bruce Wayne's childhood trauma and his parents' tragic fate fuel his obsession with justice.The League of Shadows, led by Ducard, challenges Batman's moral compass, forcing him to confront his own darkness.In summary, ""Batman Begins"" is more than a superhero movie; it's a character-driven exploration of identity, fear, and redemption. It's the Batman film we've been waiting for-one that resonates with both die-hard fans and newcomers alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Batman really begins with this film,"This film details how Bruce Wayne becomes the Batman, and the epic way he saves Gotham city from an evil plot.The first hour of ""Batman Begins"" paves way for why Bruce wants to become Batman, and how he does it. Though there is not much action, it is still captivating to see the transformation from an ordinary man to a superhero. The remainder of the film is filled with heroic action. The balance of action versus violence is excellent, there are many fights but it has no senseless violence. Apart from the action, ""Batman Begins"" has a human touch. The relationship between Bruce and Rachel is well developed, drawing viewers emotionally closer to Bruce, as Bruce is not just a distant unreachable superhero. The long lasting loyalty of Alfred is touching, and he has many of the best lines in the film.Forget the previous Batmans. Batman really begins with this film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"good, but not great","Like everyone else who has reviewed ""Batman Begins"" thus far, I saw it at an advance screening. (Probably?) unlike anyone else who has reviewed this movie thus far, it was introduced to me (and the other 150 or so people in attendance) by a Warner Bros. VP who stated his belief that this movie would not only meet but exceed the new standard for super-hero movies set by Columbia's ""Spider-Man"".I understand what the VP meant, but after watching ""Batman Begins"", I can't help but conclude that comparing it to ""Spider-Man"" is like comparing an apple to an orange. Yes, they're both super-hero movies, but where ""Spider-Man"" is a playful romp and its title character geekily charming, ""Batman Begins"" is a disturbing odyssey and its title character painfully tortured. And while they're both rated PG-13, ""Spider-Man"" is much more kid-friendly than ""Batman Begins"", which I would not recommend for young children. Some of the elements of ""Batman Begins"" are downright horrifying.All of this is what makes ""Batman Begins"" a good movie. Batman isn't supposed to be cute and funny, or even particularly likable for that matter. His alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, is seriously disturbed. ""Batman Begins"" does an excellent job of illustrating how Bruce Wayne got to be the way he is psychologically. Even better, ""Batman Begins"" does a phenomenal job of explaining how Batman got to be the way he is physically. Everything about Batman that one could consider, well, not exactly super, but definitely pretty darn cool -- his skills in stealth and combat; his ""bat-suit"" body armor, helmet, and cape; and his myriad of gadgets, not least of all the Batmobile -- is presented in such a way that makes it ALMOST completely plausible in today's society. It's also nice to see a Batman movie focus so much on its title character and minimally, yet sufficiently, on its villains.I emphasized ALMOST above because I had a bit of trouble accepting the Mortal-Kombat-esqueness of Bruce Wayne's martial arts training. Perhaps this wouldn't have been as hard for me to digest if the segment, which took up the first quarter or so of the film, had not been as long, nor had the final fight scene in the segment been so incoherent. Overall, the film was unnecessarily bloated at 140 minutes, and most of its fight scenes were flurries of activity with no distinct focus.Other things that kept ""Batman Begins"" from being truly great:* Too-young-looking Katie Holmes' utter unbelievability as a fierce D.A. (Too bad Kimberly Guilfoyle-Newsome isn't an actress (yet?))* Poor character aging. (Or perhaps Alfred took to sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber after Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered?)* That bizarre accent Christian Bale used when he was wearing the Batman costume. (And, most unfortunately, a couple of times when he wasn't.)* That bizarre growth on Liam Neeson's upper lip!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Christopher nolan should have watched loads of good martial arts films and he would have worked out how to direct quality action scenes because the choreography of the fights looked fine.If the action scenes would have been the same BUT well directed the film would have managed a 8, it would have still lacked any truly great action moments which for me a film like this needs to be in the 9's or 10's.Will probably rent the DVD but won't be buying it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Everything was portrayed on a 3rd grade level, and nothing was really left to the imagination. where is the dualism of good and evil? Where is the delicate line between vigilante and hero? This movie attempts to draw these lines and then clearly plant itself in the good/hero camp. Yawn. What's the point?I am surprised that this movie is doing so well on IMDb, and hope that people will wake up soon and realize this movie is just another boring action flick. Some say its an improvement from Batman and Robin, notably the worst of the Batman movies.

It makes a Batman fan out of all of us.,"""Batman Begins"" is not only an expertly crafted superhero movie, it's flat-out a great action film. Every element of the film is top notch. We're given a solid cast of professional actors who take the material seriously, which means we get characters that are iconic and memorable and would be even if they weren't based on the immortal characters of DC Comics. What I still find surprising is that even though any Batman fan, and most people that are somewhat familiar with the character will know roughly what his origins are, but the story does not feel repetitive at all. It feels fresh, and it's very tightly written. As an extra bonus, there is plenty of exciting action sequences. The movie is filled with memorable moments, some great lines and the score is a real powerhouse. There's at least two great car chases during the film that are both really thrilling and the movie gets very inventive with some of the gadgets used by Batman. If you have a friend that has been turned off of the superhero films or never took comic books seriously, this is the movie you want to show them. Not only will they be easily converted but it will give you a chance to watch this movie again. If you haven't re-visited this chapter in the trilogy since the original release date, you've likely forgotten how good this movie actually is (which is likely due to the success of the later films) but on its own or as part of the franchise, it's a landmark in the comic book adaptation genre.

"If you're a fan of Batman, you'll love it, if you're not a fan, you'll become one after watching this film...","Four decades after the TV series, two after the first film, Batman wasn't exactly a beginner, so the title might sound a bit presumptuous in the context of 2005 if only because everyone thought the saga actually ended with that dreadful ""Batman & Robin"". But that was underestimating Christopher Nolan, he didn't just revive a cinematically dead saga but proved beyond a (dark) shadow of a doubt that it hadn't even begun.But it needed to come so late and I knew I was right to watch the previous movies before Nolan's take, because it's only in that order that you realize how underexploited the potential of the DC icon was, as far as characterization goes. Indeed, it's not just in the way Nolan takes us to the origins of Batman (Christian Bale), to Bruce Wayne's childhood, his trauma with bats, the death of his parents and his initiation by Ducard (Liam Neeson), it's how it plays later in the 'revealing' scene.Take the first Batman, a classic, no doubt about it: it starts with criminals who don't fool us about their status as baits for the heroic entrance. Keaton popping up and saying: ""I'm Batman"" probably had some members of the audience clapping and cheering but it doesn't hold up now, you know it's just the kind of trailer-filler scenes with no other pretension than introducing the hero. What happens is that, villains you don't care about are stopped by Batman who can take care of himself, so it's not that we don't but we can't root for him.But boy, when the ""I'm Batman"" moment happens halfway through that film, after all that journey where he kept looking for himself, asking whether he's seeking revenge or justice, after all the wandering and wondering, all the tasks and duels and pains and stitches, all the brainstorming with Alfred (Michael Caine) about the right identity and with engineer Fox (Morgan Freeman) for the costumes and the ""gadgets"", when he finally comes up fully-dressed... we know it's not just a superhero in a fancy costume, what we've got is an achievement... and I was cheering inside. And not not just because of the hero. We saw Tom Wilkinson laying his cards in front of a mildly impressed Bruce Wayne, which makes the villain's come-uppance twice more enjoyable.That scene alone is the reason why Nolan was right to make ""Batman Begins"". When it started, I was like ""what the hell...?"" I kept waiting for the Batman tropes, Gotham City, the logo, the Batmobile, Alfred... but then I realized that Superman had started the same way and when we could finally see the nerdy Kent opening his shirt with the ""S"" logo, we were finally rewarded for our patience. Nolan trusts our patience as well and is generous enough to make a few allusions to the Batman we know, like with the infamous parent's murder scene. And once again, even that scene is played at the right time, after many glimpses on Bruce's relationship with his father and his own fear, and see how it all comes full circle with that defining murder. I think it just comes down to one thing: give everything a meaning.Why Batman? Why the bats? Why a black uniform? Why never killing anyone? Everything has an answer, a meaning, an origin. I love how Nolan tries to give some realism to Batman's origins, not to make the film realistic but plausible in the realm of superheroes movies... so real that Batman shouldn't even be considered a superhero. This is not just a good film, but a good story. Good in the classical sense, with the coming-of-age, the hero triumphing over his initial demons, then gaining enough strength to give a meaning to that first triumphant step and good in the writing.For instance, notice how the word 'vigilante' is mentioned twice, by Ducard and later by the commissioner, Nolan was aware about the kind of labels that go with a character like Batman, and he doesn't deny them as much as he gives them a new weight, it's like ""Yes, but there's more to it..."". A vigilante always has style and an attitude that betrays an unconscious desire to 'show off' a little but in reality, Batman is perhaps the ultimate vigilante because he goes from a totally selfish desire to get his revenge to protecting a town that is corrupted to the core and all the style and the attitude are only meant to scare his opponents, to hide in the night, as a matter of fact, again, everything can be explained.And this is nothing compared to the way the word ""fear"" is repeated, serving the film's motto that we're all meant to fall, but it's all about picking ourselves up. From another director, it could sound corny but not with Nolan, and certainly not with Caine playing a great Alfred. And this comes from someone who likes the other Alfred, too. The cast is another highlight of the film, honorable mention to Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and even Katie Holmes who was shockingly nominated for a Razzie, granted she wasn't Oscar worthy but that was a low blow, even by Razzies' standards. Speaking of the Oscars, the film was so full of great visual effects and action sequences that I was surprised it only gathered one nomination for Cinematography, but quite a deserved one, the shots on Gotham City were breath-taking.You know I've never been fan of DC or Marvel Comics, but I always loved the Disney Duck stories with Scrooge McDuck and Donald... and what Nolan did reminded me of Keno Don Rosa's ""Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck"", he took an iconic character and provided a level of depth and a dimension that went beyond the format of the comic-book canon. I guess if there ever was a ""Batman"" hall of fame, Nolan would be in the Top 5 not far from the creators or Adam West.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A slightly flawed, but nonetheless fascinating study on moral complexity","Where most superhero films are immature nonsense with the typical clich√©'d 'tyrant' evil villain and the non existent narrative or character development, Batman Begins puts an emphasis on character instead of action, and the result is that here is finally a superhero film that is both mature and impactful due to this.Batman Begins has many changes in the way it tells its narrative. It starts out with a non linear storytelling structure with Bruce Wayne's present intertwining with his child past, whereas later on the present is the only timeline that is being handled. As stated before, the emphasis in Batman Begins is on characterization, and the audience begins to find out through these flashbacks sequences what will motivate the future 'Batman' to don his costume. It is that very fear of bats the young Bruce Wayne is shown to have that he wishes to strike into the hearts of the criminals he fights, and this is a brilliant piece of character writing in itself to make the audience understand this. The gritty way his family is murdered, and the way their killer is shot just moments before assassinating him himself further adds to the escalating need for justice in Wayne's subconscious. The character of Wayne is, due to this interesting narrative structure, quite complete. We understand his struggles, his motivations and his actions. This is a humane character that one cares about.While the acting is pretty good in Batman Begins, there isn't really a performance that stands out. Everybody was more than adequate, but a surpreme performance seems to be missing. The performance that comes closest to this has to be Michael Caine as Alfred, who shows an impressive emotional range in his care for Bruce Wayne. Christian Bale is a good Bruce Wayne, although not a special one. However, a lot of these performances are also helped by excellent dialogue. Particularly the scenes with Henri Ducard ( Liam Neeson ) & Bruce Wayne are dripping of excellent in depth and intellectual dialogue about the inner depths of the origins of Wayne's fear of bats. Ducard & Ra's Al Ghul and the League of Shadows also bring forth an interesting question about morality, as these vigilante-like killers have a nihilistic kind of vision of Gotham, and believe it should be eradicated as such. However, through certain characters it is shown that there is yet humanity left in this world, and that nihilism is in fact an extremist way of looking at things. Still, we understand the vision of this League of Shadows because Gotham is still displayed as a crime ridden cesspool that does sometimes seem beyond helping.It feels more like a neo noir than a superhero film at times, and it is obvious that a lot of the visuals were highly inspired by Blade Runner. The darkness, the smoke vents, the pratical effects in the stills, it is all very reminiscent of Scott's masterpiece, and the result is that this cinematography really breathes the sleaze, atmospheric darkness and filth of Gotham perfectly. The visuals in itself tell the story of the bleak hopelessness of this corrupted city. The score by James Newton Howard & Hans Zimmer is also a standout as a superb atmospheric piece.This is, however, not a perfect film. The first hour and a half is excellent in non linear storytelling, but it is filmed in a montage style kind of way. For example, a simple shot of Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) entering his office is cut immediately with a shot of him sitting down on his chair. We do not actually get to see him walk up to it and sit down. This is a little example, but it goes on like this for the entire duration. The gaps in the timelines are a bit too large, and it seems to want to go forward at breakneck pace with this editing.While the narrative in Batman Begins is very sophisticated, it features a lot of unnecessary exposition. It is not the kind of film that really allows the audience to think about what is going on due to actions of its characters, and Nolan seems unable to display the emotional state of a character without them verbalizing it. There are also a couple of scenes in which something that is shown some time beforehand is literally repeated, such as the guy in the Wayne Tower repeating what Wayne said will happen if a certain train reaches it. However, as stated before this does not really deter the film from being less sophisticated, and because it is still an intelligent script it is not really insulting to the audience, but there could have been a little bit more subtlety in this narrative.The action sequences in Batman Begins are also nothing above average. It uses a lot of quick edits, shakycam and distorted images which do not really capture anything of the actual fight scenes. I get that Nolan wanted to make it seem like Batman was this lightning fast superhero, but when we do not actually get to see any of it, what is the point? Luckily as stated before the emphasis is not on action but on character in Batman Begins and thus this is not a complete movie ruining factor. Chase scenes are also filmed with an unremarkably low stance camera point of view.Batman Begins has a surprisingly intelligent narrative for a superhero movie, great character development and characterization, a fantastic original score, good acting, a mostly superb script & an interesting duality in the way it handles morality, but it is also lacking a bit in the filming of its action sequence, use of subtlety and the montage like pace.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"REALISTIC, BATMAN (flying wings)","The best Batman movie ever made! The story is amazing and dynamic with a very articulated plot like a sort of puzzle well composed (it's the art of director!!). The interpretation of actor is skillful, above all that one of Christian Bale, so softly deep, and that one of Cillian Murphy (he appears to me a real crazy megalomaniac ; )). There is a good choice of not killing super-criminal (the Scarecrow) in the same episode, allowing a continuity with future stories (good very good). This is realistic, human, psychological, introspective movie with a particular attention about little feelings: a masterpiece!!! Because of this circumstances, it's complete work! I hope for other similar!PS: Christopher Nolan is a great director! note: there is only 3 little logical neglected particular!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Best Superhero Film Ever, NUFF SAID","Being a huge fan of Burton's original Batman films, I realized I would have to go into this film a bit differently than I would watching Batman or Batman Returns. I have watched this film almost eight times since it was originally released and I think I enjoy it the same each time I watch it again. Christopher Nolan has done something absolutely wonderful with this film and I have yet to find anything really wrong with it.The story is absolutely terrific. David Goyer did a terrific job with the story. Christian Bale, for me, is the best Batman yet. It has alway been for me that Batman and Bruce Wayne are two different individuals and this movie makes that more distinct than any other batman film and Bale does the best job doing it. I absolutely love in this film the relationship Batman has with his allies. I always felt Burton's Batman films lacked the important relationship between Batman and James Gordon. Gary Oldman is the perfect Gordon and both characters develop an important relationship with each other that I feel was non-existent in the original batman films. Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworthy) and Morgan Freeman (Lucious Fox) also soar as important figures to Batman. Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard is pretty good. I think Scarecrow's character (played by Cilian Murphy) is not as good as it could be, but that is just one small and minor problem that offends me. The setting is wonderful. I love the depiction of Gotham City as a dirty, miserable, and slum infested city. The portrayal of ""the narrows"" is terrific and although I loved Burton's portrayal of a Gothic and dark Gotham City that expanded the viewers imagination, the dark Gotham City in Batman Begins is better. It was great to see a taste of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One added to this film with the corruption that lies within the city among the mob and the powerful figure heads. The corruption of Gotham City is an important focal point that is addressed beautifully in this film. I absolutely love the music and the fight scenes are beautifully choreographed.One simple word can describe this movie, Wonderful! An absolute joy to watch and, in my opinion, the best take on Batman. This film is absolutely terrific and I recommend it highly. It truly is a masterpiece. I loved the Tim Burton Batman Movies, but Nolan has taken a step-up from those films!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Forget Episode III,"Forget about the Luke-warm Episode III; a movie franchise that didn't succeed it's predecessors by sticking to the all-CGI method. I liked Yoda better as a puppet anyway. Mr. Lucas gave us a great trilogy with Episodes 4 - 6; and that's the way it should of stayed. Now we have a new hero to film saga film making, Christopher Nolan. He has created the first of what I see to be many new Batman pictures. Batman Begins is a wonderful film experience. The original with Michael Keaton was an excellent movie, but this film surpasses any and all expectations of fans of the original two; I say original two because I'm trying to forget about the Schumacher additions. Batman Begins is a much darker, in depth film. And it will be very, very hard for viewers to find flaws in any aspect of it both as a stand alone picture, and when compared to the Star Wars trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
best yet,"This was a thoroughly gripping and entertaining movie, by far my favourite of all the bat flicks to date. In pure enjoyment terms, it easily matched the classic (and very underrated) '60s Adam West campathon. The action scenes were wonderfully cut, conveying the speed and agility of Batman as he beats up bad guys. Let us not forget superb supporting turns from Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and, especially, the great Michael Caine as Alfred, but the star of the film is Christian Bale who gives a most compelling performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne, creating a new cinematic vision of the now familiar character by pushing him to the edge of sanity. Cillian Murphy is undeniably creepy as arch-villain and psychopath the Scarecrow, a wonderfully different type of villain for a Bat movie, but one that seems to fit with the tone of this one. A great movie for people of all ages.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best of the Batmans by far,"The Batman series has taken a lot of heat in the recent years, especially from the atrocity that was ""Batman and Robin."" Batman Begins has essentially saved the series.Christian Bale was perfect for this film. He was dark, but not as dark as Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer. The film also showed Batman's human side much better than its predecessor, which was just downright outrageous. Thankfully, they got rid of that awful neon-look for Gotham, which previous director Joel Shumacher was freakishly obsessed with. It also chronicles the all important training of Bruce Wayne, and Jim Gordon's rise through the police ranks as apparently the only good cop left in the city. This is not only by far the best of the Batmans, but also one of 2005's best films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
god awful-i wish i would have shot myself instead of seeing this movie,"First let me start off by saying the batman series started and ended with Tim Burton and Michael Keaton. All attempts at the capered crusader have been comical at best. Moving on to the 2hr+ piece of crap known as batman begins, i don't even know where to start ripping this flick -i will list only a few reasons why this movie should never have been made or thrown in the trash instead of releasing upon the public.1. Christian Bale's voice as Batman(tries to deepen his voice) it gets not only annoying but it sounds incredibly forced and dreadful.2. The scarecrow villain is in the movie for literally 1 minute of film time, completely a waste of time because underdeveloped is an understatement.3. The joker is supposed to kill Bruce Wayne's parents when Bruce is younger, not some random poor lowly criminal. Then what should happen is seeking revenge, Bruce turns the murderer of his parents into the Joker. -completely dropped the ball on this one4. Being Batman Begins, Batman can not have a better more updated car than Batman, made in 1989. If its a prequel, make sure everything coincides with the other films - not that hard.5. At the end of the movie - A) Batman gives the bat symbol to gordon - he is not commissioner yet and does not fit with other films b) Jim Gordon shows Batman a joker card, indicating a criminal is out and about on the streets of Gotham- If Bruce Wayne is supposed to in essence create the Joker, how is he around? Doesn't add up at all, leaves more frustration and questions.more things i would have mentioned about this horrendous film - Jim Gordon's character, Bruce Wayne's personality, the batcave, Katie Holmes' character, and a few other small things.All and all just a pile of garbage. The best superhero series as of our time right now is far and away Spiderman. The story is engrossing and extremely well written, and has tremendous casting, unlike Batman Begins.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Rise of a superhero!!,"The epic movie with more epic sequels. This movie gives rise to a superhero known as ""Batman"" and also the saga of Batman Trilogy. It depicts the story of a young and fearful boy, Bruce Wayne, and how he became a crime fighter as a result of his parent's death. A beginning of three master pieces by Christopher Nolan, the movie is not only epic in the sense that it has a great plot and more really executed than other artificially portrayed superhero movies, but also because it gives rise to a series of such epic cult classics. Incredibly well deigned action scenes, good acting by Christian Bale and Katie Holmes, justifying their selection, good direction as well as extremely well selection of supporting cast, has made this movie a success.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Become The Fear,"It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.Batman Begins is the film that really brought back the superhero genre. Sure the X-Men films were darker and more realistic than previous comic book films but Batman Begins brought a whole new audience back to theaters. It's my least favorite of the trilogy but believe it or not it's still in my top 10 favorite films of all time. It's a brilliant origin story that gave us the beginnings of the greatest trilogy of all time, in my opinion. And without this film we wouldn't have had Inception. Christopher Nolan made these smart superhero films in order to gain studio trust to create his own ideas like Inception and Interstellar.For how great The Joker and Bane are in this trilogy it's Ra's Al Ghul that gets overlooked the most. Liam Neeson is at his best and gave Ra's depth. He's truly terrifying because he's the type of villain that believes what he's doing is actually good for people and he's not the typical twirl your mustache evil villain. That's what this film and the trilogy did so well, it gave layers to each of it's characters and is by far the most intelligent superhero franchise.What's fascinating is that you don't see Batman until nearly an hour in, but it's not less intense because of it. It's beautifully written and paced so that audiences are on the edge of their seats even without anything really happening on screen. It be wrong not to mention Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow as it was the first time he put on the mask. They perfectly brought Scarecrow from the comic book pages to the big screen without making his character seem too comic-booky. Batman villains are hard to make appealing to a mass audience but Christopher Nolan perfected it.Rachel was perhaps miscast and I may be one of the few people who actually prefer Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance over Katie Holmes any day. But she is serviceable for being a completely made up character. It's fascinating to watch Bruce' struggle to overcome his fear and his haunting tragic past. It's even better going back and watching the film after you have seen the entire trilogy because of how many things tie into each other. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were great in the supporting roles and Christian Bale truly shined.So in all Batman Begins may be the worst of the trilogy but still a masterpiece of a film. It brought back the genre in a way previous films failed. It gave us the most realistic look at a character who most thought could only thrive on the pages of comic books. After all who could forget the easter egg at the end?+Brought back the genre+Paved the way for Nolan's forthcoming films+Dark, gritty, and realistic+Well acted film all around+Hans Zimmer's score!!!+Ending easter egg10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"After realizing the corruption that exists within his home city, billionaire Bruce Wayne decides to become a mysterious vigilante","He's a billionaire. He is the heir to a very successful private enterprise, and he is devastatingly terrified of bats. Ever since falling down into a bat-infested cave, the bat has been the symbol of his dread. Following the murder of his parents, Bruce Wayne went in search of a way to stand up and fight the injustice in his city, living among criminals in Asia. While in prison, he meets a mysterious man named Rah's Al Guhl, who offers him a way to fight the world's corruption through a special type of training. When he realizes that the brand of justice is not the same as his own, Wayne returns to Gotham, and he does not like what he finds. Utilizing the training he had received, as well as the resources from Wayne Enterprise's Applied Sciences division, Bruce puts on the cowl and cape that we know and love, and he sets out to defend the city that his father worked so hard to preserve. The Caped Crusader has appeared in comic books and other mediums for decades, and the quest for a permanent success in a film portrayal was very elusive. Though Batman (1984) was a relative success, the failure in the projects that followed were enough to drown out this spark of triumph. The infamous Bat-nipples and such were too much for comic book geeks and the general public to handle. Thankfully, a new director named Christopher Nolan, who had just come off of a successful project called Memento (2000), took up the reins of the DC Comics icon. With the release of Batman Begins, the once depressingly faulty franchise was up to par with a more contemporary success, Sam Raimi's Spiderman. In contrast to what the previous films in the Batman franchise brought to the screen, this installation brought some major pieces: great themes, realistic action sequences, and depth to the main character(s). With a notably darker portrayal of Gotham's hero, this movie was a breakthrough for superhero flicks, and it has been a heavy influence on those hero movies that followed it. The only aspect of the film that the Academy recognized was the cinematography, which definitely deserved such attention. It was the sequel, The Dark Knight, which grabbed the most attention for Oscar categories. The biggest difference in this Batman movie is the themes. While the previous films tried to capture the cartoonish, comic book essence of the character, this one was as realistic as a fictional hero story can be. Tackling deep themes like redemption, rebirth, and standing up for one's beliefs, Batman Begins is much more than men in tights saying ""POW"" and ""BAM"". On a negative note, the acting is not quite up to par with the rest of the film's quality. Though it is not the worst acting in a Batman movie (see Batman & Robin), it is not the most well performed film either. Though this is the predecessor to the best superhero movie of all time, The Dark Knight, I strongly suggest that any interested viewer see this film first, as each of Nolan's trilogy plays off of the other films. Just make sure that you keep in mind that this isn't really as family-oriented as the Marvel movies (Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.). This is the grownup's turn to appreciate the Caped Crusader.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Thats bat-tastic!!!!,"This is a review for the Blu-ray version. As it was stated by many reviews already, you know this is a darker more brooding Batman than any of the previous films. Christian Bale is perfectly cast as the Dark Knight and is easily the best Batman there has been. Liam Neeson (Ducard) is excellent as the sensei/villain, and Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes) brings her ""girl next door"" charm as the love interest. Cillian Murphy is frightfully creepy as the Scarecrow/Dr Johnathan Crane. The Blu-ray version of this movie is definitely the way to go. Unsurpassed picture quality and superb audio make this the definitive version to own, it makes a great movie even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Missed opportunity,"A movie of grand proportions but few recognizable human characters, Batman Begins is yet another example of modern Hollywood: make it bigger, louder, faster, pricier- and worse. Christian Bale makes an interesting Bruce Wayne, although he becomes a husky-voiced cypher with the batsuit on (but let's face it, anybody's going to look ridiculous wearing a suit of armor, cape and pointy ears). Michael Caine brings an understated passion to his portrayal of Alfred, the ultimate sidekick- although a proper English butler with a Cockney accent is a bit distracting. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are fine as always; hopefully, though, their much better work in much better movies isn't overshadowed by this newfound success with the popcorn crowd. On the other hand, the movie is burdened with lots of ""what-the-heck-is-this"" performances- most notably, Tom Wilkinson as an Italian crime boss portrayed badly by a British stage actor, and Katie Holmes as a grownup (stick with Dawson's Creek, honey). And finally, Cillian Murphy (the Scarecrow, a guy with a bag on his head)and Liam Neeson (a guy with a phony goatee nearly on his head), as two of the least threatening movie villains ever. Hey Cillian, nice costume- what's the matter, was your ""scary ghost"" outfit at the cleaners?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An Oscar worthy welcome back to Gotham,"I loved Batman Begins. I was reluctant to see it at first, but I'm glad I did. This movie saved the series from the downfall it was doomed for thanks to Batman & Robin. It brought back the darkness of the story, and there was a lot of drama and twists this time around that kept me on the edge of my seat.Unlike George Clooney in the last movie, who simply PLAYED Bruce Wayne/Batman, Christian Bale WAS Bruce Wayne/Batman from the faces he made from scene-to-scene to the dark sultry sound of his voice. He was plagued by his parents' death, and you could feel his anger and determination towards Gotham's shaky situation. I won't name everyone from the main cast, but Cillian Murphy does an excellent eccentric. This was a good role to remember him for. This cast was the best of the five movies.Good job, Mr. Nolan!

Another masterpiece by Nolan,"**Review of ""Batman Begins""****Rating: 9/10**""Batman Begins"" is a remarkable reboot that redefined the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's direction, coupled with a compelling script, provides a gritty and realistic take on the origins of Batman. The film delves into Bruce Wayne's journey from a tormented orphan to the caped crusader, exploring his motivations and fears in a way that previous films had not.Christian Bale's performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman is exceptional. He brings a depth and intensity to the character that makes his transformation believable and compelling. The supporting cast, including Michael Caine as the loyal Alfred, Liam Neeson as the enigmatic Ra's al Ghul, and Gary Oldman as the earnest Jim Gordon, all deliver outstanding performances that elevate the film.The film's tone is darker and more grounded than its predecessors, which works to its advantage. Gotham City feels like a real place, plagued by corruption and crime. The cinematography and production design contribute to this sense of realism, creating a visually stunning backdrop for the story.Hans Zimmer's score is another highlight, perfectly capturing the film's mood and adding to the overall intensity. The action sequences are well-choreographed and thrilling, but it's the character development and story that truly make ""Batman Begins"" stand out.While the film is nearly perfect, it does have a few minor flaws. Some of the action scenes, particularly those involving hand-to-hand combat, can be a bit hard to follow due to the quick editing. Additionally, the pacing occasionally feels uneven, with certain sections dragging slightly.Despite these minor issues, ""Batman Begins"" is a triumph. It successfully reboots the Batman franchise, laying the groundwork for what would become one of the greatest trilogies in cinema history. For fans of the character and newcomers alike, this film is a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best comic-book movie ever made,"Batman Begins is the best comic-book movie ever made.Intelligently written, action-packed, yet with a surprising number of talking-heads scenes that make us care about the pyrotechnics later. But those pyrotechnics are not all CGI effects so much as they are feats of daring on a human scale. And that's what makes Batman Begins so winning.Since Batman is a mortal, a superhero without superpowers, the enemies are human too; no gimmicky Joker or Penguin, et al; no witty Gene Hackman in Superman, but scary Liam Neeson in a strong physical role. Ten-year-olds will be bored; this is a comic book movie for grown-ups, and it finally works. And with this movie, Christian Bale becomes a household name, he's that good (and looks great!).Highest praises to Christopher Nolan and the creative team that brought this artwork to fruition.

Batman the Psycho,"The best part of this movie is they finally got the correct casting for Batman this time. They finally chose Christian Bale the man who played ""American Psycho"" and another Orwell kind of movie, ""Equilibrium"".It makes me think they finally got it right for once! Val Kilmer looks like a comedian rather than Batman, George Clooney looked too cool to be a Batman, and others who played the role just doesn't have that chemistry. Michael Keaton as Batman looks too coward and not dark enough and not even close to being athletic.This is the first in a series that finally concentrate on Batman as the real actor instead of the villain. There were many twists and surprises in the casting and this added a great dimension. I mean Morgan Freeman who played Seven, is great in dark horror movie films that required serious tone, while Liam Neeson played well from his Star Wars Episode I. The big surprise that was Gary Oldman playing the good guy for once, really difficult viewing him because you are so use to him playing ""Dracula"" or some guy to destroy earth in the movie ""The Fifth Element"". Go this Oldman, I don't know if I should cheer him or be careful of him. He is the nervous element in the movie.The movie is somewhat good in tone, but could have improved on the theme of ""Big Brother"", which is a big serious topic in the internet world of New World Order. So the crime scene, the Mafia thing is a bit overdone, but I can take it. The fight sequences were too dark and could not see who is fighting who. The beginning sequences was sloppily done somewhat and the story was a bit too broken with flashback while he is training in the Himalayans. Because of some touches in the movie to New World Order, it would not be surprising that the mainstream media won't like the movie anyway, but most viewers will.Other than this the movie has a great display of realism and special effects was done well enough to believe that it was real enough for the general viewing. The psycho element and realism of Batman is done better than all the previous Batman because all the previous ones were over-the-top.The terrorism of destroying Gotham just doesn't add as to the realism of motive. Most motives in reality is that terrorism is either state- sponsored or a major corporation or consortium is behind the economic gains rather than some wild-eyed crazy religious (or philosophy) as this movie would indicate. Well, who am I to blame? Newspapers been doing that all the time and blaming on the patsy like Lee Harvey Oswald.However, it would have been much more realistic if economic gains were behind the destroying Gotham. An example is the series of James Bond 007 such as the movie Goldfinger.The writers did a good job however in showing the Wayne Enterprises' President were somehow behind the entire ""terrorist act"". Yes, you need TONS of money to finance terrorism and only corporate or state funding is needed for this kind of scale of terrorism.It is somehow eerily portrayed to remind you that the World Trade Center, as the train goes to hit the Wayne Enterprise building for a massive blow up of the city's water supply center. The writing could have been much more interesting if there were a clearer tie up to the President of Wayne Enterprise to be behind the entire fiasco and corruption that Batman and the owner of Wayne Enterprises tries to defend. However, this is the best Batman movie I have ever watched and I can stand the slow and choppy beginning and this can be overlooked on the strength of Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman. I do not like the casting of Rachel, she looks like a child to play the part, but this again can be overlooked. Near perfect movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Could be the start of a new series of Batman films...,"Although this film was a refreshing break from the previous two films, it is still mostly lacking when compared to the two Tim Burton productions. Not being a fan of the Batman comics, I can't really say whether or not this film is consistent with the comics, it is fair to say this film tries in no way to tie in to the original Batman film. Many characters are too young or too old, and various plot events are inconsistent between the two films. A surprise character reference is made in this film that could mean Batman Begins is the start of a new series...Christian Bale delivers a Batman that is much as refined and ambitious as Clooney, and also as violent and dark as Val Kilmer, although still not as good as Keaton. Katie Holmes pulled a surprisingly strong character into this film, and Gary Oldman plays a very convincing, although somewhat more active, Sergent Gordon.

"The best Batman film to date (including ""The Dark Knight"")","To be honest, I wasn't exactly wowed by ""Batman Begins"" when I first saw it during its original theatrical run. Sure, I enjoyed it but I didn't feel that it lived up to the hype. Recently I watched it again and was pleasantly surprised with how it compares to the other Batman films.Let's begin with the cast. This is hands down the best cast ever assembled for a Batman film. Christian Bale was a fine choice for the caped crusader as he can handle both the physical and emotional demands of the character. Liam Neeson always delivers a top-notch performance and he certainly doesn't disappoint here. Cillian Murphy makes for a great villain and it's a real treat to have Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman in supporting roles. It doesn't even stop there; you've got the likes of Rutger Hauer & Tom Wilkinson as well. Too bad Maggie Gyllenhaal hadn't yet replaced Katie Holmes, though.This 'reboot' takes the story back to the beginning. We see the events that shape Bruce Wayne into Batman. As in the best superhero films there is a certain thrill of excitement as we see the hero coming to grips with their powers and then putting them to the test. Overall, I think that the plot line here was quite satisfying as it managed to bring the franchise back to a more realistic place (though it is a heightened reality, to be sure).Nolan's direction is well-handled but, as I've said before and will say again, I think that Nolan's reputation stems more from astute taste in selection of projects than in actual technical skill. The Hans Zimmer/James Newton Howard score is also ably handled though it's no match for Danny Elfman's iconic score for the Tim Burton incarnation.Having also watched both ""Batman"" & ""The Dark Knight"" in the last year I feel confident in designating this film as the best of the lot.

another summer disappointment,"I finally saw BB and was expecting great things from the reviews it received last summer. While not a bad film, it didn't have that dynamite punch you expect from a film touted as a summer blockbuster. I found the very beginning confusing and it took me 40 minutes in till I started finding it entertaining and not boring. The beginning is from the title, it shows how Bruce Wayne trained to become a deadly fighter with a secret organization. He goes back to Gothem after being gone years to rid the city of crime. Rachel, the girl he had a crush on, is an assistant DA and one of the few that has not been bought by the mob. The movie shows how Bruce developed the bat suit, mobile,and weapons. And of course he must battle the surprise (though he was gone/dead) villains at the end who want to destroy Gotham with a chemical that makes people crazy.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not that great story you need to be a big hit. Spiderman was much better with how they showed the hero obtaining super hero moves.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

1st is still the best,"The movie was OK, just that okay.

The first Batman with Michael Keaton is still the best of the series of these. He looked better, acted better and gave of a better air, aura of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. elements of the first should've been incorporated into this version as well, as it was the most successful.

batman begins- based on a true story,"The problem with many, many superhero films in this day and age is that with each and every single one, the fantasy element seems to decrease. there is a worrying amount of realism applied to these films. lotr, the star wars trilogy, the matrix, even sin city, were all excellent because the film makers crafted a thoroughly believable fantasy world that absorbed us. batman begins sucks because it is based entirely within the real world (gotham city could just as well be new york, LA, even London or Paris).when in reality, if a guy dresses up in a rubber suit, as a 'bat', and starts to fight crime, he'd be arrested for being a pervert/ vigilante or both, and would get sent down to the loony bin for life.many fans of comic books, or 'geeks', as i like to call them, have got to understand that comic books exist as pure fantasy and nothing else. I have noticed, esp. since harry Knowles aicn, that a lot of emphasis has come into making super hero films real and dramatic. Could you imagine if the lotr or star wars trilogy were treated as gritty dramas rather than the outstanding piece of genre film making that they are? Theyd be terrible.There is one scene in batman begins that seems especially ludicrous. commissioner Gordon (played by a wasted Gary oldman) is seen having a dead pan conversation with a guy dressed as a giant rubber bat, and doesn't seem to batter an eyelid. The scene is played out for real, and like the rest of the film we are expected to believe, without any clever twists, that this could really happen. When without all the explosions, action and SFX, the film would be nothing.If these 'geeks' want their fantasy films and nothing else, then so be it. If they want human drama, realism, plausibility mixed with the surreal, watch either classic 70s films such as taxi driver, clockwork orange, apocalypse now, day of the locust, David lynch films, or Japanese horrors such as uzumaki. a gritty drama about a giant rubber bat is kinda pushing things a bit too far.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

This allowed us to learn more about the history of the character.Major kudos to Bale who nails both ends of the character. He has the smug playboy nature of Bruce Wayne down pat (which shouldn't be a surprise after seeing him in American Psycho), but he also bring the intensity to the man behind the mask.

This first part homever is the less gory, has gore level 0, still being dark and not an all-kids-movie.Locations used for the movie just worked perfectly, acting by all the involved actors - Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and so on - was just brilliant.The music also gave it the right vibe.As the only unreal thing I've found was a threat towards the end which in real-life would have worked differently, This first part of the batman's journey was to me a great movie.

Time to begin again,"The previous incarnation of the Batman franchise crashed and burned upon release. I was self-hating enough to catch the truly abysmal Batman and Robin on the big screen in Summer 1997. My expectations were low, but I was still gobsmacked at how bad the movie was. So bad, in fact, that Warner let the franchise cool for 8 years before rebooting. It was a long time for a cash cow to lie dormant, but Batman and Robin really was THAT bad.Christopher Nolan brings the character out of the gaudy, cartoonish world of Joel Schumacher and into reality for the story of Batman's origin. I'm quite sick of every single comic-book hero getting an origin story instead of just throwing us in at the deep end. The 1989 Batman didn't bother with origins and was able to further the plot without it. Despite the 140 minute run-time the plot of Batman Begins is side-tracked and 'last minute' when compared to the rest. Everything builds up to the last act but there's no consistent hook. Nolan also does himself favors, as well as shooting himself in the foot, by the naturalization of the character. The gorgeous anamorphic Panavision photography looks absolutely stunning, but I do miss the oppressive, German expressionist vision Gotham from the Tim Burton movies.The wide cast of actors all do well with their roles, despite getting relatively little screen time between them, though I never felt close to any of them. As with all Nolan films they're all so serious and straight it's hard to see a real human being behind them. I only ever see them as a plot function and never anyone I can identify with or recognize. The film is just too slick and confident. There are no rough edges, which I think would have made it much grittier.It's a good film, and light years ahead of Schumacher's embarrassment, but it's not as brilliant as the sycophants proclaim it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Second Best of the Series,"It still doesn't beat Tim Burton's first film, but ""Batman Begins"" is better than the rest of the Batman movies to date. Christian Bale makes a terrific Bruce Wayne--he may be the best actor to have played him so far. And top-tier actors like Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, while maybe not greatly challenged by the material given them, still make the most of smaller roles.My biggest problem with this film was its structure. The first 20-25 minutes of the movie are actually quite boring; there's so much plot exposition and back story to work through that the film grinds to a halt trying to slog through it. However, once Bruce Wayne begins his actual transformation to Batman, it's as if someone flicked the power switch on and the movie takes flight. From that point forward, it's a lot of fun, dark and brooding, as Batman should be, but also full of that cheeky brand of humour common to comic books.There are many times when I wish the fight scenes had been more visible; director Chrisotpher Nolan shoots everything so close and edits everything so fast that you can't really see what's going on, a shame since there are plenty of opportunities for sensational fight choreography. But there's enough in this movie to like to make criticisms like this seem like afterthoughts.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins is AMAZING!,"Batman Begins is the best Batman movie. Christian Bale's performance was astounding. He makes batman a believable character.

He is the best and smartest director. He set up every part of the movie to perfection. He is very detailed and thats what makes this Batman better than all the others.

The character is really explored how some 8 year old rich boy becomes a lost vigilante to a symbol of fear.... and hope. Bruce Wayne is also perceived well in which his playboy lifestyle makes up most of the comic relief in the film. Alfred is played perfectly and Morgan Freeman also gives a great performance as Lucius Fox. As for The Scarecrow he is played quite well. Liam Nessan gives a great performance of Ducard/ Ra's Agul. Katie Holmes is questionable in her performance but she gets the job done. The special effects and sound are great and the action scenes superb.

This bold film explores the psychological ""push and pull"" of Bruce Wayne and his grand alter-ego.All-in-all, Batman is a detective dealing with some pretty hardcore criminals. Like Bruce, they are all consumed by their own psychological limitations and underpinings, but where the Dark Knight rises above the easy road of self-destruction, he fights to survive while defeating those who represent his own internal demons.Christian Bale has certainly made the best Batman to date and with such a phenomenal supporting cast, the movie was exemplary.I only hope that the story, theme, imagery and dark distortions will continue in future sequels.

I've been picturing Ed Norton in the role... he seems like he has the ability to go from quiet and scheming to absolutely insane in an instant - like the joker should.The Riddler: Jim Carrey's Riddler was awful, I think. This character needs to be portrayed more like he was in the animated series - extremely intelligent, calm and collected. Go with me on this one: David Hyde Pierece (Niles, from Frasier).

"A stunning reboot, but not just for Batman, for superhero films the world over.","Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" is an inspiring piece of work. A piece of work that shows us that superhero films can actually be great films, all they have to do is shy away from the more cartoonish childish style of the 90's. Nolan's Batman is a much darker Batman, just like his alter ego Bruce Wayne. In the public eye Bruce Wayne is a billionaire playboy. A man who has more money then he knows what to do with. But there is so much more to him then that. Christopher Nolan's Bruce Wayne is a damaged angry individual. A man who is constantly surrounded by rage because of the death of his parents. Nolan's idea of exploring the characters origins is what sets the tale apart from any other Batman in my eyes. By delving into Bruce Wayne's origins we (the audience) are able to understand the character more. We feel what Bruce Wayne feels and we understand what drives him to do what he does. Before Batman Begins I feared that superhero films were becoming extinct. Christopher Nolan has showed that Superhero films can survive in modern day cinema, they just have to learn to take themselves a little more seriously. If the upcoming film Batman Vs Superman (and the new DC universe overall) is a success, then a lot of it will be down to Christopher Nolan. His bold attempt at redefining Superhero story telling has been a massive success, and has set the ball rolling for Superheroes to creep out of the shadows and back on to the big screen.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Pretty standard addition to the saga, but at least it was entertaining","To say Batman Begins belongs in the top 250 is quite a stretch. While the film seemed to have few shortcomings, you just knew this would turn into some clich√© studio film that the masses would eat up.I will start with the good stuff. I will say, watching this film was pretty interesting, for this version of Gotham City is a little more colorful (yet subtle) than in previous movies (let's not even start about Batman Forever). I had doubts whether Christian Bale could hold his own in this film, but I guess anyone can be wrong on any given day. He does have a presence to him that is quite strong and focused, much in the same way Michael Keaton played Batman, who was tiring and strung out in his versions. The casting was pretty good, getting a wide swath of actors as opposed to the flavors of the month. I was especially happy to see Gary Oldman once again (this time in a normal costume), for you never know what kind of nuance you'll get with him in the picture.This sadly leads to the dreadful parts. Katie Holmes, Katie Holmes, Katie Holmes. Just like that waste of space, she was a waste of a perfectly good role. Sadly, Cillian Murphy barely existed in this film, and his character was a rather intriguing one. Another factor in the film that was completely clich√© and a juxtaposition of ""trendy"" film-making was the whole ninja shadow army (or whatever the heck they called themselves). I would have much rather preferred the whole battle with organized crime as opposed to the Shadow thing. The pacing wasn't that great, but it was starting to get too long I guess. And let's not forget the utter absurdity of the new Batmobile, which was ridiculous.Batman Begins will certainly make money, but hopefully they do a much more polished job on the next film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great Film,"Being a Batman buff, I wanted to see this movie from the time I saw the trailer. Actually the last films from the batman franchise weren't quite up to the mark. (And I am not even thinking of Batman and Robin). This film was a pleasant surprise. The settings in this movie tend to be dark and convey the depth of corruption in Gotham. Director Nolan (who is great at doing thrillers) sticks to the right attitude for this film. The cast is great and Bale was pretty convincing.Cillian Murphy was pretty cool.The film leaned more on the psychological aspect of Batman than on his physical prowess, which is the way I want it to remain. That's what makes it the most faithful in the franchise.(Tim Burton's original is also close, but Joker overshadowed Batman). Great film for Batman fans and even others would enjoy it.

Critical Update for  Age 19-24 Generation,"You know I have to try to watch my reviews and opinions of movies, cause they seem to change sometimes and sometimes they don't. For example when I saw the movie ""Saw"" I had not seen a good movie for some time, I was depressed, and easily excitable. I said that the movie was ""awesome"" and ""one of the best"". Later I ended up determining that Saw was one of the cheesiest movies of his kind, and used shock values to mess with my head, the movie clearly sucked. You know the same thing happened with ""Sideways."" I was depressed(real depressed), and ""Sideways"" was about a white guy who depressed like me and had a happy ending, so I liked it, now I hate ""Sideways""! But I think I can get it right with ""Batman Begins,"" that is only if I think carefully about what I am writing. First of all I don't want to give away the movie, unlike other movies in the franchise, this actually has a plot worth not spoiling via trailers and movie reviews; most are respecting that. The movie was dark, definitely something aimed away from a family environment into a more adult market, though I am sure there will be an amount of little ones seeing this only to be disappointed and scared stiff halfway through. The movie is clearly the story of batman, and batman's story owns all. Bale is the perfect batman, plain and simple; hopefully they use him again for (sigh) the sequels. And the movie was done almost completely old school 99.9%; all stunts, real explosions, and camera tricks. I loved this movie, but it has its problems (there seems to be a chunk of the movie missing, and there is not much to the scarecrow character after all)... I think it was rushed out by producers thinking with ""Episode III"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Island"", etc, that people will flock to see it now, compared to the fall. The truth is this movie is set up for a blockbuster record-setting situation that wont likely happen. I don't think it will flop WB, but no way in hell are people going to flock to see another batman movie, and once word of mouth flies about the type of movie it is (the grim nature of it), people are just going to wait to rent it. And I did state way above, you see very clearly, I loved this movie.. But you know that's me, I like dark movies with good endings... that sort of makes me retarded, but oh well, Ebert liked the movie too! The only bad thing I have to say about the movie is that it's not a new concept, Burton did the same thing (dark batman) almost 2 decades ago, and although this movie stomps Burton like a bug, Its not new; all your doing is making a new movie draft of the graphic novel version of batman(which is the real basis for this movie, not the 1939 comics). For that freshness factor I can't give this movie a 9 or a 10, and because of the a critical plot error I felt existed, I cant give it an 8 either. It's not new concept, but a critical refresh to the Batman for my generation (19-24) that Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher never could achieve. ""Momento"" director Christopher Nolan did well and the acting power never fell too short to bring the movie down. I recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Huge disappointment...,"I can't believe we waited 8 years for a Batman movie, and this is all they can come up with. This film is a complete mess, from the confused non-linear storytelling (whenever its convenient), to the amateur picture and sound editing, to the sloppy, distracting directing.I hate to say it, but I'd rather watch the Adam West version of Batman (which actually had some wit) or even the George Clooney/Joel Schumacher disaster, only because it provides SOME kind of entertainment (in a B Movie kind of way). This film is devoid of humour, wit, suspense, mystery or even drama. All scenes are clipped down to their climaxes, and we are never given a chance to catch our breath.Once again, we are given 3 (rather than 1) villains, which makes the film 1/3 as good as it could have been (no, not 3 times as good!), while it tries to cram 6 hours worth of story into one rushed 2 hours.It's cut together like a movie trailer, rather than a story, so you're never really 'inside' the plot. You don't feel the suspense, or even the moment-to-moment reality of what's happening. So many scenes come and go with no real contribution to the 'story' other than to 'update' you on what's happening with the characters at the moment (don't confuse that with a real story!).There are elements of the film--mostly superficial--that do work, but they barely register as a blip in this mess. Gary Oldman (our finest actor?) plays Sgt. Gordon to a 't', but his sub-plot doesn't allow for much of his 'man-on-the-inside' role that he provides in the comic. Ras-al-gul resembles the comic book version in name only, as he has somehow switched from an Arab to Liam Neeson as a samurai (!?!?).Looking back, the film should've focused on the Scarecrow (and maybe an earlier draft did; the original working title was Batman: Fear, and 'fear' seems to be the main theme of the piece). Cillian Murphy's unique features couldn't have been imagined by a comic artist. Like the re-created version in the animated series, Scarecrow actually looks scary, and uses a power that would've been more satisfying is he actually got to use it more. Katie Holmes is excellent, Morgan Freeman is fine, and Michael Caine is adequate (I'm not British, but his accent seems way off for Alfred).All in all, it seems that there MIGHT have been a good film in there somewhere, but it was simply ruined by last-minute editing and a soundtrack that seems like an afterthought ( usually the same boring song runs through several scenes in a row, reinforcing the 'movie trailer' feel). Then again, the weaknesses could lie with the most important creative choice of all: the writer.I don't know where David S. Goyer ever got the reputation as a good writer, but considering the only credits he has to his name are trash-film comic book adaptations, he must have another career as a playwright or a novelist. First he adapted Nick Fury for TV, which landed him the Blade trilogy. Blade, despite its unexplainable popularity, is typical dark fantasy/action movie garbage; all silver/blue colours, heavy metal soundtrack and 1 dimensional characters.I suppose the shareholders at Warner must've seen the numbers on Blade, because not only did they give him Batman, they also gave him the job of adapting the beloved Flash to the screen (God help us all).It just goes to show that Warner should've stuck with their original plan of letting Frank 'Sin City' Miller and Darren 'Pi' Aronofsky adapt 'Batman: Year One', but that would actually require them to base their decisions on talent rather than the (imagined) potential profits.Oh, well, another in a long line of comic book bombs, I suppose (after Elektra, Catwoman, Daredevil and Hulk, the future is already looking dark for superheroes). The sad thing is, the investors might look at the choice to let Christopher Nolan (Memento) to direct as a reason for its failure, and thus shy away from letting other 'indy' directors take on big budget superheroes. Sadly, this could mean the next Bat-film might star Will Smith and be directed by Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich.Where's Michael Keaton when you need him?3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins is the first installment in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. This movie a reboot after the colossal failure of Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin.,"This is a very good film and also one of my favorite Batman films, but it has it's bad moments as well. Of course I will start with the positives before I have to bash the film a little bit. Firstly I thought The whole cast, excluding Katie Holmes, did a very good job in their roles. Especially standing out to me was Cillian Murphy who made his supporting role into a top notched villain. Gary Oldman was fantastic as usual, taking the role he is given and taking it to the limits. Also the special effects were well done with little to no CGI to be seen through out the film. And what the film has to say about heroes in general is very interesting to me and are expanded in the next film.Now the things that did not work in this film that brought down what could have been a perfect film. First Scarecrow is not used to his full potential. I would really like to see more of this villain, but that might be a nitpick. A lot of people seem to not like Katie Holmes and I would be lying if I said I didn't have a few problems myself. She's just not that good, in my opinion, if anyone else enjoys her in the movie then that's completely fine. Also some of the lines in this movie are kind of cheesy I wont list any because I don't like spoiling any movie for those who have not seen it. Also the twist at the end is not the best, I'm not going to say what it is but I could see it coming from a mile away.Over all though this movie is a great Batman movie that picked the franchise that had been killed in 1997 and brought new respect to the Batman name.

My New Favorite Comic Book Movie,"To me, Batman is the most mysterious superhero there is. We know about Superman's past. It has a TV show. I was very pleased to see how Batman became what he is.

At least five people told him to shut up in unison.I did expect this to be good because there was so much speculation and buzz on it. I was excited to see if it was really good as it turned out. It now ranks with the Spider-Mans and Elektra as my favorite adapted movies.The direction of this film was spectacular as was the screen writing. I'm hoping that different people aren't brought in for the possible sequel/remake that is suggested at the end of the movie. The acting is also good. The Batman that was chosen was a great choice.

Again anther great actor Michael Caine plays royal butler Alfred he's not just butler here Caine plays him solid and he has more screen time then Michael Gough. (Gough played Alfred in the four previous movies) Great acts just adding this film and Gary Oldman plays Lt Jim Gordon soon to be commissioner of Gotham City, Gordon looks like just like in Batman: Year One by Frank Miller.Bruce (Bale) travels the world but captured and he is in prisoned he is saved by Henri Ducard (Liam Nesson) says he works for Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) called League of Shadows Wayne visits Ducard and Ra's Wayne is stopped by Ducard asked questions by Ra'S he is beaten by Ducard in a fight Wayne trains with League of Shadows when Ra's Al Ghul tells Bruce that Gotham has to be destroyed and he has ex cute a man too but Bruce rejects and sets everything on fire fire saves Ducard falling of a cliff.Bruce returns to Gotham met by Alfred, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) Katie plays DA Assisant and sees Wayne Enterprises taken by Richard Earle (Rutger Hauer) and meets Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) in the science department of Wayne Enterprises that's he gets Tumbler (Batmaobile) and other gadgets from. Batman stops Gotham mob boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) and Cillian Murphy plays Doctor Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. 9/10 I can't for a sequel.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Legend of the Batman who he is and how he came to be!,When I first saw the trailers and read the reviews I was skeptic about this movie. Ra's Al Ghul training Bruce Wayne? amongst other concerns namely Michael Caine playing Alfred. However when I first saw it the movie clicked for me I sat back and watched a Legend Begin. The acting is first rate and the story fit within the accepted origin of Batman.Of course Hollywood being Hollywood they do make changes and they are acceptable changes. They actually add to the movie in small ways. Michael Caine is excellent as Alfred he delivers a strong fatherly performance and Liam Neesan is nothing short of great as Henri Duchard a man with a incredible hidden agenda. Inspired casting Gary Oldman as James Gordon. Christian Bale is now firmly entrenched in my mind as Batman. I hope the Dark Knight is just as good as this one or better.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Dark and Serious Sounding and Looking Take on the Legend,"""Batman Begins"" is a mostly effective, serious retelling of what is now a legend as a dark, post 9/11 rumination on fear, vengeance and justice. This Batman's approach could be a third way between the Jedi and the Sith as a catharsis for angst.While the opening scenes in the Mysterious Orient that probably appeal more to comic book readers at first seem exaggeratedly confusing, director/co-writer Christopher Nolan integrates them with pregnant flashbacks and superb production design, particularly through the recurring visual motif of bats.The attention to visual and aural detail is marvelous, including the triggering, Faust story opera that young Wayne attends (Arrigo Boito's ""Mefistofele"") with additional references later on to the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"".Visually, this Gotham integrates the grit and spookiness of different types of special effects from ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""28 Days Later. . .,"" and ""Escape from New York"" to create a complete environment. The sardonic script even gives some thought to the future of cities, from the senior Wayne's philanthropic focus on building a mass transit system to ""Bruce"" paralleling Abraham's debate with God as to whether Sodom and Gomorrah are worth saving, and evidently Gotham can put together a minyan.Christian Bale is a key factor in grounding the film in psychological realism, as he makes ""Bruce Wayne""'s step-by-step, guilt-ridden choices build up believably. He is also charming as he creates the alter-ego of a carefree playboy. We only get too few glimpses of just how much he bulked up and worked out after ""The Machinist,"" but his personal trainer deserves his line in the credits.Also keeping a foot in realism are the sword fights that eschew the popular tricks from Asian films for more refreshingly old-fashioned swashbuckling, though the final fight, with a twist on ideological enemies I hadn't anticipated, went on a bit too long even if the points it makes are intellectual.The casting choices are both an added strength and distracting weakness, particularly the selections of mostly actors from the British Isles. Third time's the charm for Liam Neeson as a sword-wielding mentor compared to his not quite credible takes on that role in ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" maybe because here his character ends up more complex.Michael Caine is simply great as a play on the British military officer's assistant definition of batman with an added, warm, father figure element.Cillian Murphy is devious without camping up his evil psychiatrist. When he lets loose with one cackle it's a charmer and he uses those beautiful baby blues to creepy effect.But that wonderful actor Tom Wilkinson is not only miscast as a gangster, it's a bit pathetic that the fictional Gotham's underground is run by clich√© imitation ""The Sopranos,"" regardless of fealty to the old comics. Gary Oldham seemed wasted as a ground-down by corruption cop.As to the Americans, Morgan Freeman gets to twinkle a bit more ironically as a mentor than in ""Unleashed."" Katie Holmes has no chemistry with Bale but at least she seems earnest. From other parts of the world, Ken Watanabe and Rutger Hauer are underused.I did get lost on some plot points about the key weapon, but it's cool looking without understanding its parameters and it's enough that it has to do with light and dark.The music is mediocre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Worst Interpretation of Batman Ever,"A lot would argue that ""Batman and Robin"" was the worst Batman movie of the whole series, and that is something I have to agree on. However I feel ""Batman Begins"" is the worst interpretation of Batman ever. I admit I was not too happy with the reinterpretation that occurred with ""Batman Forever"" but that I could live with because there was still a lot of amusing and visual elements to it that made it watchable. ""Batman Begins"" on the other hand is heavy handed and a little too much so to the point that it becomes abysmal and practically unwatchable early on in the first act. I found it becoming tedious with Bale delivering lines like an automaton and even though I think he's a good actor and liked him in other roles, he just wasn't Batman and did not fit the role well enough. As for seasoned actors Freeman, Oldman, and Caine popping in this mish mesh I have no idea what on earth they were thinking. They just made it more grating to bear. Caine has a lot of cred and has been in many superior films but it was actually depressing watching him tread through this sloppy disjointed sludge. He needs to retire. And the less mentioned about the dreadful and miscast Katie Holmes aka Mrs. Cruise the better. I think this was very much catered to the current MTV generation with extremely short attention spans and little imagination. This movie did not amuse or fancy me the way previous Batman films did. In fact it did not entertain me in that way at all, and for that reason I found it to be without value whatsoever. I say why even bother making a Batman film that is so abysmally dull and dim.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins is amazing,"This is definitely the best batman film ever. Forget the former neon lights, silly lines, and wildly dressed bad guys. This is the Batman movie that we've all been waiting for! The other Batman films are indeed fun, but Batman Begins is above them all. This one is dark, intriguing, exciting, and simply amazing. In other words, it is everything that the original Batman (comic book) was originally made out to be. In other words, if you were disappointed with the former Batman movies or even if you liked them, you should definitely see Batman Begins. Your views will change forever. This is who Batman was, should've been, and who he will be from now on. Batman Begins is the only batman film who finally gets it right.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"BEST FILM OF 2005, Tops my top 5 list now.","I was lucky enough to attend the midnight showing of Batman Begins, and from walking away from it, I have to say ""wow"". Words can't describe how beautiful of a film this is, for in the land of superhero movies, it not only blows away the Spiderman series, but practically every superhero movie that I've grown up with. This is the best Superhero film ever made.But maybe saying Superhero is a little off. Batman's more of a vigilante then a superhero. Sure it's a comic book superhero movie all around, but don't get me wrong, this is not a film you want to take the young ones too. It's dark, it's violent at times, and it's very moody. There's a lot of thematic elements in this film, including how Bruce Wayne deals with the death of his parents.The film opens with Bruce Wayne (played by Christain Bale) in a prison. He's there not because he's necessarily done anything wrong, but because he's studying the criminal mind. He's in a foreign country that is never explained, but it doesn't need to be explained. After getting in a street brawl with six goons at the prison, he's thrown in a solitary confinement cell, where Henry Ducard (Liam Neeson) begins to talk to him, telling him that he can train him.The first hour of the film is about the events that lead up to Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. They explain how he got the toys, what he's going to do, and why he's doing it.The real stand out role here isn't of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, but as Batman. The first night he goes out as Batman is probably the biggest and greatest scene I've seen in a movie. I love Michael Keaton, but Bale just blows him away in this performance. He even has the different voice down.There's a major plot twist at the end of the movie, and unless your a Batman junkie like myself, you will probably be surprised.Cillian Murphy does a fantastic job as Dr. Jonathan ""The Scarecrow"" Crane. Although he's not in the film a ridiculous amount of time, the film isn't centered on the villains, like the previous four films. It's also not outlandish, cartoonish, or down right stupid. None of the lines in the film were stupid to me, and the script felt like it was masterfully written.In fact the cast alone did a outstanding job. Even Katie Holmes (who plays Rachael Dawson) I thought did good, despite getting bad press for this film.The other real big stand out here though is Michael Cane. I love Michael Gough in the other four Batman films as Alfred, but Michael Cane just makes this so real, he's so caring and loving, you just love him.One other performance I'll mention is that of Gary Oldman who plays Sargent Jim Gorden. We all know later he's the Commishioner, but man he looks just like the comic books, and he speaks with the elegance you would expect of him. Outstanding.So will Batman Begins win any awards? I doubt it. Superhero films are snubbed year after year. But this year I really hope that the Academy has the imagination to look at some of the performances in this film, especially that of Christian Bale.Batman Begins easily goes down as not only the best super hero movie ever made, but one of the best films of 2005, if not, the BEST FILM OF 2005! I urge anyone to go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A solid reboot for the Dark Knight franchise,"Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" is a welcome return to the Dark Knight's origins. From the snow swept opening in the East to the dark Gotham conclusion, this is a visual masterpiece.Christian Bale is the perfect Bruce Wayne / Batman. Bale plays darkly tortured characters perfectly and he seems born to play this superhero. He's a much more satisfying Batman than his predecessors, looking like he could really handle himself in a difficult situation.Michael Caine is a very satisfying Alfred, conveying real emotion in the part. Caine is also very amusing, making the most of the script wherever he can.There's a wealth of talent involved in the film, from Liam Neeson's Ducard to Gary Oldman's Gordon. Katie Holmes is slightly disappointing as Rachel Dawes but Cillian Murphy is top-notch as The Scarecrow.8 out of 10. One of the best superhero movies out there and arguably the best ""Batman"" to-date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I loved all of Christopher Nolan's Batman films,"I am a lifelong Batman fan. I grew up watching the 80s and 90s films, loved the 60s tv show and have a subscription to DC comics online. I remember this came out my senior year of high school and it blew everyone away. The Dark Knight trilogy broke ground in the comic world and attracted a ton of acting talent, had amazing stunts and interesting technology. It combined various Batman comics. It made social commentary and made you think without being political. The only thing I didn't like was the growling voice Bale did while in the suit that got old sometimes but the villains were always scary, realistic and well acted. They were all critical and financial successes and also got nominated for Academy Awards. Even after a decade they still hold up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great movie,"I also had reservations for it since i wasn't really a fan of batman to begin with and all of this franchise business is going from bad to worse with the exception of star war III. Comparing it to Superman Returns i must admit that Batman Begins is way better! The atmosphere really surrounds you, when it's emotional you are emotional and when it's active you are active. Encircled in this atmosphere you feel part of the movie and for two hours you leave your current life and become the Batman!! Also you learn about the history of Batman as the movie suggests Batman begins. Only one thing i would like to see is a bit more detail on how the suit is made and selected however i take into consideration that they would either have to make it two movie to contain all the details or one long one with data missing... they opt the latter.Truly amazing movie that to say the least surprised me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
To the point to Batman spirit,"That's how super heroes should be, a bit relatable to human beings, not somebody from the other world itself or a product of science experiment.The way Batman character came into being was amazing.

Batman de-mystified. Not necessarily the tour de force some critics are calling it,"I liked this movie. Christian Bale. as many others will tell you. seems a perfect fit for the role. The supporting cast, while not having a Jack Nicholson, are very impressive and perform as expected. I don't see this film as better than the 1989 version though. Just as Batman is now shown to have more realism and humanity as a fully fleshed out character, so are the villains. Nobody in this film is larger than life, including Bale, and things seem to be pulled away from the comic book roots. The villains are sort of a lukewarm bunch, not poorly acted, but not particularly scary or menacing and when they get their just desserts, they seem a lot more like just criminals than the personification of evil. And for all the menace of the Batman persona I am not sure I recall seeing a drop of blood except in an early scene involving Bruce Wayne prior to Batman. He is ""dark"", to be sure, but mostly just knocks out the bad guys or ties them up much like the campy Adam West character. The audience wasn't cheering when the bad guys paid the price, and in fact, nobody seemed to much care. I also found the movie a bit slow to get started, but that might be because I was subconsciously comparing it to Burtons first. I could live with the pace, because the character had to be thoroughly introduced as this will be the first of several new Batman films. BUT to rate better than a 7 with me the bad guys have to actually be EVIL, and Batman has to be willing to want to do more than just arrest people. Michael Keaton was a scarier customer than the new guy, and seemed to me to be truer to the comic book origins.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A definitive Batman film.,"This to me is THE definitive Batman film.Brooding and dark, Nolan gave Batman a revitalization it needed after WB/Schumacher's god- awful Batman & Robin.We get a darker and more serious toned Batman along with a fine performance from Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He's more fleshed out in this film more so than the previous incarnations of Batman on screen. Bale embodies everything I wanted in a Bruce Wayne. He's not wearing a mask when he's Batman, but he is when he's Bruce Wayne. Something that hasn't been really dived into, with the exception of Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, as it sort of was.Here we understand why Bruce Wayne is doing what he's doing and why he's out there putting himself on the line to beat criminals to a pulp with everything he knows. Batman Begins is also told in a nonlinear narrative. We get a series of flashbacks that develop Bruce's persona. We also get a Batman that fully utilizes his detective skills and his gadgets are very impressive. Almost real world like. Very little cgi in this film, almost everything is practical.Speaking of real world like, Nolan completely nails the tone of the film. It's grounded and works perfectly for a character like Batman.The supporting cast is excellent. Gary Oldman, Michael Cain, and Morgan Freeman are all spot on as Bruce Wayne/Batman's allies. Finally we have a Commissioner Gordon that is faithfully represented unlike the previous installments. Gordon does a lot more than just calling Batman for help, he actually dives into the action working Batman. Oldman is the perfect Gordon and it's very hard to imagine another actor in that role. Alfred is a lot more fleshed out as well, Michael Cain and Nolan bring more of a father figure role and is more than just a butler. Morgan Freeman provides the humor and levity of the film as Lucius Fox, who supplies Wayne's toys.I think out of all the villains in Nolan's almost perfect trilogy, the one who is overlooked is Liam Neeson's Ra's al Ghul. Nesson's portrayal is very underrated. He plays that mentor role to Bruce very well and he's not a typical evil villain, rather a villain who really believes that he's doing the right thing by destroying Gotham City as it's infested with crime. Something he and Bruce do not see eye to eye: killing. Cillian Murphy is awesome as Dr. Crane otherwise known as Scarecrow. Every moment with the Scarecrow is gold and it's a shame he's nothing more than just as ""pawn,"" as Batman puts it. Tom Wilkinson also has a sharp supporting role as Carmine Falcone a powerful mob boss and I even enjoyed Mark Boone Junior as Gordon's corrupt partner Detective Flass.The action scenes involving the Batman's vehicle the tumbler is exciting, but I cannot say the same for the hand to hand fight sequences. Batman's extraordinary martial arts are exploited as well as they could be. There's too much shaky cam and you can't tell who or what is happening. I felt only small amounts of chemistry between Katie Holmes and Christian Bale. I liked some of Holmes's performance, but like Kirsten Dunst in Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man film, where Holmes's character Rachel declares her love for Bruce, it's very awkward and kinda bland. Almost uncomfortable to watch.With a strong lead, and a supporting cast, solid script by David S. Goyer, and under the direction of Christopher Nolan, this is the Batman film I've been waiting for.9.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
On the brink of great but....,"This film could have been better on so many levels. The dialogue was full of terrible Hollywood blockbuster one liners and comic relief....that pretty much ruined the movie that I had extremely high hopes for. Batman has casual conversations with the other cast members in certain scenes. The fight scenes are so vague and opaque that the audience can't track who's hitting who and what's going on. It's a shame, because the scenes with Bruce Wayne really shined. If you are all about the film being very close to the comic book, you will really enjoy it. If you are below the age of 16, you will probably love it. Hollywood has once again infected one of my director hopefuls. I guess the only hope we can have left is Quentin T. who still seems to be making original pictures with great dialogue. *sighs* Cillian Murphy is pretty good, Michael Caine is one of the owners of the one liners, Gary Oldman is underused and very subtle. Katie Holmes is in the film too much. Liam was very good. Christian Bale, my favorite actor was great as Bruce Wayne, but has only one scene in which he really shines as the Batman, when he is expressively angry. It's probably the only scene with any sort of depth and emotion in the whole film. I believe 2 more pictures are supposed to spring from this, I hope they are better. I'd rather see the first Tim Burton Batman than this one. I think the biggest problem is that most of the emotion of the film is in the first 30-40 minutes. The cinematography is very good, and the lighting used vast amounts of natural light. The audience needed more shots from Batman's subjective point of view.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"I wanted to like it, honestly!","I wanted to like it, honestly!I've been a huge Batman Fan all my life. And yes I still have a copy of Batman Year One. Love it. But unfortunately....Take a seemingless endless budget, and all¬ñstar cast, great special effects, set design, costume design, and add in a monkey for a script writer / director. What do you get? A movie a bunch of hopefull Batman fans go to, and end up grimacing at every line of dialog. You get a movie that is trying hard to be a psychological thriller, but seems to have been written by a 8 year old. The movie lacks any consistency, and any real understanding of what it is trying to do. By then end of the movie, you are stuck wondering , what the bleep was the point of any of this!?!??! You get a beautiful to watch, yet, literally painful to follow mess.What happened? In earlier Batman movies Burton went for a more campy vision of Batman.Well the fans wanted something darker, something along the lines for the more realistic ""Batman: Year One"". So Hollywood decides to cash in on another attempt at Batman, in the height of the whole Comic book movie craze. And someone decided this meant diving into Bruce Wayne's psyche, and showing his ""transition"" to Batman. In Burton's Batman, they just showed enough of a story we all know and let us settle the rest in our imagination. In Nolan's version everything is so blatant yet not thought out enough to stop it from completely contradicting itself. We are beat over the head again and again with Wayne's inner conflicts. There are several excellent ideas throughout the fill that just keep falling flat on their face, either because of not getting fleshed out properly, or just simply from contradicting themselves. Little about the movie makes any sense, from the characters philosophies, to training with live metal swords and no head gear.Burton's movies were at least consistent. They worked within themselves, creating a world that gelled together. He stayed true to his vision of Batman, and came up with some solid, consistent movies.With Batman begins, expect to go from a great scene, to sitting there and just thinking, what the bleep did I just see. The scenes with a child Bruce Wayne are just painfully bad. Expect no consistency, no vision, no cohesive story.So what is this film worth? It is a typical shallow action based comic book hero movie with little true substance behind it. Expect ridiculous leaps of faith as far as what is physically ""possible"", expect stupid car chases where the ""hero"" almost gets dozens of people killed and tears of the city, expect anything but a good story.Production value 9/10. Story and script 2/10. Overall 4/10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A dark and great origin of Batman,"Batman Begins- the ultimate origin story for the Caped Crusader.The director, Christopher Nolan, was well known for his low-budget films such as Memento and Insomnia.....Until Now! Nolan has created a totally new and original Batman story that triumphs over Tim Burton's two Batman films. The difference here is that Nolan has made this film into an origin story and he delves deep into the character of Batman, something no other filmmaker has done. He writes a very emotional and great story. The acting is very good with performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman. The action is also very well done with some very breathtaking visuals and sequences sure to keep you watching. Nolan offers fast editing too which means that any violence that happens is quick and not brutal.

Puts the series back on track.  A masterpiece!,"After the bitter disappointment (understatement, I know) of Batman and Robin, something special was needed to prove that Batman could still be a viable movie series. This is the film that not only proves it, but puts would be pretenders such as Spiderman and X-Men in the shade with a superb piece of film-making that puts script and characters above action sequences (although there are plenty of those too). What is so satisfying about the movie is that while Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly putting his own statement on the character, he has also reverted more to the style of the first Batman movie of 1989, by making the universe are characters inhabit a plausible and real one, even in the presence of bat-caves, gadgets and over the top villains. The city of Gotham doesn't look like the neon lit cartoon world of the Joel Schumacher years, instead looking like a real world, one that could exist. It is these types of choices that make the film a joy.The casting is pure perfection. While Michael Keaton was a great Bruce Wayne/Batman, his casting was quirky and strange, even though he got over those problems masterfully. Christian Bale on the other hand is quite possibly the perfect embodiment of Bruce Wayne/Batman, he has comic book good looks (black hair, square jaw line) and like Michael Keaton, has a psychotic look in his eye while at the same time having a sense of humor that is a joy to watch and laugh with. Likewise Michael Caine as Alfred. Initially I would have preferred Anthony Hopkins, but Caine ends up as the better choice putting in a performance as touching as it is boisterous and hilarious. Add to this Gary Oldman as Sergeant Gordon (the future Commisoner of Gotham City), Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow and Katie Holmes as the love interest, and not forgetting about Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Batman Begins is a glorious piece of summer film entertainment. I left the cinema in a buzz I haven't felt since the first Matrix film, everything works so well here, the dialog, the script, acting, direction, even the music from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is fantastic, with Zimmer taking the action cues and Howard the more intimate moments.As all good comic book movies should, the end only leaves us with more (espcially a mention of one of Batman's most famous villains, which I won't give away here) and its good to know a sequel will be with us in the next few years. All that I ask of Nolan and Warner Brothers is not to screw it up this time because this could be the beginning of something special indeed.Bravo Christopher Nolan, bravo Christian Bale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Disappointing,"Boy did I have high expectations going into this movie. After making two of my all time favorite films, Insomnia, and Memento, and making a solid debut film in, Following, I thought Christopher Nolan could do no wrong. And while this film isn't exactly wrong, it just isn't better than Tim Burton's Batman. Hell, in my opinion it's a little worse than Batman Forever.What problems do I have with the film? For one thing Christian Bale. I always cringe when I see a graduate of the Keanu Reeves school of acting, and Bales deep monotone whisper did just this. For god sakes show some emotion! Guy Ritchie was able to pull that style of acting off in one of Nolans previous films, Memento, but in this it just doesn't work for Bale.Getting back to Nolan, it's hard to smell his stench in the movie. The beginning of the film is evident with his type of dialouge and dark artsy cinematography, but as the film goes on, you forget it's Nolan's, and it will remind you more of David S. Goyer's (the co-writer) Blade films. The second half of the movie is filled with little dialouge, and because of this the film just drags on to its way too long 2 hour and 20 minute end. And whats with all the one liners? It seems that Nolan and Goyer stuff the film with way too many inappropriate for the time jokes. But my biggest pet peeve with the movie was the score. It wasn't as much that it didn't hold a candle to Danny Elfman's classic Batman score, but more that I could not recall ONE time that it wasn't playing in the background.On the plus side, Katie Holmes does a good job as the love interest, and Michael Caine is great as Alfred. Gary Oldman also gives a fine performance. I could however do without Morgan Freeman's character who is basically to Batman exactly what Q is to James Bond.While the premise of the film about Bruces fear of bats was excellent, the rest of it just doesn't work as well as it worked for Burton (and even Schumaker in 'Returns) if you are more of a Batman fan than a Nolan fan, you'll probably enjoy the film a lot more than I did.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The rise of the Kinght,"Batman Begins (2005) is by far the best reboot in cinema history. Christopher Nolan's vision on Batman is the perfect origin as batman is trained up in the league of shadows.

The supporting cast is great as well with Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Katie Holmes, Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy all kill it and all have something to do without it feeling crowded.

Massive disappointment,"Christopher Nolan blows the opportunity to make a definitive Batman movie by delivering a tepid, poorly structured effort that wastes the impressive acting talent assembled to re-tell the origins of the Dark Knight. It all starts reasonably well with a decently thought out, if a little rushed, origin story, but the film quickly unravels upon Bruce Wayne's return to Gotham. What awaits him (and us) is a dull, contrived tale with weak villains handled by a director whose talents obviously do not stretch to handling this kind of material. The action scenes in particular have you crying out for someone who knows what they're doing, while the character development and story (Nolan's supposed strengths) lack cohesion. Watching the film you have to assume its massive budget was spent on paying the actors, because it's certainly not up there in terms of design, settings or effects. It all adds up to a terrible waste of talent. Unfortunately, returns speak volumes and I'm sure Warner Bros. are already rubbing their hands at the prospect of equally banal, box-office conquering sequels. I only hope Superman Returns delivers a more satisfying, better quality effort and that one day someone will make a movie that truly captures the essence of the Batman of Dark Knight Returns & The Long Halloween.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""What I do that defines me""","The film had a lot of things going against it: The legacy of the last two Schumacher catastrophes.The fact that it had been eight years since the last Batman film.The general disregard and distaste of many for comic book films.Many past directors, writers, and studios have not treated the source material well, leading to a comic book that has not lived up to expectations and have been critically panned by critics, fans, and casual movie goers as they should.This movie is a restart of the franchise and banishes the legacy of the Schumacher films to the depths of HELL.The director (Christopher Nolan, Memento and Insomniac), screenwriter (David Goyer, Blade, JLA/ JSA: Virtue And Vice), Warner Bros., the cast, and everyone else involved in the film should all be given a round of applause for what they have done with this film.What we have been presented with is BATMAN BEGINS, the true Batman, straight down to the origin. The film is an action film but is more of a psychological examination of what could drive a man to become a creature of the night.The movie is set in a realistic world with all characters being believable. A compelling origin story was weaved together with a plot that was not over the top and was well executed. The emotional arc was also played very well by all involved.After all has been said and done, this is truly the best comic book movie of all time and one of the best movies of all time.Besides, if you don't care about anything else that I said, this was the only comic book movie that I've ever seen that received a standing ovation as the picture cut to black and the ending credits began to roll.Later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Darkest hero returns,"Batman Begins finally do justice to the greatest comic book superhero of all time. I have always wanted Batman to be dark, demonic, sinister, dangerous, and now he is. Also, the story of him has such epic feeling that was never used before in the right way. And now it is.I knew this one is going to be great when I heard that Bale is Batman. Anyone who saw Equilibrium, know what I mean. Bale is perfect in this kind of complex, dualistic roles. New Batman and Bruce Wayne are excellent. Batman is finally scary and menacing and Bruce Wayne is realistic playboy billionaire with a secret.Story is superb. Journey from a child to the legend was superbly done by Nolan and the whole atmosphere of the movie, helped with excellent soundtrack is total perfection. A lot of action, a lot of emotions, good dialogs between characters, every character is great, even Katie Holmes. Caine, Freeman, Hauer, Neeson, Oldman, Murphy, Wilkinson, they are all great and even more.This movie is one of the best action adventure movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A perfect Noir story of a mysterious Hero,"A lot could have gotten wrong when making another adaptation of the ""Batman"" story. Considering all the 90s movies with Val Kilmer and George Clooney everything was already said and done. But director Christopher Nolan took a bold brush and showed us darker shades of grey with a compelling visual experience, fine acting and a dark twist of the Batman origin.You have never seen Bruce Wayne in a darker place than in this movie. I like the fact that Nolan took time to introduce the audience to the new point of view and it's only after one and a half hour that we finally get to see some action of Arkham Asylum villains. Here we witness the becoming and get aquainted with the people around.Enjoy the 2005 flick anytime soon and remember where every cinematic soundtrack that followed afterwards came from.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best action movie since...I don't know...ever?,"First off, I am not a gigantic fanboy of Batman. I thought the first one was pretty cool, and the rest got more and more disappointing. However, when I heard that Christopher Nolan was directing Begins, and Christian Bale was Bruce, I began getting excited. I went to the preview showing at midnight, and although I am extremely tired today, it was worth it.This is my favorite action movie since the LOTR movies. If you don't count those, it might be my #1 all time. The storyline was captivating, the villains menacing, the action gritty and raw. Definitely darker than any of the other Batman movies, this movie rounds Bruce's character out. Before this, we only see him as a cocky rich-boy who is kind of bored, and thus fights crime. This movie delves into the psychology of his driving forces. The main theme, fear, is extremely well followed throughout the movie.This Batman is not a simple character who executes cool fight sequences. This Batman is disturbed, confused, and struggling with who he is, and how he can do good. The crack team of Nolan, Bale, Neeson, Caine, Freeman, Holmes, and Oldman pull this one off. Big Time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Christopher Nolan Has Given CPR to a Supposedly Dead Franchise,"The original ""Batman"" was released in 1989, under the direction of then-newcomer, Tim Burton. It was one of the first comic book movies to give itself a dark tone. It made for a pretty entertaining, albeit flawed, superhero movie, though this was mostly due to a fantastic performance from Jack Nicholson as The Joker. Burton's second Batman movie, ""Batman Returns"", was too dark and too stupid, so for the third movie, Burton handed the reigns of this franchise to Joel Schumacher. This is where things took a turn for the worst.Schumacher's first attempt at the Batman franchise resulted in ""Batman Forever"". This one was definitely more kid-friendly and manipulative, and even though it wasn't as well received as the first two movies, it was a huge hit at the box office. Because of this, Schumacher was brought on to direct the fourth, and final, Batman movie called ""Batman & Robin"", which is considered to be one of the worst movies of all time.1 out of 4 just isn't good enough, unfortunately, so Warner Bros. shut down the idea for a fifth movie and left this franchise. However, in 2005, Christopher Nolan, who was riding the success of the critically acclaimed ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"", rebooted this franchise. And, from both a Batman fan boy standpoint, as well as an avid movie goer standpoint, I couldn't have been more surprised.Christopher Nolan has taken the character of Batman to a whole new heights with this movie. He takes more of a realistic and prudent approach to the lore of Batman. Because Batman, like all the other superheroes out there, can be phenomenally goof sometimes. Here, Nolan makes you believe that a vigilante could dress up like a bat and fight crime, which, let's face it, could not have been an easy task.From a casting standpoint, everyone brings their A game. Christian Bale brings more duality to the characters of Bruce Wayne and Batman. As Bruce Wayne, he acts the part of the drunken billionaire without a care in the world. As Batman, he it more intimidating and stealthy. He preys on criminal's fear, and the best part of the movie is seeing him develop this strategy.Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman are all some of my favorite actors, and, naturally, they all give great performance. Because of the direction and tone of the movie, they act not like they're in a comic book movie, but more like they're in an Oscar nominated film. They each flesh out their characters brilliantly and effectively.The movie is shot very nicely. Nolan is a master of scenery here; there are just so many moments where he lets you soak up the atmosphere, allowing you to take in the sheer scope of everything that is Batman.Final verdict: This really is a smartly handled movie. This is the Batman movie that I wanted to see, but never thought I would. It's superior to the Burton/Schumacher era, but the next one takes it to an entirely new level of greatness. But, that's another review for another time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins was such a great reboot!,"Batman Begins was a reboot that takes you into real city rather than a cartoon city.Christian Bale as ""Bruce Wayne"" is such a great character that became the Batman by facing his fears of bats which took a lot courage. I feel that Michael Caine as ""Alfred"" was the wisest friend that Bruce had ever known. Morgan Freeman who played ""Lucius Fox"" was a great inventor that worked for Thomas Wayne (which was Bruce Wayne's father) for many years. Cillian Murphy as ""The scarecrow"" was a sick minded villain that gave people hallucinogenic drugs to scare people and put them under his control. Liam Neeson who was the real ""Ra's Al Ghul"" trained Batman and in the end, his training allowed him to put an end to Ra's Al Ghul who was the main villain of Gotham City.Hans Zimmer did a brilliant job of making the Batman soundtrack and it's themes.

If the duality of the character can't be pulled of convincingly you don't you are on the back-foot from the beginning. Not as bad as George Clooney (but hey even Adam West was better than GC).

Two-Faced Feelings,"I just got back from Batman Begins. I'm very confused.Not from the story, characters, ending, or anything technical. I am confused by my own emotions. I feel like a symbolic Two-Face.On one side, I want to give this thing 10 out of 10. It was awesome.But on the other side, I would wipe myself with it. Allow me to get down to business.GOOD: 1: The cinematography is AWESOME 2: Good CGI, can barely tell (if at all) 3: Dark. Very good, with the exception of Adam West, campy Batmans don't do it 4: Very deep, serious.5: Provides background as to why Batman can kick so much ass.6: Scarecrow done MUCH better than I expected.7: They made Batman SCARY and INTIMIDATING, which has always fallen short.8: Christian Bale did a great job at the intimidation with Batman.BONUS: Alfred grabbed a golf club when he ran into the house to help. I found that hilarious and awesome.BONUS 2: The very end. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I won't say anymore.BAD: 1: The fight scenes SUCK. They all cut way too fast, and too much to know what's going on.2: Hypocrisy. Bruce Wayne doesn't want to kill a murderer...but has nothing against killing about 50 guys two seconds later who fight injustice.3: While it was darker, it still wasn't a ""Dark Knight"". They should have made Batman a killer, much like he was when he first came around (in the first appearance of Batman he threw a baddie into a vat of toxic waste) 4: The new Batmobile is completely stupid. It's kinda cool...but logically WAY too much for any man (even a bat man) to need. The pivotal Batmobile is from Tim Burton's BATMAN.5: Still no explanation how the Wayne family is friggin' rich. A business, yeah...but still no reasoning why they're so rich.6: Scarecrow was HEAVILY under-developed. Barely in the movie enough. Not to mention Scarecrow's ""defeat"" at the end of the movie is the funniest thing I've ever seen in a Batman movie.7: I didn't feel any connection between Bruce and Rachel. They were childhood friends...and that's where the connection stops for me. Did I mention the fight scenes were bad? 8: When I first heard Christian's voice as Batman, I laughed. Not a good sign. He seemed to be trying too hard to try to become a different person when in the suit. He also did not look like a Bruce Wayne to me. I know there's much more than looking the part (George Clooney comes to mind), but it's a factor. He seemed too emotionless, detached. Christian is a good actor and I saw it...but it seems he fell short. Michael Keaton still holds the reigned for the most intense and perfect Bruce Wayne AND Batman.BONUS: The ending seemed a bit pushy (even if I did orgasm at it). But it was confusing for my friend. He was questioning if it was to show that it was a prequel to the Batman '89 movie. I explained that they were starting over. But still, I can see how people could be confused. Personally I'd leave the first two Batman movies in the timeline and redo Forever and Batman and Robin.Even looking back, I don't' know what to say. One thing, it's an awesome and excellent movie. Another, it's mediocre at best.I'll give it 6 out of 10. You might love it...you might not.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins Again,"I don't like to argue with other users, but anyone who gave this movie a low score didn't see what I saw. Rubbishing ""Batman Begins"" because it wasn't directed by Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher, or it wasn't like the animated or live action TV series (or even the comic books) is pointless. If you want more of your own personal idealised vision of Batman, go and buy the relevant DVDs and leave this film alone.Some people call the action scenes jumbled and confusing. I've not been involved in many fights but I'd say that the director has captured the feeling of hand-to-hand combat pretty well. As a director of at least one borderline Art House film (""Memento""), Christopher Nolan has taken surprisingly well to the mainstream.Casting-wise, the only bum note in the ensemble is Katie Holmes. She's punching way above her weight in the company of actors like Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Christian Bale and even relative newcomer Cillian Murphy. Admittedly, her character isn't much more than eye-candy in peril for most of the film but she fails to convince as a professional prosecutor or as a credible love interest for Bale's Bruce Wayne. The only adjective that I can find to describe her character is ""Wet"".Yes, ""Batman Begins"" goes over ground already covered in preceding ""Batman"" movies, but if viewed as a separate entity it establishes the main character's background and motivation, answering many questions about the origin of the BatCave, the costume and all those wonderful utility belt gadgets that we wanted when we were kids. Nolan has effectively directed a new beginning to another Batman film franchise.A special mention has to go to The Tumbler, the basis for the new BatMobile. Never have I wanted a car more than I want one of those! After the patently flimsy creations (all wobbly tail fins and neon lights, like over-sized toys) of the Schumacher era, the design of the new Batmobile is convincingly solid and purposeful. It's a credit to Nolan and the stunt crew that there's very little obvious CGI in the vehicle sequences, and a credit to the people who took the frankly mad design of the Tumbler and turned it into something that could handle so much stunt work.""Batman Begins"" has captured my idealised view of ""The Dark Knight"". I didn't even realise that I had such view until I saw this movie and now I'm really looking forward to the sequel...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

I missed this on the big screen and regret it immensely. At last, the Batman franchise has been hauled kicking and screaming from it's pitiful depths and rocketed directly (do not even think about passing go!) to the very top of the superhero pile.

"At Last, Batman Soars Again","In the hands of some directors (Brian Singer, I am looking at you) a ""realistic"" approach to a comic book property means draining it of all fantasy and joy and grounding it in a mundane, gloomy realm of blunt topical references. Thankfully Chris Nolan does not take this approach. There is plenty of fantasy and awe-inspiring spectacle in Batman Begins, but all of it is well-motivated and well-explained. We've got ninjas, flying heroes, super-fast tanks, and Bond-villain-esquire weapons of mass destruction, but all of them feel an organic part of the heightened universe masterfully created in this film. We've seen big vistas before in Batman movies, but they always had a back drop feel to them and the action of the films was relatively confined. Here, a Gotham truly epic in scope is painstakingly created and explored. This city only exists in miniature and on computer but it feels like somewhere we can genuinely go. These are all high points of the storytelling itself. The movie would still fall flat if it weren't support by a near-endless string of knock-out performance. Christian Bale's Bruce is stoic, introverted and tormented, but Bale still manages to keep us engaged and interested even as he's holding it all in. Michael Caine is the perfect Alfred, warm, drily witted and endlessly loyal. Gary Oldman plays against type as a likable and to all appearances fairly normal cop and Morgan Freeman imbues what little time he has with pure charisma and charm. Liam Neeson also plays against type, showing a cruelty one wouldn't expect out of one of the screen's most charming actors. The real surprise is Cilian Murphy who, though cast in a supporting role as a fairly minor villain in the film's considerable rogues gallery, manages to leave a deep impression upon the viewer. He is thoroughly creepy and disturbing, even without a particularly impressive costume. Batman Begins also succeeds in delivering those comic book essentials, action and intrigue, in consistent amounts, rather than falling to that bane of franchise beginning films, the endless setup. True this is an origin story, but Batman's origin is so riveting that we hardly miss the Bat until his appearance halfway through the film. And even then, there are at least three major action sequences and plenty of stunts to go. Though you can't complain about the level of action, some argue that the frenetic, murky style in which the action is presented is rather off-putting. On the contrary, the flash frame editing serves to punch up the impact of the fights and even if the viewer is sometimes lost in the melee, he never loses the sense of brutality that Batman brings to his battles. We are left as bruised and battered as the numerous foes of whom Batman makes short work. All in all, a fantastic effort, both as a franchise beginner and a stand-alone epic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Great action flick,"Batman Begins is the first part of the well received Batman trilogy, directed by Christopher Nolan. And as usual, Nolan delivers ! For fans of great action, this movie is definitely for you, with many thrilling moments and fight scenes ! It too serves as an good first part of the trilogy, building a splendid world in the form of corrupt Gotham.Christian Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne, the main character whose inner desire for justice after watching his parents get shot as a kid makes him adopt his crime-fighting alter-ego, the Batman. Liam Neeson plays the crooked Ducard, with class I may add, whose sinister plans may cause the fall of Gotham. Michael Caine and Gary Oldman both deliver splendid performances as the loyal butler Alfred and Commissioner Gordon respectively, adding a touch of comedy to this otherwise quite dark movie.Cillian Murphy portrays the wicked Dr. Jonathan Crane excellently too, but I believe he should have had way more screentime. It feels like you see him for a minute, then he disappears for a half hour and suddently comes back, disappearing once again after a minute. This is one small problem I have with Batman Begins. Still, he brings a maleficent performance, one which I think is very underrated.The soundtrack is simply amazing. The adrenaline pumping main theme comes in at the exactly right moments, which makes for some pretty exciting scenes. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard really knew what they were doing !To conclude, Batman Begins is an excellent action movie, and not one without heart. It contains many great performances, but unfortunately sometimes suffers from some problems with the pacing and the screenplay in my opinion. It is a movie I recommend you to watch though, especially if you enjoy comic book flicks and action thrillers !75/100 (rounded off to 8 stars)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

What a waste of potential,"I just saw this at a preview screening at Universal Citywalk. Even the awe of my first Imax movie experience couldn't save it. Christian Bale was excellent as Bruce Wayne, bringing the tortured self-searching to the character that it requires, but when donned in the bat suit, his attempts at the necessary menace were nothing if not pitiful. The chemistry between Bale and Holmes was, well, non-existent. It made me long for Spiderman and Mary Jane. Speaking of which (the comparison is inevitable), Christopher Nolan could have learned a thing or two from Spiderman 2's graceful, invigorating action and fight scenes, given that those in ""Batman Begins"" are bombastic, bludgeoning, and generally incoherent. The few inevitable one-liners (weaved into dialog that ranges from the over-serious to the shamelessly moralistic) solicited more groans than laughs. The biggest saving graces were Cillian Murphy, who's perfect as Dr. Crane/Scarecrow (the Scarecrow effects were great too), and the always excellent Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, and Michael Caine. Pity they couldn't have found their way into a better movie. I can say this, however: it wasn't as bad as ""Batman and Robin.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Debatably The Best Superhero Origin Story Put To Film,"Batman Begins is directed by Christopher Nolan and is the first installment in the Dark Knight trilogy, one of the best series of films delivered to film audiences ever. Although The Dark Knight is usually considered the best of the three movies, some do consider Batman Begins the best, and understandably so. However, I do feel it has its share of problems. Let's talk about those.Since most people know the origin story of Batman, played by Christian Bale in this film, I'll just explain what happens in this film. After becoming Batman, Bruce must face off against the one person, besides his friendly butler, Alfred Pennyworth, played perfectly by Michael Caine, that knows his real identity: his own mentor, a member of the League of Shadows, Ra's Al Ghul. Since Ra's is the one who trained him, he knows all of Bruce's weaknesses, and how to beat him. With the help of childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and police officer Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), Batman must save the people of Gotham from Ra's' evil plan, and the unleashment of a possibly even worse villain, Jonathan Crane's alter ego, the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy).I'll just jump into my problems with the film, and then begin with the praise. My main problem is the character of Rachel Dawes. Not the performance by Katie Holmes, or even the character herself, but more like the occupation of her in the film. It seems that the writers didn't exactly know what to do with her character at times, so she was thrown in on a useless subplot or just as a Batman love interest. I want to clarify that Katie Holmes didn't do bad at all, just the need for her character at specific points seemed useless.The only other problem I felt the movie had was the slowness of it at points. While The Dark Knight (2008) and even The Dark Knight Rises (2012) were fast-paced most of time, Batman Begins seems to slow down at times. This is most likely because it's an origin story, and it has no previous installments to build upon, but origin stories in the past have been fast paced, such as 2002's Spiderman.Now, for the praise. I love Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne. Although many people consider Michael Keaton the best Batman, I personally prefer Christian Bale slightly. Don't get me wrong, Keaton did amazing, and Bale being the better of the two is just my opinion. I also really like every other casting choice in the film. Michael Caine as Alfred was a fantastic choice, as was Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Cillian Murphy was great as Jonathan Crane, and Liam Neeson as Ducard was a near perfect. Katie Holmes was okay (and, I'm secretly happy with the replacement choice of Maggie Gyllenhaal), but she didn't exactly do great. Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon was one of the best casting choices in superhero movie history, up there with J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.I also love the direction, as I do with every Nolan movie. Nolan to the camera is as Da Vinci is to the paintbrush. If Nolan didn't make films, he would probably homeless or working at a McDonald's full time, because film is truly his calling. The way he captured the image of the dark city of Gotham was perfect, due to his portrayal of the crime taking place in this city, and just how bad it his without good people around anymore, and how this downfall started with the death of Bruce's parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne. The importance of this fact also ties Bruce by birth to the crime rate in Gotham, which inspires him even more to become the caped crusader that we all know him as.The last pro I have with the film has got to be the score. Hans Zimmer, the composer for Batman Begins, is a modern day John Williams, despite how different their style is. Hans Zimmer does more of a background style, in which the audience is sucked into the movie due to the music, while John Williams' scores suck you in because of the music itself, and the music is obvious, it's not just in the background. In addition to Hans Zimmer, James Newton Howard worked on the score, and the epic team up of these two makes for a near perfect score.In conclusion, Batman Begins is one of the best superhero films, despite its few flaws, and impressed me on so many levels. It's easily one of, if not the, best superhero origin stories put to film, and is a bit underrated in my opinion. Check this movie out, I suggest it to anyone, fan of superheroes or not.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Mr. Nolan, please direct X-Men","I concur with all of the wonderful compliments here on Mr. Nolan's extraordinary recreation of Batman. He restores the depth, grittiness and integrity of the Dark Night -- and is true to the comic book series in a way that only two other franchises have been true to their own (Superman and Spider-Man). The cast is just superb all around -- including Katie Holmes. She points to a necessary ingredient of this saga -- the lasting tension within Bruce/Batman and the ongoing threat that he will go over the edge between justice and vengeance. He's a disturbed and conflicted man, and Holmes, like Caine's Alfred, is critical to illustrating that. I shudder to think what Nolan and his remarkable crew will achieve in a sequel with Joker, and very much look forward to his future work on this front. But I have one question: Can you imagine what this guy and his team could do for X-Men? Please consider it, Mr. Nolan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
DC and Chris Nolan gets it exactly right.,"After Batman and Robin, another Batman movie titled Batman Triumphant was scheduled to be released in 1999 and to be directed by Joel Schumacher with George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone set to reprise their roles, but was cancelled following the critical failure and box office disappointment of Batman and Robin and numerous of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Batman on screen, but all of that changed with the success of comic book movies like Daredevil, Spider-Man and X-Men, and Warner Bros. Pictures decided to reboot the Batman franchise with the 2005 film directed by Christopher Nolan and the first part of his epic DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY, Batman Begins.The goal was to get the audience to care for Batman and Bruce Wayne and this film was released on June 17, 2005 to critical positive reviews and grossed over $374 million worldwide and spawned two sequels in Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy: The Dark Knight, which was released in 2008 and The Dark Knight Rises, which was released in 2012.The story is an origin story, showing how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and the film does not fail in this kind of movie. It shows his initial fear of bats, we get to see the death of his parents, his journey to becoming Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul and The Scarecrow as they plan to destroy Gotham City.Now, this film is inspired by the classic Batman comic book stories such as, The Man Who Falls, Batman: Year One and Batman: The Long Halloween. Director Christopher Nolan does a really good job with the source material and with a script that Nolan himself and co-writer David S. Goyer wrote, this is one hell of a DC Comics superhero movie that has gotten all of the praise and attention.The musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard could not have composed a much, darker wonderfully and emotionally satisfying orchestral score. Batman's theme in this film is exciting to hear and when it finally shows Batman in his costume, I just screamed and cheered like a fanboy in awe.The acting is just fantastic this time. I give credit to Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman because he played the duo-role beautifully and amazingly and I thought I would end up hating his performance, but I actually did not.Michael Caine plays Alfred Pennyworth and he just brings so much to that character and I really enjoyed his performance. Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes was a little confusing, but I enjoyed her too. Gary Oldman and Liam Neeson are great as Lieutenant Jim Gordon and Henri Ducard / Ra's al Ghul and they are just over the top.Tom Wilkinson is good as Carmine Falcone and he pulled off the great performance of a villain. And when the scene came up where he says, ""What in the hell are you?"" and Batman grabs him and says, ""I'm Batman"". It had me cracking up, but also cheering. Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox and he is just simply cool showing Christian Bale all of Batman's gadgets and weaponry. These performances are just top-notch, but the only one I did not enjoy was Cillian Murphy as Johnathan Crane / The Scarecrow. Murphy is good as Johnathan Crane, but when he is the Scarecrow, his Scarecrow just drives me insane.The Batsuit and the Tumbler were the coolest designs for this film and Christopher Nolan made awesome choices in hiring Lindy Hemming as costume designer and Nathan Crowley as production designer. The cinematography is shot really well and I give credit to Wally Pfister, because he did a darn good job and did a great job with the other two films in the DARK KNIGHT trilogy.The most powerful elements in this film is the common motif used in this film, which is fear and critics and audiences noted this that fear was a common motif throughout the entire 140-minute movie and this film has went on to be known as one of the best superhero movies ever made.The film does have a dark and gritty tone compared with the other Batman films and I will never get tired of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. It's an epic three-film trilogy with good action, good writing and a good leading man and that is Christian Bale.Overall, I love this new Batman film adaptation. Is it better than the original 1989 film? Yes. Is it darker and grittier than Batman Returns? Yes. Is it humorous? There are scenes of humor in this film, but not that much. Is this the Batman movie we have been waiting for? Yeah, it is. I love this film to death and like THE DARK KNIGHT and other superhero movies that I like, I have no problem re-watching this again and again. I give it the best rating I can possibly give it and that is an 8.4 / 10. Perfect and it is a hell of a lot between then what some people called the disaster that was Batman & Robin.Christopher Nolan, Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Comics and Legendary Pictures, what a great job you done and you should be proud.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Extraordinary Filmaking,"I have had a long relationship with this film, I watch it every year or so to remind myself of how far I have come as a fan of movies. I want to be entertained, enjoy myself and be impressed at the techniques directors use in order to fully bring the piece to life. I don't want to give an overly internalized, pseudo intellectual, impenetrable, pretentious review pandering to grab peoples attention. I have gained such great enjoyment and developed such a strong affection for this film over the years that it is simply unparalleled. It's this particular one I keep going back to time and time again. It is without a doubt the measuring stick on how to make a big budget studio film that is essentially about characters and their different viewpoints, fleshed out and executed flawlessly.The reason I can never quite say to myself that Batman Begins is a perfect film is essentially a structural one, for the first 40 minutes of the film the narrative wasn't pre written for Christopher Nolan, there was a very rough outline in the source material but nothing concrete in which he would have to stick by. What we see in the opening 40 minutes is a simply sensational story of childhood, love, loss, vengeance and the search for a meaningful existence. Contained within was some of the most touchingly beautiful moments in film history in both narrative and aesthetic terms. It when we first meet James Gordon played by Gary Oldman do we see Nolan settle into more of a comic book orientated narrative setting based on ""Batman: Year One"" with a James Bond like tooling up from Lucius Fox played by Morgan Freeman. This part of the film though extremely engaging and enjoyable I didn't find was quite able to mesh with what was a truly brilliant opening 40 minutes.Batman Begins is a film whose importance cannot be understated, it is without a doubt one of my favourite films and one I don't see staying on my shelf for a prolonged period anytime soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Begins,"This is easily the best of the Batman Movies. Entertaining and mystic with excellent actors in their male roles. Life has many surprises as did this movie from Hollywood. The children ages 7 to 12 that attended with me all wanted the DVD to watch over and over as they were the most impressed with the constant action and special effects.The quality of this film and its presentation seems to be right up there with Star Wars series from 1977 to 2005, and should be one of the most viewed films of 2005 and may out gross the showing of competition War of the Worlds flick.Universal Studios should immediately open up a tour with scenes and equipment for rides in the new Batman vehicle!

A superior fifth outing for the caped crusader,"I'm a bit of a sucker for superhero films and Batman has a kind of credibility as the superhero without superpowers, so I happily saw the two Tim Burton offerings (""Batman"" & ""Batman Returns"") and even the pair of inferior Joel Schumacher works (""Batman Forever"" & ""Batman & Robin""). I wouldn't have expected the British director Christopher Nolan (""Memento"" & ""Insominia"") as the choice to revive the franchise, but the return to the origins of the story - a mere 12 frames in Bob Kane's 1939 comic strip - and the much darker, more psychological approach work really well and result in a superior and entertaining movie.Christian Bale - whom I first saw as a child in ""Empire Of The Son"" - is a credibly brooding Batman/Bruce Wayne, but Tom Cruise's current squeeze Katie Holmes is rather weak as his conscience cum love interest. One distinguishing feature of this fifth outing for the caped crusader is the impressive line-up of support actors who include the British Michael Caine as Wayne's Cockney butler, Tom Wilkinson as the head hood, and Gary Oldman as the future Commissioner Gordon (a rare opportunity for Oldman to play a good guy) plus Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman, who are employees of Waynes Enterprises with very different motivations, and Liam Neeson of the mysterious League of Shadows.In any superhero movie, the non-human stars are the gadgets and here ""BB"" offers some good-looking stuff and an original angle on how Wayne acquires it all. The Batmobile is very different from previous films - a kind of ultra-rugged Humvee that smashes all in its path. Some, at least, of the reported $180 that the movie cost to make has obviously gone on this hardware with a lot more on the stylistic sets of Gotham City, Wayne Manor and a Tibetan retreat. The rousing soundtrack from Hans Zimmer adds to the atmosphere. In short, this is a visually and aesthetically satisfying outing and, Oldman's final reference to the Joker, is either Nolan's bid for a sequel or a clever link to the 1989 Jack Nicholson role.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Better, but only because it's compared to the last two...","Alright, I have to say that Batman Begins left the last two Schumaker productions in the dust, but let's face it: this isn't a hard thing to do with that kind of competition. I think people are so excited about this newest addition to the Batman family because we've all been so desperate to wipe our memories of Batman Forever and Batman & Robin that we'll overlook the bad to see the good.Now don't get me wrong -- Batman Begins was fun to watch, and there were a lot of aspects that I enjoyed about this film: seeing Wayne take his first steps into becoming Batman, Michael Cain's performance as Alfred, and especially seeing Christian Bale get some real big-screen appreciation (Equilibrium was unfortunately very underrated, it's an excellent film if anyone gets a chance to rent it). It was grittier and darker than the last ones. Plus the Batmobile... We all know we want one of those now ^_^.But there are so many things that were missing from this film too, things that were essential to who Batman is and the steps he took from day 1 to protect the innocent. In this version, the little boy who watched his parents die didn't make a vow that day to fight evil, the movie decided to make him wait until he had left Princeton. And his detective roots? All gone, probably my biggest disappointment in this movie -- come on, even _Adam West's Batman_ was a detective, for crying out loud! In the comics, Batman's deductive mind is one of the things Ra's Al Ghul respected so much about him, but in the film our hero is really little more than an impassioned, wealthy ninja who leaves the technical side to underlings. Speaking of ninjas, did we HAVE to have another ""set off one explosive and the whole building proceeds to blow up"" scene at the beginning? And why did Wayne Manor have no fire alarm or water sprinklers in it? Not to mention *spoiler ahead* how he dealt with his enemy at the end: ""I'm not going to kill you, but I don't have to save you either"", which equates to ""I'm going to kill you and use a loophole to avoid responsibility for it"". This is NOT Batman! I hate to use this as a comparison, but this Batman movie actually reminded me of that horrific Daredevil film that Affleck made not too long ago... Our hero doesn't beat the demons inside of himself through strength of his will and character, he only accomplishes it with the help of his girlfriend who doesn't respect those demons, i.e. ""No sex for you until you stop being so revenge-driven"".Sorry, I would love to give this thing the full thumbs up, but it didn't go far enough. It used a lot of aspects of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One (who I worry didn't get any appreciation for his work since I never saw his name in the credits!) but mixed them in with a grittier-campiness. And the only real reason everyone is really cheering for it, sadly enough, is because it was better than the Kilmer/Clooney movies....",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Better than dark knight,"This film is flawless! It is infinitely more believable than any batman film and that is why it is the best!

Ra's al ghul is a mirror image of batman and is also his teacher which makes for an incredible story ark. Hans zimmer is perfect, british cast is perfect, and katie holmes is perfect for rachel dawes.

nothing special.,"it's heavily over rated. if you have high expectation, you will be disappointed. it's nothing special, exciting and inspiring. all the good guys in the movie are smart ass and the bad guys are dumb ass. i can't stand the way all the smart asses smirk and talk to indicate that they seem to know perfectly well what is going on. batman seems out of place. he didn't fit into the movie. and i just learned that batman is actually a ninja. it's terrible. it is like the typical Chinese kung fu movie. the hero saw the corrupted society, went up the mountain to seek for a master. he learned the kung fu and back to the society to kick the bad guys asses. and in the end, the hero discovered that his master is actually the biggest badass and he had to fight his master to save the world in the final plot.the best it can get is 5. but since it is heavily over rated, i give it 1 to balance the rating hopefully.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman: darker and more interesting than ever before,"In the 5th Batman film, director Christopher Nolan brings a very dark side out of the superhero and explores how Bruce Wayne became Batman in this wonderful fantasy, and my personal favourite Batman thus far.Nolan uses a very sophisticated choice of direction to bring out the traumas of Wayne's past in a great use of flashbacks, so unexpected and diverse which is what the franchise needed, not to mention the writing is top notch by going darker than all other films in the series created.The direction fits beautifully alongside a consistent plot. Though I was lost at a couple of turns with the involvement of many characters, the plot is solid and fits the genre beautifully with the use of the escapism of realism, such are the action sequences and the use of the cool gadgets, and though I have never read the comics, am sure are great justice to them.The performances are excellent as well. Bale (American Psycho), in his first role as the superhero, delivers on a whole new level compared to previous performances by Keaton, Kilmer and Clooney, and is by far, the darkest and most interesting. Excellent support is given by Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes, and the performances cannot be faulted, and these performances in particular give the film more depth, and make the film very character driven, none more so than the driving force that is bale's portrayal of the lonely and troubled Bruce Wayne.Seeing the creation of the hero was very interesting, as I have never read any comics, I didn't have much idea as to how Batman came about, and this was a great showcase to demonstrate how he did, and is very strong and emotional, and does explain why batman acts like he does in other films, the loneliness and the sentimental issues are evident by the troubled past clearly effective in this film, which answers so much.Though there is a few flaws in the characters and occasionally the plot, it is by far the best Batman made thus far, and I wait impatiently to go and see The Dark Knight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Great return of a non-childish hero,"Making a superhero movie isn't easy, mainly because a lot of expectation is created something a lot of people has been reading in decades. The last two Batman movies where very childish for not to say very disappointing, but now Christopher Nolan presents a Batman that really makes sense. The story shows the why's and when's of the origin of the character in a way that could be possible (in a Jurassic Park way). The villains are not crazy psychopaths, but respectable criminals with strong foundations. Batman isn't Superman, he's a normal person, and you can sense that in the movie. The turns of the movie and the effects are very good, the hallucination scenes are really scary and the support characters have very good dialogues. The jokes are good but not so often giving seriousness. I would recommend it to everyone, but it can be confusing for children though.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Mighty Good, but not God","I really appreciate the fact that Batman turns out to be the indifferent guy who is picking his suit at the store, having dinner at a restaurant with her girlfriend and the one who cries in lonely nights for the traumas of his childhood. Christopher Nolan took the movie at the correct time, when much of us were waiting for the return of The Dark Savior, whose dark suit hides a thirst for justice that lies in a humanly more developed way; not like Schumacher's Batman that was almost Captain America with a little more colour. Great Christian Bale: his gestures show power, his words resentment: best Batman although he had no big competition. The supporting cast shines for itself; but Katie Holmes really lacks appealing actoral power. The cinematography which catches dark at its very best, and the incredible sound make this a very pleasant experience.Fast and moving editing. Okay with that, but I have another couple of movies that outsmart this. Apart from it, very good choice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A Little Journey Through the Life of Growing Batman,"Batman has almost always been a thrilling character as we look back at the past Batman movies. His great power and abilities to fight against evil forces in Gotham city have amazed many. But from where did he got his skills? What is his past all about? From where did all his equipment come? These and many other questions revealed in the last Batman movie.From its very beginning, the film succeeds with sinking you in the action-filled atmosphere. At the same time, you get into a person's mind, trying to understand his exact feelings and thoughts, his weaknesses and fears. A charming performances by Christian Bale, who shows us off good skills in martial arts at some fighting scenes, and the beautiful Katie Holmes could be seen throughout the movie. Michael Caine and Liam Neeson keep their work on a high level, too. All this, brought together with an excellent directing by Christopher Nolan, contributes to the impression of a classy and decent picture.Although the whole beauty of the movie, there were some moments where the script gets a bit nippy and the cues lose their fascination. But it is an action movie, howsoever. The main idea is practically kept and going.To sum up, watching Batman Begins will bring you a good excitement. It could even make you ask yourself questions about your own life or deed. Maybe that's what the good movies are made for.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
best of Batman ... maybe ... but not much more,"Yes, this is the best film in the Batman series. It's not that hard, though, as the previous ones were just comics films, with mega-stars playing childish action. This film tries and to a certain degree succeeds to be a little more - meaning it has a story, some characters development, good cinematography (although not that impressive as in 'Van Helsing'), and some good supporting role acting with names like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson in the cast. On the bad side, Chriatian Bale is even less charismatic than the guy who played last summer in Spiderman, and Katie Holmes never succeeds to make us believe she is a DA deputy, or that she succeeded to get engaged to Tom Cruise.I wonder what made a director like Christopher Nolan, who directed the strong and original 'Mememto' and then had Pacino and Robin Williams sharing the screen in 'Insomnia' go that down on the artistic scale. Oh, I forgot - money, money, money...Yes, this is the kind of entertainment that many will enjoy and let them be happy. No it's not a bad film. But it's not a good one either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Would have been better without Katie Holmes,"I, much like any other batman fan, was waiting in great anticipation for this one and I must say I love this movie. Christian Bale as a young Bruce Wayne I thought was great casting, but how would he handle the role of the dark knight? He does it just about perfect. Gary Oldman gets extra kudos for playing a young Jim Gordon. Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth may have been stretching it a bit but he as always does a great job. This was certainly a vast improvement over the Joel Shumacher travesties. The fight scenes I thought were fine but could have done without the blink-and-you-miss-it action.My only problem with this one was Katie Holmes. She just seemed like a deer in the headlights throughout this film. Maybe the producers needed a young hot female and just sort of settled on her. Either way this was still a fantastic film and I am hoping for a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Flawlessly average,"(Nearly) perfect action movie. Surprisingly believable for much of the movie, without resorting to the standard superhero melodrama too much. This I didn't expect. Another aspect was the appropriate use of CG. It wasn't overt. One scene in particular, the camera panning around Batman perched on a building, the cinematography is very 'real' looking. At least one major flaw that I just couldn't ignore being that this is a 'realistic' superhero movie. Without spoiling anything, let's just say that humans contain a lot of water. The whole 'save the day' scenario was unfortunately plain, nothing we haven't seen before. I think that's where the movie failed for me personally.

Year One in glorious Technicolour!,"Bruce Wayne is lost. Seeking criminals to fight by getting locked up with them in south east Asia, he cuts a strong, skilled fighter but a sorry figure as his crusade for justice has turned sour and left him bitter and without direction. After being sought out by the league of shadows he is trained by the legendary fighter Ducard (Played by a Liam Neeson who does not seem like the same bored man who played Qui Gon Jinn) who adds the finishing touches to Bruce's skills showing him the arts of deception and the skills he needs to combat evil and to become an agent of Justice.However, after his relationship with the league of shadows sours, Bruce returns to Gotham, wiser, with an edge he did not have before. He teams up with a disenfranchised employee called Lucius Fox and raids Wayne Enterprises for the latest equipment in order to carry out his war on crime. After an hour of pre-amble and character set-up we are treated to some real Batman action and the movie never looks back as we watch the lost boy Bruce become the caped crusader, the dark knight that the comic books fans have been crying out for, for years. In this the best comic book adaptation ever made, we are treated to a tour-de-force of acting, direction, drama and, yes at times, even comedy, as we witness the birth of the Batman.The performance by Christian Bale is excellent, combining the driven, rage fuelled Wayne with the super-slick playboy returning to the city. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman add weight as the butler and the inside company man respectively. The direction is smart and subtle, turning Gotham from the all too dark visions of Tim Burton and clown like circus of Joel Schumaker into a real city, with dirt and rain and real people residing.Left open for sequels but with enough content to make a good film on its own this is the best Batman film so far and bodes well for the series from now on.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

the main thing is...,"I think the story and all psychological supporting tricks are not totally new and brilliant. I also applaud the taking of the risk of boredom (and working it out quite decently) which dominates almost all comic book adaptation movies opening with the ""beginning"" stories; just because the story is known by at least half of the audience. The rest also, I mean the action part, is good enough; especially better than the Burton/Schumacher series. All goodies, like beautiful filming work and inclusion of actioning bats aside, I think the main thing that makes this one highly enjoyable is the supreme performance of the supporting cast. Especially Caine and Oldman are perfect in their roles. Neeson has still a bit Qui-Gon Jinn scent but that is not too bad. However, I'd prefer to see more Watanabe than him.

Rejoice for Batman Begins!,"I have a hard time giving comic book movies a perfect rating. Really, how can a comic movie be worth a 10? The answer is Batman Begins, a very faithful movie to the true Batman. Every single bit of info on how the Bat came to be is masterfully presented with slick cinematography and a powerful script. One of the surprising elements of the movie is how emotionally involved you become with Batman and Bruce Wayne. The action is intense and I have to say that the Batmobile is the best of any. I also saw this film on a Ultrascreen (what used to be an Imax theater) with powerful surround sound and thumping bass that makes the action that much better. The acting is superb (with special note to Michael Caine as Alfred... well done, old boy!) with powerful actors in several roles. Some might disagree with Katie Holmes as Rachel, but I found her to be an important and fitting role. One thing some people might have a hard time with is the surprisingly complex plot. A lot is going on in this movie outside of the rise of Batman. A second viewing may help to understand all that goes on may be required. (you will not mind seeing it again, I will see it as many times as I can) Fight sequences are nicely done and doing real stunts instead of CG goes a long way to giving Batman the right atmosphere. The CG that is used compliments the film and never overwhelms like in Star Wars. All in all, Batman Begins is the best comic movie ever made surpassing Spider-Man, Superman, and X-Men. The best part is that you do not have to be a fan boy to enjoy the movie. Ladies and gentlemen, rejoice, for Batman truly has returned!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""Are You Ready To Begin?""","Seven years after Batman's last woeful appearance on the big screen, the Dark knight would receive a second chance to start a big screen franchise. The result was a Batman film 180 degrees different from its predecessors in its tone and presentation. In fact the title said it all: Batman Begins.Christian Bale makes a remarkable Btamn / Bruce Wayne in the film. Like Christoher Reeve in Superman The Movie almost three decades earlier, Bale makes the remarkable journey to superhero seem believable. Whjat makes Bale's performance (and arguably the character's journey as well) all the more remarkable is the fact that batman is not just your average superhero either. Bale makes the journey from man to symbol remarkably and believable. The one downside to Bale is really his voice as Batman which is unbelievably deep to put it nicely. Yet despite that he makes a good candidate from the best film Btamn yet from this film alone.Like how director Richard Donner surrounded Christopher Reeve in Superman The Movie with an all star supporting cat, director Christopher Nolan surrounded Bale in much the same way. There is Michael Caine who makes a wonderful Alfred with a terrificly understated performance, Gary Oldman's realistic Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman's excellent Lucius Fox for a start. Then there's the villains like Tom Wilkinson's mob boss and Cillian Murphy's Dr. Crane. Don't forget a the stand-out performance of Liam Neesom as Dukar who helps to firmly anchor the film in reality. There are one or two miscasts like Katie Holmes and Ritger Hauer who both seem nowhere near in their roles as the rest of the cast. Overall though it is an excellent supporting cast backing up an excellent leading man.One of the big reasons this film works is that, unlike the art deco inspired films of Tim Burton or the overly stylized films of Joel Schumacuer, Nolan choose to put his Batman in something close to the real world. Everything about this film from its real world technology(or thereabouts)to Gotham itself signals this. Nolan and fellow writer David S. Goyer have taken the Btman mythology out of the comic book and into the real world. This is a dark world for the Dark Knight indeed.What would a Batman film be without action? Though it is essentially action less for much of its first third, the film has no shortage of action after wisely allowing for plenty of time for character development. Nolan wisely chooses not to fall into the usual trap of having a plot that revolves around the need for action sequences every few minutes. In fact Batman Begins is quite the opposite by using action to forward the plot. The action might be amazing but it never overwhelms the human drama going or the most important thing: the story. And that is how it should be.From strong performances to a real world setting and amazing action sequences, Batman Begins is a terrific action film. It is more then that though. With its blend of human drama with action it is a new beginning for a amazing hero. As the title says: Batman Begins.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A return to the real Batman,"This is a darker, more realistic Batman movie. For comic book fans who have read the earliest stories, this movie series should be heaven. Christopher Nolan is taking audiences back to how Batman was intended to be: a dark master detective who is HUMAN. His ""villains"" are crime bosses and mobster, just like in real life. But Batman must also face madmen like Scarecrow. The villains are more realistic (Nolan said you will never see the Penguin in his film series because it is too unbelievable and far feetched to be real). Begins is the beginning (which is refreshing given the slew of poor quality prequels that seem to be coming out lately). We learn how Bruce Wayne altered from poor little rich boy into the vigilante of justice. This film introduces the long standing comic villain of Ra's Al Ghul to film. And Nolan (mistakenly) creates a love interest for Batman/Bruce Wayne in Rachel (played poorly by Katie Holmes). The story and the action are truly inspired. And the direction this series is taking is from the original comic icon, not from the 4+ decades of camp and overacting. It's darker than Burton's, better than Schumacher's (but what isn't?), and true to the original. What more could fans ask for? Highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Even though the Scarecrow is totally the opposite of the comic book (in the comic Jonathan Crane is an old and ugly doctor who was fired from Gotham University for experimenting on the students with his gas of fear), the character presented keeps the essence and motives that the original character has, unlike the Riddler, Mr Freeze, Two Face or Poison Ivy in Schumacher's awful versions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

After a related family tragedy, we take three giant steps to muscular Christian Bale (as Grown-up Bruce Wayne). First, he is seen in a Chinese prison. This is to begin Mr. Bale's expert training in combat, Asia being most obvious location. Bale fights and fights for mentor-like Liam Neeson (as Henri Ducard)...Later, Bale develops his ""Batman"" identity. He gets funny ears. Bale and trusty butler Michael Caine (as Alfred Pennyworth) discover a huge cave under stately Wayne Manor. The caped vigilante's once little girlfriend develops into attractive district attorney Katie Holmes (as Grown-up Rachel Dawes). This all-new character was not present in DC Comics' new ""Dark Knight"" Batman and is inappropriately weaved into the hero's origin story; possibly, she is intended to cement the final removal of the character ""Robin"" from Batman's potentially naughty influence. After the origin and Asian stuff, we get to a real Bat-Film...""Pow!"" ""Sock!"" """"Ka-Boom!"" Batman must rescue Gotham City from the clutches of ""Scarecrow"" Cillian Murphy (Dr. Jonathan Crane) and crime-lord Tom Wilkinson (as Carmine Falcone). Best villain is surprisingly not Ken Watanabe (as Ra's Al Ghul), but Mr. Murphy's ghastly ""Scarecrow"". They should have made him more of the focus. Also noteworthy is director Christopher Nolan's use of rising and falling; note how the well and ice drops are replaced by up-and-down Bat-action. The art/set designers create a great-looking Gotham, and Wally Pfister photographs it well. The ending strongly suggests a sequel...****** Batman Begins (6/10/05) Christopher Nolan ~ Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
High budget movie with a colossal waste of talent,"Plot Outline: Disillusioned after seeing his parents murdered, millionaire heir Bruce Wayne (Bale) travels distances to unravel himself and to find means to fight injustice while, his wealth, his company has fallen into bad hands. Bruce returns to Gotham, a new man with a dark side: Batman, a caped crusader who teams up with upcoming cop Gordon to fight crime.Comment: Christopher Nolan's Batman is credited with the focus on the central character and its development with unprecedented detail. Sadly, it has been painfully overstretched. Although one would argue that there is more of Batman than the weird-villains, I would rather say that villains bring out the best in superhero movies rather than a bland portrayal of the character's mental development for 140mins. Probably, there are shades of Nolan's inexperience with Action flicks and his comfort with movies like Insomnia.Christian Bale dons the cape as the fourth Batman after Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney and looks like he needed to spend more time in his cape to establish himself as Batman. Liam Neeson's Jujutsu and Ninja classes reminded me of Fishburne in Matrix. Stars like Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Cutie Katie Homes are underutilized. Technical work is neat on SFX but nothing great to look for.Rating: 2/5",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The movie that changed the world of Batman!!!,"In 2005 we have the film that would change the world of Batman to this day. Christopher Nolan undertakes to put in his hands the Batman franchise that he wanted from his first steps!A new Batman more grounded in reality, unlike previous Batmans that were based on the comics. The role of Bruce Wayne is played by the awesome Christian Bale, Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul and I cannot fail to mention the inimitable Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth!The film starts very strongly and ends very strongly. Halfway through I personally feel it gets a little boring. I also feel that they didn't need so many villains, but it doesn't spoil me as much as Batman's voice, which every time I hear it pierces my ears, luckily they fixed it in the next movies.That's all I had to say, the reason I put 8/10 was purely subjective, I think the next movie is much better and I couldn't put it higher. If you haven't seen it yet then why you still here! It's an amazing movie!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"Excellent, Fantastic Movie","I have to admit, I was a little apprehensive entering the movie theater to see this movie. I left feeling awed and wowed. This was an incredibly well done movie. It was believable and had a storyline that people could relate to. This was not a cartoon like the other movies. This was Batman. I loved this movie and would strongly recommend for people to see it. All of the actors were superb, particularly Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, and of course Michael Caine. It was an extraordinary cast, and each lent their own unique role to the movie. The movie was believable. There were no comical villains or cheesy lines. The technology was real and was not fake movie technology.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"It's not what you are underneath that defines you, but what you do!","Batman Begins is just so different, if you are expecting it to be like Burton's you will not only miss this film, but you will miss out.Batman Begins is a far more realistic idea, and has a far more rich back story that makes sense, from why Bruce trains, how he can do what he does, and even the suit and car make more sense.Sure it doesn't have the gimmicks kids fall in love with: Namely the car, the popping music, but it has so much more: Depth, Realism, and Meaning.These 3 things, along with brilliant acting, perfect pacing, script and directing create a movie one must watch a second time. And when you do you see the car for what it is, a relentlessness of spirit, the music for what it inspires...Afterall, 'it's not what you are underneath that defines you, but what you do! Batman Begins, a tour De force. A movie full of depth, introspection, and meaning. It even included little details like tiny strokes of a master's brush.Yes, Batman Begins, and continues in 2008, and I can't wait.You see there just aren't enough movies these days crafted with such passion, such loyalty to not only an idea, or a story, but to the future of film. Those who declare that yes, character development is important. Understanding, meaning, and integrity shines light on beauty, and brings hope like light to a darkened place, and this place where movies are made has grown so dark.That's why I rate this movie a 10.Seriously folks. I loved Burton's Batman as a kid. I was about 13 when it was in theaters, and as a kid I loved the Joker, the car, the music; it was just so much fun. But it isn't very logical. I mean take for example The Joker. He falls into a vat of toxic waste and his hair turns green but his face turns white? I mean come on, it was fun, as long as you didn't think too much about it. Great kids movie.Batman Begins is simply a more realistic film. It's got more depth, meaning, back story, logic, and simply makes more sense. It's a Batman for a more mature audience.Both fantastic movies, but I would never call Tim Burton's Batman brilliant, fun maybe, entertaining, memorable? Yes. While Nolan's Batman was an important film, because it had depth, and that's something missing far too often in today's movie industry.So you see, you can enjoy both movies, just for different reasons. And when you compare them, there's no need to bash either one, for both have their merits, and both should be commended for them.That is all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Batman movie yet.,"After the awful mess that was ""Batman & Robin"", I was unsure of a re-boot of the Batman movie franchise. Memories of Bat-Ice Skates and mid-air surfing haunted me before this movie came out, and more of the same would have squashed any dreams in my head of a real, quality Batman film.But I figured, okay, it could be good, I've heard good things about this Christopher Nolan, I'll go see it.One of the best decisions of my life. What Nolan has done (and what he is about to do again in ""The Dark Knight"") with the Batman film franchise has given me and Bat-Fans the world over the origin movie we have been yearning for. It shows fans and general audiences alike the quest of Bruce Wayne to become something criminals fear: Batman. Yet when you see this movie, it doesn't have the comic-book superhero popcorn movie feel to it like you get from the ""Spiderman"" movies or ""Iron Man"" (not that that is a bad thing). No, Nolan makes this movie feel like a legitimate work of film art and not something you just go see to fill up your summer time with, and I hope I get this same vibe from ""The Dark Knight"".But, this film had one minor flaw that keeps me from giving it a 10: the fight scenes. I understand what they were trying to do with them: they wanted us to feel like we were right there in the middle of the action. I appreciate such an attempt and I can see why a director might try it. But I could not tell who was doing what to whom in ""Batman Begins""'s fight scenes, all I knew was that Batman was fighting someone, but that was it. It could be an issue of taste, but I just like to see what exactly is going on.""Batman Begins"" still easily takes the cake for me when I think of the best superhero movies, though. I'm sure when viewed from the spectrum of the upcoming ""The Dark Knight"", this movie will seem even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Top Films of the Year... and The Year's Not Even Done Yet!,"i don't like to give 10's to movies usually because to say so would say it is a perfect movie with no faults. NO movie has a perfect slate. But as a Die-hard Batman fan and lover of movies... this came DAMN close.it's reinvented. refueled. modernized. and kick-ass. the movie draws you in from the get-go! Pulling you in by your hair, we learn of Bruce Wayne's pain and hatred over the death of his parents and the one who committed it. unable to actually DO the deed, he runs. not away. but chasing after something. something he never expected he'd have to. his fear.I was doubting Bale. His playboy demeanor. pretty boy smile and attitude. to change it into your ""true"" self as the real Bruce Wayne in my most loved comics does; the one challenge that could break the movie if not done right. I applaud him. He BECOMES the Knight. i really saw it when he yanks up a thug by his legs upside down 20 stories. when he yanks him up to the top, he grabs him by the hair and just KILLS with his voice and eyes. i can't explain it. it just feels right.after 7 years, he returns to give justice a rightful place in Gotham. i kid you not: this movie delivers plot points that no movie has cared to include. there are SO many great points that just give the character depth and the movie THAT much more credibility as a believable feature. By telling you them all, i'd be spoiling the surprise and the joy of seeing it for the first time.To know that this movie franchise is signed on for a full trilogy (with most of the cast signed on for that FOR NOW) made my heart skip beats when it was finished. Christopher Nolan's directing and inward vision from the books is just what the Bat Franchise needed to be resurrected. i hope he realizes how great his talent is with the making of these films.Too good to be true, kids. Too good to be true.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What batman should be like!!!!,"This movie offers all a batman movie should offer:with convincing performances and portrayals of all the original comic and Gothic city......it truly does tell the world that batman sure isn't just on the verge of becoming homosexual, but he actually needs that suit to be ultimately tight-this is perhaps is subtly reflected in the background and armour tough motives of batman as a character...well done Mr Nolan....Well done for picking a talented cast including Cristian Bale, who not only managed to sustain the weight of playing such an iconic character of batman, but also showed a very convincing portrayal of Bruce Wayne. i look forward to the sequel with great interest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman Is Back...And Does Not Disappoint!,"I loved this movie, just like a lot of other people. Everything just clicked. Excellent cast, terrific story, and great direction. Christian Bale nails the character of Batman perfectly. Michael Caine as Alfred is terrific as always. Cillian Murphy, wow! This guy has talent. He just had an eerie presence throughout the movie and portrayed Jonathan Crane AKA Scarecrow perfectly. Chris Nolan, where do I begin? This man is a genius. He does a great job of catching the setting of Gotham nails the character of Bruce Wayne and Batman. The story is intriguing and it makes you believe that Batman could actually exist but obviously you would have to have a lot of money. Maybe Bill Gates will be the next caped crusader! haha.This movie is excellent and is at least a rental for anyone who loves great movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
THAT's Batman,"This is the Batman that I've wanted to see. Michael Keeton gave a good feeling on the darkness that Bruce Wayne had in him, but you never knew why. I mean did Alfred teach him how to fight. It's answers to questions comic readers have pondered for years. And you finally find out ""where he gets all of those wonderful toys..."" The reason why he is a bat is also quite interesting, why not just dark suit guy? Batman never was about just getting the bad guys for fun or to punish them like another similar Marvel Character. He actually has a greater plan to make Gotham City a better place. It really separates Batmans from the vigilantes that are so often portrayed in the comics.

Finally an entertaining and very good Batman movie! ***1/2 out of ****,"I saw the other 4 batman movies and only the first and the second are quite good, the other 2 are really terrible because is not entertaining there, but this is one of my favorite superhero movies, great story, great actors, good action sequences,some intense thriller scenes, here all the requisites of a good superhero movie.I really liked the performance of Christian Bale because he is cold and Batman is cold, and he had the little sense of humor that Batman need to have a just man building a big lie and convince people to begin in the lie and believe in a good future of Gothic city fighting in this movie with Ras'Ghul played by Liam Neeson that did a quite job playing this character with little conviction I really liked the performance of Gary Oldman playing Jim Gordon, making of him the character of Batman Comics joining forces with Batman, he really played Gordon with excellent conviction and very seriously acting and in the second movie he really did for my opinion a very good performance.And this Batman become more interesting when appear actors like Michael Cane, Morgan Freeman,Cillian Murphy and Gary Oldman; they bring to the movie humor and humanity.With an excellent original score, with good visual effects, with good costume design, good acting and a great direction of Christopher Nolan, i recommend you to see this Batman Movie, this is really good and stunning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Didn't like the Batmovile or Katie Holmes, (guess i rather to have more like the original version) Loved Alfred and a Bruce thats more tormented, and not at all goofy (like Clooney made it) I don't care if they already made it i want to see all my classic villains in this kind of movie-making, i want the joker, Katwomen, poison ivy, and everybody else, but above all i would like to see the psychiatry's that was Bruce only and true love and went crazy.

Best Batman cast,"A redeemed and refashioned Batman. My congrats to Warner,Nolan and Goyer for a job well done.Christian Bale as Bruce and Batman is the best of the lot. Never I liked Tim Burton's Batman or any of Joel Schumacher and that disgraced Catwoman movie. So good to see the Batman persona so human and likable. Its a decent story and cool to witness the Batmobile as the love child of the Abrams tank and ferrari. The villain didn't eclipsed Batman and the creepiness by Cillian Murphy all in his eyes. Great job on his creepy Scarecrow mode.I'm still warming up to Batman's voice but its a minor flaw along with Nolan needing more experience in the action sequences. Christian Bale was good but even better thanks to his supporting cast like Michael Caine,Morgan Freeman,Liam Neeson,Gary Oldman,Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy were all riveting. The only female in the cast who is Batman's lady love by Kate Holmes she's also very very good. Rachel and Bruce still needs more exploring because its also intriguing and both are so fitting as a couple. They great romantic timing together. I really hope Nolan and Bale's teamship remains intact and characters Alfred,Gordon,Fox,Rachel all return and some Scarecrow resolution will be satisfying.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Christopher Nolan Hits a Home Run with Batman Begins,"I'm generally not an action movie fan; but this movie goes beyond the usual Hollywood white hat/black hat fare.The evolution of Bruce Wayne from wounded child to crime fighter rings true. The movie swings back and forth from past to present with finesse; and is easy to follow. The visual style of this movie is marvelous. It is beautiful.I love the casting. The characters are not cardboard, 2-D; but have motivations that hook in your interest and grow with time. It's believable, like good fantasy should be.Christian Bale as Batman is SO much better than Michael Keaton, or even George Clooney. Bale's body is honed, athletic and beautiful and he gives a first rate performance, from troubled, rebellious youth to matured man of honor.Liam Neeson also turns in a great performance as eccentric mentor; and the scenes in the Himalayas are original and stunning.This is the real deal.

The Best Batman Movie Ever!,"When fate prevents him from avenging the deaths of his parents, young Bruce Wayne flees to Asia where he seeks counsel from a dangerous ninja cult leader known as Ra's al Ghul. When he returns, Bruce finds that Gotham City has become overrun with crime and corruption, and that there are forces at work trying to remove him from his inherited place as the owner of Wayne Industries. Discovering a cave under Wayne Manor, Bruce assumes a new identity as a secret detective and guardian of the people of Gotham City against the criminals that plague them.I have to say, this is the first Batman film I've ever liked. I never liked the original Batman nor the second and third sequels. This film finally got it right! It has a dark atmosphere and is serious. I liked that the film started with the origins because I haven't learned of Bruce's life, yet (until now).This film is somewhat disturbing with it's (I thought I would never say this) realistic action scenes with some scary effects to enhance it. I liked the overall look of the film (dark and gritty) with a fantastic score and some good CGI.Christian Bale plays a fantastic Bruce Wayne and a great Batman. I also liked the supporting roles by Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson. I also liked the plot of the movie.I really have nothing else to say. This is a really nice addition to Christopher Nolan's collection of fantastic films. This is one of the best superhero films ever created and it's no family friendly film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
THE origin story,"Batman Begins is the ultimate superhero origin story, so good in everything it does that the caped crusader never needs another. It proves that none of the dark and gritty reboots that this spawned truly understood what they were imitating as this is so earnest and full of warmth. It clearly understands Batman in every aspect of his world and mentality whilst still letting the creative team here put their own distinctive style on the material.Christian Bale nails every aspect of playing both Batman and Bruce Wayne. He has the general physicality down which is insane considering he did this after The Machinist. The self-obsessed exterior of Bruce Wayne's playboy persona is there as well as the painful interior. When he's Batman the voice is never better with a stern yet softly spoken nature for friends and a much more intense rendition of it when interrogating enemies.He's supported by a wealth of talented actors given ample material to work with. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are equally likeable with both of them imbuing the film with the right amount of humour. Gary Oldman is a perfect Jim Gordon with an unwavering moral compass even as he feels defeated. Cillian Murphy and Liam Neeson are both great villains for completely opposite reasons.Christopher Nolan's direction is amazing with an unwavering commitment to practical effects that yields the best rewards. This film feels truly epic and is by far the most stylish rendition of Gotham out of his three films. The action is very choppy but Lee Smith's editing still manages to find a rhythm for it with some action scenes benefitting from the speed and intensity of it. Plus the weaker hand to hand combat is balanced out by a stellar car chase.The score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is magnificent. There's a real sense of triumph to it which builds beautifully during the grandest moments, of which there are plenty. Few scores have been as consistently thunderous and it still sounds unique compaared to previous Batman music. It doesn't go unnoticed in the quieter moments either with softer pieces that unlock the heart of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Where it all began,"The Batman Begins but somehow falls behind the Dark Knight. Its rare to see a sequel movie rated better than the first in a trilogy but in this case we have have to go back where it all began.The Dark Knight would not have existed if it wasn't for this movie and it setting up the story properly to have such a strong foundation for a sequel. The quote from the movie ""It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me"" can be applied directly to this movie as it gave birth to the Dark Knight and defined what the trilogy would become.Give credit where credit is due.

Awesome!,"i don't know where to begin. i love all things batman, and have seen all of the movies, and used to watch the television show in reruns, and i had very high hopes for the special advance screening i attended. also being a huge Christian bale fan, and not having seen him in anything substantial since 1994's little women, i was anxious to see if he would measure up to my favorite Batamn, Val Kilmer. well i have to say this is the best film of the 5, and Bale is even better than Val Kilmer was. Michael Caine made a lovely younger Alfred, and i loved the way we finally got to see where Bruce came from in his quest to protect Gotham. everything in this was much less cartoon like than any of the others, and that sense of reality added to the viewer's ability to be drawn in to the story. this is a darker, more emotional conflicted film than the others, but it is worth it. i loved that there are no wasted characters in this movie-everyone is important and that makes out easier to follow. my best sign that it was not just my opinion was when my husband loved it-even though he has always said how lame batman is-so-even if you are skeptical of batman as you know hi8m-go see this-it's not what you think.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Nolan leaves his mark on the Superhero genre.,"This is an amazing, an absolutely amazing film. With Batman Begins, director Christopher Nolan has gone back to basics, jettisoning both the silliness of the TV incarnation and the gothic and fetishist elements of the '90s version. This is a hard-core, down-and-gritty origin story - the tale of, as one might reasonably expect, how Batman begins. It isn't intended as a ""prequel"" to the 1989 film - not only is Gotham City a completely different place, but key events of the Batman chronology are re-spun. Batman Begins is designed as the start of a new life, a reboot for the franchise. In the process, Nolan has not only crafted the best Batman movie, but arguably the second-best motion picture superhero narrative. Christian Bale is very good as Batman and Bruce Wayne and although many people have criticized the rough coarse voice, I found it to be apt for the style and vision of this film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What it should be.,"So finally here, Batman Begins, and what a beginning! This chronicles Bruce Waynes journey and allows you to see just how Batman comes about. With the story so focused on him you may be forgiven to assume that the other characters would be sacrificed for this purpose. Not a bit of it, characters such as Ra's Al Ghul is given plenty of screen time and others such as The Scarecrow are shown enough to get the interest in the viewer and tee them up for the sequel. Casting is nigh on perfect and Christian Bale almost looks like he was born to play Batman! Michael Caine as Alfred raises a few eyebrows at first but again a class act. The story without giving too much away, is a great one which tells all it needs to with a twist towards the end which may surprise several and indeed sets things up for the sequel.

Batman Begins is Batman Reborn! Wonderful!,"I never did like Batman since I was a kid. (Morgan Freeman is a big fan of Batman the comic.) The previous movies were good and I enjoyed them - the character was made more realistic. The characters were not 2 dimensional. This is not just an action-adventure. This movie, in my opinion, brought the character of Batman up into the realm of drama. The chase scene seemed so real. The reaction of the cops seemed so real - as if unacted. (I found out watching the ""after movie"" info, that the director, Christopher Nolan, wanted this movie to be realistic - it WAS!) The entire movie is flawless. I will watch this one again and again.I first saw Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"" - I said I will never watch another movie with that guy in it (b/c of the role - not b/c of him). Once again I get to eat my own words and prove that I am an idiot. Mr. Bale went beyond the simple 2 dimensional image of Batman portrayed by Michael Keaton (Batman Returns - did a great job) and George Clooney (Batman & Robin - did a great job) and Val Kilmer (Batman Forever - did a great job). But Mr. Bale is able to not only act like the superhero, but is able to _act_ as a fool equally convincing. Wonderful is the operative word. I look forward to other movies starring Mr. Bale.Now to the ""supporting"" cast. I have never seen a movie so loaded with great actors in the supporting roles. HOLY MACERAL BATMAN - IT'S MORGAN FREEMAN!!! Michael Caine as Alfred?!? Liam Neeson as a villain?!? Gary Oldman as Gordon?!?!?

better than the previous two,"This movie is definitely better than the two before it. However tends to go off on a tangent at times. The movie also tends to become a bit of a drag. The second half is where the fun really is. All characters give a decent enough performance. However it is the support team comprised of Caine, Freeman and Neeson that elevates this movie. Michael Caine as the good old butler is impeccable and plays his role perfectly. Morgan Freeman is Lucius a tech expert at Wayne enterprise who provides batman his cool gadgets. Liam Neeson plays Docard the leader of a ninja gang in the east. Christian Bale in the title role as batman is so so, I have seen better performance out of this talented actor. The action is as expected dark and very believable and Nolan gives his own touch (a big improvement over Joel Schumacher) to the movie.

"Not the same Batman, i know that much","Whatever you think of Batman Begins, you kind of have to give more credit to X-Men and Spiderman for getting it right the first time. The execs at Warner Brothers have changed their minds over what they want to do with this superhero franchise of theirs that they go and retool it every two movies.So it's kind of disorienting watching this one, in ways good and bad. For one, I feel a little disappointed in the batmobile: it's more like a bat tank. Mainly, though, the story's a lot more complicated with its humongous cast of characters. If I didn't know any better, I'd guess there's a rule that anyone who's ever been nominated for an Oscar gets a coupon for a free role in a Batman movie that everyone's cashing in on (if you want to know the exact stats, which I hope you do because I spent 10 minutes researching this, 5 actors in this movie have earned 12 Oscar nominations between them), and they had to try extra hard to find parts for everyone., which led to some characters who just didn't need to be there. Like Morgan Freeman, for example, is a scientist who designs Batman's gadgets. I love Morgan Freeman but what exactly is he doing there? Doesn't Q belong with James Bond? Also, who's the real villain? Aside from making the story confusing, I think part of the fun of Batman is that you have this whacked hero dressed up as a bat and then you have even wackier villains with themes of their own, like a guy who dresses like a Penguin or the Riddler. With the exception of the Scarecrow, this movie doesn't really have that here. Unfortunately, I didn't really see the scarecrow that much, anyway. I think the reason for adding someone like crime boss Carmone Falcone was to show us how bad of a place Gotham is. Now Tim Burton didn't ever need to resort to that. He created such a dark tone that he could show us what Gotham was just by showing us a frame of it. I will add, though, that most people who see this movie will probably agree that Commissioner Gordon and Alfred are both two really strong characters in this movie and they add a lot, unlike the other movies where they kind of stand around and look like idiots next to Batman. So, as I say, the story's different but as it stands on its own, it really works well. It had the same piecing-together-of-the-puzzle element that the Star Wars III prequels had, which is real cool. If you've watched any Batman TV episode or watched any Batman movie, then you can't help but be intrigued by a movie that answers the questions, where did Batman get the idea for Batman, how did he get the batmobile or the batcave, where did he learn to fight?, etc.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Mr. Nolan, do you remember making movies?","The first half of this film is pretty good. The Tibetan Monastary scene is a rip from the Baldwin ""Shadow"" movie of 1994; but that was probably a rip from another film, so, what the hey. The second half of the film is pretty much of a redoing of elements from the first Tim Burton Batman film, and it really never lived up to the promise of the first half. The first half almost finds the real human beneath the Caped Crusader's cowl - an almost impossible feat, for any comic book movie, but Nolan nearly pulls it off. The second half, although a well-made action story, never gets back to this level of insight.But here's the real problem: Director Christopher Nolan made what is unquestionably, to my mind, the finest English language film yet made in the 21st century, ""Memento"". what the hell is he doing directing cartoons? Well, he made a lot of money and moved to Hollywood; that'll do it, I guess.On the DVD of ""Memento' there's a special feature interview with Nolan, in which he says that he much preferred looking through the camera lens while filming, to using a video recorder for instant playback. Given all the CGI in this bloated comic book movie, one could never imagine it made by the same director.Well, Chris? What happened? And when are you going to make a real film again? I'm sick of Hollywood buying out people of talent and turning them into 'blockbuster' fodder.Nolan, get real.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Some of the worst action sequences ever & no redeeming qualities,"The action scenes in this movie looked absolutely horrible. There's no way to know what's happening most time... and I knew Batman would win before I entered the cinema, so if there's an action scene I want to see what happens! For a superhero movie this is a capital crime (can you imagine a superhero movie without any fight? This wouldn't suit the genre!) I also found quite annoying the scene with the Batmobile... man, it seems they want to sell you one! They tried to tell us how cool the Batbmobile was all time, and the scene turned out to be pathetic.The starting scenes became boring by the eleventh time Neeson talked about his pseudo-philosophical view on fear. A pity, since this could have been good if it was just a bit shorter.As for redeeming qualities, I was upset to notice there were none! Not the acting, which wasn't so bad (except for Holmes annoying character, though perhaps it was written like that), but didn't help to save the movie. The dialogs were also just OK, except when they tried to sell us their rants on vengeance/justice/fear and the like -they were such a bore...If you aren't a hardcore Batman fan, save your money. And if you are, perhaps you will notice more irritating matters which I couldn't spot, so...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Batman begins Again,"Hollywood is now in complete auto-loop mode by remaking it's own movies. We are supposed to erase all four previous Batman movies and start all over again? So we return back to that fateful evening his parents were killed. And all intentions are that they are going to 'remake' the Joker episode too. This must be likened to that new catch term - a ""re- imagining"". How many rewrites do you think it took to have Batman 5 (or Batman Do-Over 1) to start with Bruce Wayne intentionally wasting away in a Thailand prison? This movie not only goes into far left field in terms of treating the kabuki of action movies, it goes into the parking lot. Another no-no is the lack of obligatory over-the-top action set pieces at least every 20 minutes or so. Here we get lengthy character development. But as one character declares - we are defined by our actions. The characters and the camera never stop moving. We float along the city of Gotham, or glide through other locations (which all seem to have high ceilings with catwalks).As the pieces start falling together in the second half of the film, our patience is rewarded with a solid lead character that we know intimately. So every action has meaning, and the action movie actually has a story. Ang Lee tried this with ""Hulk"" a few years back, but failed because the character development was dull and tedious. (see my review for more explicit details). Here, the whole story of bats as the source of childhood fear is far more interesting. Every step of Bruce's transformation is done with a more Down to Earth approach. This means there are flaws in Bruce's motives, and things don't always go to plan. Michael Caine is well cast as the surrogate father. Morgan Freeman seemed to be cast primarily because he is a big name. Christian Bale on his own is a risky gamble for the franchise. I enjoy his strong acting abilities, but that almost works against you when the audience needs to buy that you like running around in a batsuit. Katie Holmes still comes off as the requisite leading babe, but no complaints there. Thankfully, there are no goofy love games (such as that bogs down the 'Spiderman' movies) as these characters interact. The script successfully steers away from most clich√© plot follies. Bad guys are thankfully not all dressed up like Liberace. This movie also gets some points for being gritty, casting Liam Neeson (everything he does is excellent), and mostly for a script that was brewed long enough to have a refined taste.But once again, is all this enough to cover the fact that there are few jaw-dropping effects? For a guy like me who likes intelligent movies, the answer is yes. For the guy who needs to see an explosion every 10 minutes, the movie might drag. But for a 2 hour and 20 minute movie, it certainly did not drag at all for me. One thing I missed was a little bit of looseness of the characters. The movie almost never lightens up, and rarely has time for any fun humour. Others might be upset to see our hero attack the police, causing harm to men in uniform. It might be a little hard to sympathise with Bruce's desire to be a vigilante. This sometimes gives you an uneasy feeling about whether to applaud his actions. The script also carefully tiptoes around this grey area. The movie accepts that the police does not approve of those who take the law into their own hands. This is a strange clash of the real world versus the comic book world. But I for one am thankful that I don't have to see any more men in tights and goofy make-up. And god forbid please - no Prince music, MTV, or over- the-top set pieces.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
not that good,"I can't understand why this film got such a good rating. I'm not really a comic book fan, but this film just left me cold. It had a great cast and a promising young director, yet i left the cinema wondering why I bothered. Christian Bale only seemed to come to life briefly in the part of the film where Bruce Wayne adopts the American Psycho character ( which Bale did so well). I think this scene was at a party?!. Gary Oldman, another great actor, seemed to be cast in the wrong kind of role. Katie Holmes?! - enough said. Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie, as i expected this movie to be a million times better than the previous 2 batman films. It turned out, in my opinion, to be a photo finish for the winner. Can someone please tell me why this movie was good?",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Better Than People Think,"Batman Begins came out of nowhere to the world. It was introduced, and then slowly disappeared. No one even thought of it until Dark Knight came out. I believe because there was no cool villain. We want to see Joker, Penguin, or Riddler when we're watching Batman. Not someone like Scarecrow.Batman Begins was a great origin story. It showed exactly how Batman came to be, and it was painstakingly good in showing that. It is a much needed prequel to the Dark Knight franchise. Christian Bale is actually very good in this movie. He was a real Batman. Ben Aflleck seemed more fake.7 Stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Truly Batman does""Begin"" here","After years of waiting for the next Batman flick here comes a movie which gives us a totally new perspective of ""The Dark Knight"".The story spans the life of the person Bruce Wayne,the orphaned multi-millionaire boy and how he moves through his early life,the first days of his struggle to fight crime and how he finally transforms to Batman .We come to know more about Bruce,the ideologies he has,the sacrifices made and the hardships faced by him so as to finally become competent to fight crime. Light is shed on the unfamiliar part of Bruce's life, and this brings in a new dimension to the character of Batman. So as to do this the plot brings in characters who were untold in the previous stories and portrays them very well.We come to see him as a intellectual mind and a true detective and not any other vigilante who rushes to save the day.(A point not properly focused upon sadly by the previous movies).And as for the usual stuff the fans expect to watch this movie doesn't lag behind :his gadgets,his gravity defying moves and the Batmobile do prove to be breathtaking.The audiences might feel a bit alienated when the story moves much around the unknown years of Batman but then Nolan carries it off really well and finally gives us truly the beginning of this hero.If you are a true fan of Batman then this is surely not to be missed .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good movie but slightly overrated!,"Batman Begins is definitely a better movie than the earlier efforts but I was disappointed by the fast camera cuts, almost like a music video. Christian Bale is always good and also Michael Caine of course. But I'm getting really tired of Leam Nelson in his roles. He is annoying to look at and listen to. The action scenes was also way too dark and fast to be really satisfying, they looked cheap. I think the reason why so many people on IMDb has rated this movie so high is because they have been waiting so long for a new Batman movie.Worth a look but don't expect to be blown away.My rating: 6/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Been there! Done Bat! ...,"Watching BATMAN, either the old TV show or the various blockbuster movies, there is a huge lapse in logic that is hard to get around; namely, how can anyone, even a millionaire/billionaire like Bruce Wayne, amass all those gadgets and gizmos and superhero stuff and still maintain his secret identity? Okay, those gadgets in his utility belt aren't that big of a deal, assuming, of course, Bruce Wayne also happens to be a scientific genius. But how can you install a nuclear reactor in a cave under your mansion without somebody knowing it? Or custom build a Batmobile all by yourself? Superman and Spider-Man and the like are all pretty much self-contained superheroes, but The Batman, being human, has got to rely on a whole lot of other people to supply him with super gadgets. How could he trust all those people to keep his secret? BATMAN BEGINS tries to explain away such illogical gaps and, strangely enough, the explanations prove to be not all that interesting. For instance, basically all those wonderful toys seem to be army surplus junk that Wayne Enterprises couldn't palm off on the military. Okay, but oddly by supplying logical answers to Batman's mysteries, the film only seems to demystify the very mythology it is trying to perpetuate.Depending on one's point of view, BATMAN BEGINS is either a noble attempt to expand on the Batman legend, or like the STAR WARS prequel trilogy, a quiet, unwitting admission that the possibilities of the series have been milked dry. After over half the film illustrates the tedious exposition explaining how Batman came to be, the film becomes the standard superhero adventure, right up to the last minute confrontation with the villain and the saving of humanity.The film is exceedingly well made, but relies totally on formula: Bruce Wayne's early childhood trauma (check), his conversion to eastern mysticism/martial arts (check), his vow to fight evil (check), his confrontation with evil forces out to destroy Gotham City (check) -- check, check, check, etc., etc., etc. And do we really need yet another climatic chase through a major city where large chunks of real estate is wantonly destroyed, but where apparently no innocent lives are lost? For a film offering a new beginning, BATMAN BEGINS seems to suffer from a lot of been-there-done-that.To its credit, the film benefits greatly from the casting of Christian Bale as the young Bruce Wayne. As the other BATMAN films have shown, it is largely irrelevant who is in the Batsuit, since the character is largely played by a series of stunt men. But since most of this film deals with Bruce's metamorphosis, Bale has the talent to put a human face on the character of the millionaire playboy by being serious without being tiresomely intense, and still surprise the character with a bit of humor. Bale is backed by pros like Michael Caine (Alfred the butler), Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer and a surprisingly subdued Gary Oldman, all of whom are given little to do except give the film the credibility of their reliable presence.The film's villains, however, are problematic. Whether we are talking TV show or movie, in the past the villains have been the real star of the stories, with BATMAN pretty much playing straight man to whatever ""special guest villain"" is hamming it up center stage. Here, Batman is the main character and the evil-doers he must vanquish almost seem like afterthoughts. Crime boss Falcone (Tom Wilkerson) isn't interesting at all and the possibilities of Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow are never even nearly realized. And while it is refreshing to cast Liam Neeson against type as the film's ultimate villain, I have to admit I never believed him or his band of ninja warriors were ever a real threat. Nor does his plot to destroy Gotham City even make sense, either in philosophical intent or criminal execution.The film wants to avoid the over-the-top Jim Carrey/Jack Nicholson theatrics of the previous movies, but to what end? Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul doesn't quite measure up to the level of a James Bond villain, let alone rate being worthy of facing off against a comic book superhero. And having the final confrontation aboard a runaway elevated trains dares unfavorable comparisons to a similar action sequence in SPIDER-MAN II.Showing little of the imagination of his work in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA, Christopher Nolan's direction is efficient and largely effective, if not inventive. He seems to be going for a degree of realism, far removed from both the campiness of the TV series and the nightmare gloom that plagued the Burton/Schumacher series of films. Either way, the film seems to be playing it safe, obviously avoiding any risk that might threaten the studio's hope of turning the franchise into another cash cow franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Not since The Matrix...,"... has there been a film that is everything that you want it to be.With the Batman series so far, you have to give yourself over to the fantasy aspect, and cherish the performances of actors such as Nicholson in order to forget the more comic-book aspects of the films - and rightly so, before this.You could have questioned how a relatively 'straight' screenplay could possibly fare? In Batman Begins - BRILLIANTLY! Bale plays the straight and perversely charming Wayne, so much nearer to the TV series that introduced more of us to Batman than the comics. Cain plays his restrained loyalty perfectly, and Oldman plays his emancipated cop, empowered by his relationship with Batman, with a biting reality.It is, however, Bale's performance that stands out - a consummate actor and inspired casting, his character is believable, enigmatic, and complex - without being overly intense (a la Kilmer). Keaton has been knocked off the number one spot by a worthy winner in Bale.I don't know how it's done, but the directing of the actors enables Bale to gift us this character without competing with both huge stars and excellent character actors.Relying upon the films rather than the comics for my background in Batman, there are omissions of couple of fundamental story threads that I thought I would miss. Not so. Batman Begins has almost inexplicably succeeded in wiping the slate clean and starting again.It is this Batman that you care about, this Batman that you hope is delivered next time - intact, no actor changes, all supporting cast and film-makers in place, and please - no style changes! Tim Burton had his free rein in his second film and royally messed it up: dark does not need to be unwatchable.This is dark, at times scary and disturbing, superbly entertaining, and the filmmakers are in their element.Without knowing how the film would end, I spent the majority of the last third hoping the film wasn't about to draw to it's close. The lady on my left spent most of the film sitting forward on her seat and, apart from the laughing responses to well spaced jokes, a transfixed audience uttered not a sound.I made 4 phone calls on the way home just to rave about it - at 11 o'clock at night on a weekday, and for the first time in my life will be going back to the cinema to see a film again - Batman Begins.Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Schumacher Stain is cleansed,"This movie is perfectly executed. Perfectly cast, perfectly written, perfectly directed and all the performances are spot on. Extremely faithful to the source material without being hamstrung by the kind of literal-mindedness that ruined the Daredevil movie.The production design is incredible. Gotham is a perfectly believable dystopia, sort of like New York under a re-elected David Dinkins. The Batmobile deserves special mention too. By far the coolest version in the vehicles 60-year history, I promise you that what you've seen in the previews doesn't do justice to the actual chase scenes.This isn't a great comic-book movie.

Batman at His Best,"""Batman Begins"" joins the Superman films of the 1980s and both Spiderman movies as an example of a movie comic book adaptation at its best. This is no surprise with Chrisopher Nolan at the helm, the man who brought us ""Memento."" True to the unique take that Nolan has on Batman, this film is not a sequel to the other four, but rather a new beginning for the caped crusader (as the name suggests). Like the other films, Batman faces multiple villains at the same time, including an old-style gangster named Carmine Falcone (played remarkably convincingly by Tom Wilkinson, who would not have been my first choice), and a devious psychiatrist named Dr. Crane (who proves that looks can be deceptive). There is a third villain whose arrival on the scene comes as a shock to the audience as well as to Batman (no, it is probably not who you think it is!). Naturally, I will not give anything away, except to say that there is a history between Batman and this person that makes facing him or her a psychological challenge as well as a physical one.Of course on the down side, Nolan continues the comic book practice of giving the villains a stupid plot to attack Gotham City, but that is to be expected. I have yet to see a comic book adaptation where the bad guys came up with any truly brilliant ideas. Instead they come up with ideas like harvesting people's brain waves so that the villain can become smarter (an actual scheme from another Batman movie).Every comic book hero must have his love interest, who thankfully is usually an intelligent woman. In this movie, it is a young and idealistic assistant D.A. played by Katie Holmes, who does a fair job of it. Among the other supporting actors- Michael Caine is good as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman brings his usual professionalism to the role of Lucius Fox (who in spite of the name is not a pimp, but rather a developer of advanced technology for Wayne Enterprises). Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe are particularly good as the martial art experts who train Bruce Wayne, and the future Commissioner Gordon makes his appearance in the form of Gary Oldman, who has always been one of my favorite actors.This film is wonderful from beginning to end, although the scenes in the ice village at the beginning of the film were somewhat confusing, and required a great deal of concentration to follow. Hang in there, and it will pay off.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Batman to Believe in...,"Not to be too dramatic but we need a Batman. With all the injustice in our government and dark corners of the world, we need to believe that there could be Batman. And in my thoughts all involved in this film have delivered that to us. You leave the theatre believing in Batman, that you could see Batman saving someone and you see that anyone with the drive and means could be a hero - and thankfully you also see the ramifications, the human aspect; the cuts and wounds Batman receives on Bruce Wayne's body and the choices he must make to do what he must.I don't agree with comparing this Batman film to Tim Burtons since I feel they are different ideals of Batman and need to be seen as different films. I will leave you with this however; Batman Begins is Batman. The actors are their characters, the film-makers have made a FILM not a two hour waste of time.Thank you all who were involved, you've brought hope to Batman fans again!-A humble indie film-maker and comic book geek",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Batman ever - sorry Tim Burton,"Batman Begins is really the first movie of the franchise. The story predates Batman (the one with sappy Michael Keaton), and explains not only why Bruce Wayne, the rich orphan, became Batman, but also how he turned himself into the Dark Knight.And what a journey - Scaling the snow-capped mountains to seek a master to hone his martial arts, uncovering the amazing gadgets in his late father's company, scaring the hell out of the rogues, meeting Commissioner Gordon for the first time...Batman's methods to strike fear in the hearts of the baddies are finally explored in this fifth installment. Before that, all we know is that Batman is this costumed superhero with incredulous gadgets. Now we know why DC puts him on par with Superman and Wonder Woman. It's not how super or wondrous he is. It's how human yet effective Batman is that makes him such an intriguing superhero. And you have to give Christopher Nolan, the director (who directed one of my fav movie Memento) due credit. Tim Burton was close, but Nolan nailed it right on the head.Some of the best things of Batman Begins: 1. Best Batman - Christian Bale. Better bod than Val Kilmer, better range than Michael Keaton, better everything than clown George Clooney 2. Best Commissioner Gordon - For once, he's crucial to the plot, and he deserved it. 3. Best Bat-chick - Kathy Holmes. Even Tom Cruise is falling head over heels for her. And you'll see why.The not-so-great stuff: 1. The most uncool Batmobile to date - It is the most realistic, I gotta admit, but a vehicle that's called a Tumbler just doesn't cut it for me. 2. Not very impressive villains - like the saying goes: ""it is the villains that make the hero"", and while Scarecrow and Raa's were interesting characters, they failed to hook me the way The Joker, The Penguin and Catwoman did.Nonetheless, Batman Begins lives up to the hype. The franchise is finally saved. Let the fun begins!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best Batman film of the five...,"This film is the salvation of the Batman films... erasing the devastating effects of the digression prone George Clooney train wreck ""Batman & Robin"".

"jumpy, discontinuous, confusing","First of all the first thing you're going to notice is that it doesn't make sense in the context of the original Batman film of 1989, although I don't think many people will care.The action sequences are so cut up and jumpy that unless you're either on speed of LSD, it will only seem like a jumble. The explanation for how Batman came to be is trite, but not so horrible as the laughable pseudo-spirituality/psychology into the mind of Batman.Katie Holmes is a lousy actress, or at least appears to be one in this film and Christian Bale even though he's not an incredible actor, leaves her in the dust multiple times. Cillian Murphy doesn't make a good villain either. He's about as menacing as a waiter.And BTW - if you're a stickler for science like me, microwave energy wouldn't just cause water to vaporize, it would do the same to a human body since it's mostly water too.

"fun, but makes no sense","Aside from a few ridiculous detours, this Batman is miles better than Batman Forever. It's also nowhere near Batman (or even Batman Returns) but most people won't care because it's also a lot funnier :) Here's where it all falls apart: a white guy (with a Korean name) flies into Tibet, taking over large portions of Asia's criminal underworld; with his new network of criminals, he builds a giant monastery to train the hordes of ninjas he will need to destroy Gotham City (which is halfway across the world). Sounds weak? It is, really, considering that none of it makes any sense from any angle the movie presents us with; however, spectacular execution and neat Bat-toys save this Batman from becoming another terrible Batman Forever-style turd. Christian Bale works hard to distract from the awful backstory he's given, and succeeds after the first hour is over. That hour, mind you, seems to last forever.

"""Batman in his true form""","I was 14 years old when Tim Burton's Batman came out in theaters. I loved it. Before that movie, all I knew was the cheesy 60's series filled with so much corny campy stuff, I always wondered why the Batman comic book covers looked so different in comparison. I blame those shows from the sixties for making me overlook the comics and pass them by and opt for the Marvel comics instead. But after 1989, I began purchasing Batman Comics and I realized Batman was a grim, dark tale of a person with split personality fueled by rage. Oh the comics were so different and I Instantly became a Batman fan at the age of 14.Burton's first 2 movies were dark, and his first was a Masterpiece due to great acting by Nicholson and Keaton's unemotional pokerfaced, cold portrayal of the dark knight. Burton's created a nice dark world, but it still was cartooned and campy. It came down to Burton being booted from directing the 3rd film because they said his movies were too dark for the children, and Burger King wasn't selling it's batman toys because Kids were not attracted to the films, so in comes Joe Shumacher and brought back the sixties all over again.Oh now the 3rd generation Batman is here. Sticking to the comic roots and I thank Chris Nolan for realizing that Batman can't be tampered with anymore because he is the darkest superhero. This film is filled with disturbing, depressing, and intimidating images of the dark knight, the way Bob Kane envisioned it. Too bad Kane could not be alive to see it. The character development engulfs the viewer, the direction seemed a little rushed in the beginning, but it slows down and builds slowly. When you see how the cave was conceived, the bat suit assembled but various military prototypes, and a realistic Batmobile, or should I say the ""Tumbler"". The movie has nothing in it that says, this man could never exist. Who engineered the bat-mobile in Batman Forever? those batwings and over the top gadgets are not here. Batman uses stealth as his main weapon. No flashy kung-fu fighting in this film, Nolan intended to show flashes of Batman, hiding and striking, hiding and striking, like some sort of Splinter Cell and Ninja assassin. But whoever has second thoughts about Christian Bale as Batman, then think again and just go see this film already. He is the best Batman, sorry Micheal, but you weren't scary enough, you didn't scare the hell out of me when you spoke. You were cold, but not a caged beast who had just been released from his prison, of not knowing his destiny, and not knowing his purpose. This film is great, the acting, casting , especially Neeson, Caine, and of course Bale. I give it a 10 out of 10. It's an 8.6 right now, and I think it might go down eventually, because despite that the movie is a little flawed--because Nolan is not really an action director. Some of his shots are too jerky jerky. The movie is not the greatest in terms of hand to hand combat. I know Nolan intended it to be this way, and Batman is still young here, so he still has time to get better. His Gadgets will probably get better in the next film, but despite my inability to accept Batman in this realistic depiction, and despite the fact that I didn't see some over the top action scenes, I still marvel as Nolan's filmmaking ability and cannot deny this film the title of masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This film is simply -talk talk talk talk boom boom boom boom-,"I was expecting a lot from this film since the rating for this movie was above 8. I mean how many films in IMDb got ratings above 8? Not many.I would have to say 8 is exaggeration. I would give it about 7. The reason being the way the director put together the whole film is so dull and obvious. Putting the heaps of 'talking' stuff in the beginning and all the exciting action part comes later towards the end. It's as if the director is telling the audience 'all right, here's the background story that you 'must' know,-talk talk talk talk talk- now here comes the 'Action'-boom boom boom boom boom-!'the end.Look at films like LOTR:ROTK. Peter Jackson puts the battle scenes evenly throughout the whole film and in between are the scenes that attempts to 'tell' us the story behind all the battle. This way the director fulfills his responsibility of delivering the story as well as putting in actions which makes the film 'exciting'. Or maybe it's easily said than done.In my opinion putting all the actions evenly throughout the film would have made the film a masterpiece. The action part was definitely worth watching.
