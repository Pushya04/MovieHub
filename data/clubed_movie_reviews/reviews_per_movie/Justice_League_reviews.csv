see the Zack Snyder version instead,"Don't waist your time on this bland, watered-down version of the movie, bungled by Joss Whedon and the mis-led executives who hired him. I mean, it's kinda fun, but forgettable, cause too mich of its gits were removed. Whereas, the newer director's cut by the original director, Zack Snyder, is the lengthy, epic extravaganza the story needs!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Justice League is, unfortunately, plagued with post-production issues.","Here we are. The Justice League. DC's greatest superheroes come together to save the world...and what is the first scene you ask? Henry Cavill's CGI'd shaved face. Ohhh dear...yup...we're in for quite a ride. So with Superman dead, Batman and Wonder Woman must arrange a team of gifted individuals to stop the world destroyer Steppenwolf from, you guessed it, destroying the world. Sighhhh...I kinda just want to hug this film and repeatedly whisper ""there, there...it'll all be alright."". Apprehensively, I went into this unmotivated and expecting the worst superhero film since Suicide Squad. Fortunately, this isn't that bad. But, it's not great either. The film's greatest achievement is the coalition of the Justice League members. Their interactions, mannerisms and even their physicality was pretty much on point. Aquaman, although absolutely useless in this, had the physical prowess of a beastly underwater warrior. The Flash was quirky and provided several comedic moments. Cyborg was essentially the technological logistics manager. Wonder Woman and Batman were the parents who lead their children into battle. Heck, she even refers to them as children! Yet it all worked so well. Remember, this is a comic book adaptation, so the humour and light hearted nature of its source material does show. The human CGI for the most part was actually executed well (far better than ""Thor Ragnarok"") and the slow motion scenes with The Flash were gorgeous to watch. Snyder is typically style over substance, which is apparent here. The story is so boringly uninspired that it defines the word ""lazy"". I cannot be dealing with another 'save the world' situation. I'm also becoming irritated with underused, bland and weak villains who are supposed to be absurdly powerful. Steppenwolf was wasted potential. Constant use of green screen, hit and miss script, rushed third act...just too many flaws I'm afraid. Was it too soon for a Justice League film considering no origins for Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg yet? Personally, I think so.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big-budget superhero mash-up switched directors in midstream,"When an alien invasion, led by the sinister Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds in a motion capture performance), seems imminent, Batman (Ben Affleck) recruits the world's heroes to stop it. He seeks out Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), but their combined power may not be enough, and they realize the one missing factor that could turn the tide of battle: the recently deceased Superman (Henry Cavill).This was another tortured production, with director Zack Snyder leaving the project either due to a death in the family or by the studio's insistence, depending on the source. Joss Whedon was brought on to finish the movie and ended up reshooting some earlier scenes. The final product seems rushed, under cooked, and dreadfully overloaded with too much unnecessary CGI effects. The common weakness in many of these superhero movies is the villain, and this is yet another example of that. The character is fully CGI and looks it, and it's difficult to feel menace from a cartoon in a non-animated movie. And the worst part is, it wasn't even needed, as the character was a normal human-looking person in the comic books, and the actor hired to basically just provide the voice, Ciaran Hinds, is a very good actor and would have been fine without the CGI embellishment. Another glaring visual flaw lies in Superman's mouth. Since the shoot ran over, Superman actor Henry Cavill was contractually obligated to start his filming on the upcoming Mission: Impossible film, a role that requires him to grow a bushy mustache. When he had to come back for reshoots on Justice League, the producers decided to just CGI out his mustache, with the end result a laughable, often deformed upper lip.On the plus side, Ezra Miller is amusing as The Flash, Gal Gadot continues to look great as Wonder Woman, and Momoa makes for an interesting twist on Aquaman, who is nothing like his comic book counterpart. Many of the acting heavy-hitters, including Amy Adams, Diane Lane, and Jeremy Irons, are just cameo window dressing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This Above Average film by DCEU has got Enough Explosion to be called a Safe film.,"JUSTICE LEAGUE REVIEW : It was one of the Most Awaited flick for me during pre release period but later Critics reviews declared it an Average to Below Average film and i lost all that year built excitement in minutes. Let me say it straight, i'm not reviewing a Great film, i'm talking about Average film so if you see any soft corner about any field then that means Average one not even Good.Justice League starts very slowly, looks like a bore flick for first 35-40 minutes and then picks up smartly. Later it continues the flow but after every explosive and entertaining scene there're 1 or 2 minutes loo breaks followed. Don't know why it happens, why film gets slow for few moments when screenplay was in top form? Then enough explosion at the end and later one surprising factor after end credits saves this Average flick to look an Above Average stuff. We've seen Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman in prequel and i'm glad to welcome 3 new guys in the team, Aquaman is Good, Flash is too good, Cyborg is decent. Some musical scenes feels irritating. Runtime is shorter than 2 hours and thanks to the editor for that but how could he trim that Superman's re-entry scene from Trailer (Alfraid says, Let's Hope you're not too late) ? Superman's Returning is slightly curved towards emotional bonding but it doesn't work at all. Villain is powerful but a fairy tale and retro look doesn't impress much. Visual Effects are Brilliant, could have been better for 3D viewing. Direction is messy, Snyder either needs to improve or needs to be removed from DCEU. We're waiting for One Good film from him and we're still waiting. Thanks to Jenskine for that one good film Wonder Woman otherwise Snyder has almost finished DCEU. Why he always go for a Dark film, why can't he just go for some fun and light moments like Marvel?Overall, Justice League is an Above Average film, obviously not that bad as critics said. Chuck the critics and go for it, those who liked BvS will surely like this and those who did not like BvS will also find it an Average One Time Watch. Enough Explosion and action in middle and at the End makes this one to worth your ticket Purchase. Talking about Box Office this one should do decent business in the range of previous 2 DCEU films or might even struggle to reach there while $1 Billion club is out of reach. I'm going with 6/10* and hoping for better a sequel which will have a League of Villains (This might be a spoiler).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The end of good DC movies,"Imagine history backwards. Imagine that you were lucky enough to watch the Edward J. Olmos' version of Battlestar Galactica first, and then, after a while, they came back with the Lorne Green's version of it. That's exactly what happened with this Marvel-infected version of the Justice League.Gone is the brooding menace of what people with these special skills would harbor in real life. Gone is the sense of peril when you have the whole world at risk of being destroyed by god-like forces. Gone is the beauty of imagination beyond what Marvel would ever deliver.This is a parody of what the DCEU gave us before.We were THAT close to have a Justice League movie worthy of being called art; instead, we got another forgettable Marvel movie.Thanks for what you gave us, Mr. Snyder.Shame on you, Weldon, for ruining the art of bringing comic books to life.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining but flawed,"So after seeing Batman vs Superman, I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film. The trailer, particularly, with it's sacrilegious abomination cover of the Beatles' Come Together, gave me mixed feelings about it.DC have been playing catch-up with Marvel for ages, and it really shows. Half of the Justice League have already been introduced from previous films. The others (Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg) are given their proper debut here (no, I'm not counting their brief cameos in the other films) and the film does its best to integrate them into the story.The film is your standard 'evil overlord tries to take over the world' plot, with Batfleck trying to assemble the Justice League. The team have some funny lines occasionally, which I feel is thanks to Joss Whedon being one of the screenwriters, but once again, the Zack Snyder tropes come to the surface with numerous sped up/slo-mo action scenes. There were also a few lines of dialogue that made me cringe.The film overall is enjoyable but there are pacing issues. The villain of the piece is particularly forgettable. They try to build this sense of scale that looks grand and epic but ultimately it doesn't quite live up to the hype, in my opinion.If we're talking about wasted potential, how about JK Simmons as Commissioner Gordon? I really hope he has more time to shine in future films because he had no reason to be in this film other than establishing his presence in the DC Universe. Also, speaking of wasted talent/useless characters, Amy Adams as Lois Lane... I swear to God, her character development is halted in its tracks beyond simply 'I love Superman'. It's ridiculous.That aside, the main heroes perform well here. I particularly enjoyed Ezra Miller's interpretation of the Flash. Jason Momoa is just awesome in everything. Gal Gadot is great as Wonder Woman, yet again, Ray Fisher makes a good Cyborg (I found it ironic that his Dad was the actor who played Miles Dyson in Terminator 2) and Ben Affleck continues to be great as Bruce Wayne.Not terrible, not fantastic, but it's in the healthy middle ground for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
it is awesome,"the movie is fun to watch, I am a DC fan, I have to admit it so I have watched this movie about 5 times to fully get all the stuff this movie offered. Differently, from the edgy tone of Suicide Squad or Batman vs Superman, this movie is just like a real-life version of the old justice league animated series. The movie has its moment, maybe too long with too much detail just in case for newcomers, and I am OK with that. What I'm trying to say is, don't expect an Oscar worthy movie or a deeply underrated masterpiece like Watchmen, the movie is fun to watch, it has its tone, one of the closest live action of the old justice league animated series. 9/10 because there is no green lantern, there cant be any justice league without Hal Jordan or John Steward",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not as good as I hoped,"This film tells the story of Batman and Wonder Woman putting a team together to fight against evil forces who try to bring the fragments of the mother box back together.The visual effects are very impressive, and the story is very fast paced. In fact, it is so fast that it sacrifices the story telling. The main backbone of the story is there, but there's no cohesion, engagement and no captivation. The plethora of characters also mean that each of them get little screen time, hence there's little developer of characters. I thought I was just being fed some fragmented scenes. The socially awkward young guy tries too hard to provide comedic relief, that it makes the heroic efforts of the league less credible. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this film as much as I thought I would.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bloated and Poorly Executed...so an Improvement,"If Batman V Superman is the oozing, puss-filled, body wound to the DCEU than Justice League is the haphazardly applied bandage that's currently dressing it. It works at least as far as mitigating the damage, stopping the bleeding and keeping this ugly-looking spectacle alive, but it's not exactly the miracle cure for the mountains of ills currently plaguing the DCEU that fans were hoping for. What exactly does that make Suicide Squad; I don't know, probably the gangrene?Seemingly only a couple of weeks since the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince aka Batman and Wonder Woman preemptively team-up to protect the world from external threat. To help them, they recruit young upstarts Barry Allen and Victor Stone aka The Flash and Cyborg; as well as marine demigod Arthur Curry aka Aquaman. This is so they can face down the eventual threat of the sinister Steppenwolf and his army of fear-fueled creatures from places unknown aka some inter-dimensional/space traveling hypno-beam (the film is not clear on this point).Starting with the good, the films as-of-yet introduced superheroes are interesting enough characters handled with the best of care by their actors. Miller especially does an excellent job keeping the mirth coming while staying true to the spirit and tone of The Flash and movie respectively. Momoa straight up shows up as Momoa sans the dreads but the rock star bravado he's known for works and works well all things considered. Fisher pulls double duty as a near constant fountain of exposition as well as a living breathing character worth investing in. It doesn't always work given the paragraphs worth of beans he needs to spill but at least no one is calling him the professor yet.The brightest star however is Gadot whose stunning beauty and otherworldly accent perfectly encapsulates every superficial thing we love about Wonder Woman. On a deeper level, Diana's naiveté from the fondly revered Wonder Woman movie is gone, but what's still there is an inner strength that both serves to ground this movie, while being an understandable progression of a character now centuries old.The fact that Wonder Woman is the only character worth not just caring for but believing in should be an indication of what's the biggest problem with this movie. Even with the Batman in the mix, the stitched-together cadre feels less like the world's mightiest heroes and more like a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. They're given just enough time to go over their skill set and motivations but its all bullet points and untrimmed fat that at times derails the film's pacing. Take a scene transition early on where Bruce Wayne is buttering up Aquaman. This scene is then set against Wonder Woman's action-packed introduction, an edit that arguably works on a narrative level but feels jammed in there like a Janis Joplin tune played just after a cover of ""Come Together"".What's worse, Justice League always seems to be in a rush to get somewhere guaranteeing moments of depth and exposition stick out harshly against the action. Bruce Wayne jets here and there, Steppenwolf picks a fight with the Amazons and the Atlantians, Wonder Woman comes swooping through a terrorist plot etc. It's all action-packed in its own bruising, unremarkable way, but none of it is good at conveying information, establishing stakes or forwarding the plot.Luckily the plot is so simple as to ensure the slow bits are over quickly. Evil-because-he's-evil Steppenwolf wants all the shiny cubes and our protagonists are doing everything in their power to stop him. That's basically it, a first draft good versus evil macguffin hunt that seems to be avoiding themes from the other films until a certain subplot makes it impossible. It doesn't add anything to the genre that they're fighting the third DC villain in five movies with a horned helmet on some power trip about world destruction but at least it makes sense this time around.And before you go huffing and puffing about how the complex mythology behind Superman, Darkseid and the infinite Earth crisis is justification for the repetitiveness; you need to first read the forthcoming sentence aloud and slowly. Movies do not require homework! Knowing the larger purpose and machinations of a motherbox is no more an indication of this movies quality than reading The Dark Knight Returns retroactively makes BvS not a pile of garbage. Enough makes sense this time around but it's still repetitive.And can we take a moment to talk about Batfleck again? I was very loudly not a fan of his older, reactionary Batman in BvS but since that movie was such a dumpster fire, I was willing to give everyone involved a mulligan so long as this one was at least passable. It is, but the poor man still looks like a bewildered stepfather who won the part in a raffle and continues wearing the cowl because his stepson finally thinks he's cool. It's just not a good use of your Affleck. Affleck is good for two things: being an a**hole and being a quiet blank slate a la his character in Argo. Batman is neither of those things but thanks to Affleck he comes across as both. Not something you want for the founder of the Justice League.A reported $25 million worth of reshoots, the unexpected absence of director Zack Snyder due to personal reasons and a shaky foundation built upon the most hated franchise movie to come out since Batman & Robin; it's actually kind of impressive this thing didn't turn out worse. It's not up to the level of another team-up movie that shall remain nameless but at least with Justice League, DC and Warner Bros. prove they're slowly learning from their mistakes. I admire this movie, I really do, but to the extent that I'd admire a fat guy running a marathon. It's trying; it's just too ill-prepared and bloated to do the job efficiently.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just an okay superhero film.,"I'm really not a fan of superhero movies, but I'd give some thoughts of this movie. 'Man of Steel' and 'BvS' were crap (except the cinematography in Man of Steel), I liked 'Suicide Squad' a lot, but 'Justice League' was an okay film with some fun scenes. Let's talk about the characters; the only characters I liked are Wonder Woman and the fastest man alive. I haven't seen 'Wonder Woman' yet, but she's really that hot af, and her character makes me want to see her own movie. Aquaman is okay character, nothing special. Batman is just boring af.. Cyborg is also forgettable.Effects and fighting scenes didn't even impressed me anyway. It was too much, and it looks like they really tried so hard to make us 'Wow!', but it didn't even make me. It's just a film with lots of fighting scenes that didn't impressed me which will be forgettable movie someday. I'd give it a 6.5/10 for some good scenes and the characters as I mentioned (without those characters I liked, it would be 4/10).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's far from great, and not always very good, but at least it steers clear of awful.","What would you do if three out of four films in your blockbuster superhero franchise aren't particularly good? When going forward with the fifth film (the all-important one that ties everything together and launches it into the stratosphere), do you stick with what you know? Or do you try to learn from the outpouring of love and acclaim that greeted Wonder Woman, the outlying fourth film? Do you add more humour and a dash of fun to the generally dark, dour proceedings? Do you refine your script to focus a little more on character and less on bombastic spectacle? In the case of Justice League, the answers – and corresponding results – are mixed. (Kinda, kinda, yes, kinda, by the way.)Justice League opens in the wake of Superman's (Cavill) death. The world – and his erstwhile frenemy Bruce Wayne/Batman (Affleck) – are in a dark depression. But cataclysmic sieges on a planetary scale wait for no man (or woman). Steppenwolf (played by Hinds via motion-capture), an ancient, alien evil that once tried to claim Earth as his own, has returned with an army of fear-fuelled parademons. Bruce realises that, without Superman as the first and best line of defense, he needs to assemble a team (a 'justice league', as it were) to save the world.Consequently, the first half of the film is rather exposition-heavy, as it busily sets up its characters, relationships and stakes. Bruce reunites with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gadot), just as she's begun to step out from beneath the shadow of grief. We also get to know the other potential League members that we've only glimpsed in passing – snarky speedster Barry Allen/Flash (Miller); sassy fish-whisperer Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Momoa); and surly human machine Victor Stone/Cyborg (Fisher).Thankfully, Justice League isn't as relentlessly dark and joy-free as director Zack Snyder's previous entries in the DCEU. While there's nothing wrong with going full grim when putting superheroes on screen (Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy proved that you could do so with depth, flair and intelligence to burn), Snyder's Man Of Steel and Batman Vs. Superman were curiously bleak pictures. Stuffed with bombastic spectacle and testosterone- charged face-offs, both films were more or less dreadful, displaying a fundamental misunderstanding of their main characters. (Cavill's broody Superman, in particular, is a painfully misguided interpretation of DC Comics' most iconic superhero, a literal and figurative beacon of light.)In contrast, there's a brighter vein of hope and humour threaded throughout Justice League, though it's unclear just how much of that can be credited directly to Snyder. The main reason for that is the involvement of Joss Whedon, who wrote and directed Marvel's two enormously successful and largely acclaimed Avengers films. Initially brought on to doctor the script, Whedon wound up overseeing post- production on the film (including significant reshoots), after Snyder chose to take some time off for very sad personal reasons.Without question, the final film benefits from the injection of Whedon's signature banter and his ability to effectively juggle multiple character narratives. Whether it's Barry and Victor bonding in a graveyard or Arthur's big speech before the final battle, Whedon contributes some of the most purely fun – and funny – moments in the DCEU to date.Characters and relationships, though more sketched than fleshed out, work well enough. As the film progresses, each member of the fledgling League works out who they want to be, as people and as the earth's self-appointed defenders. The newcomers are all decent, though not quite the breakout successes the studio is no doubt hoping for. Miller's Flash starts out adorable but ends up annoying. Momoa is underserved by the script, but nails the swagger. With just half his face to work with, Fisher amps up the angst while buried beneath some oddly ugly character design.As for DC's Big Three, it can be tough to buy into Diana's decades-long descent into grief following the character-defining climax of Wonder Woman. But, given that her arc is necessarily dictated by earlier narrative decisions, Gadot finds some lovely emotional beats to play as Diana chooses to lead and share her light with the world. The film also nudges the hitherto badly-botched relationship between the late Superman and Lois Lane (Amy Adams, still criminally underused) in a better direction.The biggest surprise of Justice League is how Affleck's Batman – almost rabidly xenophobic in Batman Vs. Superman – grounds both the film and the team. There's something hauntingly poetic about watching this taciturn loner, who could so easily hide himself away in a fortress of wealth and power, trying to atone for the world's loss of Superman. Embracing the fact that he's by far the most mortal member of the League, the film finds the heroism in Batman's humanity.For all that it gets right, though, Justice League suffers for being what it largely still is: a Snyder blockbuster. He tends to favour overblown spectacle and one-dimensional villains, both of which culminate in the peculiarly unmenacing Steppenwolf – a CGI-drenched creation that manages to be hammy and fake all at once. The plot is, somehow, stupidly convoluted and insultingly simple at the same time. ('Mother Boxes' must be another way of spelling 'MacGuffin'.) And, while absolutely everything about this film is better than what Snyder has produced before, it still never quite grabs the heart.Nonetheless, Justice League is a step in the right direction. It doesn't reach the glorious heights of Wonder Woman, but it doesn't regress to the murky depths of Batman Vs. Superman either. With its story and characters turned firmly towards the light, there might be hope for this franchise yet.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
#releasethesnydercut,"I saw the theatrical version of justice league and felt it as a blatant copy of avengers. After that I saw it's first trailer before Snyder's exit, I felt how awesome it would be if the original version released. One element whedon forgot to add which was one of the reasons for the success of avengers is chemistry between the actors. Avengers had memorable chemistry of tony-cap, tony-banner, thor-hulk, nat-cap, nat-banner and nat-clint. But here there is no chemistry between the leads at all. Batman, aquaman and cyborg were wasted.

"Quite entertaining, by the standards of the animation episodes..","Not sure what movies the critics e.g. rottentomatoes watched..as conspiracy theories go, one is tempted to wonder if they were paid to tear apart, and it looks inconsistent esp considering they loved Wonder Woman..Anyway I think JL has nailed it, by the standards of the animation episodes which I thought are quite entertaining..Ben Affleck nails it as Bruce Wayne and as Batman, Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman..and finally they've got Superman right (to me)..and Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman are great as well (also Jeremy Irons is great as Alfred), and maybe this is a good precursor to their standalone movies..It's worth keeping in mind that this is a superhero flick, an escape, a fantasy etc -- if one wants a real life uplifting catharsis, one should stick with The Shawshank Redemption and so on.. JL is certainly not perfect, it does not do character development on the scales of the Dark Knight or some such..but it is definitely entertaining, fast-paced, positive and relatively lighthearted, and the characters are mostly placed correctly (at least along the lines of the animation episodes), as individuals and as part of the League.. this is certainly comparable to Wonder Woman in terms of how hopeful it feels overall.. and in some (inexplicable!) sense Synder's take on the previous movies also makes a bit more sense now, within this universe..at some level..

"Doesn't quite do 'Justice League' justice, better than anticipated though","Having been underwhelmed by the waste of great potential that was 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (not terrible but rather lacklustre) and seeing that critical reception was not particularly good, expectations for 'Justice League' were not very high.Although it has major problems, 'Justice League' turned out to be better than expected. Contrary to the constant critic bashing, which to be perfectly honest has gotten out of control and extremely annoying fast for a while now, critics get a good deal of respect from me. Even when my opinions differ to theirs, which has happened a fair number of times, their appraisals and criticisms are very understandable and it is easy to see where they are coming from. 'Justice League' is a case of the film being much better than anticipated, considering the word of mouth and 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' being so disappointing. Is 'Justice League' better than that film? Yes, by quite a bit.'Justice League' does have its problems. Although the CGI is pretty good on the whole, there is an over-reliance of it and it doesn't always add to some of the scenes. The story has its fun and excitingly compelling moments, but a lot of it does feel rushed, which does see too many abrupt tonal and storytelling shifts, and some of the first half has a cobbled together and rambling quality. Am usually not one to carp about plot holes, much of the time it is a lazy criticism to me, but one can fit the Grand Canyon through some of them and some border on the ridiculous.The rushed pacing does come at the expense of character development, which tends to be rather flimsy. Particularly true to this is the villain, there is nothing menacing or remotely interesting about him, he's basically a very dull just there sort of character. Ciaran Hinds is completely wasted, while Ray Fisher is somewhat dull. Not all the jokes work, some feel out of place, while the final battle could have had more excitement and Danny Elfman's music score is uninspired and forgettable.On the other hand, most of the acting is very good. Ben Affleck brings a brooding intensity to Batman and he didn't seem that bored to me. Other bright spots in the cast are Jeremy Irons' very amusing Alfred, Amy Adams' feisty if somewhat underused Lois Lane, Jason Momoa's beautifully judged Aquaman and particularly Gal Gadot's positively show-stopping Wonder Woman. Ezra Miller is amusing, if at times slightly too introverted, as Flash and Henry Cavill looks much more comfortable here than he did in 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Diane Lane and JK Simmons are also welcome presences.Visually, 'Justice League' is beautifully shot, far more cohesively edited and its boldly dark and gritty look fits very well within the story. The script is less clunky and dreary and lightened by some nice quirky humour and some jokes are amusing, especially the absolute hoot that involves the magic lasso. The action is mostly nicely choreographed and fun to watch, some of the characters are interesting and the chemistry is great.In summary, could have been much better but to me it wasn't that bad. 5.5-6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

not an enterprising innovator but a formulaic stepping stone,"Riding on the coattail of WONDER WOMAN's stirring triumph, Zac Snyder's JUSTICE LEAGUE is emulating DC's THE AVENGERS (2012), only 5-year has become such an oceanic gap in our time of superhero surpluses, which means financial turnover would be a letdown in spite of its immense appeal.The elephant-in-the-room and main selling point is the resurrection of Superman (Cavill), an open secret the film intractably refuses to divulge in its numerous trailers and posters, which comes about in the mid-point and temporarily instigates a mini-internecine scuffle, just to show who is the boss, before getting lovey-dovey and melancholic with Lois Lane (Adams), who is too poised to give away even a smidgen of incredulity (which says a lot about the comic book culture itself).As the inauguratory piece, JUSTICE LEAGUE's chief task is to assemble the cohort, thus the premise is set up by the resurgence of Steppenwolf (CGI-generated and voiced by Hinds), to reign the universe in darkness, the film's strongest visual input is surprisingly in the the first half, when Steppenwolf tentatively assaults the empyrean Themyscira (Amazons' homeland) and underwater Atlantis to snatch the almighty ""mother boxes"", and the fleeting flashback of how Steppenwolf is subdued for the first time, it has an epic whiff of panache and otherness, which diminishes when the war relocates on human's turf (a remote Russian village is circumspectly chosen for the climax after learning the lesson from the aftermath of laying waste to a highly-populated metropolis), with a bathetic revelation that perhaps, Steppenwolf's power is vastly overestimated, because he is categorically no rival of Superman, the quintet might just as well finish him off sans the film's obvious deus ex-machina. It is expected to pull punches in the league's first official sortie, but by enervating the villain who is introduced as an omnipotent monster in the beginning is a lame move (THOR: RAGNAROK on the contrary, fabricates a more plausible finale).For all the quibbles, there are several plus points too, firstly, it is a sage move to accentuate Batman's mortality, which begins to tell when fighting side by side with those superpower endowed, and he is considerably relegated to combat with the minions called Parademons in the showdown, a cross to bear for a mortal, and let's hope Bruce Wayne will take the hint and step down from the front-line in the next chapter, not because an elderly Alfred (Irons) does need a replacement to stay in front of all the consoles and screens, but also due to the fact that Diane Prince (Gadot) is ready to take the rein as a true leader for all mankind, it is time, right? Secondly, in a less solemn note, Ezra Miller's Flash jovially assumes the role as the comic purveyor because humor is what is wanting in DC's previous critically-panned tent-poles, because the delicate balance between levity and gravity is always the sticking point which does make a difference in audience's reception and the film's own worth.All in all, JUSTICE LEAGUE is not an enterprising innovator but a formulaic stepping stone to tantalize us that the next offering will be more toothsome, more grand and more arousing, but patience is dangerously wearing thin and interest will dry out someday, speaking for the reviewer himself, that day is beckoning.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dull,"Justice League felt like going through a list of specifications with no identity whatsoever. It's not a bad movie per se, it's just extremely dull. Of course there's nothing new in the photo department but that's to be expected, it's kind of an identity for the whole DCEU. I don't like it but hey, that's an artistic choice I won't criticize here, at least it's coherent. But some flaws are more crippling than that.Every single characterization was a bit off and some of them felt like they were forced, especially Barry Allen. Still, the actors do the best they can with the material so it's not unbearable.Every situation (and even the chain of events) is so predictable (cliché even) that it gets you out of the movie. This level of ""nothing new"" is damaging to the story as it stops you from caring about anything. And it seems like the producers knew this cause they threw in the mandatory helpless family so that you could sense the danger a bit more. After all, it's just the end of the world, how could you care if there was no kid in immediate danger ? Oh wait... Still, even that falls flat as their scenes (and they're not the only ones) are filled with incoherent behaviors that were put there just so that the plot can go forward.I attended a screening where the only bursts of joy (or emotions at all) occurred when a new character appeared. Kind of a ""fanboy effect"" that fills you with hope at the sight of one of your beloved comics characters. But the rest of the time, everyone was quite bored and numerous sighs were heard. In a sense, it reassured me as I understood I was not the only one who was disappointed in the movie.*****The following paragraph might contain a minor SPOILER (depending on what you consider a spoiler)*****Plus, something else bothered me. But I know everyone won't agree on this one cause it's kind of a speculation. All the points above still stand even if I'm wrong about it. So here it is : Justice League felt like it was a failed attempt to adapt the Avengers in the DCEU. And I'm not talking about the strangely similar theme. Nor am I referring to the tension inside the team before they reconcile that felt like a watered-down version of what we saw in the 2012 movie by Whedon. But the characters are bent so that they match their Marvel counterparts. The Flash takes the place of the slightly weaker and wisecracking Hawkeye, Aquaman clearly corresponds to Thor with his royal and out-of-place persona, Wonder Woman goes through the same soldier- leader dilemma as Cap did and even Batman is slightly changed so that he's closer to Tony Stark (making decisions that make absolutely no sense for the world's best detective that we all know and love). That's a shame cause DC characters are interesting and have a lot more to offer than a mere copy.*****END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER*****As of 11/16/2017, this movie has an 8.1 score here on IMDb. Now I'm not a hater and won't say it's the worst movie in history but more than 8 ? Seriously ? It barely does the job so it's a 5 out of 10 for me.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not offensively bad but not good either... so shallow,"This was completely ""meh"" in most every way possible. Not offensively bad like Batman V Superman, but certainly not good either. Everything came across as shallow and the CGI bad guy is the absolute worst. Why on earth did they need to go all CGI and not use an actor?I do totally agree with studio execs that forced them to keep the run time under two hours. Since everyone NOT Wonder Woman in this cinematic universe is terribly one dimensional, adding thirty minutes or more of mindless prattle would have been a terrible idea. Basically, there is no developing characters this shallow to start with... might as well go all video game cut scene action. As for Wonder Woman, THAT is the true ace the WB has going for them. Not the character so much as the actress they stumbled upon to play her. Talk about finding absolute gold. Gal Gadot hypnotizes and captivates on screen no matter what she is doing. Add action to her natural beauty and charm and you literally can't get enough of her in to the story. I'm sure they realize that the focus should be on her from here forward.Of the new characters, only Cyborg has any hint of depth at all. Both Flash and Aquaman are cardboard wastes so far. So, the DCEU is truly stuck in the shallow end of the pool but maybe Wonder Woman can single-handedly tow the universe to deeper and more interesting waters.Best overall quote I've read: ""Justice League was the cinematic equivalent of watching a classmate give a presentation they totally forgot about""",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow. I didn't see that coming,"Wow. I've just watched Justice League and have to admit, I don't know if it's my incredibly low - or virtually nonexistent - expectations, or the fact, that I'm a little sick right now, or the low price of admission, but this movie is the first one in the DC extended Universe, after Man of steel, that genuinely surprised me! (Wonder Woman was a film that was more needed for women in the movie industry, than a phenomenon which everybody seems to be calling) I can't seem to think of anything that would greatly bother me here. The movie isn't boring at all, there's plenty of action, the heroes all work together, they fight together, make good use of their abilities, they banter a lot between each other, got their backs when it's needed, nobody is exaggerated, the power level of individual character is true to the scenario (Batman is still just a strong human and Superman is an invincible alien)... I don't know, it all just clicked like two pieces of Legos. Interactions between them are funny when they should be, and where they shouldn't, there is some intrigue and a little drama. Flash isn't infantile or annoying (trailers marketed him that way). Aquaman isn't some big jock (similar). Cyborg... OK, Cyborg is there to push the plot forward, but even that works somehow. What's even more appreciated, there are moments, which make the heroes tonally appropriate. For instance, the scene where Superman shows up and does what he does, the moment with flash and later with Batman are instant gold. This one scene more than makes up for whole BvS movie. Right now I'm fresh from the viewing, so I'm seeing through pink glasses and I won't complain about one dimensional antagonist, or constant jumping from location to location without any coherent time frame or other flaws, which the film definitely has. Also, I won't compare it to Avengers, because I feel that's kind of a different movie overall, but my impressions after I left the Justice League are definitely on the good side, not the other way around, so for me it's a very pleasant feeling after all of the previous DCEU movies experienced on the big screen. But hey, what do I know? I'm the guy who didn't like Thor 3 AT ALL and thought that X-men: Apocalypse wasn't as bad as everybody thinks.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Does It Really Do The Franchise Justice?,"Whether or not you feel like arguing for DC or Marvel, a good movie is a good movie, regardless of who made it. The terms 'fun' and 'dark' are the two that get tossed around the most when comparing these two franchises, and while many people are wrong to like a movie based on its tone, I can gladly say that not much complaining can be done about the tone of Justice League. Meshing light and dark to form a solid mixture of the two, due to some unfortunate circumstances behind the scenes, may have actually made this a better film than it originally was, but who really knows. As I said, the tone of this film is great in my opinion, but the movie itself is quite the mixed bag. There is a lot of fun to be had with Justice League, but here is a weighing of the pros and cons of this highly anticipated addition to the DC Universe of films.The premise is quite simple. An evil force in Steppenwolf has arrived and needs to find three so-called mother boxes in order to take over the world. Using what little backstory that Bruce Wayne has on many super-powered people, he, along with the help of Diana, form a team to take him down. With the hope that Superman may also return, this team must do everything they can to hopefully save the day. Although these characters are all a joy to see interacting with each other, herein lies the biggest issues with the film as a whole.There isn't much to say about the villain here because his storyline is almost too simple to even want to describe. He's a generic bad guy that wants to take over the world, who really only exists in order to make this team feel the need to band together and save the world. When a villain is just a tool for a team to exist, the overall impact of your movie won't ever reach a high point. That being said, even though the villain ruins the entire film for me every time he's on-screen, the characters surrounding him and how they all come together was really the highlight of the movie, making the price of admission worth it.No, characters like Cyborg, Aquaman, and The Flash aren't given quite enough backstory to really feel for them, but the casting of them is terrific and the little screen time they're given is fantastic. Their interaction with one another was great and I can't wait to see more of them in the future. There's honestly nowhere to go but up from this messy installation.Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot once again bring everything they have to the table and they sure seem to be making these characters their own, so I really hope they stick with this franchise for at least a few more years, because I feel as though there are some entertaining stories to be told if the post-credits sequences have anything to say about it.Many people will be going into this film hoping for some exciting Superman action, and although I won't give anything away for fans, I'll simply state that his small presence is more than worth the wait. Like in Man of Steel, his character, along with Lois Lane and his mother Martha definitely adds some great emotion to certain elements of the film. In terms of entertainment, this movie held my interest from start to finish and I'm actually looking forward to seeing the future progression of these characters after these first rocky few films. I like these characters a lot. They just deserve better films.In the end, comic book fans will have their share of shrieks throughout the film, from cameos to world-building, but it really just comes down to whether or not this is a good movie for the majority of audiences to flock out and see. Upon reflection, I enjoyed much more about this film than I disliked, so I would warrant a recommendation, but only to those who've followed each installment since Man of Steel, because not knowing who certain characters are would be a detriment to your experience.The movie feels very rushed, but there are great character moments to make up for that. Even though there is some very obvious CGI work throughout the film, the action is exciting and a joy to see on the big screen. Even though the villain is terrible, the team is a blast to see interacting on-screen. I seem to be finding a pro for every con, but it just comes down to whether or not I had a good time, and that's a pretty definitive yes. Justice League is a mess, but it's a mess I had fun with and that shows promise for the future. I enjoyed myself for the most part.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Incoherent cgi gibberish.,"Might as well watch the cut scenes from a video game, the cgi was poorly implemented. The villain absolutely pointless. Superman's Resurrection wasted, why not give him a few movies to find a villain worthy and build suspense?Each of the characters in twisted to ape the Avengers in their roles, especially Flash/Spidey but with non of the depth.Truly a pointless exercise and a wasted opportunity, spare yourself the disappointment. How it is an 8+ on here discredits IMDbSuch a shame. :(p.s the CGI really is that bad . . .",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It is a very funny movie with good characters that we love.,"Unlike BvS, in this all the characters have their character and  personality defined.The Flash is the nicest of all, he is the comic  relief all the time. Aquaman is like a rocker, a rebel without a cause  who is enjoying ""la vida loca"" and I want to see him in his solo movie.  Cyborg is the most bitter, as it is a marginalized human-machine- alien  mix. Batman and Wonder Woman have a good chemistry, and WW is still  amazing. This is the Superman that I wanted to see in the cinema.  The aspect of the parademons is incredible, they are like a kind of  hybrid between vampires and insects and the combats with the  protagonists are spectacular. Steppenwolf is horrible, very soft,  lacked rudeness and character, in addition the CGI is bad, it seems a  badly made video game.  The CGI in Themyscira for example is terrible, but the action sequence  is impressive. The reshoots are noticeable, like the CGI to remove the  mustache to Henry Cavill.  The dialogues of the film are not very good. The story is simple and is  set for the common viewer to understand, simply ""the bad guy wants 3  mother boxes to take down the world.""  The film fix some holes in BvS. The colors of the film are really high,  they are alive and with intensity, totally different from BvS because  of what the darkness was criticized.  The film is cut, the priority of WB is obvious, and the scissors  between the action scenes is visible to the naked eye, in addition many  of the scenes of the trailers are not here.  The action is good but in the previous films it is better. OST of  #DannyElfman is forgettable, you just hear the theme of classic  superman of 1978 and Batman of 1989 (And at the beginning when it comes  in WW you hear Hans Zimmer's). The previous films were action dramas  and the change of tone of this film is action adventure and comedy  (they started the change with WW) and take the right path. It is not an  epic film but in spite of all the failures I have HOPE in this  universe. I liked it very much.  PS: the two post-credits scenes are very good.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The movie brings together what we all hoped for, a team. its fun, bright and energetic with a balance of seriousness.A piece of advice don't go into this movie expecting to watch a movie on the level of the dark knight.

I'm Satisfied As A Marvel Fanboy. Utterly Amazing,"I'm a die hard marvel fanboy. But honestly nowadays marvel just way out of their tracks turning their action movies into some low-budget-cringy-parody movies. It's not cool, man. Especially when they ruined Thor's characters. It makes me upset.But for this Justice League, I was amazed! The jokes are on point, they played the characters so well and natural, and so realistic for today's society! And the punch-up-lines of the jokes was on point, so cool, without ruining any characters just like the Comic Books! But idk why the Batman feels so dark this time...Yeah, I'm the sad marvel fans especially for the Ragnarok movies.

Waiting For Godot.... I Mean Kal-El,"This movie demonstrates that the people in charge of the DC Universe have been learning the lessons of what they have been doing wrong and what Marvel has been doing right, in a mechanical fashion, if nothing else. The right things include hiring Joss Whedon to work over matters, because not everyone spends every second of every day being a miserable meanie, and that different things motivate different people. Some of the things they have learned that are wrong include 1: a dorky, brilliant teenager makes a great character, so let's make the Flash Spiderman; 2: the relationship between Paranoid Batman and everyone else doesn't work, so let's just.... gloss that over awkwardly, by having him behave awkwardly over it.That's fine, because these are all people who do not Play Well with Others. On the plus side, one thing DC figured out was how to deal with the Rock-em-Sock-em Robots battle, by putting in grades of robots, and noticing that there are actually civilians on the battlefield, and assigning some people to actually getting them out of the way of the FREAKING HOLOCAUST THAT'S APPEARING RIGHT AROUND THEM! On the other hand, the second third of the movie turns into Waiting for Superman, since once the Man of Steel shows up, neither G*d nor wombat can stand against his might.Mind you, I stopped reading comic books in 1969, and hadn't bothered with DC for half a decade before then. Still, it was more amusing and a better story than BATMAN VS SUPERMAN. They're still pinning their hopes on Gal Gadot, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

In 2 hours I a grew attached to each of the member of the JL(even Cyborg who was one of the great highlights of this movie for me). The thing I loved most about this movie however, was Superman!

Not living up to expectation but an okay starting point,"Watched the movie yesterday and sigh...Me and a buddy of mine went in with the lowest expectations, we didn't read anything, look at the ratings, nothing and we were still horribly disappointed. Literally at the same things at the same time.If you're going to watch a DC movie, I'd recommend never watching the trailers again before going. They wasted so much good material on the trailers. At least 1/3 of it I was like, ""yup, seen that. yup, got that"".The movie was almost set up to fail despite amazing casting and performances. I wasn't keen on the way Aquaman spoke and Cycborg's look and the fact that he was in the movie but damn was I wrong, they both nailed it! All of them did. I literally can't find anything wrong with the actors and how well the did.(you should stop reading here if you don't want to go in with a tainted perception)Why was this movie set up to fail? It was a number of things combined.1. Expectation - As a DC fan going back to growing up to Keaton's Batman, this movie has been hyped for most of my life. Even more so since Marvel phase 1 started. Just the thought of, wow can't wait for DC to do this! So regardless of how well it turns out, it will still somewhat fall short in your head.2. Trailers - as mentioned earlier, lots of material, plot and such was given away in them. I actually told my friend exactly what would happen down to the time frame and he'd just turn to me in the cinema every now and again and be like hey! you said that. You could literally piece the whole movie from the trailers. Now, I remember watching Guardians of the Galaxy 2 trailers and not knowing anything about the movie.3. A bloody mess - it was all just a big mess that was rushed into nothing really. The flow was just bad but could have been worse I'll admit. There were major disappointments in some parts of the story. For someone who feels the music is just as important, the score was a real mess. I was really excited for the music because I didn't hear a Justice League theme song in the trailers and I was excited for a specific score from the last trailer. It was a mess. Horrible plot holes that I might be wrong about I'll concede that much.There are a few things I'd give it credit for where I feel there were criticisms.1. Villain - I've been reading about how generic and thinly plotted it was. Well, firstly the voice acting was great. Secondly, you'll be distracted from the mess of the overall movie to pay attention to flaws specific to him. Thirdly, I thought it was going to be another Ares, but he stood on his own despite looking somewhat similar.2. CGI - the graphics were amazing, everything was very well done. The parademons looked great! way better than the Chitauri. Fight scenes were well done. On this end, everything was on point.3. It can only get better - the movie is shaky and seems to be finding its feet which it doesn't really end up doing. From the looks of things it can only get better. It set up a good starting point and should be more polished second time around.Final thoughts - everyone here has to and will watch it regardless of what I say. Just try your best to keep an open mind especially if you're not a layman. Look at it as a first bet rather than an all-in scenario. Even though I wasn't happy with it, I sure hope it is successful because they have a great cast. They just need someone better in-charge to paint a better picture.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Decently made despite some sloppy execution.,"After all this time, the Justice League finally assembles in the big screen. For what it's worth, it's an entertaining time and worth the admission. Despite that, the film does have a good amount of issues. But the cast for the most part is great. Their banter and their performance is what really puts the whole film a float.I've been a fan of the Ben Affleck casting since he was announced. I think he's the best cinematic version of Batman we've got on screen, certainly more comic accurate and more of a brute. Bruce Wayne here goes through a big change in his character and I liked seeing this whole new side of him. He's learning to work together with the other members and his dynamic with Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is nicely handled. Gadot, is great and her performance carries through since her solo film debut, but I still found some her line deliveries kinda weak. The reports are true though, she is used for some downgrading comedy regarding her attractive appearance and the Amazons do wear more revealing armor as opposed to the practical look Patty Jenkins and her design team helped shape. I'm not gonna go too deep in this, but I can definitely see why this would turn off a lot of fans and some general going audience members, especially since Wonder Woman was big step forward.The new players are good for the most part. Ezra Miller's Flash for me was a tad too quippy. I found it kind of annoying and most of his jokes did not land. That's not to say I didn't chuckle here and there, but I know certain liberties should be taken when it comes to adapting source material, but I couldn't get on board with this Barry Allen. Maybe he'll grow into the Barry Allen I want to see someday. However his display of powers are quite cool to look at.Jason Momoa's Aquaman worried me in the trailers. I was hoping he wouldn't be another quippy, tough guy/surfer dude character, but he turned out not to be. Well not entirely. Ray Fisher's Cyborg is a bit dry, but he's integral to the plot of the film. I think there's a lot of potential with him.Now on to Superman. I think people who weren't happy about Cavill's Superman in the past will be happy now. For me, I was already a fan of Cavill's Superman, but it took them three tries and now he is the Superman I think everyone wanted to see. His return elevates the film just a bit more. He is the highlight for me and I'm really intrigued what they do with him next.Now their villain Steppenwolf, it's not just a weak villain, it's a bad one. A really bad one. Super one-noted, and incredibly forgettable. I'd compare him to Malekieth from Thor: The Dark World. To be fair he wasn't complex in the comics either but, Snyder and his team had the opportunity to really bring something cool to the table. It is very much similar to Marvel's villain problem, and to be honest, DC villains have been extremely weak aside from General Zod. Also the Parademons are fodder. Since Avengers and Age of Ultron, it can get pretty redundant at this point to see a team take out mindless creatures.The movie is brisk. It's just about two hours, and the banter between the heroes are fun. However you can probably tell that a good chunk of the film is missing in the cutting room floor. There are a lot of scenes where the scene is abrupt and the editing is very choppy. Sometimes whenever something interesting happens it just keeps cutting away instead of letting the scene play out. Corporate meddling definitely took place, which is a shame cause I would have loved to soak up the scenes a bit more.I will admit the tone shift from BvS made this film feel a little Marvel-ish, not in a bad way. For me I never had a problem of the darker tone. BvS had a lot of good ideas, but it was all just sloppy execution(The Ultimate Cut is a little better). I would rank this third on the list of all the DC films that have been release. Man of Steel and Wonder Woman are better, but Justice League is a step up from BvS, and leaps and bounds better than Suicide Squad.Despite some problems I'm happy Snyder pulled it off, and I wish him well especially since the family tragedy we went through. At times the film looks and feels like a Snyder film, but there are moments where you can absolutely tell Joss Whedon had his fingerprints here and there. For better or worse I thought it worked at times, and at times it didn't, most of it came from Flash, so take that for what it is. I'm not one who's really picky about CGI but there are times in the film where it's so obvious that everything is CGI.To cap it off, Justice League is a flawed, but solid entry to the franchise. I'm excited now and more hopeful. Whether or not this film gets praise or negative reception, the excuse of ""it's made for the fans,"" cannot be a way to dismiss bad reviews, that goes for ANY movie.So to end this review, I hope all the fanboys are just at peace with each other, whether you're Marvel or DC. In the end all we need, at the very least is a decent and entertaining film. Just cause someone else has one opinion doesn't mean it's the end all be all.6.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"There is so much wrong with this movie, it's difficult to know where to start.","Let's start with the most obvious weakpoint: the villain. Steppenwolf is a laughably bad villain, ripped straight out of a 90ies direct-to-DVD film. He is just a big bland CGI character with absolutely no personality whatsoever. He has no motivation other than being the generic evil guy trying to destroy the world. Apparently it's not even hís plan. If I understood correctly, he's the henchman for some other character that we never learn anything about. His entire design was just uninspired, and he looked and sounded more like a weaker version of the Beast from the live action Beauty and the Beast than one of the strongest characters in the world, hellbend on creating destruction.Then there are the problems with the entire way that DC is approaching these movies. Making this an ensemble movie, just like with Batman v Superman, feels entirely unearned and a cynical attempt to cash in on the widespread brand recognition of Batman and Superman, and to a slightly lesser degree Wonder Woman, and of course the success of Marvel. It's really hard to look at this film and not conclude that this is DC's failed attempt at creating their version of The Avengers.However, whereas The Avengers' meetup felt natural, having been build up throughout its previous 5 movies, Justice League decides to introduce half of the entire league in just this movie. This makes most of the first half of the movie an uneven and boring bunch of random character introductions. Only Wonder Woman and the segments on Themyscira felt natural, because we were already introduced to their culture before and therefore had some connection to them.The rest of the Justice League itself is also lackluster. Jason Momoa's Aquaman was kinda interesting, but it once again feels incredibly cynical that they would introduce the character in this movie instead of in his own one, just because they knew that it would be hard to get people excited for an Aquaman standalone movie without an introduction to the character first. They don't care that it's to the detriment of the quality of this movie, it's just a way too get people to buy into a future film, exactly as they did with Wonder Woman. In this case they actually would have done well to look at Marvel, as they were able to introduce obscure and silly looking/sounding characters like Ant-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy in standalone movies, and make it a critical and commercial success.Cyborg was just boring and uninteresting. He has no personality, there's nothing to his character, because there was not enough time for a proper introduction. Even his suit is making the decisions for him sometimes. The CGI was also quite distracting, as his face looks rather fake.And of course while The Flash has been around for a long time, I find it hard to believe that they would have introduced his character the way they did without the success of Spider-Man in 2016's Civil War. He's pretty much an exact copy of Spider-Man, playing the teenage boy that is overenthuastic about being a superhero, and deriving humor from that.They even found a way to make Batman look uncool. He's pretty much just collecting the team for most of the movie, and does very little on his own. What is most disappointing is that Ben Affleck is never really Bruce Wayne. Whenever you see him dressed normally on screen, it's just him doing Batman stuff without his suit on. Even Wonder Woman has a scene of her being Diana Prince, but it's all only Batman throughout.Then there's Superman, whose return was very poorly done. First of all, if you have a character that is supposedly dead, don't make the actor's name the second one to pop up on the opening credits. That's a surefire way to ruin any potential surprise about his return. Of course that return was inevitable and obvious, but at least put in a little bit of effort to hide that fact. I don't even have to put in spoiler tags in here because DC doesn't even consider his return a spoiler.Secondly, because his return was so quickly - halfway through the chronological follow up to the movie in which he died - there is absolutely no relief or emotional climax to his arc, or any sense of urgency, really. You never really care that Superman's death has supposedly thrown the world in disarray, because his death barely has had any time to have resonated with the viewers. Hell, his supposed death didn't even make it through the end of the previous movie without some hint of his upcoming return.If they had some patience and balls, they would have had him stay dead for a few films, preferably those in which the rest of the Justice League got introduced, and in which the threats get increasingly challenging and hard to overcome due to Superman's absence. This way when he finally does return after the rest of the League is facing a truly frightening and unstoppable enemy, his come-back would feel earned.Overall, there's so much wrong with this movie that although I wrote so much, there are still many flaws left untouched (like Zach Snyder being Zach Snyder doing too many Zach Snyder things, or the nonsensical process of resurrecting Superman that actually put them in more danger than before). It's amazing that after the disaster that was Batman v Superman, they went pretty much the exact same route for its follow-up, setting up an illogical and unearned conflict and resolving it in a cliched and nonsensical manner.At least Batman v Superman had some really cool action scenes instead of the uninteresting CGI fest that was Justice League. And while Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was a terrible villain, I'd take him over the soulless CGI monstrosity that is Steppenwolf any day of the week. Justice League is a terrible movie in every regard, and really does not bode well for the future of DC's cinematic universe.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Ok,"When I heard news of the Snyder Cut I got excited even though most of his films were only B's or A- worthy movies I still enjoyed the CGI and allegories while this movie has non of that. Some of the things that save the day is the Flash's humor and Wonder Woman. Still it couldn't salvage this way too short, horribly edited mess of a film, some hardcore DC fans like myself. They will be in denial about how mediocre the film was, the cgi mustache, cyborg, and the forgettable bad guy with cringe worthy generic intentions (I WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD). Made this film extremely disappointing to me at least it could've been so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"What could have been a great film, ruined by a greedy studio","This is one of those films I felt weird about the first time I saw it because of how excited I was before it's release. I don't know if I've ever been this pumped for a movie before. Then the director changed, then the runtime shortened, and I was still excited, albeit cautiously.Once I saw this film the first time, I liked it, though I may have just been blinded by my excitement for the film, and the IMAX presentation.But once I saw it twice more, it's flaws began to stare me in the face, the reshoots became considerably more noticable, the effects & the colour grading became worse, and the awful attempts at humour annoyed me.While still a mildly enjoyable film in it's own right, it is nowhere near the scale and weight that the trailers and the original word of mouth toted about. It was no-longer this huge sci-fi epic with genuine character growth, it was a tone-deaf attempt at making a Marvel movie with these beloved DC characters.Unlike 'Batman v Superman', a movie I love the more I watch & disect it, this was a movie I disliked the more I watched & dissected it. It leaves a huge dark mark on my memories, and I wish that the full Director's Cut of this film could be released one day so that dark mark can finally be washed away.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Avenger's this is not,"You have to feel sorry for DC Comics.Sure they've made more than a bucket load of cash with many of their releases, including of course this year's box office behemoth and critical darling Wonder Woman, but overall the company has been living in the shadows of Marvel for a number of years now and have been late to the party when it comes to superhero team-up events until now.Suffering a troubled production that saw original director Zack Snyder depart the project late in the piece due to a family tragedy and replaced by Avenger's mastermind Joss Whedon, Justice League has had a far from smooth run to cinemas, that includes the fact we've never truly been properly introduced to its new main players, Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg, with DC keen to get this ensemble together as quickly as possible.Considering all of this, Justice League is not what I'd call a ""bad"" movie, in the sense that I'd warn everyone against seeing it, but this often jumbled and sometimes just not that interesting blockbuster is still far from the all-round winner DC would've been hoping for with Snyder and Whedon's film lacking both a genuinely good story arc (new villain Steppenwolf is just generic baddie 101 or even worse) and any true memorable set-pieces or set-ups.At what feels like a fairly brisk 120 minute runtime, Justice League is always on the move as we initially get to witness the first meetings between this collection of new friends (the highlight of which is probably Ezra Miller's pizza eating Barry Allen/The Flash) but with so many people, so many different arcs to play out, Snyder and Whedon struggle to bring it all home and action scenes often feel haphazard, some scenes feel rushed or unwanted (a Russian family is given far too much screen time), while all the films colourful characters don't get the airtime they perhaps needed.After the middling response so far to his take on Batman, Affleck won't be gaining or losing too many supporters here, the verdict is well and truly still out on Cavill's take on Superman, while Gadot is once again great as Wonder Woman. Of the new cast Miller is a fine addition as the awkward Allen, Jason Momoa gives fans hope that his standalone Aquaman will be a lot of fun, while it's surprising just how affecting Ray Fisher is as Cyborg even if his character doesn't seem cut out to get his own standalone feature.It's a shame then that we don't ever feel like this team is given the scenarios they needed to really gel together. There's chemistry to be found here, even Cavill and Affleck benefit from the likes of Gadot and the new additions, their rather tiresome portrayals enlivened by the fresh, energetic nature of their co-stars but overall the film lacks an energy or pizazz that would've been the kicker to elevate this genuine middle of the road experience to something else entirely.Final Say –All in all huge fans of DC will be kept happy with this sometimes enjoyable, sometimes downright bad big screen culmination of hero's and one badly CGI'd and generic villain.Devoid of anything of true note and without a memorable set-piece, Justice League is unquestionably the poor cousin of The Avenger's but with the talented cast involved, there is enough hope here to suggest that this band of hero's have some room to grow into something special if all the stars align.2 1/2 terrorised Russian families out of 5",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Josstice League is for very special people,"This is Joss Whedon's film, not Zack Snyder's. I have only seen this once, and it was on a seven hour airplane ride three years ago. The characters just bumble around and are annoying, and the marvel humor does not go well with the darker atmosphere of the DCEU. The CGI was terrible, and the final battle was just the Josstice League's attempt at making a coherent plot. Oh, and don't get me started on Mustache Man.Anyway, watch the Snyder cut instead!!!

DC can't get the chemistry right!,"Marvel seems to be able to create fantastic chemistry between the characters that DC can't achieve. I enjoyed most of the casting of my favorite super heroes except for Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is so one dimensional and extremely boring! As a supposed 'Amazon' she looks ridiculous. She is not tall, muscular or anything like an amazon. I am shocked anyone enjoys her portrayal of Wonder Woman but I suppose people's expectations are extremely low and just happy to have a Wonder Woman even if she can't act!The CGI was terribly done and too obvious but I did enjoy the overall movie but thought marvel would have done a much better job all round!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Mixed Emotions but it's what I expeceted,"First off I enjoy the Marvel Universe more than the DCEU. Both have some great and some not so great characters, but Marvel just seems to do it better. Perhaps because it had TV shows bolsetering it and animated movies as well, but DC had those things too. In general The Marvel Universe has just been portrayed with a better cast and perhaps a better budget and had the amazing Joss Whedon (who had to step in and help finisht Justice League for Zack Snyder. I would love to know how much affect Joss had on this project. Had he not ultimately been involved, would this movie have suffered? Joss is great all the way back to Firefly and Serenity but his crowning achievement was the first Avengers movie.I think DC got lucky with Whedon because it was hard tying in all those storylines and making a convincing villain. And Steppenwolf was LAME! Perhaps Joss couln't fix the entire movie but it had an script that was made before he stepped in. I guess you can only polish something so much when its not your own!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't waste your time. The Snyder Cut is where it's at.,"This is not the superhero movie you wanted. It's poorly acted, badly written and the visuals don't look finished. I know a Zack Snyder film when I see one. If you watch Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen, Man of Steel and Batman V Superman Ultimate Edition, then you will know how Snyder can make a film interesting and entertaining.

Benefits From Great Casting,"It must be next-to-impossible to perfectly cast some of the most iconic characters of all time. The big three here are perfectly cast and they have great chemistry. The chemistry between Bruce and Diana, specifically, drives much of the film.Aquaman is not the train wreck that I thought he would be. He takes Arthur in a completely different direction, but it works. Cyborg is way more interesting than he was in the Wolfman/Perez Titans books from the 80s. Flash continues to be portrayed in a way that is different than anything that I've ever read in a DC book but he provides comic relief and is quite entertaining.The film is fast-paced and is just like a comic book come to life.

Give me 'Justice' or give me death.,"The long awaited live-action DC Superhero team-up we have all been waiting for has arrived. 'Justice League' brings our favorite heroes together, but does the film come together as well as the team does?1. When an intergalactic foe (Steppenwolf) threatens all life on Earth, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) reunites with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) to assemble heroes from every corner to defend the world. With 'Justice League' being the 5th installment in the DC Universe, this movie undeniably feels a little rushed although it does have the appearance of a stand-alone film. It is quite obvious that DC and Warner Bros. are trying their hand at reverse engineering these characters by introducing them in one big ensemble and then gradually branching them off into their respective films. Is this DC's best movie? Not at all, but it's far from their worst.2. One the positive side, Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) is the most prominent character in the film more so than anyone else. If there's one person that gives life to this film.....it's her. The quiet moments between Gadot and Affleck (Batman) are by far the most interesting. There is a conflict between them in a sense of a love/hate relationship which hints at a possible budding romance. The other standout character was surprisingly Ray Fisher as Victor Stone/Cyborg. Maybe it's just me, but characters struggling to regain humanity that was stripped of them always resonates with me and Cyborg is just that. The least interesting member of the league however, is Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash. He clearly serves as the comic relief but he had more misses than hits. Most of his one-liners fall flat and the ones that do get nothing more than a chuckle.3. The one person I wanted and expected more of was Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Momoa obviously has fun with the role but never quite proves himself to be the badass we know him as from the comics. For someone with super-strength and command of the seas, his range is limited mainly because of the script. I'm certain 'justice' will be done to his character in his upcoming solo film, but I was disappointed that he wasn't as engaged as he should be. Not to spoil anything or explain what takes place, but the brief moments we get of Henry Cavill in the film, he finally proves himself as the Superman fans love. Probably the best set-piece in the film involves him about half-way into the movie. That sequence in particular was far more exciting and thrilling than the climax.4. Every moment in which all the league members communicate and talk amongst each other is where the movie succeeds. Despite being the only human of the team, Ben Affleck holds his own and works best in every scene he has with Gal Gadot. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf is about as underwhelming as they come. Never is his ultimate plan thoroughly fleshed out nor his objective justified. All he serves as is just a plot device and a reason for there to be a 'Justice League'. The film drops Easter-eggs every so often including two post-credit scenes. If you can manage to be patient, the scene at the very end (not spoiling anything) hints at the possibility of the solo 'Batman' film (starring Ben Affleck) that everyone has been waiting for.The scenes directed by Snyder, opposed to the re-shoots by Joss Whedon, are as knight and day. Not saying that's a bad thing, but the film feels very choppy without a proper flow. I wasn't bored but nether was I even mildly entertained. 'Justice League' is by far better than 'Suicide Squad', but until it establishes a stronger script, pacing and less over-the-top CGI action, it will not succeed at matching the standard of MARVEL.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Justice League - Disney Kid friendly humor free,"I enjoyed this movie. But I can understand why people were bored. Justice League and DCEU is almost there. They need to keep away from Disney Comedy Marvel Universe and focus more on what Nolan did with the Dark Knight. This is Snyder's fault, not Whedon's. Whedon just tried to patch up what Snyder did, but he still gets blamed for Snyders work. I heard that Snyder doesn't know alot about the DC Universe too. Poor Whedon.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hading in good directions,"I'm Quite disappointed after seeing the movie. I'm not going to tell you any spoilers so don't worry, it's spoiler free. First let's see whats good in this movie. The tone of the movie, action sequences and the parts which they included only because to make a fan happy is appreciative. The tone of the movie is lighter than Batman V Superman with jokes which you won't laugh because you would have seen them in the trailers. The fight scenes are really good and in that you can clearly see Zack Snyder's idea. Let's see whats not good. First of all after seeing this movie u won't get connected with the heroes unlike in Avengers u will connect with everyone and get to know about them, even though movie have some unique time for individuals.The connection is missing even in scenes, some scenes which are not needed too are included without which movie would be same. You can actually get to know while seeing the movie that two directors made this movie, because some scenes Zack wont take in that way. Second of all there is no background music in fights which make me sit and watch the action in silence. In trailer he kept the bgm, but not in the movie which didn't make ppl feel excited. Plot is not that blent, but is OK to have easy plot than the plot like BVS. Finally I didn't connect with the movie and enjoyed bcs of all this reason and think that I enjoyed Batman V Superman more. That's all you want to know before seeing this movie. My advice is go see the movie it's not that bad. Enjoy guys it's still superheroes with all the action.

It is Justice League!,"So, Justice League, first i think i should start by tell my opinions of other DCEU movies, i love Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, i don't like Suicide Squad and i think Wonder Woman is fantastic. Going into Justice League was first of all dream come true, as big fan of characters and what they stand for. Just imagine this movie 57 years in the making since first Justice League appearance. Yeah, yeah but what about quality of the film, be honest it's a mixed bag even i enjoyed a lot, so let's start with goods. I love characters and every actor did a good job, stand out for me was Superman, in preparation for this movie a watched every Superman movie since 1978 and see character done so right was awesome. Flash was great comic relief and Ezra Miller bring his own to the role very well. Wonder Woman, Batman, Aquaman and even Cyborg who i tough by trailers will be a weak link, they all was best part of the movie. I love a lot of moments and scenes from film, for example opening Batman scene, Aquaman going to the Atlantis with Icky Thump playing, return of Superman, Danny Elfman soundtrack, final shots of the film, they all was amazing and bring my score so high and tear to my eye. Unfortunate movie has problems, villain, some plot elements, final battle location where you don't care and don't feel stakes. It's all there, but for me so many good stuff for sure beats not so good. For overall this is the Justice League and now road to the future look really good and full of potential, even movie not was perfect, so many positive stuff in there, that i don't even mention deserve a praise. I would love to write and talk about this a lot more and this movie for sure deserve a examine and would love to be just fly on set on this thing. To get to the end i really, really like film and hope you can enjoyed as well, movie is fun, exciting and special, come on, what other time you will be seeing Superman 1978, Batman 1989, Dark Knight, Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, first JUSTICE LEAGUE on big screen of your favorite movie theater. So go out there and have good time. By the way can't wait for ultimate edition of this movie.

A complete history of being a league,"Dear readers, now I want to review Justice League as yesterday 15th November 2017, the movie is premier in my country (Indonesia). Since its announcement in 2016, we have been waiting for watching this movie and here it is!! Justice League is an amazing league. We watch an entertaining superhero movie, a sexy Aquaman, beautiful Wonder Woman, super rich Batman, houmurous Flash, serious Cyborg, and of course the handsome Superman is back! The plot is simple; that is about how to make the former League unity again with the combination of the special persons of Gotham, Atlantis, Amazon, Earth, and Krypton to defeat the enemy from dark side. The scenes of battles are ordinary because you can know the ending easily and there are many effects of CGI. The tense is also so low, so that you can turn back from doing other jobs and while you are coming back, you can still follow the scenario (The best tense in Batman Trilogy that make you can not blink your eye for just one second). Also the one is making this Justice League movie so fresh is the laughable actions or words from the Flash. Moreover, we appreciate the Director that make this movie is so compact and familiar for those who never read the real Justice League in comics. For me, the movie is the summary how each of the League coming from, what makes them special, how they know each other, and why they have the same purpose. More insightful of this; is that each League member had ever failed for a mission, and had lost their loved one, either family, spouse, or losing their own identity, so that to defeat the enemy does not mean the winner of the League, but the winner of the truth itself. One scene so questionable is that why this Justice League movie have Russian civilians involved. Maybe this is hypercritical but I critic the appearance of nuclear technology as part of environmental disaster in this movie and I do not know maybe this movie sponsors are also coming from companies who do worse wasting management. Well, let it go, grab your popcorn and do not forget to watch the movie until post-credit, because it is shown the next figure of DC Comics and hopefully the next movie is League versus League! :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A fun, thrilling adventure with some flaws","Can DC Comics keep the momentum going after the massive critical and box office success of ""Wonder Woman""? That is a question that many would like to know the answer to, and I'm happy to say that the answer is yes.Justice League is the fifth movie in the DC Extended Universe and the third directed by Zack Snyder, with some reshoots done by previous Marvel movie director, Joss Whedon. The story takes place right after the events of ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" where Batman, aka Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), inspired by Superman's selfless sacrifice to save the world (spoilers to those who have not seen BvS), runs into trouble with an unknown enemy and decides to form a group of people with superpowers to save the world from evil forces. Already having Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) on his side due to already fighting alongside her before, they must confront Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to convince them to fight alongside them. But they soon learn that this is not such an easy task. They don't know these people, and these people don't know them. So, predictably, there's problems and tension at first, except with Barry Allen who instantly decides to join because he claims he needs ""friends"". But they all eventually come to their senses and unite to form the Justice League, aiming to stop the evil Steppenwolf from destroying the world.What's great about Justice League is its heroes. They are all great and likable, and it helps that they are brilliantly casted and have great chemistry with one another. Affleck and Gadot reprise their roles as Batman and Wonder Woman, respectively, and they're both very good. But it's the newcomers who are the most interesting, and they don't disappoint. Momoa is a natural fit for this Aquaman, Fisher brings heart to the role of Cyborg, but the true standout here is Ezra Miller as The Flash. He is what you call a ""scene stealer"". Miller has a knack for cracking jokes and his comedic timing is dead on in every scene he's in. Good times indeed.The film's runtime is 2 hours, which is surprisingly short for a superhero movie these days. As a result, the movie's plot is constantly moving and there's not much down time, which keeps things entertaining. There's never really a dull moment. When there's not much action, there's interesting interaction between the heroes, and when there's no interaction, there's action. And the action scenes are well done, with each one showing what each hero's powers can do while at the same time being engaging and exciting. Not to mention the action scenes are visually thrilling, particularly the final battle.Although Justice League gets a lot right, it does have its flaws. The movie has a good amount of jokes, and even though they are mostly funny, they get in the way of the movie's dramatic moments far too often. And this is the movie's main problem, it's unsure of itself. DC clearly tried to take a page from Marvel's book in terms of adding comedy to the movie, but there's such a thing as too much. There's just too many jokes that interrupt the dramatic moments in the film, and as a result these dramatic moments feel cheap. The movie doesn't really know what it wants to be, a comedic superhero movie or a more serious one. DC is known for its darker, more serious tone, and they mistakenly strayed away from that here.Even though its 2 hour runtime is a good thing in some aspects, it is also a bad thing. The movie's plot constantly moves, but it almost moves a little too fast. Proper introductions to the Flash, Aquaman,and Cyborg are seemingly skipped over or are rushed and the movie as a whole feels rushed. It feels like the movie should have been a half hour longer to fully flesh out these characters. Granted there will be solo films about these heroes, but still.I haven't really talked about the movie's villain much, and that's because there's not much to say about him. His name is Steppenwolf and he wants to obtain the three ""motherboxes"" so he can ultimately destroy the world. Boring.All in all, Justice League is a fun, yet flawed superhero team-up movie. It gets a lot right, its heroes most importantly, but its flaws keep it from achieving greatness. And even though it's not quite as good as ""Wonder Woman"", it gets enough right to surely thrill DC diehards and casual fans alike. Booyah!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Made for the haters and critics.,"Deservedly called JOSSTICE LEAGUE. This is what happens when the studios listens to critics and listens to the haters, this is what happens when the studio takes the death of a directors daughter and uses it as an excuse to let the original director go so they can bring another director to make a movie THEY want. What you have here is a mess of movie because of everything I stated above. The downfall of the DCEU all thanks to the haters, critics, and the bad management of WB headed by Toby Emmerich, Geoff Johns. Thankfully the TRUE, ACTUAL and REAL movie Zack Snyder's Justice League got released in 2021 and it was miles, leagues and 1000 times better than this pile of studio rubbish.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ignore the Hate Bandwagon,"This is a fun popcorn movie for people who know the characters. As a father of two young boys who has spent countless hours watching Justice League animated features, this was a pretty faithful rendering of that world as live action.It is by no means perfect. The CGI is ropey at times, which was surprising and there is no getting past the mustache unfortunately. However it's not as distracting as some people think and as portrayed by some of the photoshopped versions spread by hate-mongers. The music score, if you can call it that, is very weak indeed and is just a bunch of generic orchestral incidental sounds interspersed with Elfman's Batman theme and a single moment where we hear John William's Superman theme. There actually isn't anywhere near as much action as in previous DC films, which is a shame, as this is one movie where the characters deserved to show off more, especially Flash and Cyborg. The villain is weak and we didn't get any sense of his motivation.The cast is excellent, chemistry and dialogue between them is charged and fun. Whedon's reworking of the script clearly shows. What action we do get is well choreographed and photographed. The movie starts in darkness and ends in hope, leaving you feeling quite positive about the future of JL and future additions to its ranks. One hopes they can keep the cast together for further stories and that the studio has the sense to give the next instalment to Whedon from the beginning.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining but messy,"I can't claim to be a hardcore fan of DC comics or films. That may be why I enjoyed this movie. While it's not an instant classic that's going to be analyzed for years to come, it is an entertaining film. It's not one that's going to make you think, but it is a nice way to just escape for a couple of hours, and to me, that's the purpose of film. I think all of the actors portrayed their characters well, I especially enjoyed Jason Momoa and Ben Affleck. The CGI on the villain made him look more than a little bit like a video game character. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that this is just a genuinely entertaining movie that is just fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No Justice Only league,"My rating of 1 does not indicate of how bad the movie quality is rather my disappoint with the ultimate result. My review doesn't comes out as a pure hate machine but rather due to the epic disappointment of one might feel after waiting for so long to witness the most epic team up quite possibly of this century to turn into a mediocre generic film.This should've been the most epic saga in DCEU's continuity but alas rushing to compete with Disney finally took a toll on this franchise. The characters are well enough on their own but their development as individuals are rather paltry. The cinematography is awkward at times as evident from multiple re shoots done by Joss Whedon.The CGI in some parts are terribly glaring to avoid and it feels too much green screen effect that makes your head hurt while watching in a dark room. Some are too bright while some are too dark. The color grading is very inconsistent with the background. As you all know Superman returns from the dead (which is kinda given at this point) but his resurrection isn't handled well enough. What should've been the rekindling of the hope people lost like the Rebirth of a Phoenix is marred by botched character interactions and idiotic dialogues.The supporting characters such as Mera, Martha Kent and Alfred are wasted even further. One of the most highlighting parts of BVS was the interactions between Alfred and Bruce engaging in both morally and logical decisions. Sadly it's been reduced to banal banter between them and others. I'm not going to highlight the humor since it's overdone and doesn't fit organically in this film narrative. Humor is good and should be present but not forced and overstuffed like Disney films recently have become.The villain is generic along with musical score by Danny Elfman which is just rehashing of the same old stuff. Wait for the 4K or bluray release to see edited scenes as consistent with DC's film which might be better.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Messy, fun, entertaining!","I'm a fan of Marvel but a bigger fan of the DC brand, so every time I head into a DC movie there is some DC bias. But so far, the DCEU has yet to fully win me over. Man Of Steel was decent, BvS was average and Suicide Squad was laughable. Luckily, Wonder Woman was lot's of fun and enjoyable, so my expectations were high for Justice League. So, how is it? Well....First of all, I didn't like the plot that much. It was messy, disjointed and at times incoherent. I don't know if the shortened run-time hurt the plot since a lot of the sub plots went missing or half way through were just cut off (if there's an extended version, I might be keen to get it). Steppenwolf just felt misused. He was a simple generic villain, that could've worked, but so many missed opportunities with him that it was disappointingly handled. The CGI also needed a bit of work. These things definitely hurt the movie, and had more time gone into reworking these negatives instead of re- shoots, it could've been better. But...I loved the Justice League! Ben Affleck's Batman was once again a great showcase. Gal's Wonder Woman felt fully developed after her stint in BvS and solo outing. Momoa's Aquaman was fun and larger than life. Ezra's Flash was witty, entertaining and exciting to watch and newcomer Ray Fisher's portrayal of Cyborg was nuanced, but believable. The way they bicker, argue, interact and work together felt magical. It was very reminiscent of the first Avengers movie when they team up at the end. It was a blast! Their chemistry is what elevated the movie, and they were far better than they had to be. If anything, THEY are why you go see the movie, if for anything else. The second and third act of the movie is also very good. If you complained that MoS, BvS, SS and WW had terrible 3rd acts, I'm pleased to say that JL fixes that, immensely. It was fun, lighthearted, interesting and a bright direction on where the next slate of DCEU movies head.All in all, while the villain was generic, plot was messy and CGI was pretty bad in certain scenes, the Justice League's chemistry and a strong closing act help elevate JL to be a at times messy, wholly fun and very entertaining viewing. I plan on seeing it again and hope there's an extended version.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Justice league has some really forgettable plot points and villain but the chemistry and charisma of the actors make up for it,Honestly I was pretty on the fence when watching the trailers but it ended up being nice . Got to watch an advanced screening on the 11th . Sure the green screen work from reshoots is noticeable like Thor Ragnarok . Yes Steppenwolf is generic but..The actors knock it out of the park with a unique team dynamic . Ezra Miller wins the film . Don't listen to the BlaBlaBlaMedia Guy as he gave fury road a 1 I think and is clearly biased towards Disney . The ending is pretty sweet (Has to do with the Kents) and I was impressed when I found out one of the post credit scenes was shot in one take and one cut . Not special but definitely worth your money.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Falling with style,"There used to be debate 25 years ago. Why did DC have more success with their movies than Marvel.The main hooks for DC were Superman and Batman. Although Warner Brothers tended to be careless with some of the the sequels.Nowadays it is not even an argument. Marvel wins hands down. Even a secondary character such as Black Panther knocked bells out of Justice League at the box office.With Superman dead, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) senses a brooding darkness on the horizon and he wants to assemble a team of people with special powers.Batman already has Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot.) He and Alfred seek out the quick as lightning Flash (Ezra Miller) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and the Cyborg, Victor Stone (Ray Fisher.) After some bickering they become part of the Justice League.They do battle with the alien Steppenwolf who is looking to reclaim three hidden mother boxes that will give him untold powers.One of the boxes is in the human world and Cyborg calculates that the power in the box could re-awaken Superman.In Justice League, you would had expected a film with six superheroes would be more exhilarating. The problem might be that the finished movie is a compromise of two directors work.Joss Whedon who was brought in to finish the film, instead decided to do a lot of reshoots. Then Whedon had to cut down the running time. Deleting scenes and some scenes looked rushed.The film lacks the fun factor. Steppenwolf joins a long line of dull CGI villains.Both Victor Stone and Aquaman were flat with only Flash having a spark.When it came to the fight scenes everyone is flying around. I heard one critic remark, they were really falling with style as in the original Toy Story.At least the film brings back a bit of the John Williams Superman theme as well as Michael Keaton's Batman theme.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

DC stands for Detective Comics ;)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A way too serious, totally generic, bland action film that thinks its a superhero movie.","When you think superhero films, you probably remember such hits as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Avengers. The last thing that comes to mind is any DC movie that has come out in recent years. Many people thought that after the end of the Dark Knight Trilogy that we would see a resurgence in the DC nostalgia that made the company bigger than Marvel at one point.Those hopes were dashed when Man of Steel turned out to be a dark, gritty CGI mess that tried way too hard to be relevant. The moody and drab undertone of the film made us feel to glum to remember the old Saturday morning cartoons that were filled with fun, adventure, and action all rolled into one brilliantly performed show.Next was Batman v Superman which had been hyped for three years, and all we got was eight minutes of fighting and over two hours of talking and exposition that we just didn't care about. Suicide Squad was lacking in the department of character development. Instead the producers wanted big names and flashy effects to sell the movie. That didn't work.Finally, we have this: take all the previous DC movies mentioned (Except the Dark Knight Trilogy, the only films DC got right), put it in a blender while adding aqua man, flash, and cyborg, blend it all together, then turn off the lights. The resulting disaster is Justice League. This is what you don't do with superhero films. It would be like Joss Whedon making the Avengers in 2005 with Iron man being made eight years later.The movie does not follow any of the source material, instead relying on Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot to carry the weight of the film. Everyone else just seems to be along for the ride with none of the other characters getting their own movie yet, so we have no idea what their motivations for joining the Justice League are.The film once again goes into dark and gritty territory with everything happening at once with little to no previously known information about half the main characters. Anyone who isn't a comic book junkie was asking ""Why is there a robot and a fireman in this scene?"" Just another too serious flick that betrays the source material and hopes that big Hollywood names will save it (Spoiler alert: they don't).",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Villian is simple and cliche, he hasnt got a motivation. On the other side, I liked Bruce's effort and motivation about putting this team together. Wonder Woman is wonderful again.

It's a terrible movie in its own right but I found myself saying, ""At least it wasn't as awful as BvS."" That's not a joke or an over-exaggeration in any way. Walking out of BvS was like getting punched in the gut. With this mess, all you'll feel is let down. Maybe a bit cheated, disappointed and even a bit lost but not really angry.Judging by the ratings here and a few critics that I read, I was expecting at least a decent film.

"Borrowing some Marvel Magic, Justice League is a homerun for DC.","To address the Marvel V DC issue, my perspective is that Marvel has always been consistently very good, but DC has had higher highs and lower lows (within the films and across the franchise).Justice League is one long high, cinematically speaking.The film has all the best hallmarks of Zack Snyder -- the cinematography, the symbolism, the action, but it's been tidied up with some of Joss Whedon's little humor moments, and although I'm not at all a Joss fanboy, I think the marriage of the two filmmakers' styles does the film...justice.The ensemble comes together a little hastily in this story, which has been DC's main weak link until now, but considering how Warner Bros. has not allowed the series the time to flesh each character out before joining up, they newcomers (Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg) get introduced rather quickly, but it's OK because their backstories are hinted at enough to be interesting to casual filmgoers, but comic fans already know what they are about.Steppenwolf is your typical comic movie villain -- except with Ciaran Hind's voice acting lends him a kind of stage-play gravitas that works well for the character.A few other points: Wonder Woman continues to be a highlight of the series both visually and narratively, Snyder's Superman is ultimately badass (sorry Donner fans), Jason Momoa nails it as Aquaman, I had a hard time letting go of the CW Flash but Ezra Miller made me forget it.To summarize, Justice League was an awesome superhero film -- one that is as good as anything Marvel has done. I only hope there will be an extended version because I suspect it would be even better than it already is.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So, you can cut their legs and arms off while fighting and there should be no more trouble in the future in terms of battles.Just a thought.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty Good!!,"Was Justice League everything I was hoping for? Nope! There are some things I would've wanted done differently, but I could say that about a lot of movies, so I am trying to judge this by the content we got and not the content I wanted.So I gave it 8 stars, and that seems pretty high considering all the hate the movie is getting. It definitely doesn't deserve higher in my opinion, but I don't really see it deserving less than a 5 either. My favorite thing about this movie was the cast, by far. Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot are fantastic. Ben Affleck is really good too. I've always been kind of on the edge with his portrayal of Batman. It is not always my cup of tea, but I enjoyed him in this movie. Ray Fisher did okay as Cyborg. I'll expand on my opinion of Cyborg later in the review. Jason Momoa as Aquaman was interesting (he will also come up again later in the review). And lastly Ezra Miller was fine as the Flash. I did have a hard time adjusting to Miller's version of the Flash, as I am a very bug fan of Grant Gustin's version in the CW TV show. That being said, he did a good job! It just took some adjusting since his character seems particularly socially awkward compared to Gustin's portrayal which seems very extroverted by comparison. So Miller did not do bad at all, and I did like it!So for anyone who hasn't guessed, I have severely limited comic knowledge. My full knowledge is based on the CW shows (which I understand is not a good source for comic relevance) and some of the post-New 52 Batman comics. As such, I know basically nothing about Aquaman or Cyborg coming into this movie. I know that Aquaman is from Atlantis and that he can survive underwater, and that is the extent of my knowledge. Cyborg...I have absolutely no knowledge of ahead of time, aside from his appearance in the original Teen Titans animated series. Characters such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are easy to follow because (for the men at least) their stories are iconic, and everyone has some inkling of an idea of who they are, what happened to them, and what they can do (and for Wonder Woman, her standalone movie obviously does a fantastic job informing everyone of her story). I felt the same with the Flash, since I have knowledge from the CW show, which seems to share a vaguely similar origin story with the version seen in the movie. This leaves us with Aquaman and Cyborg as our outliers. I enjoyed their portrayals, and I was interested in their characters, but I had no real attachment to either of them. That is one of my biggest complaints. As much as the public seems to be against superhero origin movies anymore, I feel like these two deserved to have one. Their histories are not widely known by people who are not faithful comic readers, and as such, some more information regarding them would have been nice going into this movie. Just something extra so that I have more reason to care about what happens to them.My other main gripe with Justice League is the main villain. And lets be clear, I actually liked Steppenwolf as the villain, I found him kind of interesting overall. However, he was, overall, forgettable. He did not receive enough screen time for me to really get to understand or care about his motivations. I feel like the best kind of villain is one that is either coherent enough that I understand why they are doing what they are doing (maybe I'm even rooting for them in a way), or crazy enough that they are frightening and need to be taken down. Steppenwolf wasn't crazy really, nor did I really follow his plan too well. But he was kind of scary, so I was alright with him overall. What I did not like was his disposable army. But, I feel anyone who complains about it in this movie and not in Marvel's The Avengers is hypocritical. Both movies have the same fault that there is this army helping the main villain, yet they are not helpful to him in the least, and our heroes pretty much don't even really struggle against them. This is something that many movies like this do, so I'm trying not to be too harsh on it. The CGI isn't top notch either, but it did end up being better than I expected.All things considered - this movie is fun. For the most part, the jokes land well, the characters are interesting, and the story is still enjoyable. Aside from one or two odd lines of dialogue and two extremely goofy Batman reactions to something happening, I think the movie was great. It had a decent plot and a fun cast. It wasn't perfect, but it set up the future of DC movies pretty well, and I left the theatre pleasantly surprised. I don't mean to compare it to Marvel, as it is indeed different, but I'd say it was *at least* as good Avengers: Age of Ultron. Probably a little better. So, in that comparison: there was a lot that could be improved, but in no way would I ever say this movie was bad. It was good, and even though it didn't completely blow me away, I still feel comfortable saying that I 100% recommend it, because it was still fun, different, and a positive direction for the DCEU.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Way Too Safe,"While this movie had so much potential... Much of it fell in the water, thanks to the fairly predictable, ""me-too"" guarantees of using cliché, generic plots, generic henchmen, a bad-ass looking but even more generic villain, way too much CGI - even in places where it should have been done more practically and CGI added for highlights or effect (like make-up on a face). Where did that 300 million dollar budget go? And what silly person came up with the idea to replace all of Hans Zimmer's music with the old theme songs? Lost most of the epic feel of the movie right there...Now, if certain actor's acting skills are not up to snuff... then it's up to the director to make sure the camera work, edits, and lighting, carry and cover that. That wasn't done well at all. Gal Gadot's acting needs work, and Jason Momoa the same; even if the lines they gave him were plain silly, a good actor finds a way to make it sound interesting.Have the people in Hollywood learned nothing of Logan (2017), with Hugh Jackman? More realism in comics is what sells. Correct screen adaptations are what sells. The people buying comic books, paraphernalia, collector's's items, etc, have money to spend - they are not children. And stop trying so hard to inject jokes or silly behavior into almost every other scene or line... the characters come across as immature and sometimes a bit retarded.Anyway, the story was weak. In itself that is not a problem, but the way it was portrayed... was well, weak. It's not possible to drown it in colorful CGI with fast cuts, and hope the audience doesn't catch on. Warner Brothers should penalize the person who insisted that the whole story needed to fit inside two hours - the pacing was too fast, detracting from the whole what-was-supposed-to-be-epic feel; which was already deeply in trouble thanks to the weak soundtrack.It is very clear that DC needs to stop worrying about Marvel; whatever Marvel is doing, is not DC's concern. DC needs to focus on doing their own thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Comic Delight,"Woah, just watched the movie today and I can say that I am relieved. Going into the movie I was very nervous, but now that i have watched the movie, I can say its worth the watch.Due to the two hour time limit imposed by Warner Bros., the movie definitely seems quite rushed. Because of that, the introduction to the characters seems a little off. Since, I already knew how these characters became who they are, I could make sense of what was going. But for casual movie watchers, its not going to be that great but definitely a entertainment flick for sure.The great side of the movie was the characters and the chemistry between them. Watching them on the big screen is a dream come true. I thought Ezra Miller as Flash was awesome and very funny. I can say the same about the other characters: Aquaman was bad-ass although he had less screen-time, Cyborg was definitely cool and Wonder Woman is as always charming. The other best parts of the movie would be Superman. I would say Superman stole the show. The CGI mustache wasn't that noticeable. But overall he did great. I can say the same about Batfleck. Ben Affleck as Batman is awesome.Now the bad parts of the movie. The main issue was with the villain. Steppenwolf didn't seem so strong. Whenever he was out of the screen, I didn't really care about him. Also rushing is also an issue here because of the two hour limit. The CGI could be even better, but it was pleasing.As a comic book fan, to see the references made in the movie was totally great. And there are two end-credit scenes. You definitely don't want two miss them. I had a great time watching the movie. And I am very hopeful for the upcoming DC movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't expect anything more than a mediocre movie,"I've been waiting a few years for this movie only to be dissapointed. I'll try to cut this as short as possible.1) The whole film felt very rushed. It's obvious that DC is in a rush but they should've seen it coming. The characters had little if at all development, lots of scenes felt awkward , without any chemistry. On addition, because of that, it's hard for the audience to connect with the characters and really develop some kind of an attachment which is crucial in actually really caring about what's happening.2) The CGI was awful. I can't really understand why, since the budget wasn't low, but some scenes felt very fake.3) The villain was a joke. At no point in the movie did he feel threatening.

A solid performance that does well with each of the new characters it introduces.,"The action scenes are impressive to watch and the film successfully balances the lighter side of superheroes with the darker tone and setting of the series. The main villain is a bit bland, the characters could have been more developed and the one liners were pretty awful, but it stays entertaining throughout and never gets too bogged down in lore or meaningless action scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I thought it was exciting/entertaining, a good enough DC superhero movie","After first seeing Justice League, I didn't find it to be on par with other Marvel films and I cast it as a flop. But later, after watching Batman vs. Superman, I saw that I had called it a flop too soon because B vs. S was a very good superhero movie in my opinion and provided the lead-in to Justice League. So, I watched JL again and realised there was more depth to it than I previously thought. My favorite character was the villain, Steppenwolf because of his great lines he had, that should def be featured more in the Quotes section. I recommend seeing it at least once, if you're a fan (as I am) of superhero movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I expected nothing and I am still disappointed.,"Let me be brutally honest. There are no redeeming qualities about this movie. The plot is a large ball of string that has been tangled beyond recognition and the characters offer absolutely NO emotional investment.The movie jumps from scene to scene with no real flow AND no clear direction. Halfway through the movie I genuinely wondered how I got here and why the movie is halfway done when it feels like it's been 5 minutes of ""story"".I truthfully cannot understand how people can be rating this 9 and 10 stars. WB do not make good DC movies. I understand it's frustrating but pretending it's a good movie is hurting your chances of ever actually making them good in the future. Telling a lie enough times might make you believe it but still does not make it true. WB have no incentive to make good movies and it is very sad. The whole thing stinks of a cash grab.

The antagonist, Steppenwolf, a pretty powerful sinister villain causes all sorts of problems for all the superpowered heroes around him.And of course, there are no spoilers to be had in DC's worst kept open obvious secret that Superman was always going to return. And when he does it's handled very well indeed.DC still has a lot of work to do and some ground to make up to catch up to Marvel Studios, who I think are probably too far ahead and possibly out of sight, but for me, this was the best movie in the DCEU so far.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Justice league has to re-animate Superman to save the world.,"I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. My wife skipped, not her type of movie.In essence this is a continuation of the ""Batman vs Superman"" movie, in this story a mythical character Steppenwolf has returned with a plan to destroy the whole world, perhaps the whole universe. As he gains more power the six remaining members of the Justice League are trying hard but seem to be fighting a losing battle. They really need Superman but can they figure out a way to re-animate him? To bring him back alive?Well as we know anything is possible in the comics. And now we know the world is still here, so there's that. As a long-time superhero fan I found the movie a bit uneven but still enjoyable. As much as the movie, I enjoyed the approximately 14 minute BD extra that explains the history of the Justice League and its characters in the comics, and some of the changes over the years.Plus the picture and sound are first-rate, my powered subwoofer really got a workout!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"I hate to rate this so low, but man! What a lame excuse for a superhero movie!","I give this movie a slight pass since production was interrupted due to Zack Snyder's daughter dying and Joss Whedon having to take over in the middle of the project, which is understandable and makes sense. But still, the Snyder cut is so much better than this in countless ways and this ended up being so underwhelming! This one felt so rushed with very little character development, dialogue that seemed like it was written by and for children, mostly bad acting (except for Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, and Ezra Miller), mediocre CGI and terrible green screen (good CGI in some parts), humor that worked only half the time but the rest of the time was atrocious, no DeSaad or Darkseid and no real motivation for the villain, and scenes that were not needed and could've been replaced by much better ones that we saw later! It's been a while since I've been this let down by a superhero movie that was supposed to be a big grand experience but it undeniably wasn't! So much charm, excitement, and exhilaration was missing! This is from the same guy who directed Marvel's Avengers which is one of my favorite movies and which I gave a 10/10!!! So much more depth and awesomeness!

BAD SIDE. DID YOU notice these poor special effects throughout all the movie? I had similiar graphics in Doom videogame. Mercy your audience! We are not in 90s.

Every other person who is bashing movies like this is either not into superhero films or just don't like DC.

Doesn't Do The Justice League Justice,"Let me start off by saying -- I'm a huge DC fan and a movie buff. I fully appreciate the intricacies involved in bringing something this huge to the screen and I realize there are weaknesses in every movie. That being saidIt's as if the writers have attempted to cram the entire DC universe into two hours with little consideration for what that does to the plot or the viewer's brain as they try to comprehend this hot mess. On top of that, The villain is the most generic brand of threat-to-the-planet bad guy imaginable and it takes way more energy than I have to take him seriously enough to even care.But that's's okay right? When the writing is bad we can always keep the audience entertained by blowing things up, you know, like in Superman - Man of Steel (in fact, just like in Superman - Man of Steel) where Superman and General Zod knock down all the skyscrapers in Metropolis. Over and over. Pointlessly. For seemingly the last hour of the movie.But we'll need some really exceptional CGI to make that band-aid hold. Which leads to  who releases a movie in 2017 with original Star Wars era CG? I And even that might have worked had they not overreached by so much. And the music? Not so important to the overall movie, but really?What did they do with that massive budget? Maybe they should have paid the actors and actresses a little less and a bit more for the writers, composers and the CGIShort on plot, same old tired action scenes but now with antique CGI, uneven acting (not that there's really much room in this movie for anything resembling acting — ridiculous posing at best) and it only took $300,000,000 to lay another DC egg. How does the same company that is capable of the Dark Knight and Wonder Woman come up with this ... crap?Should come with a warning -- Move along, there's nothing to see here (beyond what you've already seen for free on the trailer).",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
DC's attempt to match Marvel,"I was excited to see this movie. I did have high expectations. This was DC's attempt to battle Marvel with the powerful Avengers saga. I'll have to say it falls short of expectations. Don't get me wrong...it's certaibly worth watching, but I thought the special effects were almost sub-par. The most refreshing part of this movie was how they made The Flash into a kick-ass super hero. If you watch the Flash series on the WB channel, I think you can admit they have him in a ridiculous outfit. This movie steps it up 10-fold and make him...well, awesome. On another note....any movie with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is worth a watch!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Nice movie, great special effects, but there are some missing pieces","I did really like this movie, it is the first movie where you can see the most of DC heroes fighting together against one enemy, but the problem is the power gap between superman and the others (specially batman) without the kryptonite superman is unstoppable (maybe darkside will be the perfect match for him) but let be honnest batman is a strong man , smart , fast ... but still he doesn't have any superpower therefore he won't be helpful in real combats.
On the other hand they underestimate flash, however he is better than batman by long shot.For the others they are just fine on thier own. I believe this is the problem with DC they have superman (wich mean a huge power gap between the team members), on the other hand Marvel has bunch of superheroes who are close to eachother when it comes to power, so they can build a perfect team.
For the poeple who ask to see Marvel heroes (the avengers) fighting against DC ones (The justice league) I think it won't make any since because superman can destroy them all, maybe he will find trouble with the hulk but the others don't hove enough powers to survive against him, except is they use Kryptonite. Also both sides are good and good poeple don't fight eachother (don't remind me of civil war because no one died there and there is no power gap between Marvel's heroes so no one died).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I don't know what the others think but today all of the audience in the cinema was satisfied and applauded excitedly. Now I'm still excited and I know I will watch it at least two more times.

This movie isn't the greatest or the baddest. I't is just fun action film.
Some stupid jokes of course but not as many as in any marvel movie.
I think most of the marvel movies are whole family time movies and DC is trying to be more teens and older type.
I don't like the Ben Affleck Batman at all. I just don't like the character.

Justice League received mixed reviews. Critics praised the action sequences and solid performances, but criticized the writing, pacing, and CGI. The plot was thin, and the villain underdeveloped. It performed well in the theaters, but not as well as expected. The DC Extended Universe failed to develop its individual characters before expanding its universe.

"Not bad, not great, but a decent platform","'Justice League' is the 5th film in the DC Extended Universe and, after 'Wonder Woman', is their best attempt to compete with Marvel - even going as far as bringing in 'The Avengers' director, Joss Whedon, to write the screenplay. The director, Snyder (who also directed 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman V Superman') is only given a ""story by"" credit. If you haven't seen any of those three films, I suggest you do, as this film starts with Clark/Superman (Cavill) already dead and Batman/Bruce (Affleck) and Wonder Woman/Diana (Godot) pulling together a super-team to fight off some impending doom.There's the obligatory hour of introductions to each of the five main characters: Arthur/Aquaman (Momoa), Victor/Cyborg (Fisher), Barry/Flash (Miller, the best new character) - plus more screen time for Lois Lane (Adams), Martha Kent (Lane), Commissioner Gordon (Simmons) and Alfred (Irons), who are all kind of wasted. The plot is that they have to fight off an alien bent on destroying Earth, with his army of zombie-grasshoppers - directly ripped off from 'Star Wars: Attack of the Clones'. It's an odd choice, since this should technically be aimed at kids, but I'm not sure if I'd let anyone younger than 10 watch this...But that's part of the problem with the DCEU so far - it's still trying to be dark and unforgiving, attempting to reach Nolan's Batman trilogy, but not hitting any of the marks. Something's just missing that doesn't hold it all together as well as a Marvel film. And, odd as it may sound, there's probably too much CGI here. Not a spoiler: obviously Superman comes back and helps save the day, but it begs the question - isn't everyone a bit suspicious that Clark Kent is now somehow walking around? There's some decent quips and a few funny moments, mostly thanks to Flash and some OK battle scenes. Plenty of enjoyable moments, but not quite a fully-formed faction film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Go See This Movie!  You will not be sorry.,"If you are locked into viewing the world through the jaundiced eyes of the 'professional' reviewers, and pass on this movie, you are seriously missing out on a treat.Although not quite a perfect movie, this collaboration between Snyder and Whedon ends up totally restoring the proper attitude, tone, and heroic posture of all of the DC super heroes present in this movie. Yes, I know, Wonder Woman was perfectly fine after her 'stand alone' venture, and she is equally excellent here, although she certainly does not stand as far above everyone else in this film; she remains Wonderful.Some have complained about the 'obvious' switches between Snyder's ultra serious tones, and the perceived injected humor of Whedon. I say that the lighter touches are just right, and any contrast with the more darker elements, are absolutely no more jarring than the juggling between danger and planned humor that show up in every entry of the Marvel universe. Those that see them as a forced marriage in Justice League, are looking at it through prejudiced glasses. They want to see discord, so they find it. However they managed to put this film together, considering that two major but markedly different-styled directors were involved, they succeeded well beyond what the doomsayers that had already made up their minds claim.Some scenes in this movie even remind me of Richard Donner's vision of America from his first Superman movie, and even though those moments are small, they are beautifully significant and welcome.The climatic battle scene is not overly long and drawn out, and plays very well.As I said above, it is not quite perfect, but I gave it a 10 here, because it is that close.Do not listen to the naysayers, it is much better than Marvel's Avengers: Age Of Ultron, because although it has to mesh many pieces together, Justice League does not suffer the excess of attempting to jam ten pounds of stuffing into a 5 pound bag as Ultron attempted, but failed to do.I will most readily be seeing this movie in the theaters again, before it's run is through.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Unspectacular, but competently made and entertaining","I liked this film when I first saw it in 2017. It was nothing mind blowing, but it was solid entertainment.After watching the rather good 4 hours Snyder cut, I decided to revisit the 2017 version for a comparison. I was fully expecting to not like it anymore, but strangely enough, I did. It's still a by the numbers comic book movie, but it's still competently put together, and it's still entertaining.In fact, there's a few scenes and music cues in this version which I prefer to the Zack Snyder cut, and I'll take this version of Superman any day.The last 20 minutes is just CGI muck though, and there's nothing here which is particularly deep, meaningful, or even has much purpose.Regardless, it's a solid piece of fluff which I still thoroughly enjoyed.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A thorough lack of understanding of the DC Universe.,"At best this movie was strange. It had all the proper elements of a good film, yet studio heads seem to have a serious lack of understanding the psychology of the D.C. Universe.By nature, the D.C. Universe is significantly darker and more mature than Marvel. As such, they have an opportunity to delve into more cerebral stories than Marvel, and yet they treat this like a kids film. I am thoroughly convinced that Joss Whedon has become the last person anyone would want writing, or directing, or even producing their film as he is little more than a generic story teller.While Zach Snyder get's a great deal of flack, if left to his own devices he often times captures the spirit of the grittier, darker comics, IE 300 and Watchmen (despite it's flaws). Unfortunately a great deal happened with Snyder during production which left this movie essentially in shambles and broken from the start.The casting was good, however how they were used was mixed. Ezra Miller's Flash stole more than enough scenes, but Jason Mamoa's Aquaman was a bit too fratboy. Cyborg was interesting, but underdeveloped and Wonder Woman seemed like an extension from the Wonder Woman film. I've liked Affleck as Batman thus far, much to my surprise, but this just seemed meh... Henry Cavill felt entirely wooden and his apparent CGI face was incredibly distracting. Steppenwolf was the most disappointing in that he was little more than Aries redux, and as an antagonist was boring, uninspiring and just another CGI cut scene.In short, this movie was just strange. It seemed that it had all the elements to make a solid film, but moves it too fast, establishes nothing, goes from scene to scene to scene, and is flat out generic and forgettable.It's a shame because this could have been absolutely wonderful.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

very disappointing,"justice league animated series was my favourite. and justice league flash point paradox is my favorite superhero movie after the dark knight. but this zack snyder movie was not good at all. .. 1. Alfred-""they said you would come, i hope its not too late"" me and my friend had a bet, who is Alfred is talking too, superman or GL, but guess what ? They never showed this scene. . 2. i was hoping for green lantern cameo or something epic. but only suspense in movie was superman's return, which is obvious. . 3. darkseid? they never showed him. . 4. The villain? after general zord then doomsday what we got in justice league? weakest villain ever, superman didn't took a punch from him, while doomsday was able to beat him. . 5. If superman is more powerful than ww, aquaman and cyborg combined and also as fast as flash then why you need a team? . 6. the ending? opening was good, middle part was better but ending? superman just came and beat the hell out of villain and paradeamons were like krybots of power ranger(completely useless) . 7. Batman's dream in bvs? I thought they will show here- ""listen to me, lois is the key"" what happened to that segment? . so overall i am disappointed, they reduced showtime to just 110 minutes, didn't showed many scenes which were in trailer itself. .so stop fooling yourself.my all 4 friend were angry at me, due to this movie.

"Justice League (9/10 Stars) ""Seeing is Believing""","""May Contain Spoilers""For a first time DC Comics Version of Superheros Ensemble, surely is worth watching but unfair to compare with the benchmark that was set by The Dark Knight Trilogies or even the first Comic-book Superhero Ensemble Movie ""Avengers"".One can surely expect from typical cynics to regurgitate the very criticisms they used for ""Batman v Superman"" and use that for this film. The only major downside of this film, was the Main Antagonist himself ""Steppenwolf"" as there was no realism about him and too much CGI for the Main Antagonist.The takeover by Joss Whedon for the finishing touches of this film surely can be seen as a blessing in disguise and that what makes this film all the more better than the typical dark sided tasteless Zack Synder type films. Personally, this movie would have been a whole lot better had it been directed entirely by Joss Whedon or even Christopher Nolan.Given this is the first of it's kind from DC Comics and the Run-time restrictions set by Warner Bros. Execs themselves; so personally giving 9/10 Stars is purely because of the expected regurgitated criticisms and the negative ratings that follows.""Seeing is Believing""...So go see for yourselves rather than read the expected regurgitated criticisms that follows and give at least more than 8/10 as rating anywhere.

"I loved it, but the final feeling is that it could have been better!","There is no way, I loved Justice League, even with all the problems of the film it was very difficult I did not like it since it is a childhood dream to see a movie with all these heroes together, it is not the best film of this DC Universe, Wonder Woman is a better movie, has fewer problems and has a better script, Justice League had a lot of fun for being a fan, I liked the cast, Ben Affleck as Batman leaves a little to be desired if you buy in Batman vs. Superman, it's a very different character , Gal Gadot continues to shut up haters, she's great in this movie, she's charismatic, fun and pretty much all the best scenes she's involved in, Ezra Miller is pretty much like Flash, but I think her mood has gone overboard a few times, but she is the comic relief of the movie and works on a lot of the film, Jason Momoa she does Aquaman well, but the group is the weakest, but even so, she had some nice scenes with him and I quite expect the Aquman solo movie in 2018, Ray Fisher was a big surprise, he was better than I expected, the arc is very dramatic and the darkest of the film, but his CGI has problems, but he commands very well, and Henry Cavill is impossible to speak but I still have a lot to get close to the legend Christopher Reeve, but I really like his participation, the villain of the film Steppenwolf unfortunately is a villain, forgettable, is a generic villain and with a problematic CGI, I liked the participation of Queen Hippolyta and Mera even though it was very small, Amy Adams has a legal and important participation in the film too, the script is very problematic unfortunately, and this is due to the reshoots that the film was due to the tragedy that happened to Zack Snyder's daughter. and also by the cuts that Warner made with the film and thus hurting too much, I'm sure that if the film did not have as much cut would have fared better in the world reviews, the mood of the film in general I found unnecessary in the film, the film it does not have to be dark, but you do not have to want to have unnecessary jokes, the movie should have the same Wonder Woman tone, jokes just in the right moment, and be dramatic when necessary, but I'm keen to continue this universe, Justice League was a film that I found satisfactory, but it is undeniable that the film could have been much better.

So much exposition and a wildly fluctuating tone,"This movie had so much to do, so it ended up cramming in a bunch of exposition and only halfway explained crucial details about the main plot device and undeveloped villain. ""Mother-boxes"" sounds like a lame ripoff of the Infinity Stones in a post-MCU era regardless of source material, and ""Steppenwolf"" is a vaguely defined character with the goofy name of a famous rock band.Those issues aside, it's clear the crew tried very hard to pull everything together, so it's a shame the effort comes across as half-baked and dull. The producers are probably at fault for rushing this series to align with releases from the MCU.The film hinges itself on its heroes, but Ezra Miller as Flash either can't deliver the emotional depth required for his scenes with Billy Crudup as his father, or the director dropped the ball for those crucial scenes. These moments stick out in a bad way due to Miller's bad acting. The rest of the cast does a great job.There are some great fight scenes, but most of the film is exposition. It's like watching characters read the plot summary with intermittent action scenes, interrupted by brief emotional beats and Ezra Miller's clumsy line delivery.I gave this a 7 because despite obvious flaws, I recognize the source material was written for children. This dark film seems to be intended for adults. Glaring issues: the tone fluctuating wildly from scene to scene, bad CGI for certain elements including the villain, and on-the-nose, mechanical sounding expository dialogue.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Peppered with enough doses of fun,"As it stands, I am one of the very few whom appreciates Man of Steel for its somber tone. I am also one of the many that enjoyed Wonder Woman a lot. So the question is, where does Justice League rate amongst these? It comes in close. Not beyond. Not on par either.Foremost, Justice League is a fun watch. The chemistry exuded by all the casts, especially Gal Gadot and Ezra Miller, are contagious. The shift of tone to somewhat ""lightheartedness"" is definitely something for me to get accustomed to. However, the humor is peppered with the right amounts. Sparingly used, at its right times; rather than it becoming quips to transition into the next scene. Serious moments remained serious, as it should be. Each hero have their own distinctive personality & trait; whereby, not everyone turns out to be the same wise cracking sarcastic narcissists. Which was great.Secondly, the story that the League found themselves in...well it is coherent storytelling. Passable at best. It does feel epic only at certain points. Would I want it to be better? To be a masterpiece throughout? Definitely. But it does feel like a ride. From start to finish, even during its supposedly ""downtimes"", it moves along at a pretty fast pace.Now my only hatred for this film. I had my fears when it was announced that Junkie XL was replaced. And that fear materialized into reality. Danny Elfman's score is so generic. Bland. I don't really hear a theme that I care for. OR is there even a theme to begin with? The so- called Batman, Superman theme of the past, were just meh. All I heard was generic music in the background, constantly gyrating annoyingly throughout the impressive visuals.The one thing that the DC films had, which were emotionally charged, goosebump inducing scores, are now gone.

Justice League - Spoiler Free Review,"Man of Steel was awful, Batman v Superman wanted to make me give up watching movies and now I have seen Justice League...this movie wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, there was still a lot wrong with this movie, but at the very least I can say that this is a very entertaining film, not only that, but it did fix most the things that were wrong with the previous installments. The trailers made this movie look as if it was going to follow the Marvel route of action/comedy and it doesn't, this is still a rather dark movie; what they have done though is give sense of humours to the characters, giving them more likeability and making them much easier to route for than before. Ben Affleck, of course, returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne and although I was in the minority who thoroughly disliked his portrayal in the previous film, I actually didn't mind him here. Not only did they give his character a sense of humour, but they also made him a lot more human; in this film, Bruce Wayne knows that he is just a normal person with human limitations; he acknowledges this, bringing a vulnerability to his character and making him a lot more identifiable. Gal Gadot again fits perfectly into the role of Wonder Woman, her action scenes are great and her character is sexy as hell, more than that though, from the get-go she is an intricate part of the team; Black Widow has always been part of The Avengers, but her character has always been interchangeable, eye candy that could basically be killed off at any second without any major repercussions to the plot: that is definitely not the case here. The new characters are of course Barry Allen/The Flash, Arthur Curry/Aquaman and Victor Stone/Cyborg; Barry Allen is the comic relief character in this movie, and for the most part, it works fine; most his lines are jokes, sure, but that's how his character is written and it fits fine, even during the battle scenes, when he does throw a comical one-liner, it never takes you out of the scene, because you can actually believe that that is something that character would say in that situation. Then looking at Aquaman: Jason Mamoa is awesome! This is probably the best role I've ever seen him in, his character is likeable, tough as hell and Jason Mamoa just seems to be having the time of his career; I could maybe have done with a few less ""yo bro"" or other slang terms that got increasingly more as his character progressed, but that's a nitpick. Then we get to Cyborg...I, unfortunately, did not like Cyborg. Not only is this character a wet blanket, but his character has zero likeability, zero personality and every line he speaks is basically just him explaining the plot, another character I REALLY hated was the villain, Steppenwolf; this character is what kept this movie from being good, everything is wrong with him: the CGI is awful, every line he has is cliched supervillain talk, his motives have nothing new...Ivan Ooze from the 1993 Power Rangers movie: better villain than this guy. Finally getting past the characters and looking at the movie itself though, I will say that even though we spend the majority of the first act being introduced to new characters, this movie was still a lot more focused than the previous installments, and therefore was able to hold my attention for the whole of its two hour running time. The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed, easy to follow and fun to watch; the heart of this movie is the team though; I will go so far as to say, even though this was DC's first official team-up movie, there is already a stronger feeling of unity between the team than Marvel has been able to create since starting the MCU; every character has his place, every character has a purpose and what's more is they work together as a team, there are no power struggles, sure there are inner conflicts, but never do they let that cloud their judgement from what their joint goal is...these are superheroes actng the way superheroes should act, putting the needs of the many before their own. Final thoughts, as I said in the beginning, there are still problems with this film, the villain was a huge letdown, some of the CGI is really bad, some line delivery is rather cringe-worthy...but even with that taken into account, I still fully recommend you see this movie, because I get a feeling that there are actually great things yet to come from the DCU after all...watch your back, Marvel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I so wanted to love this movie...,"JUSTICE LEAGUE An honest and insightful review by Navin NambiarI've waited for this movie for 16 years. Yes, 16 yearscause that's when the Justice League animated series started airing on Cartoon Network. It was my favorite cartoon. I mean my absolute favorite cartoon. Do you get me? I'm also a fan of nostalgia and when I heard that Danny Elfman's classic Batman theme & John Williams' score from Richard Donner's Superman (1978) was going to be featured, I was over the moon. My mind was just filled with countless ideas and opportunities of how they could capitalize on those themes and conjure up some truly epic mind-boggling scenes.Unfortunately, that's where I let myself down. Those epic scenes will forever remain a figment of my imagination. SIGH.As for the movie itself, the story was too rushed in my opinion. The apparent WB corporate directive of keeping the movie shorter than 2hours seems to have done a lot of damage to the flow of the film. Not that 30mins more would make that big of a difference, but I can almost guarantee you that the director's cut will be slightly better. This is especially sad for me since in the comics, DC usually churn out great, very well written story lines. Here, not so much. The movie lacked any depth and all dialog consisted mainly of one liners and sad attempts to get some laughs. I don't have a problem with humor, but the humor in this movie is so forced it became cringe-worthy. Too many ""let's copy Marvel"" funnies about it.If this had come out 10 years ago, it would have been pretty great, nowadays we expect more, want more, deserve more, and with this talent and all the money spent they should have produced a lot better movie.So summarize, Justice League is an okayish Superhero movie. I'm gonna sell the two Hot Toys characters that I've pre-ordered. They don't deserve a place in my cabinet. I miss Christopher Nolan and his Batman Series. I'm disappointed :(",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But that film would have been probably over four hours in length.And the other thing for you JL haters is I personally think the JL/DC characters are too ""strong"". So that doesn't necessarily transfer too well to the big screen vs a comic. Hence, the over-CGI complaint too often heard.

"Nice film, not quite Marvel","DC tried to match the Avengers with a superhero-team movie and came up short. This doesn't negate the fact that it was a very entertaining movie.

A next movie should go into building background for the 'new' members.As always, DC sets a dark mood and this does set it apart from Marvel-movies.

This horse needs to be put down,"Rumor has it that DC Comics has little control over the cinematic universe, which goes a long way in explaining ""Justice League"". To paraphrase Mark Brendanawicz, this movie's a camel; a horse made by committee.

Their personalities are terrible.I don't know why this was so frustrating exactly. There's nothing about it that really angers me, but just as well, there's nothing about it that makes me look forward to more from the studio.

Pathetic Attempt to Finally Try and Copy Marvel,"First things first, it is a better film that B v Superman. But it is obvious that when writer Josh Weldon (former Marvel director for Avengers) took over directing from Zack Synder the movie changed. You can literally see when this happens in the film. It starts off like a Synder DC movie, all dark and trying too hard to take itself way too seriously, then half way through the characters start joking with each other and the movie injects some relief. But its disjointed at best. The problem with DC universe on film is Zack and the control he has. Marvel is brilliant because they have oversight and provides a big picture platform, but they let aspiring directors (lots of them) take some risk and the result is unique fun films. This movie proves DC films will never be on par with Marvel films. Wonder Woman was great, but that was obviously a fluke. The other problem is they just mashed these characters together without time to get to know them. Not worth your hard earned money to see this film. Wait to see it free on an airline, you'll thank me for it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Though Justice League is a mess, it has good moments that don't make it a total loss","Boy has DC Comics come a far way when it comes to its cinematic adaptations. For years, we've gotten a lot of Batman and Superman movies. It wasn't until Man of Steel when Warner Brothers decided to follow Disney and Marvel's footsteps and create their own cinematic universe. Man of Steel was split for a lot of people, but it had managed to establish it's own identity that actually fairs well with DC's image. The difference between to comic giants was that Marvel was humans becoming gods and DC was gods becoming humans. So why has it continued to split people?A lot of it has to do with how Warner Brothers has been handling it's property. Like a lot of people, I blame that rather then doing the work of making several movies before they get to a major crossover point, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice tried to jump five steps ahead by having too much of a good thing. Now that were looking at Justice League, it has a lot to live up to. For many of these characters, this is the first time were seeing the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg on the big screen. Let's see if Justice League can live up to it's expectation and be heroic.After Supermans death, Bruce Wayne (played by Ben Affleck) has decided to atone for his mistake of misjudging and build a team of metahumans or fellow super powered humans in case another threat comes to Earth. With help from Alfred (played by Jeremy Iron) and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Played by Gal Gadot), they talk to the quick willed Barry Allen (played by Ezra Miller) from Central City, the legendary fish man of the Scandinavian Arthur Curry (played by Jason Momoa) and the half human half artificial intelligent living computer Victor Stone (played by Ray Fisher) into joining their new league.Meanwhile, an alien villain Steppenwolf (played by Ciarán Hinds) has returned to Earth to try and reclaim a set of ""mother boxes"" in order to start an apocalypse. One of then is in Atlantis, another is on Diana Prince's home island Themyscira, and one more is hidden within the human world. Though the team of heroes, now called the Justice League, manage to retrieve the final mother box, Steppenwolf has built an army that has proved difficult for everyone. Will Superman make a return to help his fellow metahumans?Justice League is a messthat happens to have good things within. Let's get into the positives first. It's clear that director Zack Snyder (and Joss Whedon) has understood the mistakes from Batman V Superman, and have done things to improve. The plot is tighter and focused on one goal; stop the villain from taking over the world. The overall look is going in the right direction with brighter colors taking fold, thus making guys like Wonder Woman and the Flash seems more like beacons of hope. Plus, the relationships between the characters are more defined and are used to it's entertaining advantage.The two favorites here are Miller as the Flash and Gadot as Wonder Woman. They have a fair amount of screen time that establishes Miller as inexperienced, but with a mouth that's as quick as his actions. Gadot is showing more vulnerability has her connection to the humans has evolved since Wonder Woman. Affleck is great as Batman, but looks constanly disinterested as Bruce Wayne. Momosa does okay with his material (though with not enough time to show more of his personality) and Cyborg seems to have gotten the shaft as he's only in to do computer stuff for the sake of the plot. The problem is that Justice League feels like the tenth film in a series that seems to have skipped ahead (again, that blame is on Batman V Superman for rushing the cinematic universe).Now for the negatives. Steppenwolf is a surprisingly boring villain as he's your typical one- dimensional villain bent on destruction. Nothing new and even worse then Lex Luther's poor motivation in the last movie. A lot of the humor adds a bit more of a necessary lighter tone, but it doesn't always mesh with the Snyder-tone already established. Though it's been well publicized that Joss Whedon took over for the reshoots, it's painfully obvious when he came in, given that his are more humorous when compared to some of the fight scenes and other development scenes that are more grim and serious.I'll give this five Justice League comics out of five. This movie is learning as it's going, but it still has a lot of rough spots. I hope that future DC films lay off on the crossovers in order to give characters like the Flash and Aquaman a chance to shine in their own movies. I doubt I'll return to this like I do for Tim Burton's Batman, but I can see a lot of people overcoming this mistakes for the films more entertaining parts. If your just looking for your heroes fighting, you'll get plenty of it. You'll even get a lot of laughs and entertainment. I just don't think it's for me. Take it in perspective and see if the DC cinematic is worth saving.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Its not that Bad, but not that good either","Edited:
Delete this movie from history please,we have what we deserve in ZSJL!!Its not a bad superhero movie, but less from my expectation. Cuz we all agree that WW's success put high standart for DCEU upcoming movies. First note to know, we know that Zack make this movie while having big tragedy, and in the injury time, Joss stepped in to finish what must be done. not change anything from Zack's. From that note, a mess in putting everything together and last time editing will be ""pretty"" tolerated.First point is the tone, i liked BvS and MoS tone so much, cz it has different view for superhero movie. pretty realism and more characteristic. But i understand, they want better viewer who want superhero movie more ""light"", which make WW great success. And i liked it. But this is too light. Thank god it's not at Thor Ragnarok level. And some CGI are too obvious. Especially for background CGI. So less Zack's way.In the Character point of view, Wonder Woman still stand out the most, followed by Flash and Cyborg (which i recommend WB & DC to have Cyborg own movie to dig his character more. Cuz his set up and problem is potentially good). Aquaman didn't stand out much, just one interaction with Mera, thats understandable cuz they'll develop in their own movie. The let down for me is Batman and Steppenwolf. Batman is pretty good and badass, but i still prefer his performance in BvS which is really dark and grounded. In JL, he smile a lot, came in bright daylight a lot. Im not complaining Steppenwolf un-menacing character (cz i don't read the comic version of him), but i disappointed about Steppenwolf's story about being simple villain, which is make the story pretty easy and blend. But the interaction between superheroes is great. The set up for making Flash as more newbie, Cyborg's personality, and the connection with previous movie set ups are great.But, so far, this movie is pretty good experience to watch. cant wait the director's cut version.PS: End credit scene is one of the best thing that needed in this movie, so sit tight till the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable but painfully bland,"After watching Justice League after it released at cinemas, I felt disappointed - Zack Snyder was sadly un-able to finish production on the film so Joss Whedon of Avenger fame filling in to finish the movie - no brainer, right?Wrong, the lighter tone shift and lack of direction in Justice League made the film painfully bland and this led to some baffling scenes that I shook my head in disbelief. Say what you will about Zack's dark interpretation of Batman/Superman but at least Man Vs Steel and Batman Vs Superman had an edge of taking a darker approach to this cinematic universe rather than trying to appeal to everybody (like a Marvel movie) but falling short of doing so.A particular disappointment is how the promotion material hinted at large scale battle scenes and introduction of more DC characters when this was quite misleading.Characters like Flash, Cyborg and Aqua Man are rushed in with short moments of development but nothing too deep. Batman is also underplayed which is a shame considering Ben Affleck's performance in the DCEU so far.As for the good stuff - the visuals are good (especially during Flash sequences), some of the action scenes are entertaining and it slots together to create a fun enough superhero movie but the lack of depth, gravitas and direction makes it particularly bland when it could have been so much more than just 'good'.Do yourself a favour and watch Wonder Woman instead",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Justice league,"Unlike BvS, in this all the characters have their character and personality defined.The Flash is the nicest of all, he is the comic relief all the time. Aquaman is like a rocker, a rebel without a cause who is enjoying ""la vida loca"" and I want to see him in his solo movie. Cyborg is the most bitter, as it is a marginalized human-machine- alien mix. Batman and Wonder Woman have a good chemistry, and WW is still amazing. This is the Superman that I wanted to see in the cinema. The aspect of the parademons is incredible, they are like a kind of hybrid between vampires and insects and the combats with the protagonists are spectacular. Steppenwolf is horrible, very soft, lacked rudeness and character, in addition the CGI is bad, it seems a badly made video game. The CGI in Themyscira for example is terrible, but the action sequence is impressive. The reshoots are noticeable, like the CGI to remove the mustache to Henry Cavill. The dialogues of the film are not very good. The story is simple and is set for the common viewer to understand, simply ""the bad guy wants 3 mother boxes to take down the world."" The film fix some holes in BvS. The colors of the film are really high, they are alive and with intensity, totally different from BvS because of what the darkness was criticized. The film is cut, the priority of WB is obvious, and the scissors between the action scenes is visible to the naked eye, in addition many of the scenes of the trailers are not here. The action is good but in the previous films it is better. OST of #DannyElfman is forgettable, you just hear the theme of classic superman of 1978 and Batman of 1989 (And at the beginning when it comes in WW you hear Hans Zimmer's). The previous films were action dramas and the change of tone of this film is action adventure and comedy (they started the change with WW) and take the right path. It is not an epic film but in spite of all the failures I have HOPE in this universe. I liked it very much. PS: the two post-credits scenes are very good.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lighthearted and Entertaining...,"I have to say, I find it lighthearted and entertaining at least, though sometimes, you will find the plot to be rather confusing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Getting rid of past mistakes and embracing a lighter tone,"DC is cleaning up its past mistakes. This is the filmmakers going away from the gritty modern style established in ""Man of Steel"" and going back to the classic light feel reminiscent of Rich Donner's ""Superman"" from '78. If you thought ""Batman v Superman"" was disappointing, then have no fear. Joss Whedon is here to make things more.. hopeful.. Yeah, that would be word. Hopeful, lighthearted and more like the old classic superhero stories. All the bad decisions made in previous movies are now starting to get undone. And that's really good. They should have started out this way, but at least they now know what the right direction is. We owe a lot to ""Wonder Woman"" for that. Too bad the studio told them to not go over two hours with the run-time. Because that's what ultimately hurt the movie the most. There's a strange rushed feeling throughout it. Lots of new characters are introduced within a short time and before you notice you are already watching the final fight. That's the real issue here. It brushes over things quickly and you don't get much out of it. It's entertaining, but there's no weight or a good enough connection to what's going on. Everything is just decent. But, hey! This is the Justice League! It should be more than just fine... Right? Well, this is what we got. And it could have been way worse. You can watch it and not be too bothered.I liked the characters. They are all performed well. Flash is the one that I think could have been a little stronger. This is an interpretation of him being awkward and an outcast. He had his moments of being somewhat too weird, but I did laugh at most of it. Aquaman didn't get enough time, but I'm fine with the direction they went with. It was fun to see the League interact. At times I forgot about the actors and just saw the comic book heroes instead. And that's a good sign. Still, this movie is messing with me with conflicting thoughts. I liked the characters and many visuals, but the story and overall pacing is rushing instead of being effective. I didn't feel the important impacts of major scenes. I wish I did. By the way, Hans Zimmer is out and Danny Elfman comes back to the genre as a composer. He re-uses his own ""Batman"" theme from the '89 film as well as using John Williams classic ""Superman"" score. It's always nice to hear these themes, but it's really distracting. It would have been better with some new original music. The action is fine, but it doesn't get that exciting. It's just watchable with little impact. The best fight is actually the one during the beginning bank heist scene. It never got that good again. In the end I'll say that it isn't bad. It's a decent popcorn movie that for once would have benefited having a longer run-time. Just so that we could feel the importance of the Justice League forming for the first time. The good news are that the future of the DCEU might be in good hands now. We'll see, but I hope so.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Team of Heroes Deserves a Better Villain,"If there were a real fight between Marvel and DC superhero movies, the referee would have stopped it a long time ago. Alas, this is not a one vs. one bout-both can continue to win. DC movies continue to make money (somehow). So once again we watch another dreary Zack Snyder landscape in a movie that looks inappropriately gloomy for one that includes people who fly.Mercifully, Justice League is better than a few recent DC movie disasters, such as Suicide Squad and Batman vs. Superman. It still falls far short of the exceptional Wonderwoman, but in relative DC terms it feels like a win. 
Part of that comes from actual genuine efforts to have fun. This movie has jokes. Sure, not all of them are funny, but at least one of the filmmakers (likely Joss Whedon) is trying to sprinkle in some joy.Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller) shoots his shot. He may truly be funny. It's just hard to tell because so many of his lines are not. He delivers them earnestly and with proper comic timing, but he's not quite a comedy giant who can will subpar material to hilarious levels by sheer force of charisma. That's not a knock against him. Few actors ever have possessed such talents.I only wish his co-stars on screen put in half his effort. Gal Gadot was fine, not sparkling like she was in Wonderwoman but fine. To the other superhero stars-I'm not at all impressed. You can do better.Perhaps they lost their energy after reading the script, which is littered with hacky dialogue and boring, predictable plot points. Something happens at some point, but it doesn't go well so the team seeks help from someone to calm down the other someone (that's my anti-spoiler phrasing). This entire sequence of something could be considered a surprise but only if you have never seen another movie before. If that is the case, welcome to movies. Many of them are much better than this one.The greatest flaw in the movie-and I know I'm burying the lead here-is that the villain is awful. Steppenwolf is the least complicated, least interesting villain in recent memory. He wants to acquire power because he wants to be powerful. There's nothing deeper or more complicated than that. The most interesting thing about him-he's tall. Cool.That is essentially his only defining trait. No, wait. I forgot that he also carries an axe. That may be interesting to someone. The point is that he's about as deep as a raindrop, and an entire team of superheroes deserves a more compelling adversary.Stay with me, just two more nitpicks.One, I cannot stand seeing Amy Adams this tragically underutilized. She's a treasure, and this movie pays her a tremendous disservice. Two, this is second recent DC movie to blatantly exploit the most attractive female character's butt. For real, there are so many butt shots of Gal Gadot in this movie that it almost seems like certain scenes were filmed by a horny teenager.If you're a DC diehard or pathological fan of superhero movies (my group meets every other Thursday), you can see this movie and not completely hate it. Otherwise, I recommend giving this a hard pass. Instead, go see Black Panther. It's 1000x times better.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Vidiot Reviews.....,"Justice LeagueThe best thing about having Superman on your team is that you don't have to work so hard.Unfortunately, the super-friends in this fantasy are down one Kryptonian.In the wake of Superman's (Henry Cavill) death the evil Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) returns to reclaim three hidden artifacts that will allow him to transform Earth's environment into a living Hell.To prevent this from happening, Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) recruit The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to help intercept the relics before Steppenwolf's minions unite them.The quasi-sequel to Batman v Superman, DC's ensemble film featuring its flagship comic-book characters is as half-baked as its roster of metahumans. With no character development, a generic villain and embarrassing dialogue, this CGI laden actioner never stops to flesh out its one-dimensional story.Incidentally, recipients of Superman's transplanted organs should stay out of direct sunlight.

The world's most expensive fan edit...,"...Alas, this was not a fan edit, but a studio ordered cut of a film that was made so because some studio executives needed it done by a certain date for personal reasons and hoping to get enough showings to warrant more box office profit, but that's not all...Practically re-do most of the movie and make it into the kind of picture it was not ever designed to be in the first place. Anyone who has now seen Zack Snyder's Justice League on HBO Max will see just how different it is compared to the Warner Bros. / Joss Whedon version from a few years prior, there is really nothing present in this version of the film that does anything better than Snyder's. So many moments in this version are just sloppy and lazy, and at times either awkward in design or just plain silly.

"Although long time in the making, Justice League ultimately proves to be unnecessary.","After years of speculation and uncertainty, DC Films' answer to Marvel's Avengers is finally here. But is it necessary? Fans, movie pundits, studio suits and everyone else in between can argue over this for years. The answer is irrelevant, and given the outcome, even rhetorical.As awkward as it sounds, Justice League - with no less than five latex clad superheroes - is the finale to director Zack Snyder's trilogy (following Man of Steel and Batman Versus Superman) but also distances itself from the previous two by trying to fix common complaints about those films - too dark and no spunk, we said. Well guess what; The makers behind Justice League heard our protests and made this film as bright as day. There's also some humour that will draw a genuine smirk from all but the sternest viewer or harshest critic. That's it. Everything else is an incoherent, incomplete, unguided, unwanted mess.The problems are plenty because that mess is all over the place. On one level, the world is still mourning the death of Superman. Like the previous film, Biblical analogies are apparent, but only if you care to look below the surface and only if you know what to look for; which is why a genuine question in this film is whether or not a God can be resurrected, and if so, should that happen. Then the tone shifts to familiar territory. On another level, the planet is about to be destroyed by Steppenwolf (played by Ciarán Hinds by bizarrely imitating Liam Neeson), an alien general done up with bad CGI. And then there is Bruce Wayne who claims his superhero ability is being rich. If that isn't a stab at Tony Stark, is it meant to be funny? After hobbling along with these one-liners for an hour, the titular roster is setup for the first and bombastic clash of superpowers. But by this time we are essentially watching two movies, and it won't take long before it dawns on the viewer that something isn't quite right. Or not altogether there.Even as alarming as that sounds, there is yet another movie which struggles to break through the superficial cracks of the main movie, and this is probably why Justice League is almost forgivable - The idea of a team of misfits trying to fit, (which made The Avengers hugely entertaining) seems to find some footing in this film too. Ezra Miller's Barry Allen, AKA The Flash, holds a candle to Tom Holland's Peter Parker. For better or worse, Miller even has a lot more pep than Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman combined! Another welcome addition is Jason Momoa as the brooding Aquaman, and although there's something fishy about his supersonic speed, there's not much else explored.When it works, it's because of the camaraderie between some of the characters. Along with Miller's Flash, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is almost always one of them. Consistency, though, is not a strong point in this film. In the end, and despite being salvageable, Justice League is content with breeding familiarity. This includes a villain that is both weak and boring, and with an agenda that we have seen one too many times. As for Ray Fisher's Cyborg, there's little doubt that anyone will remember how and why he is a member of the League. While all this is still forgivable given Snyder's tragic personal loss during filming, the biggest undoing is a superhero film unsure of what it wants to be. Which again asks – was this necessary?",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Could have been so much better!,"Tonight in I went into the movies to watch the movie I had been wanting to see come to life since I was a child. I wore my Justice League shirt which I designed myself and was so excited to see how it would turn out. So I went in with high hopes thinking it would do so much better than Batman Vs Superman. To be honest I already thought BVS was a great movie anyway. However I left the cinema very disappointed. It was too funny and had moved away from the whole serious side that DC had pretty much built its foundations around. So I'm sorry but to suddenly change like that and for a massive movie too. It just didn't make any sense to me. It had a lot of good things about it. The action scenes were amazing! Aquaman by far steals the show and I cannot wait to see his solo film. However the one character who think would be the biggest bad-ass in the film is actually the such a wimp. Yeah I get that Batman doesn't have superpowers but come on! You took down Superman and yet now you are scared of a couple para-demons like come on. You have gadgets you could use.This is what angers me the most is when the most bad-ass character in the whole DC universe ends of being the biggest baby in a movie where he should be kicking everyone's ass. My honest opinion I reckon the whole reason why Batman was like this is because he was too dark in Batman Vs Superman, but what did you people expect he is the crown prince of darkness. That is what pisses me off, when non-comic book fans complain about movies that they don't understand and then directors have to completely change movies to suit everyone. It's just not fair to the fans who have loved the comic books and want to see what happens in the comic book come to life on the big screen. Sadly it didn't happen in Justice League. As a huge fan of the comic books this movie just didn't do it for me. Will watch it again probably but I will wait for the extended version to be released and watch that. Honestly if you aren't a comic book fan you'll probably love it.In conclusion overall it was a great action movie. However it could have been done so much better if they stuck to how Justice League: War was done. Yes I am referring to the animated movie. If they had of done that but in a live action movie well then it would have been awesome.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Abomination, disgraceful, embarrassing.","After seeing this movie for the first time I REALLY wanted to like it. It was our first Justice League movie that many had been anticipating for years. It just felt like a failed attempt at all angles, horrible editing and completely skewed direction of where the story was going to end up and where the studio wanted this to go. You could tell how much had been changed and where VFX was used to change already completed shots, to the new vision of Whedon and the studio. It was all around just a embarrassing to clearly show everyone how incompetent the team was who handled this.After ZSJL, it is BAFFLING that they would even release something like Justice League. You had an amazing movie with ZSJL and scrapped 90% of it for the worst reasons possible. The story holds so much more to it. Every character is done justice in their adaptations and how amazing they are. Each character having plenty of time to get to know and love each of them. The action is amazing, the CGI is top tier, especially compared to most movies today. So much more thought and heart was put into this screen play. There's so much world building that anybody could have taken over the helm after Zack Snyder and fulfilled what the fans would have loved to see. If you are hesitant of ZSJL After watching this piece of garbage, please give it a try. I can assure you that it is a totally different movie, leaving you wanting everything it wanted to give you in the future.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Justice League is there. You might pick up on what it means to be a hero in your heart again. So, despite all the whining and complaints from the mass of fans... I say the movie did pretty good.

Something Is Definitely Bleeding,"I revisited this cut after watching the Snyder Cut and hindsight is 20/20: WB clearly reacted to fans being upset about the dark tone of Snyder's prior films, and said ""let's hire the Avengers guy to make this like Avengers so we can be more successful"". Problem is, when you approach something superficially without passion or heart, it shows. Whedon took Snyder's Cut, chopped off 2 hours, inserted tons of Marvel phase 1 quips, and turned up the contrast. It didn't work. Why?1) The tone is inconsistent. Regardless of how people felt about BvS and Man of Steel, we had been introduced to a darker DC universe with heavier emotional themes. You throw in quips every 5 minutes, the tonal shift is cringeworthy. Batman saying ""something is definitely bleeding"" is just so stupid. I like some of the jokes in isolation - like Aquaman sitting on the lasso of truth - but a lot of the new comedic bits are sooo lame and forced. Not to mention ""booyah"" and ""I'm also a fan of justice""...god...really?2) The threat is weak. While I think Steppenwolf in Snydercut looks way cooler and the increased violence was fun, I cared more that he was actually a nuanced villain. You understand why he's doing what he's doing and even slightly sympathize with him. He is completely generic and non-threatening in Whedon's cut. The looming threat of Darkseid is more important to establish and of course we lose that here.3) The characters are weak. Because of the press for time, we don't get to have time to have our heroes join together in an organic way. We introduce Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman here and barely get any character development. It's a tall order to get us to really care about these heroes as nuanced characters in one film as it is and 2 hours to do it is just not enough. I would argue even Snyder's cut couldn't accomplish it all - he definitely made Cyborg and Flash more relatable but Aquaman was still a bit of a mystery (albeit the solo film was always planned to be next). By the time they all get together in this cut it feels unearned and not special. The Justice League uniting should feel special.4) The stache. I understand Whedon needed to rewrite the script and this required reshoots with Cavill. The contract he had with Mission Impossible sounds so juvenile. Im gonna give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt that this was the best CGI they could afford (which, still, really?). But that's so messed up to not just cede to wear a fake stache on your film and force another crew to spend tons of money on CGI. Just another example of spoiled rotten kids/execs in the sandbox who don't play well together. So dumb.I'm gonna be a little controversial here and say people reaped what they sowed. I like Snyder's darker, broodier vision for this universe since Man of Steel and I like the theatrical cut of BvS and loved the ultimate cut. The studio did what they thought was best and it just didn't work out. Now thanks to a vocal, and slightly toxic, minority of fans, we were able to get Snyder's original vision and it was great. I hope DC learns from this, picks a lane, and sticks with it without focusing so much about the bottom line or recreating Marvel's success. In my personal opinion, making the DCEU a ""darker"" version of MCU would be awesome.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Superhero Movie,"Justice League needed a live action adaption for so long. Now, after 10 years in development, we finally got the movie and it doesn't disappoint.The founding members are Batman, Wonder Woman and joining them are Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg - it's such a disappointment that fan favourite Superman (last played by Henry Cavil) is dead. JL includes two post credit scenes and both are equally great, can't spoil them.What I disliked about the movie?There are some cut scenes which end abruptly. This might be due to keep-it-under-two-hours thing. Most of the sequences from trailers are cut from the movie. In the tunnel sequence when batman brings his night-crawler he says ""My turn' in the trailer and in the movie it's just another stupid joke he makes. I don't understand why Batman has suddenly become a comic character. In another scene halfway the movie batman makes a joke about something bleeding which was totally not Batman like. If someone else made that joke I could understand but this is the Goddammn Batman we are talking. He just doesn't bleed and yell.I really hated the Wonder Woman and Flash sequence where he falls on her boobs. I will not talk about those ass shots.For all those shouting bad CGI I didn't notice Henry Cavil's moustache. The CGI was really done. I was enjoying the movie not looking for a frame to yell 'hey look bad CGI'. Honestly I noticed it only in beginning phone recording sequence (I am sure it was inspired by Homecoming, which is really sad. WB had show little hope that They could have used such cheap shots. They could have allotted this time for more character building.The road to Justice League 2 is very long. I hope it doesn't get cut down too.

Delivers what it promises 'Fun',"What you expect from a film ?? Entertainment ?? Of course!! Justice league keeps you engaged till the very end And it has enough ingredients to keep your interest alive. So here is the story line -- Batman is gathering a team of meta-humans with the help of Wonder Woman to save the world from the wrath of an ancient Villain called Steppen Wolf. He is searching for mother boxes ,the most powerful energy sources in existence, in order to Dominate the world. There is flash , there is Batman , Wonder woman , Aquaman and Cyborg Of course! And then there is Superman in a long special appearance. Performances: Ben Affleck as the Batman is first rate , Gal Gadot is the real show stealer here , she's outstanding in every frame. Ezra Miller is quite funny and he has given some good lines to deliver. Jason Mamoa and Ray fisher are good enough. Direction by Zack Snyder could've been more better,his Narrative style is so simple and there is no twist and turns in the plot. Editing is fine , could've been crispier. Dialogues are quirky and one liners are well written. Action scenes are thrilling and there are two major Combat sequences one is in the first half and the other One in climax and they both standout. All in the whole JL is a treat for DC fans and for me also. Don't miss it , it's better than BvS and you'll surely have fun. My rating :7 /10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

WW,Aquaman, Flash) + Gotham is buauuuutifully presented as we have imagined it growing up + Post credit scenes rock! + Visually amazing, costumes are on point + Amazing nicks between lead casts + Action sequences especially Flash's + A quick surprise fight midway in movie ( wont spoil it. Hint: big guns)Negative Points: - Batman's character is thinly written, he probably doesn't even fights steppanwolf. Similar for Cyborg and side casts. - Steppanwolf is bland - The backhround score hugely lacks impact thanks to last minute change. Check out the opening track ""beautiful lie"" in BvS, you'll know the difference. - 2 Hrs screen time instead of 2 Hrs 50 Min - Thus, whole movie feels rushed and abrupt endings of scenesIf you're not able to resist to see it in big screen or are not familiar with superhero movies, don't see it wait for director's cut.Giving 6/10 now, which i'm sure I will rate again after watching the full release which i know will be better.

"It is a let-down, but still judged a bit too harshly","Justice League is the 5th DCEU movie and all four of the previous ones were building up to this one (and it should have been more). So much set-up in the previous movies and did it pay off? No, it didn't. But is it bad? Definitely not.First, let's talk a bit about the history of DCEU. Unpopular opinion here, I liked all DCEU movies so far (yes, even Suicide Squad, I'm gonna get so much hate for this), but I do realize it's very flawed and could have been done a lot better. Almost every movie was a missed potential, including this one. The main problem is that Warner Bros. worries too much and listens to criticisms more than it should. There's nothing wrong with listening criticisms, actually it can be a great thing, but WB gets very confused about them. Man of Steel worked okay, aside from some lack of development and a bit awkward pacing, I thought it worked. BvS was damaged by the editing. Of course there were more flaws like an overstuffed script with too much set-up and some scenes that had good ideas, but poorly executed. Maybe it could have been glossed over easily if they didn't cut it down so much. The extended version isn't perfect, but it's an improvement (even though the theatrical version wasn't as horrible as everyone was saying, it had style, it had ideas, it was different and was a spectacle). But that was supposed to be the movie to release. Then they panicked and listened to some really unfair criticisms about it being too dark. Not every movie has to be an action comedy, we have Marvel for that. And that led to crippling Suicide Squad. I still think it's entertaining and I like it for all it's flashy fun. I just had such an amazing time with it, I just couldn't hate it. Even though I see its flaws, but they didn't ruin it for me. Wonder Woman was finally, a success, so there was a lot of hope here. Aaand it feel a bit flat on its face.It's not bad, just slightly above average. It provides some epic moments, but it falls into mediocrity, because WB got afraid of making risks. They cut it down, so it's not overlong, but it only ended up feeling incomplete. Long doesn't necessarily make for overlong. So it all feels very rushed and at times like you missed a few scenes, even though you didn't. Humor was hit-and-miss (miss more often than hit), so injecting that much humor and copying Marvel was a really, really bad idea. Some is okay, sure, but don't make it feel so forced. The characters are very underdeveloped, if they didn't want to introduce them in their own movies, then give them more time in this one. These are just some really bad creative decisions. Another thing DCEU surprisingly doesn't nail at all is the villains (even though I'm in the minority who liked Jared Leto's Joker), as much as DC usually does. And Steppenwolf is the worst of them all. He's a CGI abomination who looks like he wandered in here from some PS3 game. He looks as bad as Incubus, but he's an even lamer character. There's barely a motivation, just a typical power- hungry alien and actually, you barely notice him. There's not one redeemable quality. Not one.Now let's get to the positives. It's very fun and has some really epic moments that show what could have been. The actors fit their roles, the characters as underdeveloped as they may sometimes seem, are okay presented and each one has something to do or some unique quality to them. The plot is a lot more clear and cohesive than BvS and only so slightly less thin than The Avengers. And has some gorgeously shot moments with beautiful cinematography (Gotham City looks amazing). The score by Danny Elfman is a bit forgettable, but has some surprising nods to some older DC scores.So, all in all, there are a lot of cons, but I think the pros outweigh them. Once again, a DC movie is judged to harshly. It's not great, and it's definitely ruined by the studio, but it's entertaining and considering how production went, it could have been worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Barely as good as it needed to be,"Not a good movie by a long shot, but I enjoyed it simply because it gave me heroes who actually acted like heroes and not tortured souls who have no idea why they do what they do. Big relief to see Superman acting like the ""can do"" guy we love. Glad Batman's not a homicidal maniac. WW remains great. New guys are okay.Movie's a mess, clunks around a lot, bad dialog, mostly lame jokes (with a couple good ones), but I left the theater feeling good.

How a director change can derail a production.,"I expected more of this film, specially because I liked Batman vs Superman. Unfortunately, the director change during the production is felt during the whole movie. It tries to hard to be a Marvel movie instead of being a good story on its own. The humor is a hit or miss, the re-shooting of those Superman scenes (with the ""uncanny valley"" removal of the mustache) is a mess. It is watchable, but is just not a movie to pay for. You can almost feel how the production was steering the story towards a lighter theme instead of continuing the whole atmosphere or world built on the previous movies.Watch the Zack Snyder's cut instead. It is a 200% better experience (and longer too).",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another let down,"Justice League was definitely better than BvS but the bar was never that high. The film was a slightly better, less dark and lighter film. You could tell they were trying to pull of the humor that Marvel did effortlessly. The acting was decent but it was woven together by a weak story and villain. Except for sharing a name with a great rock band, the villain failed to impress and create a sense of danger. The plot was the standard I want to destroy earth and raise my kingdom and the heroes need to band together again.Ben Affleck seemed uninterested in this film and didn't have as much of a presence as I would have liked. Wonder Woman as always worked like a charm and captured everyone's attention. The flash actually worked and the jokes were not that bad. Cyborg and Aquaman were a disappointment. While they looked the part, they failed too impress. Another big flaw in this film was the importance and hype the overpowered Superman was given. While I don't mind Superman as a hero but he has too many powers and it is only some ridiculous alien monster with no personality that presents a challenge. When he finally returned in the last and lackluster fighting scene he was more formidable than his opponent and easily fought off the villain. Where was the intensity and challenge if this overpowered hero easily beats down the villain. It's obvious Snyder has a crush on Superman.Sadly there was a lot of potential but it was wasted in a movie that will likely be forgotten in a year. Zac Snyder should be prevented and blocked from making superhero movies. He has ruined and stopped the DC universe from taking off except for Wonder Woman.6.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie was so bad,"Absolutely disappointed, the movie lacked any depth and felt like a sequence of scenes designed solely to set up to future stand alone movies for the so called heroes from Justice league. The movie lacked any depth and all dialog consisted mainly of one liners and sad attempts to get some laughs. DC simply can't match Marvel and I think that is a shame since they have such rich material to work with. I think in future I will give DC movies a miss.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What an incredible film!!! Marvelous in every way,"Just recently saw Justice League today and I have to say, as someone who took awhile to watch it and has been anticipating it for sometime, I have to say WOW what a film. The film was excellent from start to finish, people who say this film was bad or this film was not good are really acting like they're a film critic. Its a FICTION film people!! not to be taken so seriously. The character development was great for each character which they don't want to so too much because they have their own films in development in their own right. As a comic book nerd and fanboy I can tell I can die happy now because it was everything that I wanted to Justice League. Barry Allen stole the show, Aquaman was awesome, I liked how they went more into Batman's story, Superman was brief but great to have him back, Cyborg was really my favorite among everyone. Don't know why but liked his character development the most. An cant forget about Diana aka Wonder Woman who is beautiful and strong as usual. Something about that woman. Cant wait what DCEU has in store oh and stay for the wtf after credits scene.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Thoroughly enjoyable,"After suffering superhero fatigue from watching Iron Man 25, or whatever number the Marvel Iron Man remakes have reached now, I thoroughly enjoyed the more grown up Justice League. The DC Universe doesn't feel the need to crack a joke every 20 seconds like Marvel movies(10 in Thor), this makes it feel more like reading a DC comic book which often dealt with darker themes. The colour palette in the movie is brilliantly done, remiscent of the beautiful airbrushed artwork of the 80's comic books I read as a child.
The criticism of the bad guy is valid, he is boring and generic, but then again, so is the bad guy in countless cape movies. 
The one thing I found jarring was the casting of Jason Mamoa as Aquaman, I couldn't think of many actors worse suited to the role. As I stated earlier, the movie's visuals are highly reminiscent of 80's artwork, so why you wouldn't cast an Aquaman that looked and acted like hero we grew up with is hard to understand and may negatively affect the upcoming movie. Maybe enough GOT fans will up the attendance.
Anyway, ignore the critics, unless you are a fanatical Marvel movie fan you will probably enjoy this movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film of superficial emotions and chaotic action with a generic ending.,"Fun for those who enjoy the DCEU universe as a whole, because what seemed most to watch the movie after the exchange of Snyder and Whedon was wanting to make a film in the style ""Marvel"", but without the essence, characteristic and will of Marvel to deliver to the audience a decent comedy and impressive or intriguing action scenes. The plot is also not good and misses all opportunities to present a villain who likes to hate for the right reasons, but he is only generic. And what reason to continue with the universe ?! It will not work at all if they continue on this ""roller coaster"" in all attempts that will end in an hour.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as bad as I thought,"This is a decent superhero film. Went into this with no expectations at all as I've not exactly been impressed with DC's offerings so far, but I was pleasantly surprised. Is it up to Marvel Movie standards yet? No. Does it show promise for the DC franchise's future? Most definitely.

I couldn't stand it,"Okay, first of all. I wasn't gonna see it in cinemas, I wanted to wait until it comes out online. But all those trailer, and the ""hype"" had me going. Turns out, it was very big disappointment. I don't know how to even start. If they want to make a movie, let it go how comics say. Because of their only hit ""Wonder Woman"", they made her the wisest, strongest, dominant character ever. It felt like more Wonder woman ft justice league than Justice league. It felt like Batman, superman and all other characters were there at the mercy of wonder woman. The way batman acts, superman acts (in comics), over here, it was all just about wonder woman. I know wonder woman is inspiring this and that, but they over did it here. I can't even take it out from my mind how bad it felt I don't think so we are ever gonna see bad-ass batman EVERY AGAIN. It's all about wonder woman now. Secondly, CGI wasn't gonna enough. Story was very predictable, nothing special, no surprises. And the Superman, wasn't exciting, somehow you already know what was gonna happen. It all just felt awful, I wanted to see bad-ass ""batman"", meaning of hope ""Superman"", the king aqua man, inspiring wonder woman etc. But this is more like, we beg you wonder woman for your mercy, please guide us, we are nothing without you, all that crap. I'm not hating on wonder woman (comics), but this is really awful. See there are many plot holes, but it would have been exciting if they did like comics, instead making it all about wonder woman because she had such a hit in DCEU. Gal Gadot is to DC like RDJ to Marvel. Just the difference is RDJ helps all other actors in MCU to rise with him, Gal Gadot makes it all about her, her and HER.

The Cinematic Equivalent of a Loveless Marriage,"2017's Justice League is another entry in DC's desperate and rushed attempt at wrestling the superhero film genre back from Marvel. Instead of working to uniquely match the set design of Thor Ragnarok, drama of Logan, and the chemistry and combat sequences of The Avengers, Snyder & co have essentially created another Marvel ripoff. Apart from the performances of Gadot, Miller, and Fisher, the film is a slog to get through, filling scenes with nauseating action sequences and forced character chemistry. The main antagonist, Steppenwolf, is a bland ripoff from the Avengers, and the ""driving force"" in the movie, the ""Mother Boxes"" feel like a poorly motivated off-shot of the Infinity Stones.I'm not a Marvel or DC fanboy, I'm just trying to talk about this film as a film. The superhero genre is more saturated than ever, and you have plenty of better options than this.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deserves To Be Better,"When you have Justice League as the title, you expect some grandiose movie. Because Marvel's Avengers has set the bar, another movie about superheroes group must be good. But this movie just doesn't deliver.I understand why the bad ratings here. When you expecting a 9 but you get 6 instead, that will feels like a 3. The movie just let us down.Unlike Avengers that already has movies about each superheroes, Justice League only has Man Of Steel and Batman v Superman. The other superheroes story were cramped in little time. So we don't really feel connected with them.But to be honest this movie is not really suck. It's kinda okay movie.

Avengers-DC version,"So the wait is finally over.Had my expectations low after criticisms of how WB made a mess of a movie by cutting off 45 minutes of the movie,but the movie ended up being pretty good.Didn't witness such a pacy screenplay in Hollywood in a long time,the 2 hours passed in a blink of an eye.Due to Joss Wheldon's influence,JL reminded me of Avengers in several places and there were plenty of jokes,but they were fine except for the flash,who was more annoying and whiny than funny.Superman's moments in the movie are beyond doubt the best parts of the movie.As far as the negatives are concerned,I really missed Hans and Junkie XL in this movie.Danny Elfman's score was nothing more than fillers to the narrative.There were a couple of scenes where the old themes were used and that was the only consolation.And barring a few slow mo scenes,I felt Zack Snyder's touch lacking.Lets hope we get the full extended director's cut soon",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"DC just isn't understanding themselves. They produce Man Of Steel with a powerful villain and weak hero and then they end it by one simple punch which kills the villain. Batman VS Superman just wasn't what is should have been. They fought for about two minutes and then were allies the rest of the time. Doomsday killing the weak Superman was the only thing that saved the film. Suicide Squad I haven't seen so can't judge but I am guessing that the reviews are may be accurate but they may be a little bit too harsh. Then you did produce a very good film, Wonder Woman. Good villains, a hero that can actually stand a chance and an ending which everyone will love. But then Justice League makes a wrong turn.They introduced the heroes in a clever way, Flash obviously being one of the better ones but there wasn't enough of something. Steppenwolf just seemed like a random villain who needed a couple of magic boxes to end the world. He probably only killed about two minor people and that was about it. There was no origin and he didn't stand out very well. For a film which tries to act like the Avengers, it wasn't doing a good job. The heroes were fine except from Superman obviously and Lois Lane is someone we want more of in the films. The ending was boring, the build up took a bit too long and the action that was used was OK. The action saved it really and some of the CGI.In order for DC to improve it needs to start introducing better villains like Bane, Mr Freeze and Joker. Although, the dark Knight trilogy and Lego Batman Movie are probably better examples of using these sorts of characters. Overall 7.3/10 for this film, in some places it would have been lower or higher. For those who prefer DC to Marvel, get it right. Marvel has better movies like Thor Ragnarok and Guardians Of The Galaxy. Even Avengers did a better job at creating the team. When you think about what you liked better out of the Marvel and DC films, more Marvel will be liked. The only time DC might be better than Marvel is when watching some of the Xmen films.Watch this film if you have to but don't expect the sort of battle scenes or decent story you'd expect from Marvel because you may leave feeling rather annoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a let down,I have been waiting for this movie for a while now but it really let me down. The villain is the biggest problem here.

Went In With Low Expectations And Came Out Happy,"I went in with low expectations because of all the bad reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. Warner Brothers listened to the complaints from Batman V Superman and made the script funny, witty, fun. It had action, drama, and was a lovely colorful ride. They finally got Superman right. I'm actually a bit miffed at how the reviews are so low. DC can't seem to win. I read some complaints that the character development wasn't enough. Really? These characters have been in the collective consciousness for decades. Superman and Batman has been around since the 1930's and Wonderwoman has been around since the 1940s. Do we really need more character development. I love that they got right into it with out all the boring repetitive back stuff. It's too dark they complain so they listened and made it light. Now, they complain it's to light. Ugh. I loved it. Don't let the Critics spoil your time or make you prejudice against it. I think a lot of critics are copy cat reviewers and once a trend gets started they all copy each other. If you go in with an open mind, you'll come out happy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fine enough DC universe movie, deserves more breathing space...","I guess this is that movie that has been so easy for people to just throw pelters at it. If anything, it's been incredible the reaction against but also some of the support also. Let's be honest much of the criticism is also due to the rivalry faction of DC fans v Marvel fans, and i can't be bothered with all that.Anyhow, as for this, I am much in the centre. Having only just watched the film I thought that there was actually a lot to commend it for, but yes there are some flaws.Lighter in note than either ""Man of Steel"" of ""Batman V Superman"", it's more accessible. Characters are a good mixture and entertaining, and I really warmed to them. I thought Aquaman stole the show but The Flash was also excellent. Humour was good and simple. So much to like and it all keeps your attention.Flaws? Well, the story could have been better and Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot really can't act or hold the screen. The villain just wasn't strong enough but thankfully wasn't a simple copy of Marvel. The final battle was confusing, not sure how it was all resolved. Also what's the point of Lois Lane in these films? She's been terrible used, or just simply the wrong actress. Just not convinced.Despite those criticisms, don't get me wrong, it's a fine enough tentpole film. Most critics have gone over the top, and personally I think it's incredible that this has taken as much flak as it has when a number of far inferior Marvel movies have been given an easy ride in comparison (e.g. Avengers 2).It's a watchable and enjoyable film. Deserves more breathing space, and really it's a fine evening out. The series will evolve and improve, especially with new directors in line, so should be interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ai Yai Yai. This Is The Best They Got?,"""Justice League"" is one of the most anticipated for a lot of people. We  have all dreamed of seeing these heroes on the screen for an eternity,  and we finally have it. The DCEU hasn't had a good track record, and  it's no secret that I haven't been too kind to it myself. They're 1 for  4 in my opinion. Now...they're 1 for 5.  I went in giving it a chance. I gave it a chance. I wanted to like it.  It's the Justice League for crying out loud. But it's just not a good  movie.   Everything we hated about BvS is in this movie. They didn't listen.  They try to add some humor into the movie but it doesn't work, and it's  mostly with the Flash. It came across as forced and none of the jokes  were funny. It had some tonal issues, mostly it was a movie trying to  be dark and serious and twisted but then there are attempts at humor  that really throw the movie off its rhythm.   Steppenwolf was a lame villain, with a very generic villain plan. His  plan involves these three boxes that are portals, and he has parademons  and they try to bring about the end of the world and the Justice League  has to stop them. Did i mention beams in the sky yet? His CGI is  atrocious. For a movie with a rumored $300 million dollar budget you  would think the visual effects team would at least try to make it not  look noticeable. it was and it was really distracting. And it wasn't  just Steppenwolf. They do the slo-mo action sequences, which I haven't  been a fan of for a long time, but I understand that is Zack Snyder's  style.   I had heard about the movie being flawed, but fun. I can say I didn't  think it was fun. There were some moments Where I felt I was having fun  but then in the same scenes there was something that just took away  from that fun. Even if the movie wasn't executed properly, which it  wasn't, I wanted to have some fun, and unfortunately I didn't feel as  if I did.  There is some bad editing and cropping too. I noticed some obvious ADR  moments and a lot of the heads were cut off when it came to cropping  scenes.   Characterization is really thin, the plot is thin, there's plot holes  galore thanks to the mandated two hour runtime. This is a band of  superheroes that deserves better than what we got.  I am going to give ""Justice League"" a D+.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"DC and Disappointment: Two steps forward, One step back","I honestly don't understand some of the fan reviews I've been reading about this film... It's as though we've been watching very different movies.I went in to Justice League with an open mind, having had problems with Snyder's previous films (though not hating them) and having loved Wonder Woman. I have to say that despite my best efforts to see past small problems, I found it very difficult to like this movie. I am a fan of primarily the DC trinity. Have been for at least 15 years, and I know that would lead people to think that my problems are likely an objection to the changes from the source material. Let me assure you, they are not. This movie is, at times, disjointed and aloof. It leaves too many things unexplained; so much so that it becomes distracting. Furthermore, it is completely riddled with CGI. There's even evidence of CG in scenes that I wouldn't think require much CG. Most of the worst CG are found in scenes with the villain or Superman.Let me clarify, there are redeemable qualities in this movie. Almost every time Wonder Woman is on screen, she makes the movie better. I still don't take issue with Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne (his motivations and decisions are another matter). I found Cyborg surprisingly compelling. There are a few funny jokes (but also a few truly terrible ones). I was actually excited by some of the backstory and Easter eggs in the movie (the flashback was a highlight for me). And I can really appreciate what they were going for here, but the execution was so problematic.I hated how the amazons were treated in this movie and how they went from wearing roman-style armour in the previous (female directed) film, to stylized bikini-clad warriors in this (male directed) movie. 2 steps forward, one step back I guess.I mostly hated the dialogue and the unanswered questions. The dialogue, like most Zack Snyder movies is so unnatural and ridiculous, not even Joss' snappy word play could save it. At one point Superman says ""but I also believe in Justice"" and I rolled my eyes so hard I thought I would pass out. The villain is never properly explained. Like, how did he get here? How does he have access to his minions? What is his larger plan? I know that it all ties to a larger villain, but it's not explained to the audience. The casts' abilities and power levels are all over the place and the new recruits are given no explanation as to how or why they would suddenly be capable to do battle on the level of the DC trinity (who have trained in combat).I could go on, but there's no point. It will do well. It's the first time we've seen some of these characters, so we'll get more of this and the criticisms won't ultimately matter. But DC could learn a lot from Marvel. It's worth taking your time to build up a cohesive narrative rather than trying to play catch-up. I'd recommend waiting to see it rather than spending $20 to see it in a theatre. Save your money for Thor Ragnarok.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"DC shows us the heroes in their Superheroes, and you can't help but have fun in this hopeful Rebirth!","I had a BLAST from start to finish! Fans of all ages who like Superheroes, this movie is for you and will guarantee to bring a smile to your face!DC gives us a fun thrilling experience by showing us some of their best heroes uniting to bring us the hope their universe deserves. I look at this movie in parallel to their comics right now; a Rebirth of what everyone likes most about this fandom, and that's got to be the heroics. The inspiration of exceptional individuals that overcome odds to bring hope to those in need. This is the theme of this movie, and you see this vision very clear throughout the film.Was this movie perfect? I will admit, there are flaws, but not enough to get in the way of enjoying the movie. I can honestly say I had fun seeing this multiple times already, which in my opinion should be the reason you go to see a movie anyway, to have fun. We spend money to see stuff like this to escape everyday life and witness the extraordinary, and if you agree with me then you should have no problem seeing this movie.Overall, it's a great movie that you can see with anyone and expect to have a good time. It's a celebration of DC and it's just pure bliss to see on the screen. It shows us the best of these characters, and makes you crave for more at the end. I'm beyond EXCITED for what will come next for DC, don't miss out on this!Also!!! Stay until the very end of the credits, there are two credits scenes!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
An enjoyable transition in the DCEU,"After the very polarizing critical failures of previous entries in the DC Extended Universe, the year 2017 was seen as do or die for the franchise and it got off to a good start with Wonder Woman, which was universally well received by critics and fans alike. In Justice League, we have a dream film for many who were first introduced to the comics world through the various adaptations of DC characters for both big and small screen. The idea of seeing the epic team-up of said characters in a big budget project was something many fans from different generations could only fantasize about for a very long time and with it finally happening, there was a sense of caution, considering the sour recent experiences. The result was a very enjoyable film that while not a masterpiece, wasn't really trying to be one. The flick succeeds in its' most important mission which was giving fans a fun two hours.There are more than a few negative aspects of the movie. For instance, the short run time makes it difficult to properly explore the characters who probably could have benefited from a closer look at them. When it comes to the villain, Steppenwolf of ""New Gods"" fame, I don't think even more time could have made him a credible threat as he is about as empty as a filler bad guy of the week TV episode.While Superman is definitely one of the better parts of the movie, his return to life feels somewhat hollow in meaning, considering that Henry Cavill is the second name in the opening credits and that there was never a reasonable doubt about his being a fake out death. One that was not properly built up as it happened in only his second film. This time, it feels like the best improvement made was exactly in the handling of Supes, presented as a beacon of hope for the world, which would've been much more meaningful if it had been shown like that in previous outings.The CGI, as you might have read or already seen, is very disappointing and at times it seems inferior to even the Injustice video games. That is unforgivable on a project with such a large budget and while it doesn't detract too much from the movie going experience, it still is very distracting and should be vastly improved in future entries.Putting the negative aside, this was a welcome change in tone. The touch of Joss Whedon is very noticeable and it's a shame he wasn't brought on earlier in the production. We got superheroes instead of dark and gritty antiheroes that do not always work. A team that was actually saving people rather than causing a lot of the destruction that terrified citizens to begin with. They are now very likable thanks to the dialogue and better chemistry between all involved.Ezra Miller, playing the role of The Flash as basically Spiderman now is for the Avengers as a kid working alongside veteran heroes does a good job and my only complaints are that he is basically Wally West with the Barry Allen name. His origin story has a very big hole, but I believe that will be better explained in his own movie.Gal Cadot is perfect once again as Wonder Woman and her story as a reluctant hero gets properly developed. That is of course one of the benefits of having separate movies to establish the members of a superhero team as it helps flesh them out more. Here, we understand Diana's doubts, her motivations and reactions thanks to the fact that we already know the character independently from the League. Ben Affleck does a good job with what he is given for Batman and proves a good transitional leader, being forced into that position by the circumstances around him. He assumes the responsibility of a world without Superman, knowing quite well that he can never become that symbol. The traditional loner becomes the uniting factor here and left me wanting more of the character, in a good way.I didn't care much for Aquaman and Cyborg, but they are good utility players here and think there is a lot of good that can be done with them in the future. Which in the end, is what this movie does, give us a transition from one vision that didn't work to one that hopefully does much better. Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice for the most part, were not fun, but Justice League was. Once you bring entertainment back to the center of film making, you are going in the right direction. I understand and perhaps even agree with most of the criticism for the movie, but I think audiences will be greatly pleased with this leap in quality. Just like The Flash is seen getting used to his speed and stumbling, we are seeing a franchise growing accustomed to its' powers in the lead to something that can be great.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I enjoy Ezra Miller in the role but Ben Affleck just doesn't cut it as Bruce Wayne/Batman.

"Justice league is a good movie, entertaining and exciting.","The movie starts a little messy, but as the story and characters develop, it manages to keep the attention of the viewer, as the characters of the group achieve a very good chemistry on screen, which gives you enthusiasm to want to see more of this group. The conflicts between them and their individual stories make you feel that you want to know more about them. The low point of the film occurs after the development and union of the team because the climax develops very simply and the villain (steppenwolf) is totally forgotten, being a character with a vague development and too simplistic motivations. Understanding that it is only the preamble of what should be followed in the DCEU with Darkseid is acceptable anyway but it could have been used much better. Finishing the post- credit scenes are very interesting and entertaining opening the door to a great opportunity forward in the DCEU, Justice League is a relief for this universe, after a shaky and weak start.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not a Perfect Movie But An Entertaining One,"Justice League (2017)*** (out of 4)After the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Batman (Ben Affleck) decides to get a superteam together because a strong enemy could be trying to end the world. With the help of Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) the Justice League goes out to defeat Steppenwolf but a moral question regarding Superman creeps up.It seems that in today's comic book movie world one must constantly compare the two rivals. That of course being DC and Marvel but I think we're at the point where that just needs to stop. Sure, fans have their favorites but comparing the two is just rather pointless to me but then again I'm not really a comic book fan. With that said, I'm also not a huge fan of Zack Snyder but I must say that I found JUSTICE LEAGUE to be an entertaining movie. Even though it falls well short of being a classic or even one of the better comic book movies out there.I think the best part of the film is the fact that the superheroes themselves are so good and entertaining. It does seem that Batman's role in the film was taken down a bit and this might be due to how successful WONDER WOMAN was at the box office. She's certainly front and center here and there's no question that's not a bad thing. I also thought the addition of Aquaman was great as Momoa was excellent in the role and it was great whenever he was on the screen. I also thought The Flash was put to a good start here, although it seems they were taking the more ""dork"" approach like Spider-Man was in the AVENGERS movie. I wasn't the biggest fan of Cyborg here as he was the least interesting of all the heroes.Snyder's direction was actually quite good here but I guess there's some controversy over him walking away from the project and it being finished by Joss Whedeon. I don't know all the details of who shot what or who made what decisions but I thought the flow of the movie was quite good. I also thought the CGI world was good for what it was and especially the battle scene at the end, which was a lot of fun. The performances were good by the entire cast as there's no question that everyone is fitting into their roles nicely. I'm still not sure what's up with the voice of Batman but that's another topic.JUSTICE LEAGUE, as I said, has some flaws including it getting off to a rather slow start. I'd also argue that the film could have used a tad bit more excitement but at the same time I think it delivered enough to where fans should be entertained.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
GREAT super-hero movie,"Batman (Ben Affleck) gathers together Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to battle Steppenwolf (CGI). He's a being from Darkseid to get three boxes on Earth to get total control.Quick (only 2 hours), fast and basically lots of fun. After the disaster that was ""Batman vs. Superman"" I expected the worst but was pleasantly surprised. There's plenty of action and carton-like violence but no blood or gore. The plot is easy to understand and there's welcome doses of humor. There's also great acting by Affleck and Gadot. However there are minuses. Fisher is blank as Cyborg. Miller is neither cute nor charming--just annoying. Also turning Aquaman into a bad-ass was a spectacularly stupid idea. Also Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) and Diane Lane (as Ma Kent) were woefully underused. Still I loved the movie. Also, as always, wait for a cool little sequence after the closing credits.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Justice Has Dawned, But It's A Mixed Bag","While there's no cringe-worthy dialogue akin to Will Smith saying ""So are we some kind of Suicide Squad?"" but this film as a whole toes that line between awesome and passable.This film fulfills the promise made by Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne/Batman at the end of Batman v. Superman: to bring together the other meta humans of Earth to fight a threat greater than any one of them could face alone. However, if you thought the character development of the three other heroes besides Wonder Woman was lacking in BvS' email attachments, it doesn't get much better in this film.Yes, we see Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, and he definitely rejects the lame stereotype his character has been weighed down by for decades. Yes, we get to meet Barry Allen/The Flash, and Ezra Miller does a fun take on the character to complement the job Grant Gustin has been doing on the CW show. Yes, we get to finally have a proper look at Victor Stone/Cyborg, and for Ray Fisher's first major film, he does a pretty good job.The problem lies with the fact that this film can't shake the feeling that it's just an inferior version of The Avengers. Unlike The Avengers, though, where each main team member had its own film to flesh out their character and motivations and build towards a villain the whole while, this film came before that stage. Wonder Woman had her fantastic origin story, and Heny Cavill's Superman had his film as well, but all the other heroes have yet to be fleshed out properly, and it shows.The action is by far the best aspect of this film. It's what I expected going in to this film, mainly great action and just enough plot for the change in scenery between fight scenes to make some sort of sense. We get that, and it's great.The problem then comes from the plot itself, specifically the villain Steppenwolf, who is the main catalyst for the formation of the Justice League. Never mind his name alone brings to mind magic carpet rides being born to be wild, the full CGI character looks terrible for a big budget film. Plus, while his motivations are explained, barely, and full of clichés, his minions the Parademons fall into the same category as Enchantress' minions from Suicide Squad, a disposable CGI army to distract the heroes before facing the main enemy. Their creation, from the bodies of fallen enemies, holds fantastic promise but is never utilized.In short, this film is good in that it is fan wish fulfillment done properly, and has some great character moments between action sequences. I for one can't wait to see the solo Aquaman film. How much of the witty banter throughout is due to Joss Whedon taking over for Zach Snyder we may never know, but it is a welcome addition and blends in seamlessly.If you were let down by BvS and Suicide Squad but Wonder Woman had you crying for joy, this film will land somewhere in between. Check it out and see for yourself, but just know it's a dent in the DCEU's seemingly upward trajectory.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ignore the 1's and 2's,"I really don't understand the horrible reviews. I will definitely admit that Marvel went about everything better, and their movies are a notch above, but this is still good. I guess I'm in the minority on this as well, but I liked this movie more than Wonder Woman. Maybe it's the psychological effect of going in to that movie expecting a masterpiece, and watching this one expecting a dud. I just thought Wonder Woman was very hokey and cliche throughout (especially the boyfriend). Justice League was solid all around IMO. Flash and Cyborg were great. Plot was decent. Action packed and witty. I guess I'm just saying, if you like the DC heroes, and you liked the Wonder Woman movie, you will like this...unless, of course, you let the bad reviews talk you out of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Justice League: Too little, too soon","So DC holds the two biggest superheroes in the World (Superman/Batman) so why are they getting so thoroughly dismantled by Marvel? Why is their universe simply not working?I think there are a number of reasons but the primary one is that they are using a failing formula. Look at Marvel, they established each character with their own movie(s), they did a slow build in creating their universe and introduced the characters to one another over time.DC however didn't, they did a couple of Superman movies, Wonder Woman, the messy Batman vs Superman and the barely connected to the DC Universe (At that time) Suicide Squad. And then like that boom Justice League without establishing Aquaman, Cyborg or Flash.I'm rooting for DC don't get me wrong but at this stage it'll take something special to turn things around. Batman vs Superman should have been one of the biggest movies of all time yet fell flat and Justice League suffers from the same ills.A massive cgi-fest that feels rushed and forced, an Aquaman who is no doubt badass but simply isn't Arthur Curry, a villian so dull he at no point felt like a threat and a generic army of henchmen.Justice League was supposed to be DC's crown jewel but is just another further demonstration that they have absolutely no idea what they're doing.The Good:Performances are solid for a movie of this genreThe Bad:Aquaman is poorly castAll feels rushedAction scenes are hit and missTerrible antagonistHenry Cavill is just awfulThings I Learnt From This Movie:Aquaman is going to be dreadfulDC is not and will never be able to compete with Marvel",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Leagues of justice done to icons?,"With Superman dead, crime is rampant, hope is deteriorating, and Batman(Affleck, sad to be here, no longer brooding because it polled poorly) feels a need to redeem himself for his role in Big Blue biting the... spear. Paranoia apparently washes right off. He puts together a team(who will occasionally even work together when they face off against enemies) of people with powers, as evidence mounts of an alien invasion.This is essentially a series of well-done if repetitive(if Steppenwolf(Hinds, who voices a full CGI character brought to life with bad effects) is in a place, he's probably there to get a MacGuffin Box, and most likely, he'll get it. You wonder why these people even pretend to be keeping them from him, and if they couldn't have done more to make them hard to get to) action scenes, with materials connecting them – basically, you need to get the people from point A to point B, so every single fight isn't set in the same location. It is deeply forgettable. Meanwhile, I'm not going to pretend I didn't enjoy myself. For many, that will be enough. It's very clear what is done by Snyder and what by Whedon, and both do some things right, other things wrong.Barry(Miller, funny, socially awkward) isn't annoying. Aquaman(Momoa, really going for that Wolverine status) comes off as a whiny adopted kid in an adult's body, and you don't buy him joining the rest. Cyborg(Fisher, going for RoboCop) goes back and forth between ""I can't control the unpredictable tech growing in me"" and ""here's how we're gonna do this because I now know what I can do and no problems accomplishing it"". The introduction of these three is rushed and underwhelming. It feels as though we're expected to have watched the three solo movies that have yet to come out yet. Wonder Woman(Gadot, who does raise a lot of the meh material she's given) is given little to do, and it's clear that those behind this don't love her character like Patty Jenkins, Gal, and 90% of everyone who watched her own film.

DC's slow descend back to camp,"An entirely forgettable affair in every sense of the word, Justice League fails to setup any further direction to the DC world-building than a slow descend back to camp where it was after Tim Burton's Batman movies 25 years ago. Nolan's years at helm are certainly far away by now.The bafflingly conventional, illogical and randomly jumping story doesn't have a single unexpected turn of events and instead treads waters that have been trod many times before and with greater success. The CGI is strangely haphazard, with very little care how it stands out when scenes are edited together. Steppenwolf is an eye-wateringly bad villain, becoming a clumsy scarecrow whose motivations and powers come and go.Actors are an uneven bunch, both as characters and as talents, and fail to generate camaraderie or chemistry. Ezra Miller is so much better as an actor than the rest that he becomes a distraction by reminding us about it constantly. Every time his delivery elevates the poor material, it turns against the movie when the next one who opens his mouth only looks cringe-worthy.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I wasn't sure how I would like Ben Affleck as Batman, but I thought it was great.

Visuals were great.The bad: Where I understand the bad reviews was the plot. The story seemed very choppy and just didn't flow together very well.

Even in comics, those characters have different original stories depending what you read...so you don't connect with them...I did not mind cgi, but story was half-baked and you can blame studio or director swap, but to be fair movie just seemed that will fail from beginning.So for me question was...how studio? or directors could not see that this would not work?

I actually rather like Affleck's aging Batman. Momoa makes for an imposing action hero, though under utilized in this film. Miller does okay in this incarnation of the Flash, but I don't like Flash as a scared kid. Fisher is reasonably solid as Cyborg.For me the CGI didn't take over.Directing was spotty, but the pace was decent.Dialogue was spotty as well, but the actors had decent chemistry.Overall:Much better than most entries into the DCU, but not up to the high standard set by Wonder Woman.It's watchable...might suggest waiting til it hits Netflix or Amazon though.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An enjoyable watch for DC fans.,"First things first- never rely on critics' ratings before watching a superhero movie. Because, a superhero movie is not at all meant to be critically acclaimed, its about satisfying your fans who want to see their heroes on screen.
Now coming to the movie Justice League. Even though they couldn't pull of a 'The Avengers ' level movie, they managed to give the justice league franchise a decent start. The movie is well paced,you wont feel like its slow anywhere. Actually i felt they could have slowed the movie down a bit. They could have given a better build up to the introduction of their heroes one by one in the beginning,like marvel did in The Avengers. Someplaces CGI wasnt upto the mark. In some places it looked like a gameplay rather than a movie(it could actually work for some people). The dialogues were funny and witty sometimes. Not that strong a story, but they didnt let the audience feel bored at any point of time.
Overall its an entertaining 2 hours. They managed to give the justice league a good start, but they could have done better.

When was the last time you heard about a group of white terrorists going into an American building to blow it up? These are undisputed facts in the last 20-30 years.Note to Hollywood, if you inject your politics into a screenplay you will turn off around 50% of your audience, so it is no wonder this movie is not making the money it should.

"How a ""super heroes league"" movie should be made","To be honest, I should give a 8 instead of a 9 but this is for encouraging the film makers and actors in the movies. The reason why critics do not give a high rating for this movies is simply because they have been looking at it under the same old scope based on previous Marvel movies. This movie, to me, is how a super heroes league movie should be made.Now a few points:If you are expecting to have a fun time, you'll get it from JL.If you are expecting awesome characters with great acting skills, you'll get it. The movie gives a lot of time for new characters like Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg to develop.If you are expecting to see the coolest Aquaman in history, you definitely are gonna get it.If you are looking for great emotional interactions and attack combination between all super heroes and not just the main ones - the thing that Marvel has completely failed to do, you will get it in JL. After JL, you will have a very clear understand on how heroes feel about each others. For example, how Batman sees the Flash, how Wonder Woman sees Cyborg and many many more. All interactions are logical and not forceful in anyway.The actions are way way cooler than in avengers, all the movements of the characters are clear and the effects are tremendous. I watched Avengers in 3D and remembered that I cannot see all the action because it was too messy and fast. In justice league, they do know how to make use of the 3D glasses.Now, the only downside of this movie is the villains which is a little bit lame but to be honest, Loki is of the same level in terms of strength (not as a character in later marvel's movies, but as a villain in Avenger first movie). Another downside is just my personal taste, which is I don't like superman to be that strong in every movies, make him vulnerable a bit will you, Zach?In conclusion, JL is a great superhero movies and raise the bar in how you should develop multiple characters in a movie. It is not yet perfect but you will be satisfied with what the film is heading towards to. It opens a door for all the single hero movies in the future. The casts are great and way better than in Avengers. The spotlights of the movies are Ezra Miller and Jason Momoa where they steal the show multiple times. Wonder Woman and Batman appears less so that they can give the stage to the new characters, which is something Avengers failed to do. Finally, go see the movie and don't hesitate even one bit!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Where do I begin,"When this film came out a few years ago, many scenes felt rushed and cut either too quickly, both movie goers and fans alike had practically the same amount of mixed feelings.Joss Whedon should have stepped in to only finish Snyder's vision, not keep 25% of his vision and take a dump on it.WB didn't even have the decency to give Zack Snyder space to mourn the death of his daughter!! They just wanted the film to be done just in time to get their bonuses! If they would have given Snyder time to mourn and heal and not interfere with this film and where Snyder was going with it, they would have had a huge success on their hands.This is the film that proves that the current executives in WB does not know how to make great films, they just throw what ever they can and hope something sticks.Thank God we have HBO Max, at least Snyder vision of the Justice League is restored, now of only we can get the Ayer cut to Suicide Squad green lit explaining how that story leads to the Justice League.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Much better than expected, very enjoyable","I was never a fan of comic books, but I've enjoyed comic book *movies* based on their individual merits and I don't subscribe to that whole DC vs Marvel thing. Iron Man and The Dark Knight are two of my favorite movies from the genre and, well, after Batman v Superman's dreary, soulless debut, I went into this with low expectations. After seeing so many 10 out of 10 ratings on IMDb, I was highly skeptical, especially with a number of bad reviews, calling this film 'mediocre' etc. I need not have worried.It is excellent, and not just in comparison to its predecessor. I suspect superhero fatigue is the cause of some negative reviews, and frankly some reviewers complaints seem bizarre, like they missed some important dialog, or something. Avengers had an alien spacecube macguffin, and this has three, so yeah, the motives of the villain tend to be pretty simple in superhero movies, something I'd like to see addressed in future. Since so many villains tend to be underdeveloped, I can hardly fault this film for falling foul of the same problem (so I won't). Still better than Thor 2's villain!The villain, while being a rather generic 'destroy the world type', has well written lines at least. And I thought he was brought down in a clever way (with callbacks!) His main purpose is to bring the heroes together, and it's quite well done (yes I'm surprised).The character interactions are a highlight, not just with the primary cast but the supporting actors too. Victor Stone's tragic presence was palpable and I found his origin and capabilities fascinating, and hey, Aquaman isn't a joke anymore (though a bit heavy on the 'aquabro' stuff I think). Ben Affleck is probably my favorite version of Batman/Bruce Wayne, Gal Gadot brings her usual warmth and heart to the role, and the Flash had the right amount of levity to lighten the mood (though I can see some people finding his quips a bit too much)Some have called this movie disjointed and 'stitched together', though it's not nearly as bad as suggested, and flowed quite smoothly for the most part. Events are explained to just the right degree, without too much or too little exposition. The overall visuals have rather uninspiring cgi and seem a bit dated, and the palette is 'confused', probably the result of bringing in another director once Zack Snyder had to step away (condolences to his family). But again, when it was over I had a smile on my face and I will definitely catch it again soon.P.S. For the love of god, get Joss Whedon to edit BvS into something watchable, I'm sure there's a halfway decent movie in there somewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Disapointing...,"Kind of a let down for me. Dark. Slow. Pretentious. Boring. Little character development. The characters were barely likable in this. Flash was the tiny bit of comic relief. Brooding Batman and Cyborg were annoying. This film is also very similar in plot to Avengers: Infinity War (bad guy wants to destroy the world, so all the superheroes band together to fight him.) But, Avengers was much more entertaining and fun, with better characters, a better script and better paced. This doesn't even come close to the original Batman, Superman, Dark Knight movies. I loved Wonder Woman, enjoyed Suicide Squad, but not BvsS or this one. Disappointing In My Humble Opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Main Reason it didn't do well was because DVD quality print released illegally a day after movies Premiere all over Internet.,"I am sure most of you have seen the Korean subtitled DVD quality Pirated version with even the clips from the same print all over Youtube for many weeks now. Now usually when a big movie is released the pirated versions that are released online are bad quality usually recorded by camcorders etc. but this was illegally released clean quality which shouldn't have been out till February or March. So most people didn't have reason to go cinema when they could watch good quality print Online. How or who managed to do it is anybody's guess because it is something unheard of this is 1st time I saw a clean pirated print of a Blockbuster 2 days after its premiere released on internet.
 As for actual movie not really that bad it started beautifully, aftermath of Superman's death, his return and his whole presentation was awesome totally something to geek about probably my favorite part of movie. Aquaman was awesome maybe the best casting choice of all Characters, Jason Mamoa looked totally kickass, truly like Kingof Oceans should along with Amber Heard as beautiful Mera, would love to see their own movie. Flash and Cyborg did the Job nothing much to write home about but nothing negative either. Now Amazons and Wonderwoman , though all other Amazons looked awesome in cosmetic sense the way one would visualize I didn't understand why Hipolyta had a Russian accent. Gal Gadot has gained some weight to look more the part and she acted really well but here I do agree with most critics she was too skinny for the even the her exotic looks fits the role. 
 But still the worst part of the movie was Steppenwolf not the character itself but because it was made completely out using CGI, when they should have used only Partial CGI. Now it is understandable CGI is required to present an Imposing God Like being but they should have used partial CGI like Marvel did with Thanos because of which Steppenwolf ended up being worst part of the movie, it made the movie look cheesy and cheaply made. I sure hope they don't make same mistake with Darkseid in upcoming sequel.

Affleck is bored, boring and oh-so-chinless in that leather cowl, while Gadot grins and bears the close-ups of her butt in tight leather pants. Other female characters seem like dutiful afterthoughts. Whedon's punched-up dialogue yields a couple of amusing moments.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Like Superboy in DC's TV series, he is not a nice scout-boy, but a mentally weak super-jerk, angry psycho who doesn't hesitate sacrificing the whole world to make his sweet-hart smile (what a romantic guy isn't he?). That kind of logic is versatile in all DC movies, so I didn't have too much confident as well in this movie (Justice League 2017).And indeed my expectation sure prevails.

Not as bad as most suggest,"Justice League, like so many of the comic book superhero movies, is very average, but hardly has bad as many critics and fans suggest. DC Comics/Warner Brothers has been playing catch-up to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, although it has not been as nearly consistent in quality.
Bruce Wayne/Batman has been invigorated with hope since he witnessed Clark Kent/Superman sacrifice himself to stop Doomsday in Batman v. Superman. He is working with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman to build a team of heros to deal with the growing problem of powerful enemies. He recruits the elusive Arthur Curry/Aquaman, Barry Allen/Flash, and Cyborg. While the Flash (Ezra Miller) is on board quickly (no pun intended), Curry and Cyborg are a little reticent.
While this team is being assembled by Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the menacing Steppenwolf returns to the Earth to recover the four Mother Boxes left on the Earth. The Amazons have one, the Atlanteans have the other, while two others remain missing. As he moves in on them, the newly formed Justice League takes action. However, they lack a certain something to defeat the powerful being.
The only choice, they assume, is to resurrect Superman. It is obvious he comes back, but he is not right. Superman must remember who he is and what he represents. Kal-El/Clark/Superman retreats back to Smallville to rediscover who he is while the remaining Justice League take a gamble on defeating Steppenwolf.
First, the bad. The movie was a bit rushed, not giving enough exposition to set up the plot. The audience really has to pay attention to a quick-paced story. Another Achilles heal to the franchise is stealing ideas. In the early days of Marvel, they borrowed ideas from DC. As their cinematic universes expand, the opposite is happening. The World Boxes are the DC answer to the Infinity Stones of the MCU, and Steppenwolf is Loki, although a bit more sinister.
On the other hand, we have some good conflict, and decent characters. While Cyborg lacks imagination, Erza Miller gives Flash his usual smart-ass comments and humor laced with a little fear. Even better is Jason Momoa's interpretation of Arthur Curry/Aquaman that defies the culture of ridicule and jokes of his uselessness by being stronger and tougher. Henry Cavill, however, really shows a little more depth as he renews relationships with his mother (Diane Lane) and Lois (Amy Adams).
Do stick around for a couple of post-credit scenes, because one of them sets up for whatever the sequel will be. Sure, their writers could take some lessons from the MCU writers, but this DC outing is pretty decent.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If only, the studio was brave enough to adapt some of the better story lines from the comics, this film could have been so much more. Marvel is not known for their phenomenal plots, they focus on entertainment and its clear that Warner Bros is trying to jump on that bandwagon with Justice League.For the future we can hope that Warner Bros come to their senses and retain some originality by focusing on good story lines and character development.

"Not bright enough, not big enough - better than feared, worse than hoped","As a superhero fan since about 1984, and a big-time collector of superhero comics (although - full disclosure - admittedly a Marvel fan primarily), I consider myself to be in a position to judge just how successful this live action Justice League movie is. Had this come out some ten or fifteen years ago, it would have been a pretty awesome JL movie. It would have looked expensive and edgy, and most things about it would have felt fresh. Sadly, it has come out in 2017, as a too little, too late, too rushed and too cheap wanna-be movie, enormously ruined by its association with the absolutely horrible train-wreck that men call ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"". Horrified by the negative reactions to ""BvS"", JL producers (or suits, more likely) scrambled to change the planned story of this movie, basically cutting it up and throwing away the dark second half (you can check out the leaked original plot in Youtube videos), to replace it with an ill-fitting brighter second half, in which we get a much brighter and ""gooder"" Superman than we saw in ""BvS"", courtesy of Joss Whedon's frantic but disappointing attempt to save the movie via damage control. And, while I think that all the changes have probably been for the better considering what we would have gotten from the original Snyder vision, that doesn't stop this movie from feeling choppy and terribly structured, with a plot (and villain) that isn't very interesting and just amounts to a lot of time-wasting. Lots of action and explosions, but very little story or character development.What chiefly dissatisfies me is that the movie just isn't cosmic enough. Why didn't they pour on the whole Darkseid thing? They should have pulled out all the stops! They are in competition with bloody Marvel Studios, which race onward with one amazing movie after the other while DC is standing still and scratching its behind. They should have gone for bigger and brighter, and poured more money into it, hiring more competent talent, especially regarding the writing. But it's DC. They do stupid things by force of habit (sorry, but they do. Many many people think so).Well, at least this movie isn't a total loss. I expected the worst, but there were quite a few things in the movie I liked (and, of course, more things I disliked. Why didn't we see more of Mera?). I particularly liked Cyborg, with his alien tech that kept evolving and producing new super-tech powers for him. That was cool, especially since I felt that he would be one of the toughest characters to make work. Besides the lack of arcs and development, I didn't have problems with the other characters, but I'll emphasize that I really loved Wonder Woman. She was a total inspiration. She succeeded in giving you the feeling that she would absolutely have your back, and truly care about you all the while, whether you were an innocent bystander or a comrade in arms. She embodies all the admirable and feminine qualities of mother, sister, lover and protector, and that is a heck of an achievement. The movie is worth watching for her alone.I hear that some people really like this movie, as in giving it 8 or 9 stars out of 10. Good for them. For me it was a bit of a hollow experience; something with the potential to be so much more. I rate it 6 stars out of 10, which means slightly above average, compared with other movies of its type. No classic, but conceivably something I'll want to watch again sometime. It's a shame Whedon couldn't do more to save it. Ultimately, I think they should have just redone the whole movie from scratch rather than changing it into a sort of happy zombie version of the original version. Who knows, maybe some form of the original cut will make it onto an eventual disc release. I doubt it will be better, but it will certainly be interesting.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hopefully their solo movies will be better then this empty mess,"Greetings from Lithuania.As the one who really enjoyed ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" as well as ""Wonder Woman"" i found this movie pretty flat, unfortunately. Why do superhero movies these days have to have stuff like ""orbs"", ""cubs"" ""keys"" and similar devises of doomsday which are very stupid, childish and just lame. Boy oh boy how i miss movies like ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Batman Begins"", where on the center were characters, their actions and consequences - not fucxxx orbs, cubs, keys and similar toys!Overall, ""Justice League"" is the kinda movie which just splashes before your eyes and vanishes from your memory the second credits start rolling. There is nothing that will keep you from seeing it once. I think its about time they should very seriously consider to change Zack Snyder into someone with more fresh vision.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Parody on Zack Snyder's Justice league,"This is the parody movie made by Joss Whedon and Geoff Johns.Zack Snyder's vision was thrown out of the window. The runtime is shortened to 1 hr 50 minutes (without the credits). Darkseid, Martian Manhunter, Iris West and many other characters are absent. Many important scenes and plot points were deleted or reshot. Many out of place humor.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slightly not as bad as Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,"Hey, Justice League is better than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, if for no other reason than it's a full half-hour shorter. Those, my friends, are 30 extra minutes you get to spend doing something else, anything else, instead of watching another DC UNIVERSE snoozefest.With such star power as Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, and national treasure Amy Adams, no wonder they could not afford to pay Ciarán Hinds to actually appear in the movie as the big bad baddie, Steppenwolf. That's right, folks, it's your favorite and most popular DC villain ever, Steppenwolf in full CGI gloritude.What's that you say? You've never heard of Steppenwolf? Well, he's been hiding for thousands of years but can appear anywhere using a blue cylinder dealie thing and he has a legion of scary flying zombie things that are actually pretty easy to kill. Steppenwolf, however, is really strong, and he has a wicked-cool fiery axe up with which he chops stuff and he's sorta angry all the time and never really shuts up. Oh, and apparently the last time he tried to destroy Earth everyone got together and teamed up to defeat him so that seems like a really good idea again, but it's going to be really tough to get superheroes to band together because they all lead such complicated and interesting lives.Steppenwolf is really powerful, but he can become, like, really super-duper powerful if he can get three Mother Boxes (that's right, I said ""Mother Boxes"") together, much like Mola Ram hunting for three Sankara stones, or was it heavy water, red crystals, and meteor dust? Good thing we only have to find three of them, because finding six of them would take too long. Also of note is you can revive Superman with one of them, which is pretty cool, because he can probably punch Steppenwolf's head clean off all by himself.Nice also we have no real back story for any of the newbies. Yes, Flash is a goofy dork who gets to have the most fun, but pretty much everyone else, especially Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill, look like they've been sprayed with stupid dust and inhaled it for a few hours. Also, Cyborg is sort of like a nicer Lawnmower Man, I think. Gonna have to check the press guide on that one.Oh, no Jared Leto?! Perhaps too busy planning his next hairstyle.Oh, and hi to Jeremy Irons, J.K. Simmons, and Diane Lane! See you next time!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Justice League brings it home!!!,"Don't fret about Rotten Tomatoes grossly bad scoring system or believe the bad reviews from the critics that panned it.

It's fun, funny where it should be, has lots of great action & battle scenes, & gives us 3 great new additions to the league, The Flash, Aquaman, & Cyborg. Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, & Ray Fisher are fantastic as the newcomers to the team. I loved it, it's way better than Batman V Superman, & I can't wait to see it again tomorrow. I know I'll be seeing it multiple times at the theater as well as buying the Blu Ray when it's released. My biggest complaint is the Runtime is too short at 110 minutes, with 10 minutes of credits. I think the movie would be better had they left in about 15 to 20 minutes of obviously deleted scenes. It also has 2 excellent end credit scenes, the 2nd one is at the very end, so make sure & stay for that one.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A lighter tone of a new DCEU era,"I've watched Justice League last night as I could hardly wait to see my two best favorite heroes back in action.I was bit worry that the movie turned out to be disappointing due some reviews I read online. The critics were really mean. Man! They just could't help their selves but sliced and chopped the movie into pieces and left it dried out of its juicy parts.My suggestion for my fellow movie-goers, don't read the review unless you've seen the movie or they'll eat your positive energy with their mean and brutal reviews. It'll force you to see the movie as a comparable stuff.For me, the movie was good but not perfect, obviously. The tone was lighter than BvS, and that's a good sign. Not that I'm complaining with BvS movie tone but I believe some, if not most, movie-goers think that the tone was too dark.The cast were good and team were tried to get along each other in quite funny way. Although, there were some moments I felt the jokes were dry as I have seen them during the trailer. When Barry Allen ask Bruce Wayne what he's super power was, and Bruce replied, ""I'm rich."" It could've been funnier if I haven't seen it in the trailer.Of course as a critic, I would say that they could have done better with the story line and tied some loose ends, but the movie just doing fine if you watch them with an unprejudiced soul. You are watching a movie, not a score board. So, just enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just CGI characters fighting different CGI characters in a predictable succession of different scenes, the end.This movie is missing three quarters of what make a movie a movie and the last quarter is not without its own faults, as aforementioned.

Very decent DCEU film! - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com),"If I had to describe Justice League in one word, that one word would be 'awesome'. Somehow I don't think that one word will be enough for a full-length film review, but that was what I, and most of the audience, was thinking for the entire runtime. Justice League is tons of fun, with a light and laid back tone to it, unlike previous DCEU entries.The overall plot is a continuation of Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, following the events of the film. Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) wants to put together a team with the help of Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, in what will be and already is her iconic performance as Wonder Woman. They both target The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and, hopefully, Superman (Henry Cavill) to form the Justice League, and stop an evil force led by the fan favourite villain Steppenwolf, played eerily by Ciarán Hinds.After the poor reception of Batman V. Superman and Suicide Squad, DC were hoping for a beacon of light to appear, this was the excellent Wonder Woman directed by Patty Jenkins; for the second time, the DCEU have released another entertaining follow up that will restore the fans faith in Warner Bros. and the DC Extended Universe, and may finally create some competition between them and Marvel.The introduction of the iconic characters that make up the universe was short and sweet, but got the job done with a reasonably short runtime of just two hours. The action is non stop from beginning to end, with great humour and dialogue that put a smile on my face throughout. The comic relief is evidently The Flash, with embarrassingly nerdy lines that suit the character perfectly. The only main character that isn't explored satisfyingly enough is Cyborg. Little of his past is explained and your left feeling no more attached to him than when you first heard of him. The character is also quite dull and doesn't stand out when competing with others like Batman and Wonder Woman!
Considering there was direction from both Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon, the film's pace and tone stay consistent, and the story remains coherent and understandable.However the film suffers from a painfully weak villain that just feels like a throwaway character, and one that is very forgettable and is by no means chilling or spine tingling, unlike the comic version.
Regardless of the frustrating flaws that stand out, Justice League is everything you would want it to be with resonating heroes and their relatable issues. Non-stop entertainment and fun is exactly what a superhero film should be, and that is exactly what Justice League is.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Went in knowing reviews are mixed, still ended up liking it.","It's far from a bad movie. It's just that scenes doesn't flow nicely. You'll definitely notice when scenes just look incomplete, like it's missing a follow up or a backstory. Nothing to love about the soundtrack. Steppenwolf is okay. Generic villain, but I enjoyed seeing him kicking ass on screen. It's just that..you wish he'd bring more pain, u know what i mean?CGI, nothing worth criticizing or applauding. It's OK. If you TRY to find weird, out-of-place CGI, you'll find it. But if you just attune your mind to enjoying the movie, you won't notice anything weird.The league themselves are great. Flash's jokes are a hit and miss, but it fits his character. Didn't thought I'd say this, but I loved cyborg. Ray Fischer did a great job. I was worried that aquaman would be the one-liner guy, but he's great as well. Gordon, Alfred, WW, Batman, Flash's dad, all great as usual. Last but not least, superman. BADASS.Since BVS and WW is the benchmark for DC movies nowadays, i'll just say this. I hated BVS. It made me physically mad. Although JL is not as good as WW, but I had more fun with JL.Summary : Enjoyed it a lot. Has its flaws, but definitely worth the wait. I might get crucified for this but..........i liked it more than avengers *runs away",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The train wreck we needed, but not the one we deserved","I came into this movie with high hopes, at least assuming it couldn't be any worse that Batman V Superman. Unfortunately, it was just terrible.The dialogue is frequently very cheesie. The villain is so boring. Part of a characters face is CGI'd and looks horrendous. Characters freely shout out secret identities in front of civilians. Portals ""conveniently"" open up at perfect times, and in perfect locations. There is a random family that is shown every so often, and we are supposed to care about their well-being. Yet the movie does nothing to make us feel attached to, or even learn anything whatsoever about these people. So when they are in danger, it's not even of concern to the audience. And then the one thing that really bothered me the most...The final battle does not have a single drop of water in it!! AQUAMAN IS A MAIN PART OF FILM! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? I'm not saying the entire battle should've taken place on or near water. But at the very least, the director should've found a way to use water since it is what a MAIN CHARACTER can control. That was pathetic.There are many more things I could bring out, but I wanted this review to not contain spoilers so that hopefully people that read it won't waste their money on watching the movie.There are 4 funny lines in the movie I enjoyed, and 1 really cool action scene near the beginning with the Amazon's. But those things were not enough for me to give this movie even a 2nd star.Don't waste your money watching this in theaters. Wait until you can watch it at home on the comfort of your couch. Invite some friends over so that you can laugh at how terrible it is together.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you're an avid DC Comics reader, such as myself, you will notice a lot of really cool Easter eggs in this film and whatever you do, do NOT leave until ALL of the credits are done; 2 of the best post credit scenes I've seen in a comic book movie.

An honest review,"I'm gonna be honest, Jusitce League was a okay movie, not as bad as people say it is, but the reason it got so much criticism is because it is a Justice League movie and should be amazing.

"Worth the price, but not worth the wait","As a DC fan, I've waited the Justice League to be put on big screen for a long, long time. When Man of Steel came out, I could see a positive future for the DCEU. While slightly flawed, at least it had some truly impressive visuals, backed up by a decent story. I was pretty satisfied. Even after the messy Batman v Superman, I still had faith in the DCEU, for it had the ambition to make something outstanding, though being not really successful. While the terrible Suicide Squad disappointed me, the major hit Wonder Woman, which was pretty much successful in every way, refueled my passion for the DCEU.And then we have Justice League. While it is entertaining, it has just so many problems that make it impossible for me to enjoy.1. The re-shoots. As many people mentioned, one can easily tell whether a scene is made by Snyder or Whedon.2. The editing. Too many close-up shots being shown continuously (a very common problem that already happened to many blockbusters, such as Warcraft). Everything happens way too quickly, which means ZERO character development. Therefore it is almost impossible to actually care for the characters if you don't like them already.3. The visuals. I am hardly a big fan of Zack Snyder, but I find it very enjoyable to watch his unique shots that somewhat capture the feeling of the comics. In Justice League, there is merely any interesting shots; most of the shots are no better than any ordinary blockbusters.4. The story. The script is SO generic - much more so than Man of Steel and BvS. Everything is expected. There is NO sense of danger, and we simply cannot fear the villain at all. Also, though everyone knows that Superman will return, it is supposed to be very powerful moment. Instead, they managed to somehow make his return in a way that is not thrilling at all.5. The humor. I don't mind DCEU to be something more light-hearted, but if you want to have humor, at least do it right. The fact is that probably not more than 1 out of 3 jokes in this movie is actually laughable. Other jokes are either stupid, or simply not funny.Above all, Justice League is a watchable blockbuster that provide just enough fun to make your 2 hours worthwhile. Don't expect more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Excellent and intelligent story.,"I assume the problem with superhero stories and hence the low average score for this film is that people go in, leaving their brain at the door, wanting simple stories and the goodies winning at the end. I found that the JL film pretty exciting in the fight scenes, but also the plot and overall storyline made sense. It was darker in tone than some similar films but this added to the overall feel. I would highly recommend the film to those who want more than just something to stare at whilst they gobble down popcorn.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Predictably poor. Absolute trash. Fanboys will love it no matter what but everyone else steer clear,"A failure of epic proportions. After Batman and Robins abysmal critical and financial failure in 1997, no one ever thought Batman would ever be seen as cool again. Batman seemed to forever be ruined after a series of bad sequels in the 90s (Batman Forever and Batman & Robin especially). Luckily in 2005, Christopher Nolan gave us the best Batman to date by far with Christian Bale donning the big bad cape. Following the success of that reboot, we not only got the most inspired and brilliant trilogy of Batman movies, but one the the best trilogy of movies period. Grossing billions at the box office, getting IMMENSE critical praise, and landing on every serious movie fans (and comic book fans) all time favorites list. It seemed thanks to Nolan, Bale, and co., Batman could do no wrong.. Only a few years later movie studio WB got stupid and presumably listened to the wrong fan base (you tubers who account to a small handful of low IQ losers) who hated the success and wanted a more cartoony, goofy, generic Batman and dc films. Instead of smartly observing the colossal success of the dark knight trilogy and following the template that proved successful path for their other DC properties, they went with the 2 or 3 guys on you tube who bitched and moaned and pushed for goofy, mindless fodder. Also I assume WB wanted to rush to mimic Marvels success with Avengers ( afar superior film to Justice League). Here we are with the final product. Surprise Surprise. After the failures of Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, and Suicide Squad ( all had great potential that was squandered), who really expected JL to be anything but the same old trash we've been getting? Well if anything, there has been consistency. In this DCEU, the films get progressively worse than the last. Man of Steel was weak, BvS was terrible, Suicide Squad was abysmal, and JL is...the worst one of all. Bravo. If mindless action set piece after mindless action set piece with terrible cw level CGI, generic standard, take over the world plot by CGI villain with a cast of completely undeveloped plot, corny jokes, and boredom is your thing, well then check it out and enjoy. Everyone else who wants quality filmmaking, a good story, stand out action and spectacle, steer clear of this mess. Its a shame for those who waited so long for a live JL movie. Fanboys will be in denial and convince themselves this movies isn't that bad but it is. Ben Affleck also joins Clooney as the two worst portrayals of Batman.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A messy and incoherent strain peppered with wonderful golden moments.,"""Justice League"" is the latest addition to the DCEU and marks a cinematic landmark as the first time we've seen particular DC characters like Aquaman, Cyborg, and Flash. The film picks up where ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" left off. With the death of Superman, the world continues to mourn while Batman and Wonder Woman assemble the Justice League to defend the world against Steppenwolf; an alien villain set on destroying the world.""Justice League"" had enormous pressure riding on its shoulders as a follow up to this year's ""Wonder Woman"" and its behind the scenes problems with director Zack Snyder stepping down earlier on in the film's post production phase. Faced with multiple reshoots and a new approach by Joss Whedon, ""Justice League"" feels wildly inconsistent and unfocused in both plot and central theme. The first half of the film feels so jarring and all over the place no scene seems to mean anything to it's accompanying scene. The story attempts to balance several elements from the DC comics lore that it manages to make it feel more meaningless than satisfying for a true fan. This is obviously disappointing since I thought most DCEU films so far have done that quite well.Since the first half and the second half of the film feel so disjointed and uncomplimentary, the pacing feels down right painful. This bogs the story down almost as much as the villain Steppenwolf who not only feels cliché, he's actually blatantly bad. Many are complaining about the CGI being subpar for the villain. I would argue the actual character design and construct are so generic and video game-esque, that it's not really fun watching him on screen.Complaints aside, ""Justice League"" has some fine, memorable moments and qualities. First, the portrayals of all members of the league and their characterization was very satisfying. Ezra Miller stole the show as The Flash and Jason Mamoa as Aquaman was compelling to watch the entire time. Both Ben Affleck and Henry Cavil give quite different representations of the DC comic's heavyweights which I still have mixed feels about. Despite hesitations however, every character worked well with each other and it was truly entertaining to see every scene they were in.Recently, a large glaring issue with these genre films many have had is its tone. Recently, many audiences have preferred more lighthearted, fun, and humorous approach to the superhero/action genre. Films that make fun of the dramatic and cheesy nature that correlates with the genre stories. Sacrificing genuine emotional drama for a jokey one-liner, modern day superhero films have lowered their stakes, minimized the impact of their villains, and filled the screen with more clever one-liners than ever before. In the case for ""Justice League"" the movie falls right into that trap by fitting the mold and not standing out. Regarding Warner Bros and DC comics films, I enjoy and appreciate a film that tries to be more. With big characters come heavy ideas rooted in mythology and ancient storytelling. Perhaps the biggest complaint about ""Justice League"" is its resolve to appeal to mass audiences with more jokes and low stakes; even if it means it being forgotten in a few months. Say what you will about previous DCEU films but at least people still remember them.At the end of the day, ""Justice League"" is a good time. I would eventually recommend going to see it. It beats other comic book films this year but doesn't come close to touching some of the best. It's fun, riveting to watch for the characters, and definitely peaks my interest for the future of the DCEU. It would really be best to see this one on your own and form your own opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Enjoyable watch,"It's hard to understand the 1,2, 3 ratings. I guess some people are in a binary state of mind when it comes to reviewing and it's either love or hate. I mean, some flaws in a movie, book, tv-show, or people for that matter don't make them a 100% bad. 
I'm not a purist, certainly when it comes to fantasy, mythology, superheroes, or anything that comes from our imagination. I actually like the playing around with it, exploring different universes of thought. And of course that always goes hand in hand with some mistakes. It's the price of admission for any creative process.
I think this movie is a solid good action flick. The character development is either non existent or very straightforward, the story is much less confusing and complex than Batman V Superman. There's a lot of smiles, and I even found myself laughing out loud at some moments (Flash). Superman and Batman are far less intense which is nice. I liked the screen time everyone got. There's plenty of action. I liked the visual effects.The end credit scenes included a funny scene as well as a pointer to a possible next movie.

A better one than its predecessors,"For those who loathe Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and they are legion, Justice League will be just the corrective followup they're looking for. The scenes of the League members together, bickering and bonding, spike the film with humor and genuine feeling, creating a rooting interest in the audience. Without it, the film would crumble. The addition of Ezra Miller as 'The Flash' was a great thing as he was maintaining the balance between action & some comic sequences. The CGI was good with enough good sound editing. Although it felt that at the second half the movie started faltering due to excessive use of CGI and for over use of fighting sequences. I admit that it was way better than Batman v Superman & Suicide Squad and was a decent watch..My Rating : 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Big Fun Popcorn Blockbuster That Is So Much Fun. Affleck is great as Batman.,"From the AWESOME opening to the final battle i was hooked!!! It was great comic book blockbuster fun. Don't understand all the silly hate but i do get DC changed their tone & made this more fun with a little bit of humour & it worked absolutely fine in my opinion, The whole BRILLIANT cast really was PERFECT!!! Each excellent character had their time to shine & all had great chemistry together, Also the music score was Awesome. Steppenwolf was yes all c.g.i but looked & sounded excellent!!! The voice was great & perfectly fit the ancient character. All the action was great fun & the sewer scene with Batman's Awesome Nightcrawler vehicle was FANTASTIC!!! There's lots of great gems all through the movie, from great scenes to great character bits there's so many great parts, The Parademons look great, Lots more good things in this movie than bad things? So if you like it, just like it & forget all the hate!!! I totally enjoyed this as a big budget fun fantasy adventure & that's exactly what it was. ""The Flash"" kinda stole the show as the funny younger hero & his own flash theme is beautiful. Totally Awesome fun & very underrated. Also BEN AFFLECK is still the absolute BEST batman & bruce Wayne we have EVER HAD!!! I loved all the scenes with Affleck as Bruce/Batman, he's perfect in the role.The Flash pretty much steals the show, he's Awesome.""Aquaman"" is excellent & ""Wonder women"" is again fantastic & really holds the group together as the big heart of this rag tag team, the only character that didn't really get alot of depth was ""Cyborg"" as i did hear he was supposed to be the main arc or heart of the movie but had lots of scenes cut so that impacted his character part.""Superman"" becomes the ""Real"" superman in this movie, he become the comic book style icon.The cast is excellent!!!Steppenwolf is one of the greatest movie villains I've seen in along time especially in big fantasy comic book.Justice league is just a big budget action-packed,funny fantasy adventure!!! Would've loved it if this came out in the 90's & i saw it as a kid,
Justice league rivals Marvels Avengers & i love the Avengers films so much & Justice league is up there with those.It's Amazing seeing the Justice League on the big screen it was magical.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
7 outta 10's not bad!,"I read some reviews of this movie prior to seeing it. Many reviewers ripped it for sub-par CGI (computer graphics). Some focused on the overall story being thin. Others commented that they felt it was disjointed, plodding, and uninspired. After seeing the movie I can say... those critics are correct, but I still liked this movie overall. Some of the Justice League cast gave rock solid, bordering on inspired performances! Ezra Miller, who plays the Flash is not good, he's great! He's quirky and geeky, vulnerable, and funny. Jason Momoa is also pretty good as Aquaman. I'm not thrilled with the scripts personification of him as a kinda muscle head, surfer dude, God of water, whatever, but what the guy is given to work with, he does a good job of pulling it off. Gal Gadot is great (as usual), but her star power diminishes a lot when she becomes just one of the gang. The Cyborg character is a throw-a-way. Maybe he needs more of his back story to be revealed to flesh him out (no pun intended), but I just wasn't feeling him. As for Batfleck... Somewhere Christian Bale is crying in his old bat cape. Ben...hang up the cowl son. You're too old, and nearly talented enough to pull off Batman. The movie did reach a point for me, where I wondered if it would be redeemable at all, and then something happened. Almost like when Kirk Gibson limped to the plate on two bad legs in the 1988 World Series, and hit one of the greatest WS home runs in history, Justice League found it's heart! I still have issues with some of the story. For instance, there are inconsistencies with the previous film (don't want to divulge and ruin the movie for ya), but I can let those things go. I left the theater with mostly positive feelings about this one, flaws and all.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yup. Screw the critics,"I liked and enjoyed it.
It must have been a phase I went through: we all have small secret shames. One of mine is that as a 30-something, I got into the Justice League and JLU animated series. I still think there are great individual episodes in those series, as well as some great story arcs. So I was actually excited, when there were distant rumours of a JL movie. That excitement was worn down and all but forgotten by the negative response to the films that built up to this. They weren't necessarily great, but their biggest failing was that they fell into the shadow of the Marvel machine; the movies were less epic, less all-encompassing, and the PR couldn't compete. 
So instead of hunting out a seat in the first weekend or even the first week, I undertook watching this as a (slightly hopeful) chore, but I was so relieved.
The film had a lightness I can't necessarily explain; it felt familiar and authentic. It had qualities of superhero stories that felt like reading the comics and watching the cartoons, almost as if maybe it cared for the audience. Crazy huh. For whatever the glitz and drama of the Marvel movies, they are perhaps more than a little self-involved.
The cast did a great job. Aquaman was introduced really well and Jason Momoa was cast really well. Ben Affleck's Batman isn't the same one as all the others. I thought he was more real, more believable, just better all round. A much-needed change. Lego Batman he is not. Wonder Woman and the Flash brought all that those characters are supposed to bring and did it v.well.
All those years ago when there were rumours of a JL film, I would've expected it to have been epic. Now, I was relieved it wasn't. It was just very good. (Yay, Justice League!)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
