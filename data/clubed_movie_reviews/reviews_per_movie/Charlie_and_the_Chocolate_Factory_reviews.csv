The Fabulous Return of Willy Wonka,"Yesterday I had the pleasure of watching ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"" at the Wilkinson American Movie Day. And, oh boy, I was in delight! Don't expect a bleak remake of the amusing (and rather psychedelic) 1971-version. It is in every way a genuine Tim Burton-movie, stacked with beautiful imagery, wacky humor and bizarre characters, but at the same time faithful enough to the spirit of the novel. Roald Dahl would've been proud. It also features outstanding performances by the entire cast. Johnny Depp gives us a strange, almost creepy Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore is a perfect Charlie, the Grandparents are lovable and wacky, and the five other children and their parents are amusingly irritating. And last but not least, an excellent soundtrack by Mr. Danny Elfman, reminiscent of both Edward Scissorhands and his early Oingo Boingo-days. Go see this with your parents, children, grandparents, movie buff-friends, nephews and nieces ... they will be equally delighted!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Little girl? Don't touch that squirrel's nuts! It'll make him crazy!,"I never cease to be amazed by the versatility of Johnny Depp. Whether he is a pirate or writing Peter Pan or an adventurer or a criminal, he never fails to entertain. There is nothing he hasn't done in his 45 films, or will not have done in the five films currently in production or the 15 films in pre-production. Even as the creepy Willy Wonka (Think Michael Jackson for comparison.), he was magnificent. Maybe we have to blame his father (Christopher Lee) for some of that creepiness. After all, depriving your child of Halloween candy is just mean.But, the real star of this film was Charlie (Freddie Highmore), who was the only sane child that arrived at the factory. He was surrounded by four of the most obnoxious children (and their obnoxious parents) that I have ever seen. They got what they deserved.The color, imagination, costumes, and sets were magnificent. It was such a pleasure to watch.Depp comes through again. I am not surprised.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Burton Studied the Book's Original Illustrations,"If Tim Burton's out there I just want to thank him for bringing the spirit of the book's original illustrations to the screen. He even matched the facial expressions to the drawings, especially in the case of Charlie's family. Charlie himself looks like one of the drawings, and the Bucket house is so much like the illustrations it caused me to realize that Burton is as visual as any movie director can be. (Recent editions feature the work of a different illustrator. I'm talking about the illustrations from the 1960s. The difference between the older illustrations and the newer ones is the older ones feature a lot of cross-hatching. I imagine the older illustrations are still available, especially in a hardcover, but you'll need to search the net.) I don't know how he did it, but he got the facial expressions of Charlie's family and of Mike Teavea's father down perfectly. He also absorbed Dahl's sense of humor. The opening fifteen minutes or so, in which the winners of the golden tickets are announced one by one, really get Roald Dahl's sense of the ridiculous. I think Burton's addition of Wonka's childhood story fits well, although I'll agree that the way this is resolved is not completely in Dahl's spirit. Even in the resolution, however, Burton maintains sly humor. It is well-acted by everybody. I'd like to say that Julia Winter, who plays Veruca Salt, has turned in a truly well-observed comedic performance. Depp converts the novel's jaunty, precise Wonka into a quirky one, but it works well, because, as in the novel, Wonka's endearing traits contrast with the fact that he's a tyrant. Roald Dahl gets a rap for his cynicism, and this movie softens his message a bit. Dahl is a bit like Orwell. Both of them point out that man, given power, will exploit his fellow human beings. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY the movie is not quite as dark as the book. But it comes very, very close.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nothing could be sweeter...,"Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original ""Willy Wonka"" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Childhood Memories,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Based on Roald Dahl's book, Directed by Tim Burton and written by John August. A young boy wins a tour through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world, led by the world's most unusual candy maker. This movie has a special place in my heart because when I was little this movie was shown in every school vacation. I haven't read or saw the original book or movie. So there will be no comparison between source materials. I'm not sure the character Willy Wonka is the same in the source materials because I heard bad reviews about this version of Willy Wonka. We know every time Tim Burton doing a movie with Johnny Depp he creates his character kinda weird. Once again I'm not familiar with books or the original movie so I am going to tell how I feel about this version of Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp has done a marvelous job in this movie I loved how he acts around children and parents we know he has childhood problems so he is not comfortable with especially with invited children's parents. Freddie Highmore is ok but other child actors are better than him. Charlie Bucket's character is so flat to me. He is not doing anything at all after he entered the factory so not enough character development for his character. The visuals are magnificent the factory is a dreamland. When I first saw the scene of the chocolate river and land it's WoW. The Color combination in the factory is gorgeous. In the factory, the movie mainly focused on punishing children other than that nothing. I liked to see more details about the factory and the process of the factory. Now we are going to get a prequel movie about Willy Wonka and planning to watch the first film also. Finally, I need to say I had a good time with this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An interesting remake that actually does stand alone,"I should hate this, being such a fan of the original, but to be honest I really like it. The story has been realised in a lot more of an appropriate way for the modern world. Tim Burton has yet again done a tremendous job of bringing this fantasy world to life. It's eccentric, wonderfully mad, funny and just lovable. It does a better job of bringing the original material to the screen than the original, the only problem I have is with Johnny Depp. I don't have I problem with his acting, I think it's great, I just feel he's been directed to play the role too weirdly. The ""tragic madness"" of his character doesn't sit too well with me, and I don't think all of the back-story was necessary. Aside from that it is a great film that does stand up to the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Legendary to any kid from the 2000's,"Every bit of it hits you with amazing childhood memories.

A mixed bag,"In a lot of ways, this is way better than the 1971 version and in a lot of other ways, this is way worse. It seems that this is supposed to be closer to the original story but those seem to be a few things and the biggest differences are completely new ideas written for this movie. The film is so, so great with Burton's storytelling finesse up until they enter the Chocolate Factory. The grandpa's connection to the factory was great. Depp's Wonka is a whole different character than Wilder's but just the change wasn't the problem. Wilder made that whole movie great while Depp just like his character made the movie awkward. It was just awkward and not funny to see him trying to be too weird and awkward all the time. Willy Wonka is not particularly likeable with most of his actions, so Wilder's version was a charming guy who ultimately does the right thing, so it worked. Here, not only he's weird and unlikeable throughout the movie, but even at the point where the previous movie ended, he doesn't do the right thing. Now, the backstory given to him just didn't feel right until the end when it is used for further change in character. Even though that part was nice, it didn't feel rightly placed. Burton doubling down on the problematic aspects doesn't help too much either. The Oompa Loompas were a bit too much and all those songs were annoying as hell. However, it also had incredible visuals throughout the movie using both practical effects and CGI, the film looks beautiful in a unique way only Burton can do.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Burton does it again !,"I have seen Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion, the journey M. Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it ""reality"" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with ""real"" sets, ""real"" Oompas Loompas, ""real"" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film.After that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many  the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those ""weird"" (a word he likes  you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.What can I tell you more ? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.As for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the ""family"" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the ""Edward Scissorhands"" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.Thank you, M.Burton. Thank you very much",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Rather disappointing effort from Tim Burton...,"I know that the 1971 musical was unfaithful to the book, but I did much prefer that version to this well-intentioned but somewhat disappointing effort from Tim Burton, the director of Batman and Edward Scissorhands, and this adaptation was in some way more unfaithful in spirit than the 1971 film. The film does have some lovely sets and inventive visuals, the boat scene is fun if not as much as in the Wilder version, a great job is done with the Veruca Salt/squirrel scene and I liked the performances of Helena Bonham Carter, David Kelly and Freddie Highmore. But I was disappointed with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. He just lacked the charm and grace Gene Wilder brought to the character, and I don't think Roald Dahl intended a characterisation that was more Michael Jackson than Willy Wonka. Some of the cast overact, especially the girl who plays Veruca Salt, even for the character the spiteful spoilt brat act was way overdone. I liked the music score by Danny Elfman which is filled with whimsy and appealing oddballness(I much prefer his Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas scores however), but the Oompa Loompa songs were rather annoying with none of the noisy melodies memorable and were shot like a music video. Tim Burton evidently tried to make the story darker, and in some respects to the book, it didn't quite work. A good example was the case of the additional character of Dr Wonka, as much as I like Christopher Lee, and he did perform well, but his character was unnecessary, and the script with some over-explanatory narration lacked the sparkle of the 1971 film consequently. The grandparents did bring some comedy, and the movie does start off well. But the unfaithfulness of the last half, meant that the whole film felt rushed and lacking in charm and magic which the Wilder had aplenty. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I can't shake longings for Wilder and tangerine faces...,"Director Tim Burton has come a long way since his first job as an animator for Disney in the early 1980's. He made several animated shorts, none of which were deemed suitable for children - an early indication of Burton's dark outlook. However, his hard work and talent did not go unnoticed. His subsequent directorial work on Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) cemented his role as an experimental and visionary director/producer. Nobody else, therefore, was surely more suitable to adapt Dahl's much-loved novel, and nobody else was surely daring enough to attempt a re-make of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971, directed by Mel Stuart), that enduring classic starring Gene Wilder as Wonka.Burton's repeated use of Depp in previous films (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Sleepy Hollow to name just three) indicated him to be an obvious and, it could be argued, perfect choice to cast as Wonka. Depp is by far the best thing about this film. His character's whole persona - the costume and body language, the tone of his voice, his pithy lines delivered in a contemptuous and yet charming manner, are all presented in such a way to add up to a well deserved challenge to Wilder's crown. But does he steal it? I'd say he doesn't. For someone that grew up with Roald Dahl's novels and film adaptations, Wilder IS Wonka. Trying to ignore my obvious bias, I believe Depp does put up a good fight, and perhaps if the parents of the four terrible children had shown more spark, or been actors of a higher calibre, his comic moments would have had much more impact.Burton's other muse, Helena Bonham Carter, is mis-cast as Charlie's mother. Her lines are delivered distractedly and with the air of someone very aware of her status in the film industry. Thankfully her role is quite minor and doesn't impact negatively upon the film. Freddie Highmore is fairly insipid, yet not offensive in his role of Charlie. The same description can be applied to David Kelley, who plays his Grandpa Joe. With the exception of Augustus Gloop, whose role is comparatively minor, the four ticket-winning children do not live up to expectations or standards set in the '71 Mel Stuart version. They simply serve to mildly irritate and disappoint, particularly Veruca and Violet. But I doubt anyone could match Julie Dawn Cole, the original Veruca.A certain amount of furore has surrounded Deep Roy, the 4ft 4"" tall actor who plays every single one of Wonka's all-singing, all-dancing Oompa Loompas. He also plays Wonka's therapist and, in a tongue-in-cheek moment, appears briefly on the closing sequence where he is revealed to be the narrator. The effects used to re-produce Roy as every single Oompa-Loompa I believe detract from the film. When viewing scenes, surely it's preferable to be absorbed and involved than to be distracted by special effects and wondering 'how/why did they do that?' Additionally, Roy's scenes are the only ones to feature music - there is no Wonka or Grandpa Joe breaking into song and dance in this adaptation. All we get here are the Oompa-Loompa's didactic lyrics, which unfortunately are drowned out by below-par sound editing.In an unprecedented move, Burton and screenwriter James August have given Wonka a history. Christopher Lee, who is sadly under-used in this film, plays his father, and we get to find out exactly why Wonka is such an enigma. I won't reveal the outcome, short of saying it's pretty unsatisfying and takes away Wonka's mystery - the very thing that makes him appealing. Claims have been made that this adaptation follows Dahl's novel much more closely than the 1971 version, of which it does - everything is followed almost to the letter. Unfortunately, the Wonka/father storyline clearly undermines any attempt the film has made to stay true to Dahl's novel - should Dahl had wished there to be a father figure, he would have included that in his book. However, certain artistic license is always taken when adapting books and plays to the big screen, and this creativity is needed to keep images and story lines fresh and to prevent any static grounding.As regards the imagery of the film, well, it's a Burton film and true to form we aren't disappointed. Typically, we enter and leave the film during gentle snow-fall. The poor Buckets' house leans pitifully to one side and almost makes you shiver when Charlie climbs into bed underneath a gaping whole in the roof. Colour is suitably hued down apart from certain scenes in the factory where the vibrant colours bring the songs and sets to life - the Chocolate Room and the Boat Ride come alive, and the Television Room almost blinds. The only fault I could find, and it is minor, is that at certain points of the Chocolate Room scene, the chocolate river where Augustus Gloop meets his untimely suction looks more like brown water than creamy chocolate. Apart from the afore-mentioned poor sound editing of the featured songs, audio here is of a top standard. Sound effects are clear, no dialogue is gone unheard and the musical score is in keeping with the tone of the film.Verdict - It's easy to be over-picky when comparing a film not only to a novel, but also to an earlier, much loved and highly-established film adaptation. However, faults notwithstanding, this is watchable fare that should appeal to all ages. Is it a classic? No.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Should Have Been Better,"The wonderfully whimsical Tim Burton was the perfect choice to bring a contemporary twist to the familiar tale of Willy Wonka. Unfortunately, it never really works as well as it should. Perhaps it's because we already know the story, or because Burton just doesn't translate as well when he's trying to be cute rather than weird. In particular, the musical numbers from the Oompa-Loompas, the strange little people who work in the chocolate factory, seem so out of place. Still, there is a lot that clicks, from the colorful scenery and characters to the apt performances from the child actors and Johnny Depp, who was well cast as the eccentric candy man. Children are bound to love it, but those expecting vintage Burton or a tongue-in-cheek nod to the original 1971 version will be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

As Good As I Hoped It Would Be,"I was pleased to have this ""Willy Wonka"" re-make meet my expectations. Those expectations were high, at least in the visuals department. I expected a wild, colorful ride with brilliant hues and good special effects...and I was not disappointed.It was inventively fun with those great visuals and another wonderful kid playing ""Charlie."" I doubted they could ever come up with another child as appealing and nice/wholesome as one in ""Willy Wonka"" but they found one in Freddie Highmore. He filled the bill magnificently, as did the ""brat"" kids.A different feature of this version, as opposed to the 1970 original, was that here the Oompa-Loompas were all played by just one person, a very small Indian man named Deep Roy. One of the interesting ""features"" on the DVD details how difficult that was to do and how much time Roy had to put in to do all the things he did.Johnny Depp, meanwhile, ""did"" what he always does - do a good job of playing a weird person. I get the feeling he relates easily to strange characters. He seems to play enough of them. This was the only part of the movie, frankly, where I preferred the 1970 version: the role of Willy Wonka. Yes, Depp was interesting as always but a little too weird, too Michael Jackson-like, for my tastes. I'll take Gene Wilder's take on the character.Otherwise, this re-make has it all over the original, simply because it has 35 years of technology and computer work that the original wasn't able to have. It made this re-make a real ""hoot"" to watch. Since entertainment is what the business is called, and this movie is extremely entertaining, then I have no complaints.

"A really funny film, a great adaption of Roald Dahl's classic book","This film was released when I was 8 and I remember being really excited to see it at the cinema. The film didn't disappoint and after I got the DVD, I couldn't stop watching it. Fast forward almost 10 years after it's release, it is still one of my favourite films. The plot revolves around Charlie Bucket, a poor boy who has luckily won a ticket to visit Willy Wonka's factory along with four other children and the chaos that happens during the tour. I have seen many of Tim Burton's films so I knew this wasn't going to be a subtle adaptation and of course Johnny Depp would be in it. So if you've never liked any of Burton's films or aren't a fan of Depp, then I can guarantee you will not like this film. Burton and Depp fans though will most likely love this film. I think Depp is great as the main character, Willy Wonka, who is a chocolate tier and has recently reopened his factory to 5 lucky winners after closing it when workers stole his recipes and sold them. Is Depp better than Gene Wilder's Wonka? I'm not going to compare the two as they're both very different and great films, which happen to be an adaptation of the same book. But Depp does bring a lot of energy and comedy to the character, which I love. Freddie Highmore brings a really good performance as Charlie despite being only 12/13 at the time of filming but then again if you watch his other performances, especially Finding Neverland which he was in with Depp, you can see why Burton chose him for his character. I love the humour in this film, I don't think I've ever laughed so much at a film. The music in this film, created by the talented Danny Elfman, is brilliant and so catchy and make me love the film even more. All in all, a fantastic film. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fans of the original film and book avoid at all costs,"Spoilers below:I bought the DVD today as my family and I all love the original film and book. I was hopeful when I saw that it was meant to be truer to the book, but frankly this is not accurate. The book was quirky and fun, this film is dark and dull and even the storyline varies from the original source.One of the worst parts, is the normally excellent Johnny Depp. He was truly terrible in this role and came across as a retarded, antisocial creep. The children's personalities are not explored well and the parent's even less. They hardly show any emotion when the various children fall foul of their own actions. The music is dire and the vocals are unintelligible.Tim Burton introduced a totally unnecessary back-story that attempted to explain the weird personality of Willy Wonka. It seems having a dentist for a dad, who doesn't allow you to eat sweets, turns you into a Peter Pan/ Michael Jackson undead sweet factory owner.The only redeeming feature of this film are the sets. However, with 35 years of CGI advancements, they are not as good as I expected and are not much better than in the first film.Overall, if you are a fan of the original, do NOT watch this film as it will only disappoint. Only a die hard Tim Burton fan would think this is better than the original and Gene Wilder is infinitely better than Johnny Depp who despite his considerable talent, cannot save this garbage.",,Anonymous,Comedy

The dance sequences were atrocious, and the entire movie was slow.The sets were beautiful, really well done. That was the standout in the movie - the sets. The cast was well chosen, but they all looked really stiff. Nobody seemed to react like they should. The kids were spectacular, I have to say they out did the adults for sure.It was OK.

"A wonderful ""trip""","So I have read an awful lot of negative comments about the new ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". I myself have actually had the amazing chance to see a sneak preview of this movie in a contest and would like to put MY two cents worth in.This is most definitely not a movie for young children with its hidden jokes and bizarre jumping about. A magical menagerie of color and wit with some very dark and eerie elements, this is a refreshing change from the very happy go lucky type movie that made up the original. While no one will ever be able to replace the truly amazing Gene Wilder as quirky chocolatier Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp adds new life and oddity to the character. The character of Charlie was wonderfully cast, using young Freddie Highmore to play him. The necessary chemistry required to make a movie actually work was extremely noticeable between Depp and Highmore because of their work together in the drama ""Finding Neverland"".All in all I thought ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was a wonderful movie but definitely not for the children.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A child's sweet nightmare.........,"Like many others, I grew up with Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory, and loved it dearly, and try as hard as you like but comparisons were always going to be inevitable. Meeting high expectations were always going to be a tall order, and in my opinion, this film has failed to meet them.Little needs to be explained about this film, as the story is as familiar now to everyone as the 3 bears. Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka takes us on a very dark and even disturbing tour of this factory, with the 5 kids accompanied by a parent/grandparent in their tale.In some ways this is a horror tale where the film is made for us to wish to see the kids get what they deserve, but this takes away from the light heartedness of the tale. The kids to me are more freakish than the original and don't seem to be given sufficient time, and Tim Burton's take seems to see his imprint want to overshadow that of Roald Dahl's.I was a little disappointed by this movie, although i don't deny the setting was wonderful, and the interpretation original, but I can't see myself wanting to ever watch it again.... and in any case why didn't they keep that wonderfully frightening boat ride as in the first movie?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
my favorite movie of the year,"when i first went to the screening for this movie i was expecting it to be crap like the trailers suggested but i was surprised by how well made it is. this is an amazing movie that shows director Burton at his best. you all know the story by now so i won't waste time going over it. what i love about this movie is how they kept the things that made the original movie great and also added in their own wonderful stuff. the trailers and TV ads make Wonka look like an idiot or some freak but he's actually a pretty sweet man that's funny as hell. the kids are great too, although they get a bit annoying at times. danny elfman's music was also well done, it's not as good as the one he did for scissorhands but it still holds it own and the set design was amazing from start to finish.this is a great movie that's well shot and done in every way. it might just be the first remake since dawn of the dead that doesn't suck",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Update Doesn't Do It for Me,"I'm not giving this ""ones"" because I liked the first film much better, but it just fell short for me. Gene Wilder kept the Wonka edge going but Johnny Depp somehow took most of the humor out of the new version. I didn't see anything new, other than a lot of special effects (which one would expect) and the Oompa Loompas (whom I enjoyed). As is usually the case, there are efforts to update things with some of the music and some sight gags. But Depp just gets more and more weird, almost to the level of child abuse. Don't get me wrong, it's a great story, but I never was engaged. See it and make your own judgment. It certainly does have the Tim Burton touch which is always worth a shot.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Good,"Johnny Depp does a good job of playing a weirdo, but he's too Michael Jackson-like for my liking. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Filled with charm, innocence and drama. The colors are amazing and seem to follow the mood of the story. It's fun watching it. Its complexity begins within its characters. It's an amazing work and everything I had hoped for. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Great Burton film, laughable musical numbers","Tim Burton did a great job with musical numbers in Nightmare Before Christmas, but the same isn't true in the live action Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. With the exception of the musical scenes, this film is a splendid film with imagery, characters, and a general mood characteristic of Burton's films.Burton's version is a fresh retelling of the story and is a much different film than the 1971 version. (I never thought I'd say this, but I think I prefer the musical numbers in the '71 version, poor graphics and all!). It also includes new scenes at the end which are supposedly authorized by Rohd Dahl's widow. I think the story was better as it was, but the scenes do support the additional depth Burton injected into Wonka, so I do appreciate the scenes for what they do.Depp was fabulous (look for at least one Edward Scissorhands reference) though at times reminded me of a modern Michael Jackson (shudder). The only miscast character, in my opinion, was Missi Pyle as Mrs. Beauregard. She does play a good witch, but I'd have preferred someone else in the role.The opening sequence has some beautiful CG, though one of the final scenes has *terrible* character animation rotoscoped in a live action scene (the Violet Beauregarde character).90% of the movie is true magic. The other 10% is ruined by the musical acts (and I LOVE musicals). By the third number I learned it was a great time to get a popcorn refill or hit the restroom...The film is certainly appropriate for children and adults and both will enjoy it.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Not as good as the 1971 version,"I've just recently watched Tim Burton's movie and I have to admit, it did a better job on the book than the 1971 movie version did, even though I have not read the original book in years. There are some bits that made me smile, but it was neither as entertaining nor as charming as the original movie.I have to agree that Johnny Depp was not as great Willy Wonka as Gene Wilder was. I thought Johnny Depp was a little rude towards the children and even though I liked some of the songs, they weren't as good as those on the 1971 movie. I also agree that Johnny Depp was a bit Michael Jackson-ish in behavior. That is some of the criticisms I have to give for this more recent adaptation.Hey, jon-750, you were hoping that Tim Burton will never do a ""remake"" again, but, to disappoint you, he is. This time he's doing Lewis Carroll's story Alice in Wonderland. Even though he will be moving away from the mood of this movie, he will be doing the same type of thing he did in this movie, and he will use CGI effects in it too like what he did here too.I have to agree that Tim Burton has been the same in recent years, just making adaptations and things based on other stuff as well as casting Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in it too, as far as I can see. I wish Tim Burton would take them out and put more different people in rather than a few because some might end up getting bored. But for anyone who hates the 1971 movie, this movie is the one for you. For me, I rate it 6 out of 10, because its not as good as the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a funny good time for kids and adults,"The brilliant Tim Burton impresses me once again, this time with his dark remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (I will be the first to admit that I was expecting a corny family filmit proved me wrong). Young and charming Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) has only one wish, and that is to visit the legendary chocolate factory of Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp stars as the upbeat, yet bitter candy man (his version portrays Wonka as a wannabe crack addictand it works very well in this ""family"" film). Charlie gets his wish after several attempts and finds a golden ticket, giving him and his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) a free tour of the factory led by Wonka himself. Along with four other snot-nosed brats and their parents, the group finds mischief and adventure around every corner.Burton's bright and colorful world for the film contradicts his usual darker style (like Batman and Edward Scissorhands), but it works as for one day the young boy goes from a life of poverty to riches in what many children would depict to be there own version of heavencandy everywhere and very bright lights.The choice of Depp to play Wonka could not have been any better of a fit. He's irritable, cranky, careless, and dumb. Not to say Johnny is any of those things in real life (wink wink), but if you want an actor to pull it off and still have all of America love you for itthen Johnny is your man. This is a funny good time for kids and adults (I actually saw more people my age than kids at the theater).",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hypocrites,Now I like the original movie. But I like this one as well. But I had to write this because of the hypocrites who say they love the book and love the original and hate this. The fact is Roald Dahl hated the 1971 version. I really enjoy it but he hated it for he thought it was not true to the book. Real fans of the book would know this. But I enjoy both versions despite that. And another factor of this version is that the remaining Dahl family had a hand in it. Anyways people need to stop being biased and hate it for another reason at least.,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Something for everyone,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has something for everyone: -great children's story; i loved the original when i was a kid, and was looking forward for this for a while -baked teenager's paradise; trippy oompah loompahs.... -12 year old girl's heaven; seeing Johnny Depp on the poster is enough. -those old enough to remember the original; i loved it, as i'm sure every other human being did. -PG rating; parents can take their kids. -spooky kids; remember, Tim Burton is directingGreat movie. Even if you're seeing it for any reason i failed to mention above, you'll love it. Johnny Depp is a great actor; his ability to avoid typecast and play any part is intimidating.

Disappointing,"I know this film follows closer to the book than the original, but that does not automatically ensure it's a better film. I'm afraid I preferred the original - Johnny Depp was just too weird for my taste, and if that was how Wonka was supposed to be, then I can understand why Gene's Wilder's interpretation was of a warmer Wonka. But also this new version bored me. We went from scene to scene without any real continuity - I didn't get to dislike the other kids as much as I should have done - it all seemed very shallow. There wasn't enough depth in the characters of the other children and their parents. I believe the original film took license to make a film that was actually better than the book, rather than attempting to stick to it. Also in this film the Chocolate factory itself disappointed me - I actually found it a depressing place. To save the film was the acting of Charlie and the family who were all great, as was Christopher Lee as Wonka's father.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Johnny Depp nearly sinks the film!!!!,"I am a fan of the original 1971 classic. I went into this film not expecting to like this version better, but I was open to be pleasantly surprised. When a classic move is being redone, as seems to be the norm these days, what one would expect is to be reminded of what made us like the 1st version. Tim Burton seemed to be the perfect director for this film, and in many ways he is. The film is visually inventive, but not jawdroppingly so, I would say that the look of the film is only bigger in scope than the original, not better. Obviously it takes cues from the original film, and yes, it seems to follow the book more, which is not necessarily a good thing.The biggest problem for me is Johnny Depp. At first it seems that he would be perfect to play Willy Wonka. He goes for total weirdness here, His Wonka is more annoying than anytrhing else. Depp is a great actor, but he makes Willy Wonka to robotic and unlikable. He is creepy at first but never dangerous. Just weird. Gene Wilder had made Wonka into a 3 dimensional character. He was funny, quirky, gentle, and at times creepy, but he made him more or less a likable character. This film wants us to sympathize with Wonka, but I found him to annoying to care. Depp created a caricature, not a character. The rest of the film is fine. Freddie Highmore as Charlie is good, the supporting cast is good too. There are some funny reworkings of the originals scenes, some work, some don't. If one sees this film without having seen the original, I think that it would probably be more enjoyable without the comparison. I'll stick with the Gene Wilder classic!

Better then it's given credit for.,"I grew up reading the book, and of course with the original film, both of which I love. This remake is exactly what you'd expect from Tim Burton, it's somewhat dark, trippy, surreal and somewhat garish. Fans of his will love it, appreciate his style, and enjoy his stamp. The special effects are terrific, it's a visual feast, very colourful, so much going on. The supporting cast are super, Freddie Highmore, David Kelly and even Liz Smith are delightful. The original has such a warmth, the music, songs, but mainly Gene Wilder, and whilst I love Johnny Depp, it's the character's lack of warmth that stops it being a movie I revisit often. The music just isn't good, you could watch it twenty times and not remember a song. Way too much Deep Roy. It has its faults but it's still imaginative, bright and very entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"I heard the movie was bad, but it's just the opposite.","I went to see Willy Wonka with my cousin about a week ago. Since I saw it, I couldn't stop talking about it. People had told me that movie was going to be a bad remake but it was not at all. The best part was that they gave background on Willy Wonka. They should have done that on the first one too. Also, the ending is completely different than the first one but much better. If I had to rate the movie on a scale of 10, 10 being the highest, I would give it a 9, and I don't even like Johnny Depp. My favorite movie is also by Tim Burton. He has surpassed any expectations I had for the movie. There were many memorable scenes from the movie and I will be talking about it for a while. I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD so I can watch it with my friends. However, there were a few things in the movie that I didn't like, but there will always be parts in a movie that people don't like. The oompa loompas were a bit different and some of the children's' parents were a little different from the first one. It's not different in a bad way. I wouldn't want it to be exactly like the first one though, because that would be like watching the same movie twice. Tim Burton did a good job of keeping the idea of the first one and making it completely his own.",,Anonymous,Comedy
not as good as the first movie,"I believe overall that this new version is not as good as the old movie. Some parts that weren't in the new movie but in the old were very important to the story line.

I did enjoy the old movie very much and I was looking forward to a new remake. But when i saw the new movie, i was disappointed with its unsimilarity to the old movie.

Magical,"This movie was absolutely magical and incredible to me as a child. Recently re-watched it and even as an adult now, this movie still dazzles me. Johnny Depp's quirky yet deeply complex portrayal of the character was still grounded enough to make many viewers mystified and intrigued by Willy Wonka's backstory. He knows how to balance a compelling and delightful performance with an edgy twist to his character, that pushes boundaries in exactly the correct way to engage an audience. Wonderful acting from the children who seemed to enjoy every second of being in the movie and managed to authentically depict the characterization that I believe Roald Dahl intended to express through his book, as did the parents! Tim Burton's direction as always was excellent and it's amazing that he was able to stay so true to the book whilst also adding his own spin onto the story.

Fun For the Whole Family (Whether You've Seen the Original Film Or Not),"When I was going up in the 70s, I really enjoyed watching the original movie. Now that I have young kids myself, I was very excited to take my kids to this new version. I did not realize how well the original film wasthat is how the film was put togetheruntil sitting down and watching this new one with my kids. To make a long story short, there is no way this second film can compare to the original; but, Tim Burton does a good job.This newer version has a lot of fun-nothing to serious-lots of laughs and cool special effects look to it. Tim and his chosen actors do not drop the ball at all in this very well-made remake. Johnny Depp was great as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore was good as Charlie.

Favorite childhood movie,"Now, if I were a screenwriter and wrote some fairy tale, I wonder who I would offer to transfer it to the screen. I don't even have any other options, it would be Tim Burton. Who better than he knows how to create a colorful, large-scale, entertaining and fascinating movie from an ordinary story. Not even a movie, but a trip.The plot is here... yes, however, what difference does it make which plot. My firm belief is that you can watch Barton's films without absolutely realizing what is happening on the screen. Once I just admired his Edward, who lived with defective hands, then I admired the headless horseman and the cute inspector, and now I'm shocked by the factory created.Milk rivers, jelly banks. It is impossible to convey in words the beauty that appeared before my eyes. A glass elevator and a rickety shack, baby oompa-loompas and a huge chocolate waterfall. And what a makeup Johnny Depp has! It suits him very well. A frenzy of colors and a riot of fantasy. There are no words...There is no point in saying something about the cast either. It doesn't matter whether you are known to the general public or you are a kid playing a second role in your life, all the same, all attention is focused on the chocolate processing plant, and not on a handful of people scurrying back and forth.Speaking of people. When I looked, there was a feeling that in front of me was a light version of the ""Saw"". And what? The same space, almost closed, similar to a maze. The same people, even if they are children, but already with vices, from gluttony to self-praise, with weaknesses in the form of constant chewing, and chewing gum is a drug (tested on yourself) and with incommensurable curiosity. The same traps and no less terrible. And the same arbiter of fate with a caustic grin on his face in the form of Willy. And the essence is the same, to show what is good and what is bad, to punish the vicious and praise the saints.In general, it makes no sense to argue here, because ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" is Tim Burton. And that says it all.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wonky Kubrick,"Burton has a single note that he imposes. Fair enough. But its like Gilliam, he has to find a very rare story that has slots where has something to offer. For Gilliam, that was ""Fear and Loathing."" Burton last was in his element with the second Batman.For my taste, this was all wrong for him. His talent is the ability to separate layers of reality cleanly and then playing with the dissonance between those layers, often humorously.This story has only one layer. It is along the lines of a Suess, and may be the best Suess on film. As a Suess, it has some charm, but why settle for seconds? Bad script.But this has one cool moment where Burton leaves his Burton-dom and enters the world of Rodriguez. Its a twist on the film within. Wonka transfers a chocolate bar through the TeeVee. It is a many layered reference to 2001, which itself is about conflicting generation of reality.The scene features the white room, the eye, the music, the chair, the apes, and the chocolate bar as the monolith. What's on the TeeVee and movie screen are overlapped as our hero can reach in and grab the bar.This segues into a sequence populated by rock band parodies, including The Beatles. All these are peopled by the Oompah guy and voiced by the Oingo Boingo guy. Its an island of depth in the midst of a sea of stupid syrup.Otherwise, the project is a misfit.Oh and Helena's bearing is majestic.

Not as Bad as I Expected,"A young boy (Freddie Highmore) wins a tour through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world, led by the world's most unusual candy maker (Johnny Depp).The biggest way this film differs from the original: Tim Burton (or someone) wrote it so the story has a weird obsession with Wonka's childhood. Now, this has some advantages, such as getting a role for Christopher Lee and being able to explain the importance of family, but it does seem to ruin the flow at times.I liked the new songs. We have a new style of Oompa-Loompa, and they have a variety of musical styles. Excellent. Especially considering how much Danny Elfman was involved.In some ways, this is closer to the play than the original film, especially with the nut scene.

"Good time, flashbacks for babyboomers are hilarious.","Yesterday we saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - it was a beautiful production and had us crying multiple times throughout, some very very funny moments - the only problem is Johnny Depp as Willie Wonka, he never establishes a character and is weak. I think Gene Wilder will always have that role nailed in our minds, and Johnny can't crack it.The oompa-loompas are particularly well produced, especially considering it is all just one actor.The problem with Johnny is we keep expecting him to express a viewpoint or have an attitude other than blasé. He has a lot of clever one liners and his deadpan ""factoids"" were funny.The movie never takes itself too seriously, which is a major selling point.

Fantastic and criminally underrated film that's true to the original story,"Note: I'm not a child. I've watched the original film far more times than I've watched this film. I'm sitting here reading reviews and getting so angry at the people who review this film solely as a ""remake"" of Willy Wonka and Chocolate Factory. Their nostalgia goggles are glued to their face and they can't seem to understand that this is an adaptation of a BOOK and not a remake of a movie that had nearly nothing to do with the book.Guess what? I have nostalgia for the '71 film too. But guess what else? I don't base my opinion of THIS movie off a movie that's almost completely unrelated. The only similarity between the '71 movie and the '05 movie, and really between the '71 movie and the BOOK, is the general plot and the characters. That's pretty much it. With that being said, stop comparing this movie to that one without even taking into consideration how this one stands as a film by itself, or as an adaptation of the book. So from now on, I will not be comparing this movie to the '71 movie. That movie doesn't exist from now until when I finish typing this review.First of all, I was an extreme fan of the book as a kid (and really all of Roald Dahl's work). I've read it probably 50 times at this point and I know the story inside and out. This film is really, REALLY accurate. And I love that. Of course, you'd expect tat considering Tim Burton literally studied the book's original illustrations when making this movie, and that Felicity Dahl (Roald's wife) was executive producer of this film. The only aspect of this film that isn't accurate is the whole backstory regarding Wonka's past. Say what you want about the execution of it, but I really enjoyed the efforts of Burton to flesh his character out. It's tough to gauge a character that we know virtually nothing about, but it's neat to see why and how Willy Wonka became the way he is. His motivations make more sense when we see his tough childhood. I don't mind the backstory at all. Throwing in some character development for Wonka was a good move in my book.The music in this movie is remarkable. I do not for the life of me understand the criticisms some people are making of them. I mean, what more can you ask for: varied and catchy music styles WITH Dahl's original lyrics? It's perfect. I genuinely cannot choose a favorite song in this movie. They're all THAT good. And as for the criticisms about the Oompa Loompas all being played by Deep Roy, I personally don't see an issue with it. It was done really well, and I would personally have every Oompa Loompa played by the same person and cloned digitally than only have a few Oompa Loompas.I really do enjoy the grand and modern appearance of all the sets in this film. Burton deliberately made as much of the film real as possible, and it's just fantastic. The grand scale of the chocolate room, inventing room and nut room are just spectacular, ESPECIALLY the nut room which has a very neat modern vibe to it. I especially love during the Oompa Loompa's Veruca Salt song when they dance around the garbage shoot. Even the television room, which is essentially just a white box, has a cool modern vibe to it with the design of the lights and cameras. The factory itself, in fact, has a great design. It reminds me almost of the Overlook Hotel from The Shining: how it's so grand and gigantic and easy to get lost in, and once you go inside you really can't escape. As a kid I always wanted to look at a floor plan of this monstrosity and just see how all the rooms and movie locations were laid out relative to each other and the outside world. The factory is so large in fact, that it doesn't even seem like it can exist in the same universe as the rest of the film (Fudge Mountain, as an example).A common criticism of this film is Depp's performance and interpretation of Wonka. I personally find it PERFECT. I don't think he's creepy, just a social recluse that doesn't really know how to communicate with people. He spent so many years talking to only the Oompa Loompas and himself that he's gone crazy, which is also accurate to the book. Wonka is an introvert and an extremely bizarre man, but very eccentric. He's also a genius, but has disturbing thoughts and ideas, and acts on them in strange ways.Random things:>The chocolate river scene. How that scene was always meant to be portrayed.>The performances. All fantastic. Perfect casting all around.>The CGI. Very convincing and used as CGI should be used (to aid with telling a story, rather than telling the story itself). Also, I mentioned this before but Burton made the effort to make things real whenever possible, even training squirrels and building the inventing room out of old plane parts.>The puppet fire intro. Indicative of Wonka's crazy mind and very funny.>The tone. Accurate to the book and delightfully eery at times.>The ""show don't tell"" mentality many of the scenes had.>Grandpa Joe actually working for Wonka instead of just magically knowing everything about him.Now for some comparisons to the original. These don't have any effect on my rating but I thought I should throw some in for the sake of people reading:>The music is far better in this film than in the '71 film. Sorry, but it's true. The ""Oompa Loompa doopedy do"" song makes no sense. Although I do like it, it's not fitting to the story and somewhat lazy in my opinion to have essentially the same song over and over again with one changed verse. With that being said I do enjoy the other songs in the film (with the exception of Good Luck, Charlie).>Wilder's Wonka. Extremely comforting and caring guy, but Willy Wonka in the book wasn't. He was disgusted by the children who didn't win. He had a disturbing and strange, but genius personality. Depp nails it.>The stupid subplots introduced to show the craze around the Wonka competition such as the fraud ticket and the computer that would guess the ticket locations. They were way too drawn out and felt pointless.>The dumb scenes that weren't in the book such as the fizzy lifting drink scene, the car wash scene and the ending scene in the office (no spoilers). One review I read had the AUDACITY to criticize the '05 film for NOT having the fizzy lifting drink scene. Sure, let's just go ahead and include a scene that shows Charlie breaking the rules for no reason and makes him just as bad as the other kids! That'll make us root for him! I won't criticize the golden egg scene since that was solely out in for technical limitation reasons.>The Wonkavator. Who thought this was a good idea?>THE TUNNEL. I have no words for just how pointless and out-of-character this scene is. Y'all call Depp the creepy one?>The Slugworth subplot. Honestly, who thought this was a good idea? Why even give anyone a tour if you're just going to give them an everlasting gobstopper and see if they return it?Just for the record, I love the 1971 movie.

Fresh coat of paint to an old favorite...,"I was extremely pleased with the new Charlie and The Chocolate Factory movie, remake of the 70's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Tim Burton did an excellent job recreating the original lines and incorporating his own interpretation, which made this 2005's version exciting, comedic and entertaining. I loved the mix of characters that starred - some rookies and some vets - their roles were played magnificently. I was also very pleased with Johnny Depp's performance in relation to the original Willy Wonka. I arrived thinking his role was going to be like most every other role he's played, with his own attitude. But, it was totally different from what everyone was used to, and it was hilarious. I loved the mix of sarcasm and comedy. The audience was full of a mix of different ages and everyone was laughing and really getting into it.

This movie is worth seeing for some attractive set design, ostentatious costumes and Danny Elfman's energetic, whimsical-yet-gothic musical approach.

Underrated? Yes. Perfect remake? Ehhh...,"This isn't just one of my favourite remakes, when I was a kid, this was one of my favourite films period. Not only do I think that this is closer to the book than the original, I think that the scenes that were also in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory are actually even better in this remake, but the film does have its problems. Is Johnny Depp's take on Willy Wonka as annoying as everyone says? Honestly I don't think so, but I can see where people who think it is are coming from. Is Charlie's character as overly perfect as everyone says? I guess but when you get down to it, he was written to be a sort of role model to kids, to show them the right values and morals to have.One good point to note is that the only scene removed from the original in this remake that is noticeable is Willy Wonka's Death Tunnel (as I like to call it) which, lets be honest, was definitely removed for good reason. Take it from someone who was not that phased by films such as The Shining and Alien that the Death Tunnel scene from the original is scary enough to scar kids for life, and if that was remade in this remake... *shudders at the thought of a new Death Tunnel scene*I think one reason this film gets quite a lot of hate is because the hate is coming from fans of the original film, but I think that what they don't realise is that this film was not so much a remake of the old film, but more a new film adaption from the book by Roald Dahl drawing little inspiration from the original movie and more from the original source, the book. And considering Roald Dahl actually didn't like the original movie for not being close enough to the book, it was probably for the best.Overall I'd see this film is definitely a great watch for Roald Dahl fans, but maybe not for die hard fans of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and all with less insanely frighting tunnels from hell, meaning no therapy needed after watching this remake!7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't bother,"While some may say this terrible film is more like the original book that the 1971 movie, but overall, it really isn't. My kids actually have the book and I read through it right after watching the DVD.This film may be more true to the book with some of the finer details (the original lyrics to the Oompah Loopah songs, Charlie having a living father who worked at a toothpaste factory), none of these details add anything to the story.On the other hand, the creepy, gray-skinned, androgynous Wonka is nothing like the original character in the book. He hates children (so why does he want to give the factory to one?). He can't even say the word ""parents."" He even hates old people. There is absolutely nothing funny, amusing, or likable about him (BTW, the dialogue in the movie is purely awful). By the time there's a feeble attempt to redeem Wonka's character at the end, it's too late. And where were the childhood flashbacks of Wonka in the book? So much for ""more true to the book.""I saw the 1971 movie as a kid, and enjoyed it. But I watched it many years later as an adult, and LOVED it. There's so many great lines in it that I missed as a six-year-old. If you read a little about the history of the making of the movie (look online), you'll find that the script at one point was originally developed more for adults than children. It's no wonder, because much of the humor is more geared for adults.Wilder plays the role of ""Wonka"" like it was made for him. Also, I believe the 1971 film story additions made for a much better story than the original book, and allowed you to see much further into the characters. Maybe I feel this way because I saw the movie before reading the book, but who can ever forget the scene near the end where Charlie shuns the opportunity for ill-gotten gains, even with his own Grandpa encouraging him to do the opposite. Wow. After seeing that, the book's ending seems kinda dull.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Horrible, Awful, Terrible- um, not funny, dark- um...Horrible, Awf-","My experience has been that re-makes seldom live up to the original. But this- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory could scarcely be considered a re-make. UGH! Time watched is time gone forever. It was dark and twisted. For kids? Not mine. They could hardly sit through it for constantly comparing it to the original and were sorely disappointed in it.Disappointed? What an understatement. Once my children left the room I totally dissed this film but good. Johnny Depp is such an accomplished actor (IMO) I simply thought it was such a shame he did this film.Boring? There were plenty of moments that seemed to drag by. Dark? From moment one to the excruciating end the film is filled with dark, eerie and uneasy dialog, sets and characters.How it earned awards is beyond me; although the majority were for the film itself (i.e. costume, editing, hair, production and so-on). I do note there were awards for acting itself to a few actors (Depp and Highmore specifically). But the film was just plain NOT ANY GOOD.I can only guess that in doing a re-make of such a children's classic with such popularity the challenge was to be ""better"" (why else a re-make), but how can you top or better something that was so perfectly tuned? You make the copy something that is so drastically different that it mostly competes on another level. With that- I give August & Burton Credit... it was defiantly on a different level.The thing is I usually genuinely enjoy the work of Tim Burton. He is so creative and artistic and credit to his work-peers. But this movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory... WAS NOT ANY GOOD.When I read stuff like: John August had never watched Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory until ""after"" he finished the script. (Which to me is hard to believe) but then to hear he said he was surprised at how much darker the 1971 version was as compared to his version??? Puh-leeze! Only if the lights are out and you're watching on an old b/w set! Darker? But, enough of this. I'm sure you understand by now how I felt about this alleged re-make. There are those who like and those who don't. I'm not trying to sway a vote here, simply giving you the impression of how awful it was so you don't have to actually go through the torture yourself and view it. Good luck! LOL.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Burton and Depp made Movie Magic...again!!,"Tim Burton and Johhny Depp - a duo made in movie heaven! Charlie and the Chocolate was so enjoyable, that by the end of the movie my mouth was in cramps. I had been smiling the whole entire time. Though some people may dislike this version of Roald Dahl's book, it is only because people are so attached to the first. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not - I repeat - is NOT a remake of Mel Stuart's 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Burton's film is a make of the book, not the other movie. So I think people would enjoy it more if they didn't keep thinking about how Gene Wilder was so much ""less weird."" Johnny Depp made the movie. I've heard the total opposite and more than once. But it's Love that you see in Depp as he portrays Wonka - that dream role the he's had since he started acting. And finally he gets it and is allowed to have his fun. And you can tell he's having it, too.Adorable Freddie Highmore in ""Charlie"" does just as good as he did as adorable Freddie Highmore in Finding Neverland. He's a great young actor and just the cutest boy I've seen on screen for a long time.I find this film enchanting so enjoyable - I could watch it a million times and still get those darn cramps in my mouth from smiling over and over again.

An abomination of the classic,"I hate to say this, especially to a well reviewed film, but i simply didn't like this film and i felt almost insulted by the way it came off. Don't get me wrong, The kid who played Charlie was'nt bad at all, but compared to the classic i grew up watching, it just was horrible.Granted i know how the author of the book hated the movie, and the 1971 film didn't exactly follow the book to a T, but this film, even though it follows the book, just came off as weird, disturbing and overall poor compared to the classic Gene Wilder film. Also the Umpa Loopas were weird, Not the fault of actor, but how they were presented. I mean, if they were from a weird tribe, why would they look all EXACTLEY ALIKE? if they were a clone work force, that be different, but they were from a tribe, and idk about u but to me I've never seen a tribe on National Geographic or Discovery Channel in which each member looked exactly the same.Now, i am noting that it is the ""Tim Burton version"" which means it comes with its own visual style and flair which to me is aether hit or miss, but, compared to the toung and cheek 1971 version, it just couldn't compare. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Computer animation and special effects, hell I'm even studying them in college with the goals of being an animator, but this film just didn't need to be made.in closing, on its own, i guess its an OK film. But compared to the classic, its an abomination.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, but Visually Overwhelming.","We all know the story, the sweet little unfortunate boy Charlie (Freddie Highmore) wins a competition along with four other children to visit the mysterious chocolate factory owned by the eccentric and weirdly wonderful candy maker, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). What follows is a roller-coaster ride of excitement as the children are taken on a tour of the factory.From the introduction to the credits the audience is continuously bombarded with nauseating visuals in the form of sets, costumes, designs, special effects and lighting. Each piece in itself is yes, wonderful, creative and fantastical, but we are missing the awe and amazement that the characters feel, which a really good fantasy movie portrays. Burton's overuse of the overpowering visuals after a while cancels out the awe we are meant to feel as we enter each new world in the factory. You feel relatively no connection with either Charlie or Wonka as you are plunged into this story which never gives a breath to develop the characters, and tells the story at a pace so fast that by the end you wonder if you really were sitting there for 2 hours when it felt like 30 minutes.I really feel that Burton compromises the storytelling side of the film for the visual side of the film, as with his previous films namely Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow. While the sets and designs are amazing, both the stories and the characters lack depth.Johnny Depp certainly delivers a weird and wonderful Wonka, and Freddie Highmore is perfectly cast as the quiet and thoughtful Charlie, although he never gets a moment long enough to shine in with the pace of the movie. The child actors all do their bit as the annoying and spoilt little brats, and the parents are suitably moronic. The cast does a very good job with the boundaries that they have in this movie.The Oompa Loompas however, are another story. Yes, thankfully we no longer see the little people dressed in drag with orange face paint, as in the original movie, but at least those Oompa Loompas had a sense of realness to them, very much unlike the ridiculous clones in the new film. Since each Oompa Loompa is portrayed by the same actor, and is duplicated by a computer, there is no realness to them at all, because you can't see through the visual effects. The beauty of good special effects in movies is when you don't know that they are there, or at least you are temporarily fooled into thinking that what you see is the real thing. When you see these computer copies skipping along with flawless synchronism, you are not being fooled; you know straight away that they are out of a computer, which detaches the viewer emotionally from the story.Aside from the negatives, this does prove to be an enjoyable popcorn movie for children, and if you take you kids to see this at the cinema, they will probably thoroughly enjoy it. There are plenty of laughs and nearly sickening amounts of colours and of course, chocolate. But for the older viewer, who would like to see a really good movie, and be able to commend the filmmakers for realising Road Dahl's amazing storytelling abilities onto modern film, I'm afraid this will disappoint.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
eh... mediocre treatment,"Like most of Tim Burton's movies lately, he seems to focus more on style than substance. In Planet of the Apes, the visuals and set designs were absolutely fabulous, but the story was severely lacking. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is no different. Both Apes and Chocolate are re-interpretations/remakes, but neither of them add anything to the original. In the case of Chocolate, it takes quite a bit away.Johnny Depp looks absolutely freaky and disturbing. His face and voice are all wrong and reminds me of an amalgam of Michael Jackson, Ziggy Stardust, and Caesar Romero's Joker from the campy old 70's Batman shows... that or a woman who's had 1 plastic surgery procedures too many. The eerie smile and prosthetic teeth make him look like some kind of monster, a far cry from the endearing but eccentric character portrayed by Gene Wilder in the 1971 original.Ironically, that movie was called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it focuses a lot on Charlie and his life of poverty. This one is called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and focuses too much on the hideous Willy. They bring in the back story of Willy's abusive father in the form of flashbacks, which is completely unnecessary. The kids had a lot of personality in the original movie, but here, they are annoying and cursory. Charlie has no personality and very few lines.other problems: One segment (2001: Space Odyssey parody) looks like they bought all the left over props from Men in Black II. The new Oompa Loompa songs suck! They are also not cute and don't have any catchy songs anymore. Watching this movie was an ordeal.""Don't touch that squirrel's nuts!"" -- Willy Wonka.

Enjoyable work of an old story,"When I first heard that they were making a new ""Chocolate Factory,"" I couldn't see any reason. The original is a classic, and was the first movie I went to as a kid.A refreshing take on the new film is that it is not simply a remake of the 1971 movie. This one tells you much more about Willy Wonka and the operation of the factory. There are a few updates to the story: Mike Teevee is a video game nut!There are some very hilarious moments in the movie. I won't spoil them and tell you what to look for, but be prepared to laugh. Also, this film shows more of Johnny Depp's talent. His Willy Wonka is completely different from the great Jack Sparrow he played in ""Pirates Of The Caribbean.""Everyone in my family had a good time with it, so it comes with our recommendation. I did not feel compelled to compare it to the 1971 movie. That one will always have a special place in my heart, but this new version of the story is wonderful!Since it is made my Tim Burton, you will see his style everywhere. One small aspect of it that I did not care for was that it takes place in the winter. Everything seemed so cold and dark at first. In the 1971 film, it is a beautifully sunny day when the children arrive at Wonka's factory, giving the feeling that everyone is about to enter a fantasy land.Still, this new one will not disappoint.

"A creative, colorful, and very fun letdown.","I was looking forward to this movie most of anybody. I'd followed it from pre-production. All of my favorite critics loved it, and I was told by matineed friends that I would love it. And by God I wanted to love it.I struggled. Every time something happened that struck me the wrong way, I pretended I didn't really notice. But unfortunately, those things added up quickly.I couldn't shake the feeling that I couldn't make a stand on whether or not I thought Charlie was a good movie. I feel like I can't say it's a bad movie, because there are too many wonderful pieces and moments to save it from that judgment. But I can't say it's a good movie either, because it fails on so many levels.Take the inclusion of Willy Wonka's father, for instance. A character not in the book, Burton's decision to make Wonka a man troubled by his estranged paternal relationship only added a level of cheesiness that seriously hindered the film's capacity to intrigue us. Wonka is a character of mystery, he is the great recluse of our time--a character who revels in childish inanity but is also gifted with extraordinary genius (he has made the impossible possible). To explain his character so simply and Hallmarky (he just needed Daddy to love him!) completely betrays what he is supposed to represent. Wonka doesn't have these Freudian issues--he is the embodiment of creative glee.Secondly, take the EXclusion of the fizzy-lifting drink theft. Besides reducing the chocolate factory to essentially four explored rooms (one for each naughty child), it robs the humanity from Charlie and his grandfather. They are fallible! The point is that they are well-intentioned. Their mistake serves to show us both that there is no perfection and that intentions make the man.As I just said, the chocolate factory itself was seriously dampened. It seems that here Burton and Co. spent endless time designing the four disaster rooms, and merely created weak filler for the rest.And last but certainly not least is the CGI. Not just cartoonish, the CGI in this film was completely distracting. Maybe it's just me, but I can't stand the look of the stuff. In Star Wars it bothers me too, but I'm willing to accept it because the entire world is computer-generated. However, to have a room filled with fantastic tangible gadgets and then insert a PlayStation 2 quality blueberry girl is distracting and lazy. Burton used to be a wizard with visual effects. Take the makeup in Edward Scissorhands, the monsters in Beetlejuice, the villains and gadgets in Batman, even the gore effects in his last great movie, Sleepy Hollow. Willy Wonka's factory should appear cartoonish and bizarre, yes, but not impossible. By using CGI instead of creative effects, we are being told that it is in fact IMPOSSIBLE for these things to exist in real life. They have to be fabricated, drawn in.Of course, the film has its great moments. The adaptation of the book is faithful, right down to the Oompa Loompa lyrics. Charlie's house is slanted, and I was happy to see the story of the Sultan come to the screen. Depp's Wonka is seriously flawed (I just think it's not an appropriate incarnation of Dahl's character), but he does pull off the occasional moment of maniacal genius. The children are much more realistic in this day and age, children I recognized from my life. And Burton's exaggerated color schemes are brilliant, his characters properly caricatured, his comedic timing perfected. Freddie Highmore is an amazing little boy actor.I really wanted to LOVE this movie. And I will see it again. But right now I must maintain it was neither good nor bad, it just wasn't Dahl. It opted to replace his black satirical warmth with an obvious warmth. It too often went for the obvious joke when the opportunity arose. And between its magnificent pieces it did something no Dahl adaptation should ever do--it got boring.Just to clarify, I didn't hate it. I just didn't like it very much. I'm sure a lot of people are going to love this movie, but I for one couldn't lie to myself. I'd love to pretend that it was dark, that it was diabolically ingenious, that it was smart, that it was amazing. And you know what? If little kids go see this and are completely awed then Tim Burton has done his job. It just wasn't for me. And I couldn't convince myself it was, no matter how much I wanted to.B- A creative, colorful, and very fun letdown.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Aside from a bizarre ending, this film is great and sticks pretty close to the book","I liked the old WILLY WONKA film and when I heard they were going to do a remake, I was very skeptical--especially when knuckleheads on the internet kept started circulating rumors that Marilyn Manson was going to play the lead!! Fortunately, this was only a dopey rumor and I am pleased to say that I am glad they remade this film, since it sticks much closer to the book by Roald Dahl and because I liked the dark Tim Burton style. Unlike the original, this isn't as much of a musical and it has a wicked sense of humor. However, oddly, while being very dark, unlike WILLY WONKA, the film showed that the bad children were alright by the end of the film. If you never read the books, when you watch the original movie you might just think the brats died! Most of the reason the film is better is the clever script, though it didn't hurt that they were able to use modern special effects that were light-years ahead of the 1971 film. Additionally, while I liked Gene Wilder as Willy, the dark and twisted and possibly crazy Willy played by Johnny Depp was a hoot to watch. I also loved the new version of Oompa-loompas--so creepy and cool compared to the annoying orange freaks from the older film.I liked just about everything about the new film. The only part I wasn't thrilled with was the tacked on epilogue which starred Christopher Lee. While I love seeing Lee in films (except when he was in the Star Wars movies--this is best forgotten), none of this was in the book and just seemed out of place--though also a bit fun. Purists (like myself) may not like this, but most out there probably won't mind at all with this addition.Finally, I should point out that this is definitely a more adult version of the story. Young children probably should NOT watch the film--especially if they are impressionable of really, really young. However, for older kids, teen and adults, this remake is the better bet because it's funnier and quite clever and NEVER cloying or schmaltzy.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Satisfying Treat in a Lovely, Shiny Wrapper","First off, I would really like to emphasize that this movie is *not* a remake of the 1970's film. That's like saying Peter Jackson remade Ralph Bakshi's 1970's version of LOTR. It's instead a new, darker, and more cynical look at Roald Dahl's novel. Dahl's work is infamous for being darker than your average kiddy fare, so in that sense, Burton *was* being faithful to the source material.Beyond that, I honestly don't care how faithfully Burton recreated the original book because what I saw on the screen was captivating, satisfying, and definitely enjoyable. The opening sequence, complemented perfectly by Elfman's quirky soundtrack, had me eager for the rest of the film.The acting was great, including Depp's quirky and original take on Wonka and Highmore's heartbreakingly pure Charlie. I loved the overall look of the film, including the beautifully bright and colorful, yet still sterile, semi-dark, and slightly off-kilter, factory.One major change that Burton made, which seems to be a point of contention for some, is the inclusion of a back story for Wonka which brings in Christopher Lee in a delightful cameo. While the flashbacks themselves could run a little long and make the action of the movie stutter a bit, I liked the overall story and how it influenced the eventual ending, which I thoroughly enjoyed.The only complaint I really have is the lack of dialogue on the part of the children while they're in the factory. There were a few nice bits of memorable banter, but I left wishing they had had more screen time. This is especially true for Veruca, who was nowhere near whiny or demanding enough for my taste.Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but wished there had been a little more to it. Still, I understand that it's difficult to pack so very much into a short span of time. While it may not be the richest treat, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a solid and delicious, if a bit small, piece of dark chocolate in a shiny and eye-catching wrapper.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Closer to the book but not as sweet as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.,"So much to live up to, Johnny normally shines in off beat rolls, but whether direction or personal choices let the Willy W character be far less sweet in this attempt.The use of CGI must have saved quite a lot of time and effort as well as $, and in my opinion brought something to it that the original had no access to, though the original used what was available to a far greater extent and wins hands down regardless.The actors were either better actors or better directed in the original.Found it far easier to get lost in the original.Certain scenes lacked the the brilliance brought to the original by Gene Wilder, especially when gene got spooky and intense.Watch them both, they are both enjoyable, but the 1971 offering still wins easily.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The props and sets are better than the original, but so they should be. Gene Wilder in the original film came across as an eccentric recluse, which was fine. This Tim Burton version went back into Willy Wonkers childhood, which I found confirmed the weirdness of the Willy Wonker/Johnny Depp part.

Appropriately deeper and darker; a more timely adaptation,"Watching the 70's film as an adult, I was struck by how much the story relies on adolescent naivety, and how an older perspective makes it more unglamorous. Charlie's impoverished family, his frail grandparents, the glorification of processed confectionary, and the presentation of excessive materialism, won by a random lottery, as a 'solution' to poverty.I think this version updates the story appropriately, with more mature, modern sensibilities. Gene Wilder called it a cash - grab, but Burton made it his own without a doubt. There's the quirky, idiosyncratic production design and cinematography he does so well, and Elfman's strange score is inventive, yet totally fits. I see why Depp's Wonka is divisive, but he is uniquely human here.Don't know if I prefer it over the 70's film, but I don't feel it's worse, and it makes a lot of sensible changes where the previous film felt dated (e.g. Removing some musical numbers, and altering the ending).",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

While it is true that I was born closer to Gene Wilder's film, I love Johnny Depp's film much better. I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD, and I am talking about its release already. If someone asked my opinion about whose film was better, I would say Johnny Depp. He is by far better than Wilder. I read a comment on a website from Wilder about Johnny Depp's film, and he was angry, and disappointed. He said:"" Why would anyone remake Willy Wonka? It's all about money"". I'm so sorry, but Gene Wilder has to lighten up.

"Can't say it was as good as the 1971 version, but it's not bad","Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the second adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The first one being David Wolper's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. This adaptation, unlike the 1971 version, is much darker and more true to the book.Like any Burton production, the visuals are stunning, weird, and just straight-up pleasant. In fact, this is probably Burton's sanest piece of work. It features a... moderately realistic scenario.Only one guy plays the several hundred Oompa Loompas: Deep Roy. He does a very good job on being the Oompa Loompas. The songs they sing are catchy, memorable, and certainly pleasant on the ear. Some changes from the book were made in this movie too: Mike Teavee is addicted to video games now. That's all I can tell.There are many flaws in this movie, I must say. I think the story and pictures are a little bit too dark for me. The characters aren't as likable as the 1971 version, and I think it was kinda dumb that Willy Wonka's back story is shown much more than Charlie's antics. Speaking of which, Charlie just isn't good in this movie. I'm sure Freddie Highmore does great acting skills, but this one he was just kind of flawed. Same has to the be said for Johnny Depp, who plays Willy Wonka. The Wonka character isn't as sweet or sarcastic as the 1971 version. Again, I'm sure he was like he is in this movie in the book, but I've never read the book. I can't say I found this movie to be bad, but it's just not as good as the 1971 classic. I'd still recommend it though. This was the first Wonka movie I saw. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Oh dear. Grating voices, characters lacking any warmth, over-CGI'd 'oompa-loompas', and a purposelessness to the story ... a loser of a film","Oh dear. Johnny Depp gives yet another reliable 'freak-of-nature' performance, totally over-played. His character lacks any humanity or kindness, meaning that there is no avuncular warmth to his character, nor any sensation of genuine humanity towards the children in the story. The whiny voice he chooses to give to Wonka's character is, again, unnecessary; and is so grating it merely serves to detract from what he says. This makes it difficult to concentrate on both the script and the plot of the film.The oompa-loompas are clearly CGI'd - for ease of multiplication - making them obviously fake to even the most naive viewer. This takes away any 'escape from reality' when watching this film. All suspension of disbelief goes out the window. The comical make-up for the same characters in the 1970s' film version seems flatteringly effortful, by comparison. The advancement of film technology and the generation of CGI should add to the overall quality & belief in a film, not detract from it.As the film progresses the plot changes to become more & more about Wonka's character, and less about the eponymous hero Charlie. I believe this could be blamed upon the director Tim Burton's obsession with Depp as his lead actor. Burton's continued assumption over the years that Depp can do no wrong in his interpretation of his characters gives the actor too free a reign. But - whether this is accurate or not - in this role the building up of Wonka's character and his part in the film merely takes away the importance of Charlie.The old version of this film was pure-'70s-kitsch - fun, but a bit OTT - but the new film takes weirdness to a new level: the movie finally comes across as existential nonsense. Who cares about the Wonka character's 'drive'? Wonka's feelings about his father and own life-story should not feature strongly, if at all, in Charlie's story. In children's stories the central character is and always should be the kid. Adults should only be peripheral to their life: an untold philosophy/rule of 'kids versus the adults' normally works best. This is lost in Burton's 'interpretation' of Dahl's story.Ironically, rather than belying the essence of each film, the title of each film version of this story is misleading: 'Wonka...' was all about Charlie, 'Charlie...' is all about Wonka!In both the original story in Dahl's book, and in the 1970s' Gene Wilder film version of this lovely children's tale, Charlie leads the story. Burton has simply removed the centrifugal force of the tale, with the effect that the plot spins out of control, loses power, and drifts into nothingness.What a loss to story-telling.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Good version too,"I just watched this after having seen the original a few times before I became a teen. I think I liked some of the special effects better in the original, because it kinda lended to the idea of things being fake. For some reason, a super CGI version of some of the scenes just doesn't cut it. I still like the way good wins out over bad. But I mostly gotta say I was impressed with Johnny Depp. The acting all is very good, with a few big names. But somehow Johnny really is able to become a totally different person in his roles. It's really quite amazing. Anyway, I guess this is still mostly a kid's movie, so I don't have a lot of insight in that area anymore.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nostalgic,"The best part of this film is simply the story and the nostalgia that comes from it. It's also a pretty fun and unique interpretation of the original that makes it different. With that said, it takes a little too much creative liberty and is just outright a little too weird and strange (Willy Wonka's character and the Oompa Loompas). Still worth the watch thought!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A GREAT movie for kids and adults alike.,"Who says that a movie can't be dark and still be for kids? Sure, the original may have sugar-coated things a bit more, but it was still just as dark and disturbing as this one was! And that's OK. Has anybody heard of the Brothers Grimm? They wrote fairy tales that were still ten times as dark as this movie, and they were for kids, and many of us read them when we were kids. Kids are savvier than we give them credit for, and honestly, I think that adults would be more put off by the disturbing imagery in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" than kids would. I saw this movie at a Friday afternoon matinée in a theater that was FULL of kids, and the reaction seemed pretty positive to me. (And as far as some of the ""hidden"" risqué jokes, I remember the same types of jokes in a lot of Disney movies from the late 80s and early 90s; it's a part of the kid's movie landscape now.) I thought it was an excellent movie, for adults or for kids. I also thought it had some touches that actually improved on the original; the set pieces were amazing, and there was more with the great glass elevator (like the book) than in the original movie, which I was pleased to see.I thought I'd go into this being bored until they got to the factory because that was how I felt about the original, but even the opening scenes with the Bucket family, and Grandpa Bucket's flashbacks to his time working at the factory, are wonderfully entertaining. The unusual imagery starts there, with the gigantic factory ""ten times as big as any other chocolate factory"", and Charlie's weird, funhouse-like shack and eccentric but loving family. I was most impressed with David Kelly as Grandpa Bucket, whose performance was all child-like wonder, and Helena Bonham-Carter and Noah Taylor were also good as Charlie's parents; and Freddie Highmore, who played Charlie, ought to have a decent career in front of him.Once they do get to the factory, though, things really take off. Johnny Depp puts in an excellent performance as Willy Wonka, not an impression of Gene Wilder AT ALL, but as usual, making the character his own. Without a doubt, he's the best thing about the movie, but the imagery is amazing too. It's exactly what you'd expect from a Tim Burton-made adaptation of the book; his trademark is all over everything, and the result is stunning. And the kids are great too, as are Deep Roy as every one of the Oompa Loompas, Missi Pyle as Violet's mother, David Kelly as Grandpa Bucket, and James Fox as Veruca Salt's father. From the start of the tour, the movie starts feeling like an acid trip, and the movie never lets go of that atmosphere. The result is amazing.The only slow parts, I think, are those dealing with Wonka's childhood (although Christopher Lee is good as his father, I just thought they were a little boring and wanted to get back to the factory when they were on) and the Oompa Loompas' musical numbers, which I didn't think had the charm of those in the original (actually, I thought the musical number with the puppets at the beginning of the tour was the best one in the movie). The ending is also just a bit overlong, but the whole package is so good that the pluses definitely outweigh the minuses. You'll enjoy this movie, especially if you're already a fan of Tim Burton's work, but also, I think, if you're a fan of the original movie or the book; however, even kids who have never been exposed to any of this will be entertained. It's often hilarious, always a visual treat, and has something to offer for everybody.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A deliciously dark fantasy with plenty of personality, although it doesn't match the book","Roald Dahl is a very good children's author, and his books are definitely recommended. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of his best, centring on a boy who's one of 5 children allowed a special tour of an amazing chocolate factory owned by an eccentric chocolate making genius. The original was not a film I particularly liked although I haven't seen it for many years. This is, overall, a good, solid adaptation which has plenty of flavour and personality. Tim Burton may not be the right choice to direct, but his amazing visuals, use of quirky surrealism and interesting colour palette make the film unique and fascinating, if overly dark at times. To sum up, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the cinematic representation of a visually appealing piece of dark chocolate. The child actors, especially Freddie Highmore, are actually good for once and it's an entertaining, unique screenplay as well. There's a mild emotional centre and the ending is reasonably uplifting. In general, the film brings the book to life is visually stunning and quirky fashion, and Roald Dahl would probably like this version more as it's closer to the book.There are flaws though. While the visuals are great, the film can feel fairly artificial and Burton avoids using too much CGI, but a lot of the film just doesn't look real. It brings Roald Dahl's dark humour to the screen, but at times it just feels a bit mean spirited. It's a bit too long as well, with an unnecessary epilogue which deviates from the source material as well as a dull flashback subplot which not even the great Christopher Lee can make interesting. The main let down is Johnny Depp's repulsive portrayal of Willy Wonka, which is creepy, off putting and completely over the top. The Oompa Loompas are quite entertaining, but Johnny Depp gives what might be his worst and most misguided performance. With the emphasis on visuals and dark humour, at times a sense of charm is lost. Also, it's possible Tim Burton, although a strong director overall, with his quirky visuals and darkness, just isn't quite the right choice to adapt the book. Still, this is a good film; not the best thing Burton has done but it's an entertaining family film with a dark and unique flavour of its own.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Amazing, Brilliant and life changing.","This movie goes straight to number 1 for my favourite movies. When it first came out I just saw it as another movie and I watched it thinking not much of it. I recently watched it again about 2 months ago and I must say, I have never been more impressed. No other director could have done it better than Tim. All his movies are amazing but this is the best by far. This movie is more like the book than the original and might I add that unlike most people I really cannot stand the original and I though Gene Wilder didn't do a good job at all. Willy Wonka in this film is the most interesting character ever, probably because his personality is so similar to mine. I love the choice of costume for him and I'm even going to my semi-formal as him. All the songs through out the movie were very well done and I loved the fact that Roald Dahl's lyrics were used. The song at the start (Main Titles) was the best song composed for a film that I've ever heard. A big well done to Danny Elfman. I thought all of the cast fitted their character perfectly. Deep Roy did an excellent job and I liked the fact that he played all of the oompa loompas. I really can't explain how much I loved this movie and how much it had effected my life because to be honest I am absolutely obsessed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not very good,"Let's be clear: this movie is not half as good as the original. The backstory for Charlie was deleted, while a clichéd backstory for Wonka was added. Wilder's Wonka was charming and magical, Depp's Wonka was creepy and mean. The original was a movie for adults dressed up as a movie for kids, this one is strictly for the kiddies. The oompa-loompas are played by an old man (can't figure out what they were thinking). The children were zero dimensional, most of their parents had little to say, the acting was one-note at best. The only actor in the film to give a good performance is Charlie, but the script gives him little to say.Yes, I am biased because I loved the original. If you've never seen the original this movie would be easier to like. But if you love the original you will not love this one. It's inferior in every category.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"'eye candy"" and nothing but....","There is something confusing about Tim Burton's films. When a filmmaker has a weakness, shouldn't he take it upon himself to fix and improve that weakness in their following projects? This is after all, what critics are for: to offer criticism about films and explain what works and what doesn't. Sometimes the director will be ignorant and shrug off the review with a ""screw you"" attitude and other times it may be a misunderstanding of the critics. ""No mister critic, I don't care so much about plot or characters and it's really about the visuals."" Is that Tim Burton's excuse? And if so, what's the point?Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a visually spectacular film but it's not enough to make a good film. The story is about Charlie Bucket but then its about Willy Wonka and we forget about Charlie. There's not one cut away of Charlie's reaction while being in the factory tour. The other child characters are obnoxious as Dahl intended them to be but they have no depth. They overreact on cue when it is time for them to fall into a trap and leave the others behind. There is no build up to their selfish frustrations. Its as if they see the moment where they wish to escape and die. The last twenty minutes of the film feel rushed and we have to think fast as to how Willy Wonka was so quickly welcomed by the Bucket family.Critics can see why Tim Burton chose to film this story. It centers on ""eye candy."" But eye candy is not interesting for a feature if there is not much else to care about. Its like having sex without love. We get dazzling images of chocolate dripping waterfalls and strange looking Oompa Loompa figures and irritating breaks of songs and dance. I especially did'nt care for the background imagery of Oprah Winfrey and Stanley Kubrick's film, 2001. These kinds of visual details ruin the imagination by reminding you what the real world is all about.There has only been one film where Tim Burton's use of storytelling and character development received critical success. That film was ""Ed Wood"". Ed Wood is the movie about the late B-movie director from the 50's who made his films from the heart without conforming to traditional narrative styles. The critics did not catch on with him and coincidentally critics have not caught on with Tim Burton' style. The film""Ed Wood"" is the only exception. One cannot help but see the irony in this.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Depiction of a Favourite Book!,"As a fan of the original 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' film, I wondered if I could enjoy this remake (especially when I saw the Oompa Loompas sans yellow faces and green hair!). And the childish trailers for the films hardly did it any favours in trying to entice audiences over eight. However, from the moment the film began, I knew that I was onto a winner.Tim Burton and John August have managed to create a film that brings in the best of the Roald Dahl book without rehashing the novel word-by-word. They are also not afraid to show that the book is not some sickly-sweet fairytale but a dark story of poverty, bratty children and adults who can be rather cruel and malicious when it suits them. It also retains the point that children are often what their parents raise them to be, whether they want to or not (ie, Veruca's parents spoil her so she grows to be a brat, Mike's parents are too soft on him so he rules the roost while Wonka's father deprived him harshly of goodies without explaining he was just trying to do what's best for his son so young Willy rebelled). Perhaps, with that in mind, this might not be a suitable film for very young or sensitive children who are used to a warmer world being depicted on-screen.While Johnny Depp couldn't quite capture the same maliciousness of Willy Wonka in a way that Gene Wilder was able to capture, his Michael Jackson-esquire performance was still rather creepy and disturbing. Depp also managed to depict a rapport between his character and young Charlie, played wonderfully by Freddie Highmore. There seemed to be a real brotherly relationship between the two (and it was interesting that the role of the big brother was taken by Charlie while the emotionally immature Wonka was cast as the little brother who needed to be taught the value of family over material possessions) that was lacking in the original film where Wonka didn't really connect with Charlie until the final few minutes of the film.The children in the film are all excellent, especially when one considers most of them are newcomers aged no older than twelve or so. Freddie Highmore was successful in bringing the mix of vulnerability and inner strength to Charlie making the audience truly empathise with the character and cheer him on. However, overall, the prize has to go to Julia Winter, who was perfect as the atrociously spoilt Veruca Salt, and Jordan Fry, who depicted a hideously annoying Mike Teevee.However, the film was not without its bad points. For one, the songs sang by the Oompa Loompas was inferior compared to the those in the original. Too much was done to 'jazz' them up and they ended up lacking the rhythm of the original songs that left the audience wanting to join in.But it's the Americanisms of the film that causes it to drop a few points in my mind. Yes, this was a film made by Hollywood but American children will not go into meltdown if the British references of the book were retained. Charlie is an English child yet this film has him referring to 'dollars' (very odd considering he is living in England) and 'vacations' instead of 'holidays'. And is there really a need to have the British characters to refer to the chocolate as 'candy'? It would have been a nicer touch if the American characters used American terms and the British characters used British terms. Instead, the use of Americanisms just left me feeling Hollywood was dumbing down in much the same way 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' was dumbed down in both novel and film version in deference to the American audience. Maybe Hollywood needs to remember that in a country where school pupils as young as eight are made to memorise the name of fifty states and capitals, American children are far more intelligent than they are obviously given credit for by film producers and book publishers.Having said that, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is an excellent film that I would recommend to everyone from families to more mature cinema-goers. It's story appeals to all age groups without resorting to gooey, nauseating scenes and there is something for fans of the book and original film as well as those who might never have heard of Charlie and Wonka before.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Dog dialogue eats expensive US movie again,"Burton & Co. get points for trying something new. They could have made a slicker version of the '71 film. It would have made money. Everyone must have been shown that film ten times and told ""Don't do that"", because the new one very carefully avoided any reference to that one.So they tried something different. The new subplots don't hurt the film and opening up the tour with flashbacks was a good idea. The Oompa trickery is cool, it was worth doing. The songs are OK, just not very memorable (a shame because the '71 version's will stick with you forever). No one seemed to understand what's funny quite as well as the underpaid kid who played VERUCA far over the top in '71 like a mini Margaret Hamilton. Of course, those who haven't seen the first version can easily rectify the mistake with a 1-euro trip to the local video rental joint.No actor could read any part in this film and make it work, and that's probably why the cutting is so quick. There isn't a line in this dog worth hearing. So once Burton's run through all his satirical set, costume, and makeup gags-- and you can only show Veruca's teeth twice before it gets stale, go and try that in front of a club audience-- he has nothing to do but say ""speed"" let the actors read what all those official producers vetted and hope the graphics kids and animal trainers come up with something. What they came up with is worth looking at, but it's all empty calories.Poor Johnny Depp. He worked hard. He came up with a good new idea for Wonka-- one that's intrinsically funny and also very clever (since the plastic surgery would have covered up Wonka's age). But he has to carry the movie-- in color tinting-- for two hours. And the poor guy is given nothing to read. The audience should come out of this movie laughing and saying ""Freaky-- but wasn't that funny when Wonka said...?"" Not with a confused ""If I think 'Art' is bad does that mean it's good?"" look.Can you really make a slick costly movie about a poor boy who defeats four slick costly monsters? Yes but you'd better make it funny. Since there's no SLUGWORTH to set up the wrong decisions by the 4 kids their big crime appears to be just being born to tacky parents. They spent huge $$$ to make a giant seahorse-- lifted from the Esther Williams 1944 BATHING BEAUTY, by the way-- and they can't afford a joke?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pay no attention to that man under the top hat...,"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" has always been one of my favorite readings this is how I started my review of the 1971 version, the one with Gene Wilder, and I feel like an obligation to say it again for the 2005 adaptation. I don't know if I'm the book's biggest fan, probably not, but as a kid who loved chocolate, great story with great characters, I devoured every chapter of ""Charlie"" as if they were made of cream-nut milk chocolate. So I think I can judge both movies' adaptations with all fairness, giving each one the credit it deserved.I'm not one of these movie purists who consider the 1971 version the better one on the sole basis that it is the first adaptation or dismiss the 2005 version because Johnny Depp's embodiment of Willy Wonka was leaning a bit too close to the psychopathic side and didn't have that zest of enchantment conveyed by ringmaster Gene Wilder. It is true though, whether it was intentional or not, Depp seemed to have channeled another similarly pale-faced figure of Pop Culture and the fact that he was concerned about children made it all the more creepy. But I think there is good and 'less good' material from each movie and Tim Burton, at least, had the merit to introduce the book to a new generation of little Mike-Teavees, baiting them with a wizardry that had nothing to envy on Willy Wonka's.The 1971 film was spectacular by the era's standards but there was nothing that could match the sophistication and artistry of the 2000's, when CGI was mastered enough not to be overused. Indeed, CGI only served for scenes that couldn't do without some electronic help, but the rest of the visuals are made of scale-model, meticulously designed set, and even real rivers of chocolate. I saw the film for the first time, I wasn't sure that I would love the characters or the story as much as I love the book, but I knew Tim Burton would push the envelope and delight our eyes. And he did, from the recreation of the Chocolate Factory to the creative impersonation of the Oompas Loompas with diminutive actor Deep Roy and even the contrasts between the first act set in town and all in gray and white with the bright colors of Wonka Land, had some ""Wizard of Oz"" vibes except for the Wizard, himself.So, for all its triumphant technology, there's one department where the film didn't live up people's expectation, and it's in the portrayal of Willy Wonka. Granted Wonka is not just the flashy guy with the top hat and the purple redingote, Roald Dahl painted him as a rather dark and mysterious character and the merit of Gene Wilder is that he played your typical cheerful master of ceremony, but that was only a cover and step by step, he unveiled some darker and more sarcastic sides of his personality sarcastic (didn't even inspire one of the most popular Internet memes?). Johnny Depp laid his cards too early and never felt like the kind of fellow who could 'understand' children, not in a creepy way anyway, he struck as a sadistic, sociopath man trying so hard to smile and cheer up his guests. Depp is a fine actor, he played his Wonka very well, but I don't think it was the right angle for the movie, especially when the other characters played their part perfectly.Indeed, I'm not sure I remember any other actors from the 1971 film, except Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson and the blonde-faced Charlie looked weird, but the real star was Wilder, to the point the film was titled after his character. For its own good, the 2005 movie didn't focus too much on Wonka, and one of the many delights was to enjoy the performances of the kids who played the bad ones. The gluttonous Augustus Gloop, Mike teavee with his mean-looking eyes, and the two girls (Julia Winter and AnnaSophia Robb) were perfect Viloet Beauregarde and Veruca Salt, mannerisms, costume design and attitudes with their parents. As for Charlie who's not the most colorful character but rather the pillar and quiet strength of the story, Fredddie Highmore is Charlie like I imagined him. David Kelly also plays an unforgettable Grandpa Joe, I only wish the film didn't overlook some interesting scenes, like their laughing reaction when they don't find the golden ticket, the scene was cut rather abruptly.It's very unsettling that the one role that should've been pivotal to the film's success was the worse, but like Ebert says; the film works despite Depp. A chocolate factory is supposed to be the place any child would love to go, but they'd think twice if they saw that weird dark stranger with the creepy smile. I'm surprised Tim Burton didn't try to adjust Depp's performance because there's something in Burton's work that make him the cinematic heir of Dahl. Both are men who preserved their childhood vision and knew children enough not to patronize them with cute or overly preachy material. They were men of thrills, of adventures and mystery, but there was a heart in their story. And ""Charlie"", more than chocolate, is a beautiful story about family and Burton magnificently recreated the loving atmosphere of the Bucket's nest, perhaps the richest family in town if you count love as wealth.And there's a statement about family in the little artistic license he takes by venturing into the backstory of Wonka and his Oedipal issues with his dentist of a father (played by Christopher Lee). But while it was a good idea on the paper, Depp's performance was too unpleasant to make us care for it once the tour was over. So it all comes down to the 1971 having Willy Wonka and 2005 the magic of the book and the casting. Which one I prefer? Well, like I said in the 1971 review the book, naturally.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Review of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.,"A wonderful family movie.The main character is a boy from a poor family, who on his birthday was able to afford to buy a chocolate bar and he turned up with extraordinary luck.Other main characters are spoiled children who do not know the value of money, are ill-bred, as expected, do not listen to their elders, their instructions or just advice.The film will always be relevant, it expends important life situations, values, current problems.

Wonderfully Delicious,"I'm a fan of Tim Burton, a fan of Johnny Depp and a fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp together. I'm also a since-I-was-six fan of the classic Willy Wonka movie starring Gene Wilder. I was concerned that, despite the great experiences served up by Burton/Depp collaborations in the past, this one might fall short on sentiment and long on sarcasm growing from twisted trees. I shouldn't have worried.This film is, as every Tim Burton film is, a visual feast that draws you into a world that seems a combination of the real and unreal. This is a far less sweetly musical telling of the story, but Danny Elfman's music is a perfect fit for Burton's quizzically malevolent vision. Johnny Depp delivers a performance that can only be described as subtle slapstick. His Willy Wonka is equally an eccentric genius and nervous innocent. Burton's direction removes a lot of doubt about Wonka's motivations, and makes it OK for us to love Charlie, both pity and admire Willy, and laugh guiltily at the four despicable brats who get what they richly deserve.The Oompa-Loompas are not orange, a little wackier, and don't have scary theme music. The interior of the chocolate factory is less fun house and more never-ending stainless fortress. Charlie's family is featured more, and you find yourself wishing you could crowd around that big bed with them. Smaller children (under 7 years old) may be frightened by the puppet show, the boat ride or Veruca's squirrel scene, and unimpressed by some of the more nuanced humor.The classic is more ""pure imagination,"" this one is more flaming puppets. The classic shows Willie Wonka working in his office, this one shows Willie Wonka discovering the Oompa-Loompas. It's quite unlike the prior film in it's look, tenor and musical treatment, but the overall theme of the good at heart winning out over the good for nothing is the same. It's wonderfully delicious.>> SPOILER ALERT <<There's no last temptation of Charlie in this film (he doesn't enter any forbidden rooms), so that means no last minute tongue-lashing from Willie Wonka at the end. Instead, we're taken along on an examination of Willy Wonka's life, and wonder if he will truly shun all notions of family and the outside world forever. This part is all Burton, not Roald Dahl, but is an interesting insight into what might have made Willie Wonka the way he was, and whether the one principal he rejected in order to create his perfect world must be ultimately embraced in order to enlarge it and make it better.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I was optimistic about going because the theater was far away, But after it was over I was glad I went. The movie was in my opinion better than the original. Tim Burton directing it made the movie good, but Johnny Depp made it even better. The movie was also great because it followed the book more than the Willi Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The Characters and Factory made it seem very much like a Rohl Doll which is why this one is a fun, wacky, and hilarious movie. If you see this movie I bet you'll be laughing the whole time. The timing of the movie was also nice because the movie was almost exactly 2 hours with previews an the beginnings of the credits.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"This movie is not for young children, even though it has a PG rating","(Synopsis) Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) has built the greatest and largest chocolate factory in the world. After some of his workers steal his secret recipes, Willy Wonka kicks his workers out and closes the doors. For 15 years, no one has seen any workers entering or leaving the factory, yet his chocolate candy is still being produced and shipped around the world. One day when Willy Wonka is getting his hair cut, he realizes that he is getting old, and he needs a successor. He comes up with a plan to open his factory and reveal his secrets to five lucky children, who find golden tickets inside Wonka chocolate bars. The golden tickets are sent around the world and soon 4 winners are announced. There is one ticket left, and Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) finds the last ticket. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) is going to accompany Charlie inside the factory where he once worked before it was closed. The five children with their parents and Grandpa Joe enter the factory and begin a tour of a lifetime. The factory is not like your standard factory, but a living factory with a chocolate waterfall and a river of chocolate that you can ride a boat down. The trees and grass are edible, and trained squirrels shell nuts for the chocolate bars. All the work is now being done by the Oompa-Loompas tribe, who work for cocoa beans. Four of the rotten children get to interact with some of Willy Wonka's fantastic inventions with unfortunate consequences which force them off the tour before it is completed. Charlie is the last child left, and Willy Wonka awards Charlie the greatest prize of all, the keys to the factory.(Comment) The film is not like the 1971 original with Gene Wilder as a gentle and nice person, but it follows the book where Willy Wonka is an eccentric and crazy person. Johnny Depp pulls out all the stops and sometimes goes overboard by being a little too freaky and creepy. By the end of the movie, we discover the reason for his being so strange. I didn't like the Hollywood and Rock and Roll musical numbers, performed by the Oompa-Loompas in this movie even though I liked their performance in the original. This movie has some dark and bizarre moments and is definitely not for young children, even though it has a PG rating. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 1:55, Rated PG)(7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Complete and utter disappointment,"Having watched this film in the cinema I can only say that it is a complete disappointment in comparison to the original one.There are far too many unnecessary special affects. Apart from Johnny Depp the acting is terrible especially the girl that acts Veruca Salt, she sound as though well rehearsed without giving any personality to the character. The fact that all Ompa Lumpa are the same person really gets up your nerves and the songs are atrocious.A very dim film, and having been a big fan of the book and the original film I can only say that it is a complete waste of time and money to see it.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Slick unease: Tim Burton's beautiful but nasty Roald Dahl remake,"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" may be disquieting but isn't as creepy as you'd think from the parallels people have drawn between Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson. Parallels there are, mind you. Willy is of feminine appearance, with wig-like straightened hair, sickly smile, and too-perfect, unnaturally pale face. He lives in a preserve that's Neverland-like, the chocolate factory he's done over to resemble a candy jungle. Big difference: he doesn't like little boys -- doesn't like children at all.If Tim Burton's Willy Wonka isn't quite Michael Jackson, who is he? For one thing, like Edward Scissorhands (in his first appearance he's got giant scissors in his hand) Willy's a remarkable misfit who can't relate to ordinary people. If you're feeling ordinary, this typically beautiful but strange motion picture from Tim Burton may arouse mixed feelings. Its initial sense of order and logic turns to unease when Depp's Wonka appears. After a while the whole elaborate spectacle wears out its welcome as its little initial core of warmth goes cold. Not so different from many a classic children's story, I guess, it's full of terror and random cruelty. And like so many of those, it sprints to a happily-ever-after finale that leaves our unease unresolved.Ostensibly the story celebrates a happy family and offers hope to victims of bad ones. Willy's a sad adult who can't pronounce the word ""parent"" but is saved at the end by regular dinners at Charlie's house -- becoming a partial member of the loving little household. Despite such poverty they've had to live on cabbage soup, Charlie chooses unhesitatingly to remain with mum, dad, and all four grandparents, who sleep together, the grandparents do, in one bed in the center of the little gingerbread house.Willy -- in flashbacks not in Dahl's story -- is seen with dentist father, made to wear a hideous cage on his head slightly exaggerating the orthodontic braces once actually used. Dentist dad forbids all sweets, and Willy becomes obsessed with them.Wonka's become a huge success in business by leaving home early, and it's an understatement to say he's a genius inventor. He works miracles. Adapting the children's tale, Burton deals only in superlatives. Everything is the best, the most, the most typical. The chocolate factory is the biggest in the world by a multiple of hundreds.The factory's been closed for twenty years but still mysteriously produces vast quantities of universally coveted sweets. What happened to all the townspeople left unemployed by the official closure? The movie doesn't tell, except that Charlie's grandfather is bravely poor, in his cozy bed. Five golden tickets are randomly planted to allow five children to visit the secret factory -- this, it turns out, is to find an heir -- or, as the joke is, a hair, because discovering one gray one during his biannual haircut made Willy realize he needs somebody to take over the factory when he grows old.The movie's based on the old-fashioned moralistic concept of good vs. bad character. Except for Charlie, each of the other children with golden tickets is dominated by an evil trait: gluttony, snobbery, ambition, or pride. Charlie alone is loving, modest -- and nice. Freddie Highmore of Neverland, who works with Johnny Depp again playing Charlie, has a sweet spontaneity that makes Charlie's goodness likable and real.The factory setup and the ranging of children types is marked by stereotyping and even racism, beginning with the fat orly-poly German family with their gluttonous son whose father runs a sausage shop, and continuing with the snobbish English people, the technology-mad Americans and the obsessive, competitive American females with the mother who pushes her daughter to win prizes in meaningless things. She's going for a Guinness record for longest time chewing the same piece of bubblegum. Strangest and most perverse of all, Willy Wonka has brought little creatures from a country where they adore coca to be his slave workforce -- the Oompa Loompas -- who're all clones of the same tiny Indian man (Deep Roy) -- a model of at-home outsourcing, perhaps. The conceit is as astonishing as it is weird. Burton has his nasty cake and eats it too, because the less likable children are done away with at first, and then brought back and allowed to leave the factory, if somewhat the worse for wear.There's a song and dance routine done by the Oompa Loompas at each of the bad children's moments of downfall and it's pointed out early on that this means Willy had everything planned. But he pretends his worker-entertainers are just good at improvisation. The very idea of such a thing in such an elaborately staged movie is a huge joke. Tim Burton is the most calculating of cinematic artists, and a master of high kitsch.Particularly disturbing is the way the spoiled child of James Fox's snobbish English nut factory owner (Julia Winter) is attacked by dozens of squirrels and she and Fox are thrown down a tube to be smothered in weeks-old rotting garbage. The chewing-gum girl's fate, being blown up into a huge ball and turned blue, and the technology boy's, being shrunk and then stretched wafer thin, or the German kid's, being jammed into a chocolate-filled tube, aren't really any nicer; in fact their damage is more permanent. Depp's pronounced American accent is a curious inconsistency. He did manage a good Scottish one for ""Neverland.""It's a happily incestuous crew. Depp has worked with Burton famously before, and Depp has worked with Freddie Highmore, and Helena Bonham Carter's a Burton regular who's back with Depp as his dead bride in Burton's coming delight, ""Corpse Bride,"" which will also feature Oompa Loompa Deep Roy.There's no doubt Tim Burton has a gift for the menace and unreality of children's literature, but ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" for all its miraculous perfection, is an indigestible confection.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Roald Dahl would be proud!,"Children's author Roald Dahl has written some of the most enjoyable and most memorable books of all time. Many of which have been made into motion pictures. Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, and currently in progress, under the direction of Wes Anderson, The Fantastic Mr. Fox. Probably one of his most famous stories is that of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This novel was made into Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory back in 1971. Now comes Tim Burton's attempt at recreating the classic story of how a poor little boy becomes one of the luckiest children in the whole world.In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Tim Burton has his friend Johnny Depp to play the role of Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder in the original, a man of mystery and imagination who operates one of the most successful candy companies in the world. After many long years of seclusion, Wonka has decided to open his gates once more. He has put five golden tickets into five chocolate bars to be sent around the globe. The five lucky winners will be given a grand tour of the enormous factory. One of the five will be given a prize that is unbelievable.A boy that lives near the factory by the name of Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) wishes so much to find a golden ticket. He and his family can barely afford to put food on the table. They too want Charlie to win a trip to meet Mr. Wonka. When all but one of the tickets have been discovered, Charlie's chances are looking grim. By chance he finds money on the street and buys a Wonka chocolate bar. All out of luck and his previous two attempts looming over him, he opens the bar to find the last golden ticket!The next day is the day of the tour. There he meets the other four winners: the portly Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the must-win Violet Beauregarde, and the malicious Mike Teavee. These five all seem self absorbed compared to the humble Charlie Bucket. These five are taken on a whimsical journey into imagination, adventure, and of course...chocolate.What this movie has that its predecessor didn't was more comparison to the story. The movie doesn't focus on the outside world's craving for the golden tickets. It focuses mainly on Charlie's view from the bottom trying to scrape his way to the top. Their is more of an in depth look into the past of Wonka and how his life is impacted by his father (Christopher Lee). But what this movie lacks is a little sanity! Depp is at times a little too zany, and the Oompa Loompa's song and dances get out of control. Although they might seem childish, these parts to the movie are actually good. The compliment the crazy atmosphere of the factory. The songs are quite well done. The score of the movie and music to the songs is done by none other than Tim Burton's music man, Danny Elfman. A magnificent display of wacky music with a combination of heartwarming melodies.Tim Burton's wacky style is ever present and his over the top display of color and direction are a plus. His creative way of telling a story is what keeps him at the top directors around. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was much better than anticipated. It's just like a chocolate bar; it is sweet, gets better with every bite, and leaves you satisfied...",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good effort,"As expected Tim Burton's visual presentation and Johnny Depp's performance are quite pleasing. The story and acting that take place outside the factory are top-notch and very entertaining. Unfortunately, the time spent in the factory is not quite up to par. Depp's speech pattern becomes reminiscent of ""The Church Lady"" from SNL. The visual props become second rate. The ride on the chocolate river features a boat that you might find in a child's cereal box. The candy meadow seems filled with green plastic strands. Overall, the movie's fun for those who are Wonka or Burton fans but clearly not the best movie that either could make. Cheers to Freddie Highmore starring as Charlie. He is superb in his role.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Unpopular opinion- this film beats the Gene Wilder version anyday,"A brilliant and imaginative reinvention of a classic tale- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (like the title) stays a lot more true to Roald Dahl's original source material and makes for a wonderfully wild and entertaining time. Growing up as a youngin- I felt deeply connected to Roald Dahl's imaginative and vibrant stories; having written such books a James and the Giant Peach, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Witches, Matilda and so many more- but no book ever meant more to me than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. When I saw the original film, wide-eyed and excited after reading the book a handful of times already, I felt an immense amount of disappointment and boredom. The original film's acting is dreadful, lacking of a consistent tone, broad and incredibly thin pacing, and all together just a very structurally unsound film. Thus I turned my child eyes to the work of Tim Burton with this film and immediately fell in love. It's such a beautiful adaptation from the source material, giving us the same songs used in the book, and staying incredibly accurate to the storytelling- with a few additions of course for the films runtime. All the films additions though, I really did enjoy, and provided a lot more heart to not only the film but also the character of Willy Wonka in general. The performances are all rather good, not a huge fan of the child actor playing Mike Teavee, but everyone else was perfectly cast and fun to watch- especially Johnny Depp's oddball character performance as the iconic character. The look and tone of the film exudes more of a dark energy, but I feel adds a lot to the wonder and whimsicalness of the story at hand. In the end, it may be an unpopular opinion, but I loved this film and would prefer it any day to the original adaptation.My Rating: 9.7/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Too bad.... Way too bad...,"What an utter disappointment. Great idea to remake this classic but after that they seemed to have ran out of good ideas. I really like Johnny Depp but his performance was disturbing at best. I never read the book but the musical seemed to understand the elements needed to carry a story. Gene Wilder knew how to portray this character as a bit of an eccentric and a lovable dreamer without you getting the creepy feeling. Depp seemed mentally disturbed and ready for a psychotic break (Michael Jackson influence can't be denied). Wilder's Wonka was disappointed in the character flaws in the children, Depp's Wonka seems to relish in their failures. The whole storyline with Dr. Wanka was a worthless endeavor. Too bad this movie will make millions before people realize how bad it is. The original (if I remember correctly) was not a box office success and has become a classic that has lasted and is beloved by new generations. This movie will be a box-office hit and will be forgotten six months after the DVD comes out. Sorry Johnny but you and Tim Burton blew this one big time.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Childhood memories this ain't,"When I was 8 years old, Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory was my favourite movie. I'd watch it every day if I could. I didn't see it again until recently (I'm now 22), but even before I watched it, I was humming along with the songs I suddenly remembered again, and I grinned almost the whole way through when I did watch it. That movie is still a part of my childhood. Unfortunately, I don't see any 8 year old now grinning at the memory of this one in 14 years.I know it's a new director, new script, new everything, and I expected it to be totally different, but it just did nothing for me. The factory is supposed to be a place of wonder and childhood dreams, but it looked more like the set of Nightmare Before Christmas done in sweets. Even in the novel there was a pause to look at something before each child left, but in this, it's just, go to a room, lose a kid, go to another room, lose another kid, until only one was left.The kids did what they could with their roles, and the grandparents were pretty good, but Willy Wonka was just a little TOO weird for my taste. He was supposed to be eccentric, not they kind of guy parents drag away from their kids when they offer them a sweet! That's nothing against Johnny Depp, because he's a good actor, I just didn't like his version of Willy Wonka.As for the Oompa Loompas, I wanted to shoot them every time they came on screen. It was well done, considering there was only one guy, but I couldn't stand them.Tim Burton added his own unmistakable style to a very odd novel, which many people would like, and I know why. The first movie was all sweetness and colour and charm, which some people hated, and Tim Burton's version certainly has none of that. For those, this will be a far better version, more faithful to the novel in some ways (I liked the inclusion of the scene where Charlie, Grandpa Joe and Willy Wonka see the others leave the factory), but for me, this was just not up to scratch.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A succulent piece (screen),"This movie is an adaptation from a famous tale for kids, which I didn't read. Then, it was already made into a feature, which I didn't see either. So, it was a total discovery for me and I am unable to tell which deserves to the previous works from what have been brought by Burton or Elfman.The title says it all, except than the visit is conducted by a ""Jackson""-ian figure, Willy Wonka (his relational problem with his father must be very close to the ""disorder"" of the famous singer).Maybe because I saw the Imax version, thus paying more attention to details, this movie is a wonderful melting-pot of the universe of Burton. Like all excellent filmmakers (Spielberg,), you got the feeling that Burton is driven by the same motives that he focus movie after movie.First, the attention paid to colors, to stylish props, his unique way of filming buildings and sets will give you the same good vibes you felt watching ""Beetlejuice, Batmans, Edward, Nightmare"".That's for the eyes, but Burton is a real artist, because he addresses also the consciousness. He has a hard teeth against the American middle class, which is shown here in cynic way. Not that he doesn't like these people, but I think he has to make a point against a certain void in their life.At least, the music of Elfman is excellent, as usual. This time, he hits in all styles: Big orchestra, chorus, songs, guitars.. At the second musical show, I was happy because it sounds like the good old days of Oingo Boingo. Thus, I was waited for the next shows with impatience.In conclusion, a very good movie for all the family",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Excellent production design, good Freddie Highmore but creepy Depp",This film is yet another triumph of production design for Tim Burton. His chocolate factory is a place of wonder. Clearly a lot of money was spent on the film. The story is adapted from Roald Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate factory' and is a reasonable watch. Johnny Depp plays Willie Wonka and the otherwise gifted actor appears a bit too quirky to pull off the role. He gives a creepy vibe of Michael Jackson! Freddie Highmore is very good as Charlie and his Dickensian lifestyle is interesting to watch. All the other kids are spoiled brats and are taught some choice lessons. The sly lyrics and catchy tunes are yet another highlight. Recommended.Overall 7/10,,Anonymous,Comedy
"taking it on its own terms, the film is good overall, some great things, some not so great","It's tempting as a critic to go straight for the easy route a compare/contrast the 1971 Mel Stuart adaptation of Roahl Dahl's classic book of children's fantasy, and the 2005 adaptation by Tim Burton. But I think it would be more beneficial for readers on this site to just discuss the film on its own terms, as best as possible. In the end, I found much of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to be successful, but with some flaws/personal quips.On the technical side of the film, it's near flawless- Tim Burton is, indeed, one of only several visionaries working in the mainstream Hollywood system (mostly, I'd guess, out of his movies grossing so much over the years). In the compositions he chooses, in utilizing Alex McDowell's wonderful production design, in giving many of the scenes colors (or lacking in them) to heighten the mood, he has a distinctive style that doesn't seem to loose its energy, even in the less momentous (or overly so) parts of the film. Adding to that is the instantly recognizable music score by Danny Elfman, and the atmosphere is set to a good stance to Dahl's original story.With the acting side, the performances from the children are faithful to the book's descriptions, in particular Freddie Highmore as Charlie, with a genuine good soul in a sea of spoiled and rotten kids (and parents). All of this is fine, and then comes Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. If Gene Wilder in the 1971 version made Wonka his own, so does Depp, which is at the least to his credit. At times he can be hysterically funny, in just the little physical actions and facial expressions. He fits the eccentric, slightly off-putting qualities of Wonka well, but at times he also seems a little uncomfortable in the role.The script by John August gives, un-like in the book where a reader had to fill in the gaps, a back-story of Wonka's childhood and how he became the way he is. But it tries to explain too much, while at the same time not explaining enough. Only towards the end of the film does Depp give Wonka another side to him, and what I was left with was seeing an actor portraying a complex character in what should have been a not-so complex story. While Chistopher Lee in these back-story scenes is dependable as always, it seems a little too much to put on the plate- Depp can play weird well, but he can also play sincere, and the film doesn't give him good room to do his work on one more than the other.Burton can get brilliant with some of his excesses of the bizarre, but this time it becomes a little much. The Oompa Loompas, the strange little people who populate Wonka's factory, working for their beloved cocoa beans, are all clones in this film (I'm not sure that was how it was in the book, which is fine), and give elaborate, over-the-top, impromptu musical numbers following each of the children's demises (i.e. Augustus Gloop loving chocolate too much, Violet with the gum, et all). It wasn't so much of the portrayal of the oompa loompas that I thought didn't work- I found the scenes involving the Oompa's back-story in the jungle to be very funny- but they tend to be strange just for the sake of it to the story, and the musical numbers are so over-the-top, so inexcusable (in a Monty Python sort of way, not necessarily a bad thing in that context), that it interferes with the rest of the story. The rest of the film is not a musical except for when they appear, which also gives the film a little inconsistency.So at heart, I was glad that Burton was able to give an interpretation (granted by Burton and the filmmaker's claims it's not a remake of the 71 film) of Dahl's novel that gives room for criticism, as opposed to some of the recent flood of Hollywood remakes and adaptations that make me feel almost indifferent to how bland and average it is. Whatever faults I did have with the film, be it with the script or some of the performances, the pros tended to outweigh the cons, and that a director's imagination, when let loose properly, can make for an entertaining time. Much like with Burton's first film twenty years ago, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, his films work delights in original ways on kids as well as adults.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not as good as the original...,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory/2005/**1/2Main Stars: Johnny Depp Freddie Highmore David Kelley Deep RoyIt wasn't a really good movie. Just because this movie follows the book by Roald Dahl more than the original movie (""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"") doesn't mean it is better. The movie was good at the beginning but it went a bit downhill when Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) appeared in the movie. There are a few reasons why I did and did not like this film; one of the reasons why I did not like this film was: Johnny Depp (Willy Wonka) had a very pale face and a very annoying voice in this movie. The reason why he wanted to be like this is because he intended to be like a kids' talk show host but some people predict he intended to be kind of like Michael Jackson in this movie. Even if he intended to be like Michael Jackson it would be weird anyway. Another reason is that the acting was not Oscar-caliber although Charlie (Freddie Highmore) and his Grandpa Joe (David Kelley) were good. The last reason is that this was the strangest and quirkiest movie I saw this year and I really can't explain how it was strange and quirky, it just was. The things I did like were the sets of the movie and Danny Elfman's musical score. It was also creative how the oompa-loompas' were played by the exact same person (Deep Roy). The story was kind of interesting, too. There were quite a few sets in this movie (the chocolate factory, the house, etc.) and they were all fantastic! There were a few comedy scenes but not many. In comparison, I'll have to say the original was better than this one. These are the reasons why I liked the original better than this one: Better acting (Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, for instance), more songs, better screenplay and it was overall delightful! Original movie directed by Mel Stuart. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" directed by Tim Burton.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprisingly good.,"Not the most exciting of films but it wasn't as boring as I was expecting it to be. I do think it was at risk of being a failure because the first version of Willy Wonka was pretty much famous. And trying to live up to that first version was a real challenge.But it was entertaining and fun to watch, a great example of a classic family movie. Johnny Depp as always played the role of Willy Wonka marvellously and added to the comedy of the film but also played the heart-warming moments really well.If you are looking for a film to watch with young people, I recommend this one. I wasn't blown away by the story lines and the character performances but I also wasn't too bored of it.I'm sure lots of movie fans will agree it is not as successful as the original film but it's a hit with the kids which is good to know.I applaud Johnny Depp for yet another great leading role. And also the actors who played the children made me laugh quite a lot, this movie will be sure to leave you feeling happier and it provides a nice break from the stresses of everyday life. Enjoy it and have a giggle. I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hidden sweets to be found,"Sometimes the sweetest things in your life are the things that are not so obvious. This lesson is ever so present in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which takes audiences on this amazingly crazy and dark journey of 5 golden ticket winners through the factory of Mr. Wonka. Through this journey each falls into a trap that was specifically set up for them by Mr. Wonka. While some may think that this journey and direction under Tim Burton is not fitting for a kid's movie, it portrays the story in a much better way than the original by providing stronger performances by actors and creating an emotional backstory that is unique to the movie. Compared to the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Burton overall provides the audience with more elements and layers to this classic story. First off we see him bring his passion for the bizarre, wacky plots, and unique over the top creations that he is known for. Burton sends audiences through a colorful, darker, and more thought provoking journey compared to the original. He takes from the original story we all familiar with and turns it upside down while adding the connection of Wonka's father and harnessing the acting techniques of Johnny Depp. Overall, compared to the original this new emotional connection creates more than a one dimensional Wonka that we see displayed by Wilder and makes him more humanistic and relatable for audiences. As we see throughout the movie we are provided with numerous flashbacks of Wonka's past and his relationship with father that adds to the character of Wonka and the importance of family to him and Charlie. These moments provide the audience with an emotional connection to Wonka as we see a different side of him besides what he displays as he gives the tour to the children. We also see this side of Wonka as he confronts his father and they come to the realization of the success of each and the connection they have been missing all these years. Truly Burton created more depth for not just the character of Wonka, but also the film by making family a central theme to all characters from the 4 other golden ticket winners, to Charlie, and finally Wonka. The most notable character that Burton helped to develop to be a sensation was Mr. Wonka, played none other than the talented and well known Johnny Depp.Depp brings down the house in this film and embodies Willy Wonka through his minor facial movements, overall actions, and demeanor. Depp takes over Wonka and uses his genius to create a character that is almost like a reality TV host for children as he takes them on this journey through his amazing factory Throughout the movie we see the strong acting choices Depp makes for his character with his varying levels of physicality, precise and on point facial movements, and constant changing of tone in voice. The best glimpses you get of Depp is once each child has fallen into his or her given ""trap"" that Wonka had planned for them as Depp reacts like he knows something is up, but at the same time hides the fact that he is trying to look for one sole heir of his factory. Not only can Depp do an amazing job playing the foolish chocolate maker, but he has a more emotional side due to the recreation that Burton has conjured up for him. Overall, Depp embodies a person with a strong sense of imagination and compassion for others. Due to the efforts that we see Depp display as well as the new elements by Burton the creation of the movie is a visual spectacle that delivers a hidden journey. The hidden elements are what makes the entire piece better. Just like in life those things that we don't expect and may seem hidden can bring us the most joy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enough of a disappointment to make Slugworth proud,This doesn't hold a candle to the 1971 original classic. Period. Yes the special effects are superior but beyond that it is instantly forgettable. Gene Wilder had a point that this movie had none other than a much needed cash cow for this summer's weaker box office. Johnny Depp is a good actor but this role was completely wrong for him. His choices of playing Wonka as clutzy and spaced out conflicts with the fact Willy Wonka is supposed to be a mastermind of the candy business. Then of course there is the fact Depp's Wonka looks like something out of a Marilyn Manson video no parent with even half of a brain would bring their kids near. Burton's added back story of Wonka's childhood was his standard fare of misunderstood artist who just wants to feel like he fits in the universe. The brilliance of Wilder's performance was the fact he played someone who came across as a nutcase but was in fact a misunderstood genius always a step ahead of everyone else. Then there's the Oompas and their musical numbers. Oy! Half the time it's almost impossible to understand their vocals and what they're singing. I think this movie proves the general movie going public has become as catatonic in the brain as Depp's portrayal in this film. The children and their parents in this film were equally as practically lifeless. No wonder Hollywood is having trouble right now. This is so much of an insult to the 1971 classic that it leaves you wondering what classic they'll ruin next to get an all age audience back into the theatres.,1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If you're a fan of the original...,"If you're a huge fan of the Gene Wilder version, you won't like this version. If you liked the book better than the Gene Wilder version, you'll like this version better. If your favorite part of the Gene wilder version was Gene Wilder's insane rant in the tunnel, This is the version for you.I suppose I might as well start by comparing the characters; (Yes I'm aware that some of the names are misspelled) VIOLET Bureuguard She's a it younger, but if anything even more of a spoiled bitch than she was in the original. Although her demise...ORGUSTUS GLOOP Pretty much the same as the original, except instead of Ludhiana's he's dressed like Pugsley.Mike Teavea Mike is an updated version of Mike Teavea. In the book he was obsessed with gangster TV shows and always had guns hanging all around him. In the original it was cowboys, but he still has a gun. In this version he's even more obsessed with violence. He's also a hacker and a video game freak. He also knows allot more about science than Wonka does but, as in all three versions, whenever Mike tries to correct him on something, Wonka accuses him of mumbling.Violet Bureuguard I thing the writer came across a small problem with the book; an obsession with bubblegum doesn't really tell you much about her. However, in all three version she's a Guinness world record holder. so the writer exaggerated that aspect of her. In this version she and her mother are obsessed with winning and competing.CHARLIE In all fantasy stories there's always one character who's job is to meet more interesting characters; Luke Skywalker, Frodo, Stanley Tweedle, etc. The funny thing is; in the gene Wilder version, Charlie said he didn't care much for chocolate. Therefore, why would he care about the ticket? This version is closer to the book, in that he's as obsessed with chocolate as Orgustus Gloop, but he's so poor that his family can only afford to give him chocolate once pr year.GRANDPA JOE Is much closer to the book in this version. He's always telling stories about Mr. William Wonka and he's been bedridden for decades until he sees the golden ticket and shoots out of bed (In the book I imagined this allot quicker, like a gunshots, but it's still way quicker than in the gene Wilder version) Right, this review is probably long enough as it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Short review of Tim Burton's return to form,"Thankfully Tim Burton has rebounded back with his retelling of Roald Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. A Burton-speciality, 'Charlie' is vivid, imaginative, childlike and slightly unerringly dark. It is brought to life by Johnny Depp's wonderful take on Willy Wonka, the slightly kooky chocolate factory owner who gives five children around the world the chance to win a visit to his mysterious chocolate factory. When the lavish production design fails to lift the story - there are slightly flat sections of the narrative - it's Depp's performance that carries the film, ultimately helping it surpass the 1974 Gene Wilder version by some distance. Truer to the source material than its earlier adaptation, you feel this is the version Dahl would have preferred: he was apparently known to truly detest children, a sentiment echoed by Depp as Wonka. Well worth repeat viewings, and kids will love the set design and the nut sorting room scene, which is the film's production highlight without doubt.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
this was not brilliant...,"I don't know how in the WORLD this film received 7.5 out of 10! This was such an insult to the original ""Willie Wonka"" that it should make Gene Wilder want to spit! The plot was ridiculous, the songs were lame, the script stunk, I mean I can't figure out what Burton was on when he threw this together. I know it made a lot at the box office because everyone anticipated that it would have been as excellent as the first, but to come to this website and see that it received this many votes, who in the world are you people? It was the worst 40 minutes of my life! 40 MINUTES BECAUSE I SPENT THE REST OF THE TIME FAST FORWARDING THROUGH THE THING! I am just truly embarrassed at how sad this film was and how very boring! When I think back to the 1970's version I remember being filled with happiness and contentment, what a beautiful tale, and how very entertaining! I mean everything about it! My cousin and I can still quote the entire film and still find it HILARIOUS! Then we have this present day flop where they duplicated the ugliest midget they could find OVER 1,000 times! Talk about saving money! I realize Johnny Depp has only been in about 3 good movies in his whole career, I should have remembered that before I rented this film!

Maybe my 2nd favorite Depp movie! (next to POTC),"I went to this movie thinking I'd just be logging in another in my list of Depp movies. I disliked the 1971 version so much; I was almost dreading this one. Nevertheless I went, as all good Depp fans would, knowing that at least Johnny's performance would be great as usual.I was pleasantly surprised! This film definitely exceeded my expectations! Now I can finally say that I DO like the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! This movie was excellent. The story was much better than in the first movie. The music was great (Danny Elfman always does a good job). The scenery wonderful! And the actors... what an improvement!For me it was no surprise that the best part would be Johnny Depp's WONKA! He was amazing. There is nothing this actor can't do!!! Almost single-handedly he transformed a story that I could not stand (the 1971 version) into what just might be my second favorite movie (second to Pirates of the Caribbean).Thank you Johnny!

"Sensually Stimulating, Cerebally Deadening","Like most of Burton's work, 99.98% of the energy here and Id imagine budget went straight to set design and costume, and the perfect camera-work to get it juuust right. I admit that Tim Burton has made a couple of films that I count among my favorites. When it works, its pretty damn amazing. But as we are reminded in Charlie, more often then not, it doesn't work. To be fair, I cant really knock the visual impact this film delivers. And if that alone sates your movie-going appetite, you will love Charlie. If you are like me however, and expect more for your 11 quid than 5 music videos linked by an insipid narrative with hollow characterizations, Charlie is quite likely to make you once again involuntarily utter, 'man there's a lot of bad movies out there these days.'Tim Burton presents Charlie and the Chocolates Factory and ostensibly seeks to pull off not just a remake, but a re-telling more in line with the actual Roald Dahl's children's classic. What was wrong with the Gene Wilder film? Good question. Again visually its the bomb-digger, you cant argue with it. Plotwise, for the most part, ain't bad. So whats the problem you ask? The film doesn't play, at all!! The characters especially the main characters other than Wonka and perhaps Charlie, have about as much flesh on them as the Corpse Bride and muster zero sympathy. The film wows your senses and even delights you with the song and dance numbers, the only real achievement of the film in my estimation, but does a very poor job in storytelling. Very poor. The emotional impact that touched all of my generation, is nowhere to be found in the remake. We get this quandary a lot now with these remakes that are so technically superior to their predecessor, that you feel stupid not calling them an improvement on the original. As far as the Charlie comparison is concerned, the remake's only attribute is that it helps make the original shine even more brilliantly. Which sadly brings me to my final observation. This film has the distinction of showcasing Johhny Depp in what might be his worst characterization of his great career. Depps Wonka looks for all the world like a Technicolor incarnation of the fiend in the lost silent classic, London After Midnight. He 'acts' like the alleged fiend known as pop star Michael Jackson, and sounds exactly like Dustin Hoffman's Tootsie!!!! Put a hatchet in his hand, and you'd have the makings of a good Hammer film. Doesn't exactly work or belong here, Sheila.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bad casting choice...Depp,"Let me open with this disclaimer: I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, I think he is a great actor in almost every role he has ever played.That being said, Burton made a huge mistake in casting his friend Depp in this role. The only way this character could have been worse was if it was played by one of the other Wonka hopefuls, Marilyn Manson...So speaking of Wonka hopefuls, why wasn't Jim Carrey chosen for the role of Wonka?!?! He has the perfect mix of wackiness with creepy undertones (think cable guy; me, myself, and Irene) that Burton should have been shooting for, which is what Dahl intended in the original book (fun and likable with a hint of danger). Depp/Burton turned the character into a completely freaky unlikeable weirdo that cringed when he came near children and made weird sexual allusions. Not to mention the whole bizarre ""daddy"" and anti-family fixation. I will spare you yet another M. Jackson parallel thesis, but SERIOUSLY! I can't imagine that Carrey commands much more of a salary than Depp so what gives?!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My View Of The Movie,"My view of the movie is not all that bad, I did enjoy the movie more then I thought I might, Johnny Depp to me does it again bringing more of the original character from the book to life more then what Gene Wilder did, however this doesn't mean that Gene didn't do a great job, it just means that they are two different people with different ideas.The movie did a great job keeping kids attention focused on the film, my five year old was seen dancing while the Oompa Loompa's took the stage and she never really noticed that it was the same actor. From the time that the movie starts to the end the five year old was pretty much into the movie.The movie moved along rather quickly, and the story line was not at all dull, and at times very funny. Even though I give this movie a ""Six"" this is a movie that I will buy on DVD when it comes out, if not for me, it will be for the kids. Over all I thought the movie was good.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Holy Buckets!  A Magical Mystery Tour!,"Tim Burton's imagination produces, once again, images that are mesmerizing.Charlie & the Chocolate Factory is a multi-layered confection that serves simultaneously as an allegorical story for children and a pop culture cornucopia for adults.The first part of the movie concerns Charlie Buckets, a poor boy who is rich in familial love. He is one of five children who find golden tickets in their Wonka chocolate bars, allowing them to tour the Wonka factory. The other four are poster children for Spoiled Brat Syndrome.When the gates to the factory open to start the tour, it marks the second part of the film, much as Dorothy's entrance into Munchkinland. After that, the cultural references fly as fast as a glass elevator.Mr. Wonka, as played by Johnny Depp, is part Mr. Rogers, part Carol Channing, with just a smidge of Church Lady. But it's the factory--and its processes--that are the star of the film.Note the references to Shrek, Monty Python, Dr. Seuss, Busby Berkeley, Gulliver's Travels, Hair, Psycho, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Prince, The Beatles, Kiss, The Fly, The Beach Boys, and so much more. Much of it has a sixties-inspired Beatlesque style--an acid trip of psychedelic images. The actual story becomes secondary to the film's sensory stimulation. It's a visual and aural feast that is delightful. The special effects are seamless, the music inspired.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Equal to the original classic?,"Johnny Depp is brilliant in this more digital than expected film by Tim Burton. I would say that Depp is the reason that i left the theater feeling good about the movie. His character is nothing like a pirate, a river rat, or opium addict. He changes his voice, and has makeup all over him that wonderfully distort his face, o so slightly.The movie, as an art piece, is intriguing. It is not as innovative as Citizen Kane or as bizarrely real as the original Batman, but Burton does some wonderfully subtle things. All of the characters who wear glasses are shot in a way so that the glasses make their eyes just a bit bigger. And I think that those subtle things best show Burton's creative, animated side.But the movie was still lacking in a two areas for me. The sets were too digital for me. I have seen the original Batman so I know that Burton has the ability to distort without using a computer, so I was sad to see all the digital sets. The second issue was the child acting. With the exception of Charlie (Peter from Finding Neverland), the rest of the actors and actresses were just average, and Mike Teevee's character is a disaster.But all in all this movie is solid, and maybe even excellent when considering that it is a kids movie. The movie is more humorous than the first movie, but it will depend on your devotion to Gene Wilder to decide if you like this one or the original movie. I would sum up the movie by saying that it is as good as a modern day PG movie gets.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A criminal attempt to improve upon the legacy of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"To be honest I was rather sceptical of the decision to remake such a classic film that has influenced the lives of so many. No-one could ever replace Gene Wilder's embodiment of Willy Wonka and sadly I feel that Johnny Depp failed to.Depp's characterisation of Wonka seems to be a blend of a Jim Carrey style slapstick caricature mixed with Michael Jackson's 'the child that never grew up' sad underlying personality defects. If this was what the Director was aiming for, Carey would have been far better suited to the role.The Oompa Loompa tunes and lyrics are an integral part of our culture  how dare they be tampered with! Frankly I think that, other than the technological improvements in terms of production, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory adds nothing the films legacy. An entire generation of youngsters will grow up without ""living in happiness too, like the oompa loompa doopady doo."" It is worth seeing simply to appreciate the fine work achieved in the original.

"It surprised me, being a fan of the original","I have been a fan of the movie ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" for many years now. I have also taken great pleasure in reading the novel by Roald Dahl. After seeing previews for this film, I had doubts that a remake like this would work for me. I thought I would love the original too much to like anything about this film. Nevertheless, I was wrong about ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" I was uncertain about Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka, not sure he had the right potential for this particular character. Depp actually played the role superbly, creating a character so over-the-top and zany that I'm sure Roald Dahl would have been pleased. Freddie Highmore plays Charlie very well also, coming across as the innocent, poor boy made manifest by the book as well as the original movie. AnnaSophia Robb also stands out to me as Violet Beauverguard. This version also restored some sections of the book not made into film in the original version, such as the story of how Willy Wonka found his Oompa-Loompas and building a chocolate castle for a rich prince. Also, this film adds a great new story that is both touching and fascinating, the story of Willy Wonka's dad (Christopher Lee), the dentist who drove him to rebel and create a chocolate factory. This is actually my favorite section of this movie. Not a perfect movie, as the original was for me. I miss many of the original songs such as ""Pure Imagination"" from that film. Nevertheless, this film did not try to copy that one but rather relied on the novel. If you're uncertain about this remake, take it from a fan of the original: this one is worth seeing.*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Could have been great....but,","So, I got up early this morning. SUPER Excited to see what Tim Burton did with my favorite movie of all time.....""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Which opened today, or yesterday...whatever. I'm almost too depressed to type. Seriously.....I want to cry. No Snozzberries, no ""Cheer up Charlie"" no ""Pure Imagination"". No ""Golden Ticket song"" Nothing' at all. It was PRETTY WEAK. The infamous Boat Scene was written simply as a class 3 whitewater (brownwater) ride, no psychedelic freakout, which I was greatly hoping to see, what with all Mr. Burton's knack for being creepy. The Oompa loompas...turned into little digital disco monkeys in shiny suits. THEY WEREN'T EVEN ORANGE!!! As simple as the Oompa-Loompa songs in the original were, THEY WERE GREAT! The writing for the songs in this film was flat-out awful. The song sequences were WAY overdone, I got chills and goosebumps...because I was embarrassed for whomever wrote the songs. In fact, the writing of the entire script was shallow, unmysterious, unfunny, and just plain bad. Johnny Depp was frail as Wonka. A paper-thin wafer of what the character could have, and should have been. All of the characters were weak, except Grampa Joe. Grampa Joe was cool. The cinematography was, as expected, excellent. The film was visually appealing. I had no doubt that it wouldn't be. But that was all shot down the big chocolate chute by the lacklustre script. I knew as soon as I realized there was no ""Fizzy Lifting Drink"" drink scene, that the ending would suck too. And it did. Well, I'm gonna go shoot myself in the face. I hope you're happy Mr. Depp.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Begins wonderfully...but the fun dissipates inside the factory, and Depp is a disappointment","Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, previously filmed with music in 1971 as ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", opens with great promise, featuring incredible art direction that mixes German Expressionism with Grimm-like fantasy (aided by Danny Elfman's atmospheric, if familiar, score). Charlie Bucket, a child of little privilege who lives with his family in a lopsided house, longs to be one of five lucky worldwide recipients of a prized Golden Ticket, an invitation to tour the candy factory of reclusive genius Willy Wonka. Burton mounts the excitement of the treasure hunt, with the tickets hidden in Wonka candy bars, with gleeful aplomb, and the satire--though a bit heavy-handed--is both trendy and amusing. Once the action moves to Wonka's foreboding factory however, and Johnny Depp takes center stage as Wonka (a would-be misplaced child of the sixties), interest wanes. All the kids and parents are well-cast, particularly Freddie Highmore as Charlie and David Kelly as his Grandpa Joe, but the computer-generated effects turn Wonka's landscape into an impenetrable den of ugly colors and outsized objects (like moving wallpaper). Burton, who expressed nothing but contempt for the previous version, does borrow pieces from that film, improving upon some areas (such as Veruca Salt's exit, with squirrels instead of geese) but falling far short on others (when Grandpa Joe and Charlie secretly unwrap a Wonka bar at night and come up empty, there's no camaraderie between the two, and no embracing of the familial theme). The musical Oompa-Loompas are a dreadful come-down from the predecessor, with songs sung in different musical styles and Burton staging each like a music video (these sequences, too, steal from the first film, yet the Oompa's message ultimately gets lost in the silliness). Depp performs with too much grotesque caricature; sure, his Wonka is out of step with the world, but his sarcasm is too modern, and is geared to get easy laughs from the audience. Screenwriter John August is more out of touch than Wonka; using nasty put-downs to separate Charlie from the other kids is a facile and lazy way of telegraphing us that these children are bad examples, and the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood (as well as a visual history of the Oompa-Loompas) does absolutely nothing but chew up time on the clock. We first see Wonka himself in a flashback based on a story from Grandpa Joe (didn't Charlie know that his grandfather once worked for Willy Wonka?), making Wonka's official entrance several minutes later a non-event. This story is difficult to film without getting gummy or preachy, but Burton was on the right track with his opening sequences. Too bad the second-half is so misbegotten (and not even ambitious, really) that all the mystery drains away like melted chocolate. *1/2 from ****",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
We enjoyed it!,"The trouble with ""remakes"" is that it inevitably brings comparisons with the previous version rather than the film being allowed to stand on its own merits. However, I took two 11yr old boys to see Charlie & The Chocolate Factory today, and they both came out saying they thought it was great, and definitely wanted to see it again and want it when it comes out on DVD. From them, that's top praise. For me, a film is entertainment and escapism, and I think both are achieved in this movie as far as that goes.I thought Depp played the role of Wonka really well, and seemed to capture far more of the weirder essence present in Dahl's character, than his predecessor (Gene Wilder). The kids were as I expected, irritating just as they are in the books. Great copy of characterisation from the book! And young Freddie Highmore also seemed to produce the wholesome good boy, beloved of his family, as characterised in the Dahl novel, although what the movie didn't manage to reproduce, was the closeness of Charlie's relationship with ""Grandpa Joe"", which was a shame because it is such an essential ingredient of the original story.My only real criticism was where the makers chose to take a divert from the book with the invention of Wonka's past. I felt it was totally unnecessary, and feel that they could have used that time more wisely, to develop Charlie and Grandpa Joe's relationship, and given them a bit more talk time as they toured the factory, rather than have them, more observers, at times, than central participants. And by the way, great to see David Kelly (Grandpa Joe) on the big screen, I remember him as ""Alfred"" all those years ago in Robin's Nest!!! Overall, I'd say Tim Burton did a great job and my young critics tell me they think it deserves an 8/10 rating well kids can't be wrong, can they?!!!",,Anonymous,Comedy
Burton cooks up a winner,"I was never doubtful of Burton's capability to pull together this movie. The book's satirical and playful twistedness fits right into Burton's M.O. It is quite evident that Burton had a vision is his mind for this film and for the most part he delivers a fun and satisfying film that serves for great escapism, even though we have seen most of the content before in the original.While we've heard the story before and know exactly what happens to each character, it is still fun to get a tour of Wonka's factory through Burton's vision. The set crew has crafted some visually astounding sets from the Bucket's home to the colorful factory. Scenes that we will recall from the original, such as the boat ride, are more fun and exciting to watch. The original was very solemn, but here things are pretty fast paced.With the exception of Depp playing Wonka, all the actors/actresses are duplicating the roles of the characters in the original. Each child plays up their signature bad character trait and Freddie Highmore is perfect as Charlie. Helena Bonham Carter is always a delight in Burton's films and does well here as Charlie's mother. It is Depp's performance that is significantly different from his counterpart. I consider Depp to be one of the best character actors in Hollywood at this time. He adapts well and commits to his characters. However, I found his Wonka at times a bit off. Depp opted to go for the same sarcastic oddity we found with Wilder's Wonka, but he also decided to be more childish and ""punky"" for a lack of better terms. His character is humorous for a bit, but the act gets old after a while. Nevertheless, it by no means ruins the movie and some people will probably really like the character.Thankfully, the lamentful singing is replaced by the eccentric Oompa Loompa musical numbers. Each number is different and completely funny to watch.Lastly, what is also fun about this film is that you can see glimpses of Burton's other films on display here. The opening credits, which consist of a tour through Wonka's odd chocolate bar assembly line reminded me a lot of the cookie maker machine in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Also, the Bucket's house looks like it was directly lifted out of BIG FISH with its odd slant. Just a few things Burton added in to bring together his style.In the end, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY's plot is reused from the original, but what else did you expect. A few things have been changed to follow more closely to the book. While Depp's performance is somewhat off, it certainly is not disastrous to the film in any way. The film is fun, colorful and entertaining. I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Plus ghostly(fair skinned): I guess from hardly ever leaving the factory. The stories the same with the finding of the golden tickets. The oomp a loomphas are different and they sing these cute songs every time one of the kids has to go. The boat ride on the chocolate river was different. It was neat.

Who and the Chocolate Factory?,"This movie was supposedly meant to follow Roald Dahl classic children's book? I'm not sure what book they're following, but there's stuff in this film that would make poor Mr. Dahl gag on an Everlasting Gobstopper.This is easily the weakest work for both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. Burton simply has no concept of the joyous celebration and positive message of the original manuscript. Instead, he delivers a mean spirited and misguided interpretation that is needlessly grim and depressing. Depp appears to be concocting a character which is a grotesque montage of The Wicked Witch of the West, Michael Jackson, and Carrot Top. He always has some psychotic expression on his face which distracts you from the main story. The Oompa Loompas (really one guy multiplied by awful CGI) are sinister looking, and their songs stink. The children vary from boring to annoying.As if this isn't bad enough, the script includes ugly back stories about Wonka that add nothing, disrupt the flow of the story, and transform a character originally written as well-intentioned but cautiously secretive into a vile, selfish, brutal freak of nature devoid of any redeeming qualities at all. The tacked on sequence about Wonka's family problems is just excruciatingly painful to sit through. A definite misfire on this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Incredible,One of the best Tim Burton films in my opinion and very nostalgic,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A psychedelic roller coaster. Burton delivers. As usual.,"Given that Tim Burton's previous remake ""Planet of the Apes"" is seen by many as his worst film and also, given that both Dahl's novel and the 1971 adaptation are seen as classics, he was really touching sacred territory when he started work on this project. So initially, I was a little sceptical about this film. But never the less, I put my faith in Burton's skill as a director and bought a ticket.The combination of Dahl's uniquely dark writing style and Burton's equally unique dark visual style is a match made in heaven. Dahl always had the knack of being to communicate rather adult and mature ideas to a child audience without having to talk down to them and in a similar sense, Burton's view of the world often communicates to the child with in all of us. Be it the fear of the Headless Horseman in Sleepy Hollow, the child like innocence of Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood's almost child like desire to please his audience or Bruce Wayne's pent up anger and sadness at witnessing the murder of his parents when he was a child in Batman.First of all, do not compare this to the 1971 film. Any ideas of comparison between the two are totally pointless; this film really is a different kettle of fish entirely. Where as the earlier version put it's own spin on the bulk of the novel, this film owes itself purely to Dahl's vision, Burton's vision and Depp's masterful interpretation of Wonka's character. In this film we see a Wonka who, not only does not like children, but has some sort of phobia or mental condition where the idea of the family unit and parental love sends him into convulsions of sickness and nausea, stemming from his rather dysfunctional upbringing by a fascist father (brilliantly played by Christopher Lee). Does this adequately explain Depp's child like, performance? Absolutely. Does this make his character a little unsettling? Definitely. But this only adds to the mystique of his character, who in order to do the things he has done must be more than a little insane! That is the only aspect of the film where Burton hasn't remained true to the source material; every where else he has remained true to Dahl's story. Other characters have been changed slightly (Mike TV is obsessed with the video games instead of TV), but are still totally recognisable as the characters in the book. The film definitely benefits from the inclusion of Charlie's father (something the '71 version failed to do), giving the sense of a family who, although extremely poor have a strong family bond which makes them richer than all the other spoilt and rude children in the film. Charlie's character perfectly epitomises childlike innocence with Freddie Highmore giving an impressive performance for such a young actor. And you will believe that Grandpa Jo's (superbly portrayed by David Kelly) bedside tales of the miracles of Wonka's chocolate are what captivates Charlie's imagination.You really do get the sense with this film that it was a labour of love for Burton. He has created a cinematic world that perfectly complements Dahl's literary world with every frame dripping with colour and magic. Put simply: fans of Tim Burton and Roald Dahl will love this film",,Anonymous,Comedy

As much as I found Depp's performance to be silly, I enjoyed Freddie Highmore's as Charlie. It's not a role that needed a particularly good actor, just one that seems likable, and Highmore pulled it off quite well.

Freddie Highmore does deliver quite well though as the eponymous ""Charlie"" who finds the elusive golden ticket and travels with his mischievous ""Grandpa Joe"" (David Kelly) to the factory where all of the delicious sweets are made. It's maybe best from here on in to discard your views of the 1971 version and look at this is a completely different re-imagining of the Roald Dahl story. We've already been introduced to his rather odious co-winners who exemplify all that's ghastly about precocious children spoiled and over-indulged by parents who either don't care, won't care - or want to live their lives vicariously through the would-be successes of their brats. Julia Winter probably taks the cake as the truly obnoxious ""Veruca Salt"" but Jordan Fry's ""Mike Teevee"" isn't too far behind. With Depp putting his heart and soul into his character, we incorporate some of Danny Elfman's more entertaining music into a journey of self discovery and millions of calories. It's a quickly paced, lively, enterprise with Tim Burton bringing his technicolour imagination alive for almost two hours. The most engaging effort has to come from Deep Roy who just oozes cheeky charisma as the Oompa-Loompa (well, quite a few of them) who does all the heavy lifting while the guy in the purple velvet takes the credit. It's enjoyable enough, just lacking in that something special.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprisingly Bad,"All I can say that there can be no human alive who could possibly like this version over the original version with Gene Wilder. I actually liked the movie up until Johnny Depp appeared. From there on, it was terrible and I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. I don't know what Tim Burton/Johhny Depp were thinking. First, Willy Wonka shouldn't look like he is a 30 year old transvestite. Charlie's grandfather worked for Willy Wonka decades ago, so he should look somewhat middle aged. Next, Willy Wonka is supposed to be a genius. Johnny Depp plays him like a stupid eight year old kid. I don't believe for a second he is some kind of genius. Johnny Depp is neither a likable or funny character. He is just weird. Very few funny moments. Gene Wilder's performance, on the other hand, is fantastic. He captures oddness, with humor and intelligence. The Oompa Loompas songs were simply unbearable....just awful. The rest of the cast was actually good. All the children were pretty well played. I didn't like the parents much especially compared to the original version. Veruca's dad in the first movie was much more effective. Charlie and his family were well cast, especially Charlie.All in all...very disappointing. It's a poor interpretation of the book and a disgrace compared to the first movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Where are we?,"Being a fan of the book and original film I had high hopes for Tim Burton's stab at this fabulous tale. All praise to Johnny Depp for his magnificent performance- funny, quirky and charismatic. Unfortunately I cannot truthfully continue with praise for the rest of the film. Most disappointing of all were the Oompah-Loompahs. After the genius of Nightmare Before Christmas and Mars Attcks I suppose I was expecting something a bit more special from Burton and felt let down by what I felt in comparison was a lack of imagination. Also in the original the Oompah-Loompahs despite being lovable were also just a little bit sinister which I felt was lacking in this version and the film was poorer for it.Also can anyone please explain to me where they were? America? England? I appreciate the film is children's fantasy but it did seem very odd and a bit confusing at times, for example Charlie and his family were English yet used dollars as the local currency! Overall I would say this film is worth watching but try not to have too high expectations because I did and left the cinema extremely let down and pining for the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sucked!!!!,"I don't even know where to begin with how disappointed I was with this movie. Having grown up with the incredibly talented Gene Wilder as ""Willy Wonka,"" I expected my view to be tainted, but I tried to watch this film with an open mind. Nice try. Johnny Depp, who has made some wonderful movies in his own right, cannot hold a candle to Gene Wilder in this role. Whereas Wilder played Wonka as mysterious, a bit mischievous, but good-hearted, Depp played him like he had just done a serious amount of cocaine. His dislike for the children was overplayed and I was waiting for him to beat the crap out of them at any moment. Wilder's performance was more subtle and sarcastic. Depp's June Allyson hairstyle did nothing for me either. Whereas ""Willy Wonka..."" was made years before all this computer graphics crap, it seemed more real. ""Charlie..."" seemed like a film student's graduate project. Bottom line: ""Willy Wonka..."" is for adults. ""Charlie..."" is for children with a low I.Q. Some movies just don't need to be remade; in fact most don't. Look at ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Yours, Mine, and Ours."" The people who made these movies took classic comedy and turned them into fart jokes and basic toilet humor. Doesn't anyone in Hollywood have an original idea? Or has America lost its integrity when it comes to movies? The best movies being made these days are independent films. What does that tell you?",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Master of Dark Comedy Dahl collides with Twisted and Macabre Burton,"My first thought when I heard that Burton was going to be doing this film was that we were looking at a match made in heaven. The master of Dark Comedy Dahl and the twisted and macabre Burton collide on the screen with wonderful effects. Aside from a few weak moments here and there this film is wonderful. It has a style and a flair that is distinctly Burton, but remains true to the unique vision of Dahl. Comparisions between this and the other version are pointless. Each needs to stand on its own merits.Johnny Depp's performance is not what I would have imagined for the candymaker, but he does a creditable job none the less. His co-stars are well cast, and I would like to see more of David Morris' work. It's hard to believe that he only began professional acting at age 79.While I will always treasure the original film I can give credit where credit is due. I think that Burton should consider the idea of reviewing the collected works of Dahl for other possible films. I can't imagine that another filmmaker would do it better,",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
See on the Big Screen for The Delightful Sights and Sounds,"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a visual and aural delight, even with the worn-out print I saw as probably the last New Yorker to see the film. The production design and Danny Elfman's music are worth a movie screen experience, and the script occasionally shows the cynical and whimsical flair that Roald Dahl was known for, including updated cultural references, such as very funny satires of MTV.Never having read the book, so I don't know what was faithful, changed or updated, nor have I seen the earlier adaptation, so this was my first experience with the story and it could be this generation's The ""Wizard of Oz."" Even if the visuals are consistent with the book's descriptions and did not spring from director Tim Burton's conception, the details are wonderful.Outstanding are how the choreography and deadpan of the multiplying Oompa Loompa, portrayed by the obviously up for anything Deep Roy (and sung by Elfman), are wonderful in those marvelous settings. The rest of the acting amidst the sets and blue screens, other than ""Charlie""s parents --nice to see Noah Taylor playing someone relatively normal for a change--and grandparents, are a bit weak. While the other children's parents besides James Fox are just plain bland and have wavering accents, Johnny Depp is simply unappealing, from his voice and body language to his make-up, and not just because he's creepily like Michael Jackson. His occasional tart jibes show refreshing flashes of spirit that make the rest of his performance just that much more dull. Christopher Lee adds his usual panache to the typical movie stereotypes of an evil dentist, though surely the floss reference is not from the book. Freddie Highmore as ""Charlie"" is more earnest than natural.Geoffrey Holder's narration sounds charming. It's not only lovely to hear his Caribbean lilt, but it's nice to know that Morgan Freeman doesn't have the monopoly on voice-overs.Though the ending comes a bit close to cloying, the film does not talk down to children, who should be able to appreciate the lessons the very funny annoying kids are taught.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My opinion,"I have just seen a musical film ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" which is based on a children's novel by Roald Dahl. The film was directed by Tim Burton.This fantasy comedy film is about an eccentric chocolate magnate Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket, a good-natured boy from a poor family. One day Willie announces an international competition to select the heir to his candy empire. Charlie and four more lucky children find ""golden tickets"" in Wonka chocolate bars and win a tour of the legendary chocolate factory that has been hidden from people's eyes for fifteen years. Watching the film is like being on that tour with Charlie.The film stars are my favourite actors Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore. Their acting is just superb. I also like the music in the film. There are several songs there sung by the funny little Oompa-Loompas. The visual effects are simply the best, all the chocolate things look very realistic!I enjoyed every minute of this story on the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Choccy Horror Show,"Well it's not really that bad, but it's difficult to think of a chocolate-related pun for a review that will hopefully convey a sentiment of adequacy and mild disappointment.Hmm. Where to begin? I suppose the comparisons with the original 1971 Gene Wilder film are inevitable, so let's get them out of the way quickly: This is better. Marginally. My biggest beef with the original (aside from the rubbish spying sub-plot) was the kid they got to play Charlie  a bouffant-haired, no-mark sycophant, so ludicrously saccharine and brown-nosing, that I would have sooner sawn off my own arm than offer him a controlling stake in my chocolate empire.No such problems here. Freddie Highmore is an astute piece of casting  he has the Dickensian urchin look down pat. Indeed, the whole Bucket family is steeped in a homely grime that is never quite managed in the more Americanised original.I think the key to that is Tim Burton's decision to exploit the ambiguity over the setting of the action by making the Buckets English. I'm not sure there is anything in the book clarifying the location of the chocolate factory, or indeed the nationality of Charlie's family (there is talk of ""dollars"" in the film, but enough evidence to suggest an industrial town somewhere in the South of England. Slough maybe. Or maybe not.) It is an important judgement though because the British do poverty and old people so much better than the Americans who tend to be rather too chipper. Give me a bedful of ancient, dotty sitcom stalwarts and Helena Bonham Carter in a floury apron any day.Whatever, after a promising beginning, the film descends rapidly towards the brown stuff (and I'm not talking about the contents of the chocolate river). The special effects are impressive and diverting, but one would expect nothing less in these days of bells and whistles. But the children are bland and don't lend anything new to the story other than to fuel the debate over the very purpose of remakes. One can only watch a fat kid getting sucked up a glass pipe so many times before ennui sets in.Much of Burton's film is faithful to the book, but he can't resist an extra plot line reinforcing Dahl's fondness for generational conflict and his deep-seated mistrust of adults. Here, he seeks to explain Wonka's sociophobia by introducing a series of childhood flashbacks where a petrified Willy, his face encased in a fearsome metal contraption, is lectured on the importance of dental hygiene by none other than the Prince of Darkness himself, Christopher Lee, and if that's not enough to send a small child spiralling into a dark world of isolation and illicit confectionery, then I don't know what is.I guess the key to the whole project was always going to be Johnny Depp, and I'm afraid to say he didn't really do it for me. I can kind of see what he was going for. He's obviously studied the raw material carefully and put his own unique spin on Wonka and, while his performance is undoubtedly a triumph of make-up and gauche comic timing, I was left slightly deflated and not a little alarmed by his striking resemblance to Dave Hill out of Slade.I'm not suggesting there is an easy way to portray Wonka, but Wilder played him far too knowing and disingenuous, while Depp strives too hard to be the antithesis of adulthood, which, in this climate, and with a forty-year-old actor in the role, is difficult to achieve without drawing uneasy comparisons to Michael Jackson.I always remembered the actual character to sit neatly between the two  crotchety and misanthropic, but with a childish playfulness that neither screen incarnation truly manages to capture. Also, as I recall, in Quentin Blake's original artwork for the books, Wonka is shown to have a rather rakish goatee beard  a detail studiously ignored by both sets of filmmakers - and I cannot help but conclude that this chin-nudity goes a long way towards explaining the flaws in characterisation.As for the Oompa Loompas (in this case all played by the amusingly named Deep Roy and electronically duplicated) I will reserve judgement save for saying that both films neatly side-step any awkward racist questions by making them bright orange so that any moral outrage will be confined to Dale Winton and Kat Slater out of Eastenders.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My favorite childhood movie,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
is a hilarious family comedy. It was set in winter in England and features imaginary factory where chocolate is produced. Johny Depp, who skillfully played the main role as an owner of the factory, made the whole movie unique. As the film opens, we learn the history of the Chocolate Factory whose owner raffles five golden tickets to visit his place. Five children are chosen and, surprisingly, it turns out that four of them are extremely naughty. The fifth child, who was a young boy from a poor family background, impressed Willy Wonka by his modesty, that helped the owner to make up with his father. This film is a good option for children as it includes many funny songs, which accompanied the storyline. Convincingly acted by Freddie Highmore, Charlie impressed me deeply. I'd thoroughly recommend this movie, if you want to remind yourself of human values in the world where everyone thinks about themselves only.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Right title??,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to me had its moments, but it also had its moments.
First let me start by saying, this follows the book better than Willy does, BUT it's not a perfect follow.
The acting wasn't bad (I didn't know the woman who played Bellatrix played Charlie's mom for example which shows how good she is), but this movie felt darker than Willy which isn't surprising considering.The thing that always gets me is I think the titles of the movies need switching. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory focuses on Charlie.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory focuses more on Willy and his childhood, so while I found this one a 6 (and the other one an 8). I think the titles were off.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An absolute abomination,"This is not the only awful film to be made from a children's book in the last few years: Lemony Snicket and Cat in the Hat spring to mind, and certainly, the Harry Potter movies are never much better than mediocre.But Charlie and the Chocolate Factory suffers from the fact that it must be compared to the Gene Wilder version, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which is not only superior to it in every way, but is truly a classic film.One might well ask why anyone would dare to remake a film that was written by Roald Dahl himself. A film that had beautiful, classic songs, biting humor, and a hilarious cast.The answer, of course, is money.This film was made for one reason -- to wring more money out of a Warner Brothers property. Why else remake a nearly perfect film? It's an insult to moviegoers and an affront to the many children who may never bother to watch the original now that they've seen this trash.The thing is, the Gene Wilder version is very, very funny. Its comedy still seems edgy today. And somehow, they've managed to turn it into a movie with almost no laughs. The timing is sometimes, it seems, deliberately thrown off.Johnny Depp's performance is, I think, his worst ever. It's just stupendously bad. Then again, he has basically nothing to work with, caught between plain, unfunny new dialogue, and struggling to go in the opposite direction from Gene Wilder's brilliance. I don't envy the task. But don't worry, Johnny got lots and lots of money for his troubles.The new Charlie, Freddie Highmore, was decent enough in the tearjerker Finding Neverland. But here, he's just all wrong. His one acting choice seems to be ""Smile Every Time You Say Something,"" which I last saw used by Denise Richards in Starship Troopers.On one hand, I wondered as I was watching it whether the movie would fare better with someone who'd never seen the original. But on the other, this film is so disjointed and strange, I'm not sure how anyone could follow it if they hadn't seen the first film.The Oompa Loompa ""songs,"" if you can call them that, consist of CG clones singing the same rhyming lines over and over again. There is no narrative or melodic progression to the songs -- they are as two dimensional as cardboard cutouts.Add to this bland, unimaginative mix a few ghastly changes from the earlier movie: Charlie has a father now, his family magically gets ""unpoor"" at the end by the dint of their own optimism, and Willy Wonka learns -- get ready for this one -- that families are not a bad thing.It's beyond awful.

Johnny's Chocolate Crazy or Tim Burton's Fairy Tale,"Story. An adaptation of the eponymous and famous novel by the English writer Roald Dahl, or, to be more precise, a rethinking of the first film adaptation, filmed in 1971, which I have not watched or read the book. This film adaptation was staged by the famous gloomy storyteller of our time, Tim Burton, with the active participation of the magnificent Johnny Depp. I watched this picture for the last time about six years ago, and here recently I had a free evening, and my eyes fell on the disc with this picture. I reviewed it and was not disappointed, though I found a few drawbacks that had eluded me before. And here's my quick opinion - Tim Burton's Fairy Tale. Consider both the pros and cons of this tale from one of my favorite directors.
So the pros:
1. Atmosphere - the picture is filled with fabulousness a little more than completely, despite the rather good looking realistic environment. This realism is misleading, albeit at first, but at the moment when the story begins to unfold, the viewer already begins to understand that there is a modern fairy tale in front of them, and ceases to pay attention to some absurdities, which could not be avoided.
2. Cautionary story - the hero of our story is poor boy Charlie Bucket, who, having learned about the issue of five golden tickets from Mr. Wonka, the owner of the largest chocolate factory in the world, located in his hometown, dreams of visiting there. He gets it, and together with the other lucky ones, he goes to the factory, where real miracles await him. The story is instructive, because the rest of the lucky ones who got the ticket are the most disgusting qualities that are inherent in people - greed, gluttony, complacency, and so on. And Mr. Wonka is a kind of ""educator"" here, although he himself is not so good a character. Tim Burton makes fun and gives a lesson to children, as well as adults by the way, that being a bad person is not very good, and only people with a pure soul and love in their hearts are able to change this cruel world for the better. The ending is predictable and wonderful, no matter who says what. And the story calls for the same and makes fun of the vices of human nature, for which at one time the author was even strongly criticized.
3. Music - Tim's regular composer Danny Elfman has written great music. There are compositions that are light-hearted, there are also frightening, mystical, dynamic, and indeed all this music can be listened to separately from the picture - and nothing is lost from this. Experience and seniority can not be spent on drink, as they say!
4. Johnny Depp is Tim's ""constant muse"" who helped him create the best of his works, and I am now saying this without any exaggeration. Apart from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, it was Tim Johnny who played his best roles, and I hope he will play in the future. In addition to other actors, Johnny here holds the lion's share of the whole picture, or rather, his ingenious acting.
So the cons:
1. Logical holes - you don't notice them at first, but if you look closely, they come out, like mushrooms after rain, and this is already beginning to interfere with viewing. Do not think, the script as a whole is excellent, but here are some points clearly forgotten to work out, or they were simply scored, like ""Okay! And so it will do!"".
2. Inappropriate scenes - or rather, they are so stupid that even children will not appreciate them, let alone adults. There are few of them, but they are very unsettled.
A little about the main characters:
1. Charlie Bucket performed by Freddie Highmore is a kind and honest boy from a poor family, living with a sincere belief in miracles and well-mannered. Thanks to his character, he was able to get into Mr. Wonka's factory. Freddie is my age, and at such a young age he was able to convey the character of the hero, although he probably did not have to play it, maybe he was who knows! Well done anyway!
2. Willy Wonka performed by Johnny Depp is an eccentric owner of a chocolate factory who at one point decided to invite five children to visit his brainchild, and at the end of one a real surprise awaits. Depp's Willy Wonka is an insane genius who steals every frame with his participation and makes the viewer literally stare at the screen so as not to miss the slightest emotion of Johnny. With his eccentricity, everything is not easy either, and deep in his soul there is a tragic story that is close and understandable to each of us. Johnny - bravo!
3. Grandpa Joe performed by David Kelly - Charlie's grandfather, who worked for a long time in the factory of Mr. Wonka, whom he still admires. Thanks to his frantic energy, Charlie was able to achieve a lot. David was incomparable, and the wonderful Russian artist Alexander Lenkov also dubbed him into Russian, which adds even more charm to this character. Bravo!
Tim Burton's wife Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's mother and the gorgeous Christopher Lee as Willie Wonka's father also starred in the film.
I used to give the highest rating to this picture, but now I underestimate it, although not much, because the picture carries a good message in excellent scenery that cost a lot of money. The picture is still relevant, despite the fact that it was published sixteen years ago.
As a result, we have a great fairy tale by Tim Burton with Johnny Depp, with a great script, great music and atmosphere, but with logical holes and a couple of inappropriate moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is what happens when you give Tim Burton free hands,"What happens is, he goes absolutely crazy and spouts out the overblown surreal trip that is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and it is a total mess. The good news is, it is a rather enjoyable mess and this film is a good example of quirky, but not desperately quirky (Like Garden State, I Heart Huckabees, Broken Flowers, etc). It is a family film but definitely the prototype-film that people of all ages can laugh at and enjoy.As is the style of director Tim Burton, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a visual, magical feast that does not look altogether different from the various versions of Alice in Wonderland. The whole atmosphere is kooky and dream-like as is emphasized further by a musical score that sounds like it belongs in a funhouse at a carnival. Some jokes are downright hysterical, but most are just nice and I found that many of the things attempted were mostly met by ""huh... neat."" - type reactions.Not being a huge Johnny Depp fan like 95% of the world, I did find his performance as the enigmatic Willy Wonka rather enjoyable. How does Charlie and the Chocolate Factory compare to Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory? Quite well, and it appears that Burton sticks closer to the characterizations of Roald Dahl than Mel Stuart did. Pretty good. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Now here's a movie that did NOT need to be re-made.,"Granted that the 1971 classic had poor special effects and bad make-up, the advances in technology did not advance the cause of the story -- it just made it weird-looking. The 1971 version had characters that were likable or dislikable. In 2005, the characters were almost all despicable, except of course for one... who was infallibly perfect. In 1971, Charlie did commit a sin (he stole) which made him more human. It was his act of contrition that made him truly lovable. On the other hand, in 2005, we do get glimpses into what made Wonka into the man he is today.The music? How can you teach a lesson when you can't even make out the words?? In 1971, every child came out of the theater singing the lyrics. 2005's over-orchestration made that impossible.And by the way, why were hundreds of miniaturized Joe Pescis employed to make this film when thousands of midget-actors are out of work??Note to Tim Burton: if you're going to use special effects, get the lighting right! Otherwise it's just a distraction that hurts my eyes.The 2005 ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a movie, I guess, you have to see once. The 1971 ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is a movie you'll want to see many times.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
EXTRA! EXTRA! Tim  Burton makes chocolate covered piece of crap!!,"Witness me as I take this solemn vow: I hereby swear not to take my children to a theater and expose them to brainless pointless heartless bastardized rehashments of things I once held dear and loved, and have passes on to them in its original form to love as I have thus lining the pockets of talentless filmmakers and the Hollywood crap factories they work for thus promoting the demand for more of said substandard and unnecessary remakes.Well Well Well. Not much to be said that hasn't been said already. First of all, Tim Burton Hasn't made a good movie since Ed Wood in 1994, and I don't foresee him ever returning to his original form. The preview for ""Corpse Bride"" that accompanies Wonka just proves that. It promises to be just a rehashing of The nightmare before Christmas. The first 20 minutes or so of this movie did have promise, especially David Kelly's performance as grandpa Joe. I know everyone will be comparing this movie more to the 1971 original adaptation rather than the book, but I cant help it. The Original was timeless, this version is extremely dated (note the hip-hopped up versions of the oompa loompa songs) the Wolper film might have strayed from the novel by adding in new songs and removing Charlie's father (Dahl himself suggested this), but it didn't invent and entire subplot such as Wonka's estranged father. The film is like someones dissertation of the story, attempting to dissect the character and explain his origins, something Dahl would have never done. The film was poorly directed, relying heavily on CGI effects. As pretty as they were they did nothing to enhance the story. When I first saw Augustus, I couldn't decide weather HE was a CGI effect or an actual actor. In fact, all the kids in this movie have a sort of eerie ""plastinated"" effect, they don't look human, Like they stepped out of the Mutter museum. My biggest problem came from Johnny Depps performance. He may be slightly more true to the character in the novel, But Gene Wilder definitely played the part better. Wilder's Wonka was subtle, sardonic, romantic, evoking Shakespeare, Keats, and Oscar Wilde. Depp appears to be on dope. If Burton wanted a wonka that sounded and acted like Dave Foley from the Kids in the Hall, he should have cast he became totally obnoxious after only a few minutes on screen, and from then on it was almost painful to watch. Sad. what do you expect? This is by far the worst summer for ""movies"" in my memory. Is is any mystery why attendance is dropping off in theaters? when 7 out of 10 movies are remakes and 10 out of 10 are terrible, why not save 50 bucks and head to the video store. May I suggest David Wolper's 1971 classic ""willy wonka and the chocolate factory"" starring the incomperable Gene Wilder in the title role? your welcome.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Different Version, Just As It Should Be!  Look Out For Exploding Grapefruit!","I fear that I'm always running a wee bit behind in both books and films, somehow thinking that after all the talking heads get finished screaming pros and cons, one can perhaps be a little more objective and less caught up in the fray; besides, I have hundreds of films in my personal queue.Folks still seem to be searching for Gene Wilder in this film, but, amazingly, folks, he's not in it. It's a Tim Burton film, and it stars Johnny Depp and that said, I found it delightful, with an amazing other-worldly universe populated by Charlie Buckets and his fellow kiddie guests. This film, loaded with parodies of numerous other films (including the opening sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey), is sort of a cross between The Wizard of Oz, Pee Wee's Playhouse and Metropolis, with the Oompa-Loompas standing in for all those robotic types in the latter--but this time they are Latino Lookalikes in dazzling shades of Technicolor candy.I would personally caution against showing this to very young children, as there are a few revenge scenes that are perversely (though hilariously) graphic, such as the attack of the squirrels who drag a pesky girl to a large, dark hole and dump her in (of course in Burton's world, she richly deserves it, but some kids might find it frightening). As to the cast, Freddie Highmore is an understated delight, and Depp quietly subversive, playing well against expectations. This oddity is a moral little story about goodness which, if you're in the mood for the quirky, can be fun. I think there's room in the cinematic world for both versions of this kiddie classic to exist, don't you?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
No Heart,"I went into this movie wanting to like it, but after about 30 minutes I could see it was another Tim Burton-fest devoid of heart. The sets looked like Batman/Beetle Juice makeovers and overall the movie was FLAT FLAT FLAT. Burton is all about the visual and minor things like acting and story are secondary, to say nothing about his lack of understatement, which would more intimately involve the viewer.Mostly, there's no >sweetness< in any of his recent movies.I think there once might have been, but it's been lost somehow. The teaming with Depp and Elfman just isn't working for me anymore. Gene Wilder runs rings around Depp with his slightly-crazed/funny and yet touching portrayal of Willy Wonka. I don't really know why I'm writing this, but Burton has missed the point again.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Something to watch with all the family,"I loved the book as a kid and this movie is just as good. Jhonny Depp is one of my favourite actors of ALL TIME and i love seeing him in this role. I couldn't even tell he was playing Willy Wonka!!! I gave it a 9 because:
1. Doesn't look like it was made in 2005- looks like a 2013+!!!
2. Great actors
3. Great Music

Does it's job well,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsTo any child who ever grew up in Blighty, the tales of Roald Dhal should be as familiar as apple pie. So every child who ever was is likely to be familiar with the tale of Charlie (Freddie Highmore) a young kid with problems in life. His family don't have much and, without even realizing it (or at least not making that much of a fuss about it!) the building contractors have done a really sh!tty job on his house (it's slanting!) and every time a family member enters the house, they address the others by saying 'hello Buckets!) ??? Anyway, Charlie's luck's about to change when eccentric chocolate maker William Wonka (current wonder-kid Johnny Depp) places some shiny tickets in bars of his chocolate brands. Charlie picks the losing ticket at first and has to make do with his no-doubt scrumptuous choccy-bar. But his grand-father's a persistent old fruit and uses his money to buy him another one. This time luck lets him be a lady, and pleasant young Charlie gets sent off to Wonka's factory, with it's mountains of choccy and candy and Oompa Loompas (singing, dancing weirdos in costumes all played by one peculiar actor!) with a load of otherwise snotty brats who need a moral lesson in their lives. And Wonka's just the person to give it.Through-out the last year or so, I've been trying to get more into children's films. From the age of 16 or so, I'd sort of accepted that I'd grown out of them and focused all my attention on more high-brow, adult orientated stuff. But I started to notice a lot of critics giving rave reviews to a lot of these kiddie flicks, so I gave Finding Nemo a try, no great shakes (in my opinion!) but I followed it up with The Incredibles (which was ace!) earlier in the year. And I remembered a little film called Toy Story, released nearly ten years ago, which I could still appreciate today. So I took it on that giving my time to kids films again wasn't such a bad thing. So I'll try and seek out the Harry Potter films sometime soon (can't believe they're making a fourth film!) And I was glad to have let down my reservations and seen this adaptation by Tim Burton.Those already familiar with Burton's unique style of filming will find CATCF terra ferma, and so will those coming to experience his unique approach to family films. But despite all the rave reviews, it's undeniable that this is a film with some serious flaws. And these mainly revolve around the lead star. Highmore as Charlie, as the lead star, gets hardly any screen-time but ironically in the scenes he's in, he kind of annoyingly wholesome, brattishly so, even. And as Wonka, you could say Depp is kind of mis-cast, but he is sort of hammy for some parts of the film (although you get the impression he did the best he could with the part!) The supporting cast are quite good, in the shape of Helena Bonham Carter, Christopher Lee and Noah Taylor, through to the more unknown stars. The Oompa-Loompa singing/dancing sequences are also quite well done and have a genuine sort of charm to them.Overall, I can say this mostly succeeds as a good representation of what fans of Burton's usual work will be expecting, but no matter what everyone else is saying, there are some serious flaws present and it serves as no great notch on Depp's present career high. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Different isn't always a bad thing,There was so much hype about it. The NEW chocolate factory movie. Again we get to see the Oompa Loompas Willy Wonka and little Charlie Bucket perform their magic. There was a big difference in the music department and the Oopma Loompas songs were made in a completely different manner. There was a huge change in the acting department. I did enjoy Gene Wilder acting in 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' and i think that Johnny Depp did a fantastic job acting in this one. The character of Willy Wonka was shown in a completely different way and i think changed the entire aspect of the film. The scenery was almost the same but the thing i like most about this version was that it stuck very well to the book and it had a very nice ending. it felt more 'finished' then in 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' I rated it a 7 out of 10 as there were bits that i enjoyed and others i would have licked differently. i think that this movie is a happy fun loving movie that all children should enjoy.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A magical time thanks to Tim Burton,"Roald Dahl's delightful book of the same title gets a magical production by that wizard of wizards, Tim Burton. If ever was a man who was born to undertake the adaptation of this beloved book into a film it was Mr. Burton, a man who understands how to entertain an audience with a good story and great cinematic flair.Mr. Burton is lucky, as this film marks the fourth collaboration between him and its star, Johnny Depp. Both director and star are well attuned into what each expects from the other. The film is a triumph of creativity with a film that will satisfy children of all ages as well as grown ups. The screen play by John August serves the book and the film well.Mr. Burton has given the film a glossy look that is absolutely impossible to be distracted at any given moment. In fact, the time flew by without realizing the movie was over, leaving us craving for more.Willie Wonka, the genial chocolate maker, decides to invite five children for a tour of his famous chocolate factory. From the five that win the privilege, Charlie Bucket, the poor child with a rich family life, in spite of their poverty, is the only one we realize is going to be the winner because the other four display the worst qualities that will surely clash with their host. Charlie, the humble child shows Willie that having a loving family is a treasure that the chocolate maker hasn't got.To say that Johnny Depp is magnificent, is not saying anything at all. As Willie, Mr. Depp has a brilliant field day hosting the group, and us, through his world and his realm. Mr. Depp is an absolute delight to watch; he seems to do everything so naturally that he becomes the real Willie Wonka.As Charlie, Freddie Highmore, who had already appeared with Mr. Depp in ""Neverland"", proves again he is a young actor that is easy to like because he seems to be a natural. As his grandfather, David Kelly, is also wonderful. Freddie's parents, Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter are good, and the supporting cast do an excellent job under the direction of Mr. Burton. Deep Roy, as Oompa Loompa deserves special mention as he is seen hundreds of times! Philipe Russelot, the cinematographer does wonders with his camera. The musical score is brilliant. The people behind the production technical part must be congratulated for giving the director their best into making this film, the joy it is.Let the viewer beware he is in for a magical ride thanks to Mr. Burton.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Visually splendid and fairly faithful remake,"Former Disney animator Tim Burton has a rather hit and miss record as a film-maker but he usually has a firm grip on fantasy and does Roald Dahl proud here. He sticks pretty close to the original story except for an interesting if not wholly successful attempt to flesh out Willy Wonka's background, with Christopher Lee playing Willy's father. All the children save Charlie are monuments to defective parenting and of course all get their come-uppance. Charlie is of the deserving poor but wedded to his family and is duly rewarded.The production values can hardly be faulted. Money and a vibrant imagination is a potent combination. The exterior of the chocolate factory, the squirrels' nut-cracking room, the chocolate river ride all linger in the mind long after. Only the Bucket house, too comically dilapidated to be true, struck a false note (the other buildings were generally realistic  even the chocolate factory could have come out of the same architect's office that produced the Battersea power station). The Oompa Loompa song and dance numbers could have been done by Busby Berkeley, though he would not have been able to get by with only one Oompa Loompa (here computer graphics provided the rest).The acting was perfectly fine; I only hope the children escape the oblivion which awaited the child actors in the 1971 film with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I enjoyed particularly David Kelly, his subtle Irish charm turned on to full, as Grandpa and James Fox as Veruka Salt's ramrod-straight but weak dad. Johnny Depp denies basing his characterization of Wonka on Michael Jackson but there is an uncanny resemblance. His Wonka has also a touch of Howard Hughes and even overtones of Henry Ford  industrial autodidacts who did things their way, meeting with both spectacular success and failure. In this film his shyness is more apparent but he could not be described as child-like except for his love of candy. The Mars family of candy bar fame are pretty reclusive  though it's probably not because they are shy, just mega-rich.This is a kid s movie and the members of the target audience I saw the film with evidently enjoyed it. For me it was a visual treat. The story and the atmosphere are almost intact though I'd suggest reading the book first, or hearing Roald Dahl read the story on tape/CD.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movies blows,the first one away. I took my family to a 12:01 a.m. showing on opening day and found this movie to be absolutely worth the wait. Now I'm left waitng for this masterpiece to come out on DVD so I can watch it over and over. This movie is so well casted from Willie Wonka and Charlie right down to Veruca Salt it couldn't go wrong and the cinematography was incredible. I read it wasn't for children(I don't know what ages they are talking about) but my 10 year old laugh through the whole thing and loved it more than any of us which is saying a lot because I thought it was nothing short of a ten. The whole movie theater was into the movie from laughing to applauding and I didn't hear one person give a rating lower than a 9.5.,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great adaptation of the book - Depp is outstanding,"Charlie (Highmore) is a small boy from a poor background who lives with his parents and 4 grandparents in a ramshackle old house. One day the reclusive Willy Wonka (Depp) announces that he will allow five lucky children to tour his chocolate factory and five golden tickets are hidden within Wonka chocolate bars. Charlie manages to find the last golden ticket and along with his grandfather, they commence the tour of the mysterious chocolate factory.Thankfully, this movie was true to the original story. Depp's mannerisms and voice were prefect as the eccentric and reclusive Wonka and he was the highlight of the movie. With the help of computers, Deep Roy was excellent playing the part of all of the Oompa Loompa's, and the actors playing the roles of the other ticket winners made their characters very dislikeable.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
They Ruined It...,"Such a waste of good talent -- Tim Burton directing, Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka -- how could it be better? It should be great, but they ruined it. Having read and loved the book as a kid, and very much enjoying the first film version, this one doesn't cut it. It's a timeless story and didn't require ""modernizing"" -- keeping with the original story and merely updating the special effects would've been great. Willy Wonka was turned into a Michael Jackson-like character and the Oompa Loompa's were all one actor, digitally duplicated to appear as many identical characters -- the musical numbers with the Oompas were 'updated' with electronic music and Oompas attempting to disco-dance.This movie is what happens when a bunch of college kids get jobs at studios, do drugs, and dig into the movie-rights vault.

Don't expect the original...,"From what I had heard, I was skeptic at first, but when I saw this movie I couldn't stop laughing! Even now I will say a line from it and others will join in. I was originally upset that there were no green haired orange skinned people running around, but Deep Roy did a great job. I do not recommend bringing a young child to the movie, as it is frightening to many. But 6 up I have found really enjoy the film and adults love it! There are a lot of references to other (older) movies, plays, etc. I was one of the few teenagers that actually understood almost all of the humor in it! Johnny Depp is magnificent in his role, playing it perfectly! He plays the role of a man with the mind of a boy, just like Wonka should be played. I loved the original, but unfortunately for those Gene Wilder fans out there, I prefer the new movie. Just because you have heard it is twisted (which is true and which makes it even funnier) and you shouldn't bring your kids, it is still a movie just the parents can go see one night. If you don't go to compare it to the original, I just bet you will get your laughs and smiles. Maybe you will even consider seeing it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
How Bizarre (Even for a Tim Burton Movie!),"I usually enjoy the partnership Tim Burton + Johnny Depp (""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of my favourite films). This remake of the lovely ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" (directed by Mel Stuart in 1971, based on Roald Dahl's delightful book), however, was disappointing.Burton's dark style and adult jokes don't work here. The cynicism he put in almost every scene let the movie with a bitter taste: it's too twisted for children, and too childish for adults.Freddie Highmore did a fine job as Charlie Bucket (he also worked with Johnny Depp in ""Finding Neverland""). Depp, on the other hand, was extremely mannered as Willy Wonka, light-years away from Gene Wilder's terrific performance in the original (Depp is too much alike Michael Jackson for us to bear - the comparison is inevitable, though Burton says the similarity between them was unintentional). As a friend of mine said, Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka had a golden heart behind all the eccentricity, but Depp's Wonka is just mean and weird. I agree. The new Oompa-Loompas (all of them played by Deep Roy) are boring (their songs suck!) and obnoxious, by the way.Remakes are definitely not for Burton. ""Planet of the Apes"" and this one are his worst movies that I've seen so far. Skip this: if you want to watch a good Tim Burton movie with your kids, rent ""Big Fish"", ""Beetlejuice"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (Henry Selick directed it, by it IS a Tim Burton movie! One of the best examples of ""Producer's movie"" - just like David O. Selznick and ""Gone With The Wind"").My vote: 6 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Comedy
'Chocolate Factory' may not have an ever-lasting gobstopper,"Don't get me wrong. I liked 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' since I was a kid, but this film won't quite be what I expect from a book movie. There have been great movies based on books. War of the Worlds 1953, the Harry Potter films (the more recent being the best), Lord of the Rings trilogy just to name a few. I think the film will do OK.There are bright spots in the film. The films accuracy to the book can't be denied. The factory looks spectacular. The cast is right, but there is something a little off in this recipe for book film fame. I have it! Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. He said in an interview that he imagined a kids show host and a game show host as a single being. He may be a little off on his portrayal. I think he's more like a stoner in an extremely tripped out hallucination's. His performance has a long way to go if he wants to compete with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka.This film will do well at the box office, probably take #1 in the first week.

The Sweetest Movie of the Year,"It's hard to describe your experiences in a Tim Burton movie. They are odd, to say the least, and sometimes creepy. Sometimes they are colorful, and sometimes they're black. But they are always something special, and Burton doesn't let us down in his latest flick ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" It's a moving coloring book, with stunningly beautiful colors and creative sets and costumes. It just makes me sad that the real world isn't this rich.The most common misconception about the movie is that it is a remake of the timeless ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" It's not. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't a remake, but rather another adaptation of the classic children's story of the same title. Keeping true to the book, screenwriter John August mixes quirky humor and creepy tempo to concoct one of the year's best movies.""Charlie"" is a story of an ordinary little boy named Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). He was not faster, or stronger, or more clever than other children. His family was not rich or powerful or well-connected; in fact, they barely had enough to eat. But Charlie was the luckiest boy in the whole world, he just didn't know it yet.Charlie lives with his family; his two parents and his four grandparents. His grandparents: Joe, Josephine, George, and Georgina, never leave their bed, and Georgina is a little out of it, to say the least. Charlie sleeps next to a hole in the wall, which can be quite cold in winter, but he doesn't care, because the hole allows him to look at the greatest chocolate factory in the world, the one belonging to Willy Wonka.After some fifteen years, Willy Wonka decides to open his factory gatesfor five lucky people. He places five golden tickets in five ordinary Wonka bars, the finders of which win a tour through his amazing factory. As people around the world frantically buy Wonka bars in search of the tickets, they are slowly found, one here, one there. Charlie desperately wants to go to the factory, but he only gets one bar of chocolate a year, on his birthday.Johnny Depp gives one of the best performances of his career as the eccentric chocolate entrepreneur Willy Wonka. His exotic style and off-beat jokes almost mock Michael Jackson, but are original in its own. Depp leads an already all star cast including Helena Bonham Carter, Christopher Lee, and Deep Roy (who might as well be the star of the movie). Tim Burton directed it, and Danny Elfman created the score.No one ever thought it, but Charlie has actually surpassed its predecessor. Burton has delivered another classic, putting it up there with Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas. But Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't just mere entertainment, it also teaches us something. It reinforces the age old themes ""greed is not a virtue,"" and ""curiosity killed the cat."" But all virtues aside, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is definitely worth a viewing or two, and is by far the year's sweetest movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A good effort but lacking.,"I think I like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory better than the 1971 version, although it's been quite a while since I've seen it. I had only seen the original once and have never read the book so I didn't remember what the movie was about other than 5 kids getting invited to a chocolate factory. I was mildly entertained but nothing really was all that amazing. Depp did an OK job (he never once reminded me of Michael Jackson as some reviewers have commented), and Burton's visual style is evident from the opening credits. Freddy Highmore was very good although he didn't really have all that much to do. The rest of the cast seemed to work OK. I hated the musical numbers.In the end the story doesn't really work for me. I don't think any version would ever rate higher than 6 on my scale...",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Burton, Depp try hard, but cannot overcome charm of original film","You'd have to believe that director Tim Burton has wanted to remake this film for a very long time. Probably from the time he saw ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" starring Gene Wilder back in 1971. But just because someone *wants* to do something, that doesn't always mean they *should* do it. Based on Roald Dahl's classic children's story, that version was one of the best kid's film ever made, so fans of the original are well justified in their apprehension. And while Burton remains more faithful to the letter of the book than the 1971 film, the spirit is weak this time around. It's certainly not because of a lack of effort  the acting, especially Johnny Depp in the lead role and Freddie Highmore (who starred with Depp in the Oscar-nominated ""Finding Neverland"") as the goodhearted, but poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket, is pretty good. The special effects are terrific and the story is compelling. It's just, just  dare I say it  not the same as the first one. I'm sorry to be so elementary here, but that's my problem. It's the same situation with all remakes  most people saw the original first, so they are automatically prejudiced. Wilder, as the eccentric hermit candymaker was sweetly sarcastic and a little touched. Depp, on the other hand (looking like a combination of Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder  with a Beatles' haircut), is just plain creepy. He also goes into weird trances and suffers far too many flashbacks instead of charming the kids like Wilder did, and the subplot of his past family and psychological problems seemed out of place, as well. The child actors are fine, including blonded Annasophia Robb (""Because Of Winn-Dixie"") as athletic, gum-chewing Violet Beauregard; Julia Winter as spoiled Veruca Salt; Philip Wiegratz as tubby Augustus Gloop; and Jordan Fry as the violent video game/television-obsessed egghead, Mike Teavee (just as the original child actors were). But there's still a big piece missing, and that's the music. In the 1971 picture, there were some great tunes, including ""Candy Man,"" ""Pure Imagination"" and ""The Ompa Loompa Song,"" among others. The other songs are removed, and the Ompa Loompas (CGI creations of the same person  Deep Roy - not midgets) sing bad lyrics in three different styles  dance, pop and annoying heavy metal. Burton's direction is always quirky and inventive, and the opening credits are amazing. His small London shanty where the Buckets dwell is also a marvel of art direction, as is his dark, gloomy real world and colorful, fantastic candy factory. Young children and those who have not viewed the 1971 film, will probably like this one more than I did  but that's only because I had the pleasure of seeing the Gene Wilder version first. Poor me, I guess.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great big turn off,"I went to see this film as I am a big Johnny Depp fan, but I was completely turned off by the whole thing. The pace was so slow I was almost asleep, and I kept waiting for the magical moments to happen. Alas, they never did. The opening went on for ever and a day - remember the wonderful entrance Gene Wilder makes in the original? Well, Willy Wonka's entrance here, with the stupid ""song"" of the puppets, was just dire. He actually looked embarrassed to be there. The parents of the ""lucky winners"" were one-dimensional to say the least, and although the child actors were OK they were nothing to write home about. My 11 year old son went with me to see this film, and as we came out of the theatre I was wondering what he would have to say about it (and whether I would have to pretend that I had liked it!) but the first thing he said was, ""Well, that's not the best film I've ever see. Bit of a disappointment really."" I just felt that the director had wasted so many opportunities, not to try to emulate the first film, but to bring some fresh magic to the wonderful story. Instead, all we got was long-drawn out scenes, bad dialogue and a faintly embarrassed Johnny Depp.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tim Burton takes on Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,"Who knows why a great artist want to take on such an iconic unique movie? Maybe he wants the challenge. It starts with a dark depressing vision of Charlie Bucket's (Freddie Highmore) poverty. He finds one of five Golden ticket to visit Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory. The movie spends too much time in the Bucket home, and takes too long to get to the chocolate factory. Most of the audience already know what's going to happen. The Bucket home should be nothing more than an intro, but it goes on for more than 30 minutes before we take one step into the factory.Once we get Johnny Depp on screen, the movie gets moving better. I love the Tim Burton vision at his weirdest. Freddie Highmore is certainly a very capable young actor. Johnny Depp adds his own sort of weirdness. I love his weird take on Willy Wonka. On the other hand, I'm not sure about the Oompa Loompas. Mainly, I'm not sure about using the same actor for all Oompa Loompas. I do admit that it makes them even weirder. I would have given this a 7/10, but I have to subtract 1 for the slow start without Johnny Depp.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Nauseating Remake. Astonishing.,"I avoided watching this movie for a long time for mainly this reason: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory earned a place in my heart through much thought, discussion, and rewatches. The characters were uncannily well-written and acted out. Not to mention Gene Wilder's positively brilliant acting as Wonka which is in the top 50 performances of the century.Therefore, a remake of this classic film is positively unwarranted. From the previews you can tell how the whole thing is going to go. Burton's style, beloved from such masterpieces as Beetle Juice and Edward Scissorhands, is becoming more cartoonish and predictable as I felt this lands in the same seam as Sleepy Hollow.Willy Wonka by Depp is portrayed as a high-pitched jerk. His clean and make-up heavy appearance is completely unattractive. There's no endearment to his personality anymore. He didn't even want to know the children's' names at when he first met them.There's no more contrast. The whole film is cartoonishly creepy which just felt cheesy and half baked. I mean, I've seen his style before done well, ya know. You can tell this is a step down (or two). There's no more beauty to go along with the mystery. Everything on the screen is suspect and cold.In conclusion to this small chunk of a very long list of things wrong with this film and the very principle of this film, the first Willy Wonka had a magic and brilliance that cannot be touched and should never have been in the first place. Anybody who likes this film is obviously a rookie who probably liked Batman Forever and should not be trusted.It simply blows my mind that such a classic film was fooled with by an overactive ego of a director.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
wonderful imagination for children of all ages,"Tim Burton has made a wonderful remake of the 1971 film with Gene Wilder. The 1971 Movie was awful and was not I repeat not faithful to the book at all but this remake is more faithful to the book and more slightly atmospheric compared to the sunny positive message of the original. A few things I need to bring to light here, Johnny Depp's performance is a performance of comic genius and he is quirky and kooky and not too negative compared to Gene Wilder's weird strange performance. The Music and Songs Written by Danny Elfman which use the original lyrics from the book are all unique and styled differently. The Sets are extraordinary beautiful visual creations that make you want to go and visit the factory yourself. It is amazing the level of achievement in this movie is mind blowing.

I think that the sound that Johnny Depp makes throughout the movie with his lips and tongue will be the next middle school fad for a while. It was kind of interesting to delve into Wonka's character with the flashbacks. Tim Burton's somewhat demented touch to the remake was wonderful, especially when the kids are first let in to the chocolate factory.

"Not as bad as I feared, but could have been better.","While I will admit that I've always loved the 1971 version, I was excited to hear that there would be a new one with Johnny Depp. Upon seeing the previews, I was ready for a big disappointment; luckily, it wasn't as bad as I had feared. But the main problems with it are big ones: the story and the direction.The biggest difference between the two movies is subtlety. The Gene Wilder version is played on a much lower level; the jokes are under the surface, and the aspect of Willy Wonka as a person are visible if you look beneath his veneer of a weirdo. Tim Burton, playing true to form, decided to make Willy entirely into a weirdo, and removed any vestiges of a real person that existed; he also changed the style of humor into slapstick. So, in the previous movie, Gene Wilder's Willy seems to be having a private laugh at everyone else's expense; Johnny Depp's Willy doesn't care or understand what is going on, and everything about his life and the excursion with the children is completely arbitrary. Because it is so arbitrary, it means nothing and the audience has no reason to care about it.The addition of Willy's relationship (or lack of one) with his father was an attempt by the writer and director to deepen Willy's character and turn him into a human being; it failed. What also failed was any attempt at chemistry between the parents and their children. None of them seemed in the least concerned for their children's' predicaments (with perhaps the exception of Mike Teavee's father, who seemed like a real parent who has trouble understanding his violent child); they were all like distant aunts and uncles who see their relations once a year.With all that being said, the savior of this movie was Freddie Highmore, who took such a delight in the story that he brightened the screen whenever he was on it. He continues to give astonishing performances, and I feel that if the 1971 version had used an actor of his caliber it would have been even better.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The characters are excellent in contrast to the musical,"Charlie and the Chocolate factory is an excellent classic story about Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and a boy who has to goes against five kids to get the ultimate prize (though this boy isn't really competing, he is simply enjoying the chocolate factory tour Willy Wonka has been guiding him on). If you say that you don't want to see it because you have already seen the musical I would like you to know that this movie is probably better because Tim Burton has made Roald Dahl's characters more real and it is easier to get this story than the other one because it gives better definition of the characters. Throughout the movie Willy Wonka has flashbacks of his childhood making this eccentric character more real (I won't tell you what the flashbacks contain for it would ruin the story but they really give better definition of Willy Wonka). The new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an excellent movie that I think everyone who loved the musical would enjoy as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Tim Burton's second or third cinematic remake is an interesting one. I actually liked his version of ""Planet of the Apes,"" even though the first one is one of my all-time favorites and I was politically against its reworking. I thought Burton's charm might work again here. And, it almost did. Johnny Depp gives an interesting Parkey Poseyesque performance, the special effects are outstanding, and the message of how greed corrupts us all is indeed a good one. I haven't read Roaland Dahl's original story. From what I gather this film is pretty faithful to it. I guess I would've liked this movie more had I not seen the original. It is a very charming movie, with a great performance by Gene Wilder. I think what made it more pleasant was the surprises. When it was made in 1973, few children films had such dark elements and such great, sharp humor. And, I think Wilder's performance is better than Depp's because the former did not reveal Willy Wonka's sinister side as obviously as Depp did. I think as far as overall careers go, Depp will surpass Wilder who has not really made a good film in almost 20 years. But, when it came to Wonka, Wilder was better. The earlier film was made on a lower budget and did not have razzle dazzle special effects, but perhaps timing is everything. And, ""Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"" was simply a film of its' time. The same might be said for some remakes, but alas not this one. It is not a complete waste of time by any means, but the shadow of its' predecessors looms over it and can not be ignored. Now, I 'can't wait' to see what they do with ""King Kong."" Like Burton, Peter Jackson is a good director, but the remake will not have Fay Wray and no amount of special effects can compensate for that.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One Bad Trip,Would I allow my children to see this movie. No. Do I wish I had not wasted the 4 bucks to rent this movie? Yes. Virginia this is not your mother's Wonka movie. Burton must have been severely beaten as child because his view of the world is horror filled. The music is off key and just plain bad. The visuals are mostly CGI and like the latest Star Wars trilogy lacking in human emotion and reality. Johnny D's version of Wonka is Wonka as Howard Hughs. Creepy and perverse. He reminded me of some weird child molester. Don't waste your money or your time with this remake. Instead rent the original and enjoy the wonderment and beauty of true film making. The music is great and every kid that grew up seeing this favorite can hum the tunes to this day. There's a reason it's a considered a classic like the Wizard of Oz. Tim Burton and Johnny D are two very twisted men and this load of garbage is a bad egg. The original did not need to be remade. It was never broken.,1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Nutshell Review: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"Roald Dahl wrote countless of books, many of which I grew up reading in secondary school. There are many of his works adapted for the screen as well (The Witches, Matilda), but none so far given the Tim Burton treatment.The opening credits/scene has Burton's fingerprints all over - the imaginative sequence, the Gothic soundtrack (done by long time Burton collaborator Danny Elfman), mammoth weird looking architecture and snow filled landscapes.In the beginning, we are brought to the small world of Charlie Bucket, whose family find difficulty in making ends meet. As Wonka announces the 5 Golden Tickets (for a special visit to his factory) hidden in his chocolate bars, we are introduced to the backgrounds of the other children's family and stereotypical character, like the German glutton, the English brat, the American go-getter, and the Television (Wonka accused of mumbling) boy. And no doubt, the audience will definitely root for the time when Charlie actually gets his ticket and join the rest.Willy Wonka is the number one Chocolateer, but he certainly has issues relating to people, and I guess nobody can blame him after having his ""Secret Recipe"" hijacked by corporate espionage. We are told of Wonka's background in a series of flashbacks throughout the plot, and one of my favourites is when he journeyed and stumbled upon the Oopma Loompas.As the narrative gets predictable, it actually turned it into its advantage, as the audience expects to see some innovative room in its spectacular imaginative splendour, the set pieces in which the children get themselves into, and the performance of the little Oompa Loompa people, whose hilarious spontaneous song and dance routine will definitely leave you laughing out loud.Towards the end, after the side-splitting zaniness of the factory excursion, the theme of Family is highlighted, and nicely wraps up the movie, both for Wonka and Charlie.Johnny Depp is class, but really though, I thought his Willy Wonka actually adapted Michael Jackson's look and nuances. He managed to highlight Wonka's freakiness and child like nature to a T, and Depp has shown he has done no wrong with diverse roles in Tim Burton's visionary movies. Also remarkable is his recommendation of Freddie Highmore into the role of Charlie. If you'd remember, they worked together before in Finding Neverland, and their on screen chemistry was brought into this film as well. Many touching moments featuring Highmore will tug at your heartstrings, and I suppose besides Dakota Fanning, he's one of my favourite child actors of today.I can't rave enough of the sets created for this film, with its wonderful use of colours. And besides scoring the film's soundtrack, Danny Elfman also provided the unique sounding voice of the Oompa Loompas, and purist of the book will be glad that the lyrics for most of their performances were from Dahl himself.Although adapted from a children's book, this is one movie I'd recommend to adults as well. I guess Roald Dahl would have been proud of this effort! Bring out the Wonka bars!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Visually a wonderful movie but lacks substance.,"No doubt that kids will love this movie. The imaginary world inside the factory is stunning and looks delicious. It's too bad that the visuals most of the time are more present as the story, even though the story has a good message and moral in it, but because of the overly present visual style, this doesn't really reach the audience as much and as good as the story intended it to. Style over substance you could say.Still ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a wonderfully entertaining movie to watch. Not only the visuals impress but also the actors. Johnny Depp is perfectly eccentric as candy maker Willy Wonka. He lovely goes over-the-top at times without becoming ridicules. There really are some laugh out loud moments with him. Also more than great was the young Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket. Perfectly cast were also Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor as Charlie's parents. Christopher Lee also shows up in a small but good and fun role, as Willy Wonka's father, who is obsessed with keeping his sons teeth in good and clean shape.The movie certainly has some fun characters in it! All of the kids and parents who visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory are stereotypical and over-the-top but because of that at the same time work perfectly for the movie its entertainment value. But at the same time all of the characters in the movie lack real depth because they aren't exactly realistic. The movie is mostly entertaining and because of this the movie its message and moral simply don't work out in the sequences toward the ending.Some of the highlights of the movie were the Oompa Loompa song and dance numbers. All of the Oompa Loompa's are played by Deep Roy who has already received a bit of a cult-status. The musical numbers are perfectly eccentrically scored by composer Danny Elfman, who also did all of the singing voices for the Oompa Loompa's himself.The sets in- and outside the factory are really impressive and so are the costumes. It all visually really is eye candy to look at. Fans of Tim Burton will not be disappointed by this!Not the must see I expected and hoped it to be but still a perfectly entertaining movie, that's worth seeing.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Why was it so bad, and why didn't I see it coming?","The fault in this film involves a mix of three individuals: 1. Tim Burton, director 2. Danny Elfman, original musical score composer (And this shouldn't surprise many of you out there...) 3. Deep Roy, THE Oompa LoompaBurton's characters and depictions are dark. Not evil, per se, but just really dark. Edward Scissorhands is a great example of this. Its not an excellent movie, but you must admit that it was a VERY well told story, and thats the directors job. Facilitate the telling of a story, and make sure its done well. All of the characters lived and THRIVED in fantasy. And he (Burton) brought something to the table for them. He made them enjoyable. He made us BELIEVE the fantasy.So, Tim Burton is obviously a talented director. Why am I listing him as a cause for failure in ""Charlie""? One silly little reason. HE is probably the ONLY reason the other two persons listed had anything to do with the film at all.Danny Elfman is an incredibly talented composer. That goes without question. But he is NOT talented for THIS type of film, simply put. He works on projects such as ""The Simpsons"", just about anything Pee Wee, ""Weird Science"", and many others. Now I will give him this much credit. He also worked with Burton in Batman and Beetlejuice. These movies, while not famous solely for their score, were scored well all the same. But there is a limit that exists for the man that can give us the theme for The Simpsons. Batman and Beetlejuice were not too different from what ""Charlie"" was supposed to be. So what was up with the different getups for the Oompa Loompa(s)? A rock star? Come on.And someone please try to justify Deep Roy! Tim Burton, in his every-so-often lapse of wisdom, cast ONE MAN as THE Oompa Loompa for the film. That way, he was SURE to focus most of his attention on the sequences in which Roy is featured, instead of the rest of the film. And so much work went into the dancing sequences... But he can't dance! This guy hasn't done anything of note for the last twenty years except ride on Burton's coattails. His performance in ""Charlie"" was forced, bland, and dry. In and of itself, it is probably is the large reason why I dislike this film.)I gave it a 1 out of 10. Not because I'm being bitter, but because, honestly, the bad points drug down Depp's struggling but still joyful performance, the delightful selection of ""children"" (well cast, I believe), and anything else of merit that this film had to offer, and I honestly feel that a 1 is all it deserves.Please read my post on the comment board for ""greater detail.""",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Consistently weird, Consistently Good","Who doesn't get excited about Depp/Burton projects? If you don't, there's something wrong. From the beginning of their combined efforts until the next (Corpse Bride), there's always something in the air at theaters that makes you giggly, because even if parts of the movie are terrible, Burton's fantastic vision of scenery, and Depp's.. Depp-isms will save it somehow.And that's exactly where we place the Chocolate Factory movie.Much has been said (by Gene Wilder and reviewers) about the need for this movie, but in Hollywood's lack of ideas, well, it was probably going to get done again soon enough, and at least they have something working for them: the writer of the script had never seen the first film until after he went back to the original books and wrote this movie. That means ladies and gentlemen, that you're not getting a movie based upon a movie as so many people are trying to tell you, but you're getting something that goes back to the source material (kind of like the three War of the World films that came out this year), and a new view on everything. It's not knocking Wilder or the insane midgets that scared me as a child, it's creating a new vision.On we go pretending that you haven't heard this before: The story revolves around a young Charlie Bucket and his escapade through a tour in the museum that has just been re-opened by Willy Wonka. And right from the start of the tour, every little episode that looks awry also is silly, and perfect. From the fire set by the puppets, to the trained squirrels, everything looks so elaborately pretty. It's eye catching, it's the kind of thing that brings the kid out in you. You want to walk through that screen and dive into the chocolate waterfall, or eat the grass, so they say.And amid few problems, the acting is decent in that ""light comedy"" way. It's never too boring for the older crowd with it's sometimes silly jokes that kids won't necessarily understand (beatniks and cannibalism!), or even it's Three Stooges comedy that caters to everyone. And no, Johnny Depp does not remind me of Michael Jackson. His Wonka is far from it really, but just because he's extra pale, talks with a high voice and is hanging around with kids, well that's enough for everyone else.The best thing this had going for it to me besides the continued on screen awkwardness of Depp's strange man Wonka, and a fantastic performance (again) by Freddie Highmore, is that contrary to the commercials, I was not completely annoyed by the film as television has me believe. There's lots more to it than you're getting. They've saved all the good parts for the film (what trailers don't normally do), and it's fun. I left with a smile on my face afterwards, like many other kids will, and isn't that really what matters?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pay no attention to the hysterical naysayers,"I usually wouldn't write a review for a movie that already has so many but I have decided to come forward and defend this one, particularly since a lot of the negative reviewers sound like they have descended into hysterics. I really don't understand what all the caterwauling is about. You would have thought that Tim Burton produced a film advocating Satanism for children or something. It's really not that serious and people need to get a grip. To be clear I have seen both the original older rendition and this one and I HAVE ENJOYED BOTH. It's a DIFFERENT movie and I find the acting therein SUPERB. I have watched this film many times and the jokes, facial expression and banter never get old. The cast did an outstanding job. I find myself laughing EACH and EVERY time I watch this. As far parental advisories I watch this with my children all the time. (Admittedly there about perhaps TWO scenes that may be very briefly disturbing.) And I am big on parental guidance when it comes to movies and I am quick to protect my little ones and quick to protest, yes PROTEST, when Hollyweird gets out of line. But I really don't see what the fuss is about. (But of course, it is clearly for each parent to decide.) For those who insist on comparing this film to the original and posting your protestations online please calm down. Know that you are doing the public a diservice with your hysterics. Please step aside and allow others to view this film for its own merits. For those who have an open mind go forth and enjoy this. You won't be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stop your Mumbling,"Greetings again from the darkness. With Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"" ""Big Fish"", the underrated ""Beetlejuice"" and the underviewed ""Frankenweenie"") at the helm, there was little doubt that this version would follow the novel much closer than the original kiddie film with Gene Wilder and the torturous Sammy Davis, Jr song.What was not anticipated was the eeriness Johnny Depp would bring to his portrayal of Wily Wonka. He is downright freaky and creepy!! It is amazing and captivating to watch Burton and Depp craft the story of the isolated man-child and his disgust with all things impure. Depp's performance drives the film to depths it would have otherwise not reached.The sets are great, although the CGI are mediocre at best. Deep Roy as ALL of the Oompa Loompas is excellent although the difficulty in catching all lines of ""their"" musical numbers was disappointing. What we could hear was very funny. The great Danny Elfman produced another terrific score and also recaptured his Oingo Boingo days by writing and performing the Loompa numbers.Overall, this is not an actor's film. However, in addition to Depp, young Freddie Highmore (captivating as Peter in ""Finding Neverland"") delivers a nice, hug-able performance as Charlie. Fine in supporting roles are David Kelly (""Waking Ned Devine""), Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor (frighteningly real as Hitler in ""Max"") and the great Christopher Lee (veteran of over 200 films). The biggest disappointment was in the casting of the ""other"" kids and their parents. Surprised Burton couldn't do better.This film is funny, touching and often surreal. As with the novel, it carries a message and is not meant for young children. Some of the dialog is difficult to hear (especially the songs) but there are plenty of laughs and WOW's!!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pure Imagination!,"This movie is pure imagination all over again for Wonka fans and anyone else! First of all, yes, it is like the book, yes, it is different than the 1971 version, yes, there is no doubt Tim Burton directed this movie, and no, Johnny Depp didn't remind me of Michael Jackson (maybe because I wasn't obsessed with following Mr. Jackson's trial like everybody else).This timeless children's classic is extremely faithful to Roald Dahl's quirky world, while appealing to a whole new generation of kids and families. And who better to create a quirky world than the master of quirkiness, Tim Burton. Much like Hitchcock's famous cameos, there are plenty of Burton-like images all throughout the film (including a brief image of Wonka holding a pair of scissors that reminds us of another Burton-Depp collaboration). The visuals are absolutely stunning, so stunning that you could almost watch the movie with the sound down and still be entertained.The acting is all first rate. Johnny Depp's originality never ceases to amaze me. And Freddie Highmore is wonderful as usual (if you haven't seen his performance in Finding Neverland, see it). The nasty kids do a good job of mixing reality with their broad characters, and their equally nasty parents are the same. Once again, the classic book is appropriately brought into our modern life while sticking to the timeless quality of the story. Most notably are the Beauregarde's, hilariously brought to life by Missi Pyle and AnnaSophia Robb (quite the versatile little actress, for those who have seen Samantha and Because of Winn-Dixie). Here we have the pushy cheerleader mom who has created an obnoxious little clone of herself (know anyone like that?). And Mike Teavee is not only obsessed with television, but now, with video games (know any kids like that?). I cannot mention the entire cast, but everyone else did a terrific job, too.Fans of the Gene Wilder version (and I am included in that list) will be pleasantly surprised (especially with the inclusion of such chapters as ""The Other Children Go Home"", a rather wickedly satisfying chapter, but I won't give anything away), and fans of the book (I am included in that list, too) will be pleased to see a movie that is as faithful to the book as you can get and have it still be a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What happened to the  Oompa Loompers?,"I went to see this film not expecting it to really live up to the original but I was somewhat surprised. The film definitely contains more scenes taken straight from the book, which is great to see as so many films adapted from books lose their brilliance. The visual effects were great and the chocolate factory was more outlandish than in the first film and appears much more like a child has imagined the entire design. The only major fault I found with this film were the Oopma Loompas, or Oompa Loompa. In the original film they are far superior, in this version I found them slightly creepy, or maybe that was the intention of the directors. The fact that they were all played by the same actor added to the creepiness for me. The Oompa Loompa's songs were also disappointing. Gone were the catchy tunes they had previous sung that stuck in your head for days on end, replaced instead by what can only be described as 'noise'. Overall I give this film a 7/10 as the acting was great and so was the story. I recommend it for children and adults alike, as long as you are prepared for the Oompa Loompa catastrophe.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Terrible remake of a classic,"To be quite honest, the first make of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory wasn't that much to sneeze at. With Gene Wilder playing Willy Wonka, for that time period you knew that it would be a enjoyable movie at that. But the second remake was amusing, literally. Johnny Depp's white-faced, denture wearing, womanly haircutted Willy is embarrassing to look at it in itself compared to the goofy but likable 70's Wonka. With stupid sub plots and scenes that look like hallucinations, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a terrible and embarrassing mistake of a classic musical. Gene Wilder himself told press: ""Why remake a classic?"". I agree 100%. Good to see in the dollar movie or rent but definitely not worth $8.95 of my hard earned money.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sweet but not so touching,"Now, watch this movie again, the education of several children in the film is too typical, but not so touching. But fairytale factories, crooked Charlie's houses and independent dentist's offices in the snow are all sweet.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pleasantly surprised,"Previews made me want to avoid this movie but, because I am a Johhny Depp fan, I had to see it and I'm glad I did. Visually captivating, as usual in Tim Burton's films, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory transports you. The cast, from Charlie's family to the other children, impresses you with each contributing to the overall feel of the film. My least favorite were the Oompa Loompas- more specifically- their songs. Thankfully, they are short (the songs, that is). Although the lyrics I was able to figure out were humorous, they were, all the same, hard to hear. Some scenes seemed a bit mature in their sensibility but younger children should still be captivated.Taken out of context, previews of Depp made him look freakish but in the movie he portrays Wonka as much more human than in Gene Wilder's interpretation. Depp has a brilliant sense of timing and it shows. Depp succeeded far beyond even my expectations but still, the movie is wonderful due to a great ensemble cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny and enjoyable,"I agree more or less with what Roger Ebert said about this movie: Depp's performance doesn't sink it. And I say that being, like Ebert, a big Depp fan. I was just marveling last night at his performance in ""Ed Wood."" I loved him in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"", ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" and a lot of other movies, too. But he goes off the rails in this one, and his Willy Wonka is just plain creepy and annoying.Nevertheless, the movie has so many other treats that Depp's performance can't distract us for long. There's a boat, for instance--oh my, what a boat! I haven't laughed out loud that hard inside a theater for a long, long time. And Deep Roy as the Oompa Loompas is also memorable.And then there are the squirrels. I have to say that the scene with the squirrels must be the single most imaginative, funniest idea Burton has ever come up with, and it is carried off perfectly.And although Depp's character doesn't come off well, I don't want to make it sound like it's all bad. He is very funny at certain points. But he's funny in spite of his persona, not because of it.So the movie has its flaws, but so did the original; that doesn't get in the way of it being enjoyable. To tell the truth, I think it would be impossible to make a movie of this story that didn't have its flaws. It's hard to be sure just what Dahl was getting at, if you ask me. So any interpretation will be open to question. The main thing is that it was fun for me, an adult, to watch.I would have thought that certain scenes in the movie would have been too intense for very young children, but apparently very young children are all hardened these days, because not one of the toddlers in the audience made so much as a whimper at anything.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun to Watch!,"Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have done it again! They have made another entertaining film packed with humor. The great thing about this film is that there is humor for both kids and adults! Who else would have been perfect for the film, than Johnny Depp? The man is amazing and can make any role his. He brings a different thing to Willy Wonka, than Gene Wilder done. Gene Wilder was wonderful in the original and there is no need to compare the new and old one. But I must say Johnny's version is my favorite.Johnny really did capture what a man locked in a candy factory for years would be like and in my opinion Johnny's performance is without doubt Oscar worthy or Oscar nomination worthy at the least! If you love the older version and are afraid to see the new one, don't be! Check it out! They are very different and does not even try to go by the older version.Check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I think you adults should learn to just simply enjoy the movie and appreciate it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ever been on a tour that went too fast?,"That's what Charlie and the Chocolate Factory felt like to me. In the end I was left wondering where all the time went. I mean, the movie itself was long enough, so why did everything seem so rushed? In a flash the children had the tickets and were standing at the gates, and my girlfriend pointed out that everyone already knew this part of the story and maybe they wanted to focus on the factory. But even then, the factory never really got too much focus. The 71 movie had deeper character development of the children (I mean, with the exception of Mike Teevee, these kids weren't nearly as bad as the other ones) and the search for the golden tickets (the computer that refuses to reveal where the golden ticket is), as well as an insane amount of not always good musical numbers, and yet this movie was longer and had none of that. And what with the way Burton does visuals and the quick arrival to the factory, I thought for sure there would be tons more of the cool candy quirks from the book. And I'm not sure if there was a problem in the editing or what, but scenes that could have been more in depth by just having the scene run a few seconds longer were done so quickly that it was hard for me to sympathize or associate with the characters.I've read the book and I've seen the 71 movie, and I understand that Dahl didn't care for Wilder's portrayal of Wonka, and that he disliked Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and that's OK. A lot of authors are disappointed by films adapted from their books, it happens, despite the fact that the film might be enjoyable but not true to the storyline. And while Burton's film is slightly truer than the 71, it still veers off on its own subplots that are not included in the book. I wouldn't have minded so much if it wasn't for the fact that every fifteen minutes the continuity of the film was interrupted by incredibly cheesy flashbacks. Couldn't they have come up with some other way to incorporate a back story for the chocolate genius? What was more unsettling than the flashbacks were the unnecessary narrations that did not contribute to the story.The visuals were great, of course, and this is an era where the chocolate factory's elements, including the Great Glass Elevator, could be brought to life the way they deserved to be done. However, the gizmos and gadgets in this film were not, in my opinion, as creative and wild as the 71 movie, and seemed more coldly efficient.I did love the parts of this film that did represent the book, the stories Grandpa Jo tells, the acquiring of the Oompa Loompas, and even the boat looks right finally. Also I love that we do get to see the end result of the children. Depp's Wonka was OK, he's done better in roles. He was hilarious, but he seemed a lot less excited than the Wonka in the book. Too childish. Wilder's Wonka was great, but he wasn't like the book Wonka either. No one's got that right yet.This movie wasn't bad, it was pretty good, but I think the point is that it could have been a little better if the script had slowed down a little and developed each scene, instead of having to rely on several flashbacks. Not bad, but not great. So is life.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Skip the chocolate,"This was an appalling movie. I think it would be terrifying and disturbing for children, not to mention the fact it is just plain creepy most of the time. I love dark movies, and couldn't believe how bad it was. I loved the book, and the original movie, but this one just plain stinks. To go from Captain Jack Sparrow to this Chester Molester character makes me not like Johnny Depp so much any more. The Oompa Loompa is just horrible - computer generated and gross. Only 4 or 5 chuckles for both myself and my boyfriend. (We're both in our 30's.) Don't waste your time, in my opinion. And if your children are easily spooked, this is definitely not the movie for them. I was most disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good morning starshine, THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!!","Utterly GENIUS!!! Oh this movie did EVERYTHING right. They made Willy Wonka how he should be, a guy who is weird and has been cut off from society for a long time. Then the Oompa Loompa songs were better too, apparently they were more true to the Roald Dahl songs in the book. Then the kids were more animated, like the kids just acted like really nasty kids, except Verucka who I thought was nastier in the original, but I think this Verucka is better, because she is also very proper. Then the music, I think what really made me enjoy this was the music, Danny Elfman is a very talented composer. Except if you watch ""Batman Returns"" with Michael Keaton, you'll hear the exact same music in some spots.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Disappointing Disappointing,"I've been waiting for this movie to come out for ever, Tim Burton and Jonny Depp, what can possibly go wrong, I thought to myself. But I guess everything can still go wrong. This movie is probably one of Jonny Depp's worst performances, some face gestures, that's all he does in the movie. He is not brining anything to the character, he says more in the trailer than in the movie. As for Tim Burton, now I'm not really sure why he is one of my favorite filmmakers. Big Fish is one of my favorite movies of all times, along with Edward Scissors hands, and Sleepy Hollow. Unlike his emphasize on not using CG in Big Fish, the film begins with a long CGI sequence, and follows there after in the movie. I've been holding myself back not to watch the original Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory not to compare the movie to a classic. So I am judging this movie without any comparison. The sets are amazing in the movie, and the music is great, but at times I would've rather listen to a more playful music as oppose to an over dramatic music. The songs where really not that impressive either. I guess I can not point out what I liked about the movie. Freddie Highmore is amazing and great, but I didn't even think he had a fair role, not much to say, not much to do. I guess, i can say overall, that I am just sorry to be so disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Astonishing,Tim Burton and Johnny Depp both do a wonderful job in this movie. Johnny Depps performance as Willy Wonka was outstanding and very inventive. I thought that his take on the Wonka character was much better than Wilders. Tim Burton really did a good job in this film. He created such an amazing atmosphere. Freddie Highmore was very good as Charlie. I thought that he and Depp made a closer connection with their two characters. The oompa loompas were very funny in this film. I felt that this movie was better than the older version (although i love the older version).

It's a Winner!,"So in conclusion (yes, I know it's a funny way to start a review, but as far as I'm concerned there's no argument), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the story of a love triangle among a circle of friends and two best friends torn apart by success and failure and jealousy and success. The suspense was suspenseful and the comedy was funny, but Movie Gal says read the book instead - the phone book that is - because it has less characters than this movie. I mean, what is it with these American movies??? Overall, it's a winner. But leave before the ending because it was too scary.-MOVIE GAL",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Depp Nearly Ruins It,"I usually like Johnny Depp's quirky approach to characters and credit him for making many films much better than they had any right being, but for once his instincts are off. In Tim Burton's new take on the classic children's story, he nearly derails the film with his weird, creepy interpretation of candy empresario Willy Wonka.It's not that I was comparing this to the Gene Wilder original; I didn't much like that version either (though I liked Wilder's performance more) and thought Roald Dahl's book was due for a retry. And in the first 20 minutes, leading up to the day actually spent in the chocolate factory, Burton nails Dahl's story just right. In many ways it's a perfect matching of artist and source material, and the cordial relationship shows for a while. But once Depp enters the picture, Burton gives him free reign to walk away with it, but I didn't like where he took it.People have said Depp reminds them of both Carol Burnett and Michael Jackson. Throw Carol Channing and Frances McDormand from ""Fargo"" into the mix and you get a pretty good idea of how he plays the character. The thing is, the writers screwed up big time in giving Wonka so much back story and making him a character that begs for redemption. The great thing about Wonka in the book was that he wasn't explained; he was a candy genius, his life was devoted to making great candy, end of story. The point Dahl was making was about proper ways for children to behave, not about reconnecting with your family, father/son relationships, blah, blah, blah. Dahl's book was perfection, so why mess with it? Other than the awful additions, however, this film stays much truer to the book than the 1971 version. There are some great songs by Danny Elfman for the Oompah-Loompahs to perform, the bad kids are deliciously bratty, and Freddie Highmore is really winning as Charlie. Maybe in another 30 years they'll try to adapt this book again and get it right. Or people could just stop trying to make movies of the book and (gasp!) actually read it instead.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Growing a little bit to become a child,"What can i say? I have no words for Mr. Tim, i've never seen someone who actually gets better and better with every movie,admirable, incredible, wow! Charley is an excellent movie, full of magic, colors, darkness and that juicy humor Tim can only handle like that... Tell me, weren't you watching the movie and felt like going in and eating all that chocolate? I must confess my friends, i don't like chocolate at all, but Willy Wonka's?... well that's an exception i gotta say. It's funny all the way, look at the dialogs, they are brilliant, so concise...that's perfect (print ha-ha) A real MUST SEE in capitals... It is one of the best movies i've ever seen, and the magic is i don't have to feel this or that way to watch it, i just seat back buy some pop-corn grab my glasses and look at a film which photography is amazing, which performances are outstanding, which music is as funny as all the gags... a pearl...i guess Jack Sparrow meant this when he lost his ""ship"" ha-ha",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worth at least one look,"First off, let me just point out the following: 1. I have never read the book. 2. I have never watched Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in its entirety.If you're finished picking your bottom lip up off the ground then we can continue. Why does everybody act so shocked when I reveal I have never watched the original Willy Wonka from start to finish? People act like I've deliberately sinned in the literal presence of God when I tell them this, as if I've back-handed Him and boasted, ""There's more where that came from, old man."" Come on, people, don't look so shocked. The movie wasn't THAT big of a hit ($4 million at the box office). Granted, it's a popular kid's movie, but still. The good news is that I can offer you a completely unbiased opinion.I have to admit that I wasn't exactly peeing my pants to see this movie. And if I *had* been peeing my pants just to see a movie then it would've probably been in my best interest to seek medical help. But the trailer gave me no desire to see it. The main problem in my mind was Willy Wonka just looked too goofy. The fact that he made me think of Michael Jackson didn't help. Despite the ruling of twelve jurors, I still wouldn't trust the guy to own a chocolate factory and invite kids to it. So admittedly, I went into the movie with the expectations of Tom Cruise at an amusement park with height restrictions - hope for the best but expect the worst.""All right, Johnny, if you're done being cute can you please tell us if the movie far exceeded your expectations?"" Well, it's a'ight, but I'd say ""far exceeded"" is a bit much. Visually the movie looks great, the storytelling is smooth and presents an interesting morality tale, Freddie Highmore is quite good as Charlie Bucket (the only non-annoying kid in the movie), and the chocolate world looks realistic enough that I was seriously craving candy while watching it.But on the flip side, the movie ran a little slow in parts, Willy Wonka had a tendency to be too weird for what seemed like the sake of just being weird, and I didn't care for the Oompa Loompas. After being told that the Oompa Loompas were creepy, I was quite disappointed. They're about as scary as being attacked by a bat-wielding midget in a gunfight. I know that probably doesn't make much sense to you, and I'm sure that may sound freaky, but if you've ever been in the situation then you'd really know. Oh you'd know.It's a mildly entertaining flick, but I really have no need to see it again. It neither captivated me nor enraged me to such a degree that I feel compelled to convince you one way or another on whether you should see it.I will point out that Stephanie and my cousin Nicholas are both fans of the original, and they both agree that it's better than this remake. Stephanie's main complaint was that all of the Oompa Loompa songs are different and nowhere near as good as the originals. They definitely tried to jazz things up a bit, but I found it annoying that some of the lyrics are hard to understand. When you're singing lyrics about why each of the kids is bad then that's part of the storytelling, and I shouldn't be forced to strain my ears to hear.But what I really want to know is why people think Johnny Depp running into glass and falling down is so funny? It happens twice and the audience howled with laughter each time while I sat there stone-faced. I can only imagine how hard everybody would've laughed if Willy Wonka had farted and fell down at the same time.THE GIST:Go with your instinct. Are you dying to see it? Well, if you're actually dying to see this movie then you should probably go see a doctor. No movie should bring near death upon anybody. But once you find some treatment then it's probably worth it to you to check out. I know the people at the screening I attended loved it. So be it. But if the trailer does nothing to intrigue you, and if you didn't even like the original, then save your money. This is one of those movies I'd personally wait to make a rental or catch on TV.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"I haven't seen the original. As it is, though... this movie is *awesome*","Just like ""Big Fish"" before it... ""Charlie"" is so warm, sweet, and enjoyable, I do believe Tim Burton is my favorite movie director ever.The lessons to be learned in this charming story are many, and the story is simply fun. Johnny Depp is creepier than Michael Jackson at times (his acting is fantastic). Luckily, he can be left alone with kids without lawsuits flying all over the place. The kids are perfect stereotypes for the Oompa-Loompas to trick. The scenery and stages are perfect - full of colour everywhere, yet as dark as any Tim Burton movie out there. The whole movie is a bit dark, although in a cheery kind of way. It seems as if the main characters have a ray of sunshine guiding their actions all the time, so even if you sense the desperation in Charlie's parents, and the sadness of Willy Wonka, somehow you know everything will turn out all right.Even if it's a bit slow during the first part, this has to be one of my favourite movies of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Just flat out bad, i hated it.","The 1971 Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory is one of the best kids movies of all time, Gene Wilder is wonderful, it's charming, has memorable songs, great effects and set design considering it's low budget and age and terrific performances from the child actors.
Everyone knows that movie.The Tim Burton remake is just a bad movie. I like some of Tim Burton's movies and i think Depp is a great actor but this is a major misfire.
Depp's Willy Wonka acts like he has mental problems, the songs are loud and obnoxious so you can't even make out what the lyrics are supposed to be and it all has that signature Tim Burton visual style which i do enjoy but it's so overdone now it's become a cliche.
Also the dry, sarcastic humor from the 1971 version has been replaced with annoying ""random"" and wacky nonsense and awkward silences like it's an episode of The Office or something.Avoid this dumpster fire and get your kids to watch the 1971 version, they'll love it.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"This movie was far greater than I could have ever imagined. When I first heard they were remaking the old one I didn't want to go see it at all. Now I have seen it three times! The reason for this being that i simply hate the old one! I read the original Roald Dahl book and loved it heaps. So much that I went to see the movie after I heard it was truer to the book. ( I heard Roal Dahl hated the old one too). Tim Burton , Danny Elfman and Johnny Depp ( plus the rest of the crew) have created something that is about 90% true to the book. And we have to admit thats more than the old one. The only exception being that of Willy Wonkas back story. I thought this was cleverly thought out but also unnecessary. The music in this film just makes it as close to perfect as a film can be. Danny Elfmans Oompa-Loompa songs are excellent and I love the way he used Roald Dahls original lyrics. ( They are much better than the lame ones from the first movie)Although I thought that in the movie it was actually a little hard to hear and understand the lyrics. So I went back to the book plus listened to the songs from the soundtrack to understand them better. Tim Burtons creativity in this movies is some what weird and whacky. But I love it all the same. Its just as though it has jumped out of my imagination and onto the big screen. Johnny Depps performance is hilarious! A lot of people don't like the film because of his just plain weirdness. But I think that someone who has lived in a factory his whole life deserves to be a little bit weird. This is a very colourful and creative film that should be seen be everyone young or old!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good morning starshine...the earth says hello,"Holy crap! this movie just proves that Johnny Depp is the greatest. His roles vary so much that you can only stare in awe. Seriously, if he can go from playing Edward Scissorhands, to Don Juan (or whatever), to Captain Jack Sparrow, to James Barry (spelling?) to Willy Wonka and play every role to perfection...wow. He is king and i bow down to him.I honestly thought this movie was insanely great. Yea parts of it were confusing but its willy wonka we're talking about. if it wasn't crazy it wouldn't be right.AW! and charlie was so cute! I love the eccentricness of Tim Burton and how he can make the one movie i hated (the original) into one of my favorites just proves that he is a man of genius...also...the oompa loompas' songs were way cooler in this movie...and the squirrels were about 100000000000000000000 times better than any duck/goose as for me i am off to make muffins.",,Anonymous,Comedy
If you have seen the original...don't bother,"I think most of the comments saying how fabulous this movie is are from those who never saw the original. The original and the songs really captured the innocence of the book. This version while contemporary does miss a lot of the original subtleties of both the book and movie. I thought the original Veruka Salt was much better. Although in all fairness this Agustus, Mike Teevee and Violet are better. Actually Violet in the original was pretty good so it is a toss up. The parents in the original were all much better. Now for Depp vs. Wilder, depends on your age. I will take Wilder although Depp did do a decent job with lots of originality to a very structured character.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Not your father's ""Chocolate Factory""","CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005) *** Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore, David Kelly, Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, Missi Pyle, James Fox, Deep Roy, Christopher Lee, Annasophia Robb, Julia Winter, Jordan Fry, Philip Wiegratz, Adam Godley, Franziska Troegner. Filmmaker Tim Burton's dark comic twist to the children's classic novel and the cult film ""Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"" and Depp's gleefully misanthropic channeling of Mr. Rogers, Carol Channing and Michael Jackson make a Dynamic Duo again for the most part with Depp as a mad-as-a-hatter Wonka inviting 5 guests to his globally famous chocolate factory and Highmore (his co-star from ""Finding Neverland"" and proving to be a real talented find) as the titular tyke attempting to compete against four other spoiled brats. The true star is the amazing production design concocted by Alex McDowell that overwhelms the visuals and Danny Elfman's hit-and-miss re-interpretations of Roald Dahl's novel's lyrics to the fate of the guests. What is misbegotten is the additions of a familial flashback by adapter John August in 'explaining' Wonka and the hyper extended exponentialism of the creepy little Roy as the Oompa Loompas.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My second favorite Tim Burton film,"I like this movie better than the 1971 version. The characters are great and I love the music. The scenes with the Oompa Loompas singing are my favorite scenes. I love this version of Willy Wonka more than the one in the 1971 version. He's way weirder, crazier, and funnier. My only problem with Willy Wonka is that how he looks and talks kind of reminds me of Michael Jackson. The difference is, Michael Jackson is a pedophile. I think that Charlie was way to perfect. I like how he acts, but it's strange how someone could be that flawless. It's funny that the original film is called Willy Wonka but is focused on Charlie and that the Chocolate Factory but is focused on Willy Wonka.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A curious rendition of an old song,"I really didn't know what to expect when I paid for my ticket to see this movie. I KNEW that it would be nothing like the old movie, and much more like the book. Alas, I was correct. But therein lies the problem. While the classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory dwells less on the book and more from the excellent adapted screenplay, the new one stays almost entirely on the book source. What's the problem with this? It's a children's book. There's not a whole lot to it. Just like in the book, most of the lines go to Willy Wonka or Charlie, and sometimes Grandpa. Only occasionally do the other characters say something interesting. The kids are interesting enough, especially Augustus Gloop, who I liked enormously better in this one than the old (haha get it, enormous...). But anyway, the parents just pretty much follow their kids and don't offer much enthusiasm for anything. In the old version, the parents were just as interesting and diverse as the snotty kids they brought to the factory, adding humor and substance to the story. Not so in here.Johnny Depp was very interesting as Willy Wonka. Not quite as inviting as Gene Wilder (who did an excellent job in the original), but very unique. Like the rest of the movie, he's more like the description the book offers than in the original. I think I would have liked him better if he had better things to say.That goes for pretty much the entire movie. The set design and everything were as they should be, but the script is what fell behind and dragged these marvelous actors with it. The movie would have hummed with magic and whimsy and been much funnier if the screenwriters had stepped aside from the book at times and allowed some creativity to enter their brain flow.The oompa loompas are much better in the old one. nuff said about that.So basically, the old one is better. It may not be fair to judge the two movies, since Tim Burton didn't try to imitate the old one, but overall Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is just a better movie. I'm still a Burton fan, and this movie is by all means infinitely better than his last ""reimagining"" (planet of the apes). Watch this movie if you've wanted to, just don't buy a bag of high hopes at the concessions.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You must be on Drugs to like this crappy remake!!!!,"I don't get the voting on this movie. Talk about stuffing the ballot box. Johnny Depp should be ashamed of himself and so should Tim Burton. I can't think of one thing good to say about this movie except when the credits rolled. I don't know who Depp was trying to be here, but it didn't work. A cross between his Ed Wood character and Michael Jackson it seems but done really bad. Just because Tim Burton and Depp are involved doesn't mean it should be given a thumbs up. The Burton/Depp groupies are definitely at work here with liking this turd. Hey Hollywood, do the world a favor and stop making remakes and comic book stories. How about an original idea????

Burton And Depp Do It Again,"Reteaming for their fifth collaboration in 15 years. Tim Burton directs Johnny Depp in Charlie & The Chocolate Factory. I don't understand all the have this movie gets. I for one found it as enjoyable as the 1971 version. It's very silly, but visually stunning and I enjoyed a hell lot of it.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. AnnaSophia Robb as Violet Beauregarde, Julia Winter as Veruca Salt, Jordan Fry as Mike Teavee, and the boy with the funniest line In the movie Philip Wiegratz as Augustus Gloop (His delivery of said line is hilarious.) are all splendidly horrid. Then there is Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket. I love this kid, I think he is superb in everything I have seen him in, (check out Finding Neverland and August Rush) Burton does a great job getting great performances from his child actors.As for the adult cast David Kelly as Grandpa Joe is a delight, Helena Bonham Carter (in her first of five pairings with Depp) as Mrs. Bucket is surprisingly less cooky than one would imagine, and it's a true case of less is more. Noah Taylor is fine as Mr. Bucket. Missi Pyle is fun as the ambitious glory driven pushy mother Mrs. Beauregarde. Christopher Lee has a small role as Dr. Wilbur Wonka and Deep Roy is great as every Oompa- Loompa. Then there is Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.Back when this was made Depp was one of my top 10 actors, but sadly there is something missing in his work since this time (with the exception of Sweeney Todd) as he seems to be lost in big budget sequels to the 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' and underwhelming movies. I was bored all the way through 'The Tourist' but I at least stayed awake. I fell asleep during 'The Rum Diary' and 'Public Enemies' (his best movie since Sweeney Todd) was a missed opportunity, Although I liked Depp's performance. There is an energy around Depp (that unless he is working with Burton) has been missing in most of his work between then and now.The film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is very sincere, honest and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor. Johnny Depp was so impressed with Highmore's performance when they co started in 'Finding Neverland' that he recommended that Tim Burton hire him for the role of Charlie Bucket.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
King of The Remakes,"Ever since the original Edward Scissorhands success of Tim Burton, Burton seems more content to try and remake prior films than to go after something new & original. His results doing this are mixed depending upon which remake you look at.This one is one of his better efforts at remaking Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. His cast includes Johnny Depp (Chocolat experienced) and a good supporting group. The original Gene Wilder film is not a classic and this new version does not raise that level.While I can't recommend this as a classic film, it is as watchable as the original, kind of like comparing Gene Wilder & Depp is comparing a Hershey Bar with a Nestle one. Both these films are a different flavor of the same thing, both with good taste, but neither a really premium brand of chocolate too die for.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tim Burton Couldn't Tell a Plot if it Hit Him in the Face,"I thought Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would be better than this. Unfortunately Tim Burton again manages to screw me out of $9.25. Granted I didn't have high hopes from this movie to begin with, but I believed it would be a more mature version of book than what was done in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (I happen to like this adaptation because Gene Wilder is enchanting as the eccentric factory owner). Tim Burton introduced a new form of dragging with this movie. He completely omits the main character from the film in favor of developing a back story for almost every character. The one with the longest and most intricate back story is Willy Wonka. His back story encompasses the entire second and third parts of the movie (that being the factory tour in flashbacks and the post factory tour). The only thing it accomplishes is explain Johnny Depp's portrayal of the character, which wasn't bad. Wonka is presented as a man-child with deep fears stemming from the authority of parents. This is why I prefer Gene Wilder's portrayal in the 1971 version because he acts like he's in control of the entire factory. He's an adult who sympathizes with childish surroundings. Depp acts like he's completely oblivious to his surroundings, which makes you wonder how he can get anything done. He acts almost like Howard Hughes, but without the get things done attitude and need to advance technology to the next generation, which you'd think be needed to run a factory and keep the Deep Roy's alive. Once you think the movie's over your hit in the face with the third part of the movie, which tries to tie up Wonka's back story. To make sure you know Charlie is still in the movie they run a short story on him before finishing up the Wonka plot. You wonder why this adaptation wasn't called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory because Charlie had a much bigger role in the 1971 version. The movie ends in a nice little package but it is seriously deformed by Tim Burton's inclusion. The chocolate factory has the same Gothic styling and abrasive colors seen in every one of his movies. We know you have a signature, but Jesus try something else for a change. The musical numbers were also very weak. I read somewhere the lyrics came from the book, but the singing and the music were so awful I barely noticed them. Deep Roy needs to be shot so he cannot contaminate the rest of the world. If I wanted to see a bad musical number I would go see Rent. I only take solace in the fact this movie distracted Burton long enough for Batman Begins to correctly represent the Batman character. Thank you Tim Burton for not touching Batman in favor of adapting a newer version of the chocolate factory. You have truly placed yourself beside filmmakers like Ed Wood. At least he made bad movies with much smaller budgets.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Harken back to the days of Beetlejuice,Well now you see that Johnny Depp wont just stagger around looking interestingly attractive to the female audiences. He actually doesn't seem to care for some of his own self-created image of the melancholy yet charismatic goof-ball. Instead he decides (or it was decided) that he could play a role similar to Michael Keaton in Beetlejuice ---by that I mean slightly annoying and uncomfortable--- lets not forget some of the common elements of Burton films--- when he is making one for the fans and when he is making one for himself--- i think that this falls in the latter category.Did i find that this movie was good? Well his modern adaption and the depiction of characters went fairly well but in general it didn't jive all the way with a sense of charm or original material--- most of it was the set/props and the look--- the interactions of the characters was fairly diluted and --- yes there was some good flashback scenes of W. Wonka that I felt J. Depp excelled in--- overall not the best--- somehow it just didn't come together.,,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Comical,"This movie,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, is one of my favorite movie. First,songs sung by workers in the chocolate factory are interesting. It matches the scene of the chocolate factory. They are also comical and rhythmical.I think they stands for funny of Willy Wonka and his factory. Second,Willy Wonka looks very funny.Johnny Depp also acts Willy Wonka very well. I think Willy Wonka and Charlie are good balance because Charlie is mature of his age,and Willy Wonka looks like child. Finally, but I do not know very well the last scene because I think there are some skips about Willy Wonka and Charli. I want to know about other 4 children's episode after going to the chocolate factory. This movie is very interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Another Burton & Depp Film!,"Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have worked together before in other films like Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands. In this film, Depp plays the strange Willy Wonka who has perfect teeth and a strange personality. We learn in this film about his dentist father played by Christopher Lee CBE (he should be Sir Christoper Lee) but that's another story. Poor Willy Wonka who wear a head brace to make his teeth perfect. He puts five chocolate bars with gold certificates. The lucky winners include the obese and slob, German Augustus, the spoiled rotten Veruca and her father played by James Fox, another great British actor, the blue girl from Georgia who is a champion like her mother, the troubled boy, and Charlie Bucket and his grandpa Jones. Charlie is poor and it is obvious that his family is struggling. Helen Bonham Carter's teeth are as poor as Willy's is white and perfect.

A Sweet Tour,"I've been anticipating this movie's arrival ever since April, and now, FINALLY, last night I was able to see it. It wasn't in the main theaters anymore, in fact, it was only showing at the cheap $2 per person theater. Nevertheless, I was extremely excited to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of the summer's greatest hits.From the first few moments, my eyes were wide with disbelief. From the Bucket's crooked house to Willy Wonka's somewhat wacky hairdo, my jaw was on the ground. The plot, the cast, the scenery, all of it was magnificent.First, the plot. I already knew the story of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and the five golden tickets placed in five ordinary candy bars from watching the original movie as well as reading the book. This movie, unlike the older version of the film, was much more magical and a tad bit more believable. The inside of the factory was glorious, and Willy Wonka was just as crazy as he could be.And speaking of Willy Wonka, it's time to move on to the cast. I would bet most of my money on the fact that Johnny Depp is going to get another Academy Award nomination for the third year in a row. He portrays Wonka to his brilliance, complete childish antics and expressions. Freddie Highmore as Charlie is just as good as Depp. I haven't seen him in Finding Neverland, but my dad and I intend to rent that movie just to see how both Depp and Highmore act in it. The children chosen to play the genuine brats that, well, in most of their cases (aka not Veruca) find the golden ticket, are gems of the screen as well. They play the characters to their nasty core and are the kids you love to hate. The members of the Bucket family are wonderful too, especially Grandpa Joe and the other grandparents.The inside of the factory is perfectly magical, and because of this, the movie had its final touch of greatness.Wonderful direction, brilliant cast, and much more make Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a tour through the factory that you cannot miss. It doesn't take a golden ticket to go see this film, so I recommend seeing it to anyone who hasn't already.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Movie looks great , but Wonka is a dud.","I've seen both and have a soft spot for the original admittedly. I have no knowledge of the book so I can't speak to what is more faithful,etc...All I know is I tried to go into the new take with an open mind. I liked many aspects of the new version better than the original, (the flow of the story, the more three dimensional portrayal of Charlie and his family, no dreadful 'Cheer up Charlie' musical interludes) but I felt the Depp Wonka lacked the twisted humor and mystery of Wilder's Wonka.Wilder's Wonka was strange, offbeat, and bizarre but, in the grand scheme of things, with a purpose. The Burton/Depp Wonka is strange, offbeat (but more in an uncomfortable not particularly funny way),weird, and emotionally stunted man. Not much to wonder to him.For all I know, the new take on Wonka is more in line with the character in the book and I can appreciate the attempt at a different direction; it just didn't work for me. I'm glad I saw the new version, but I was not all that satisfied. Just one man's opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Disappointing and heartless,"There is no heart to this movie. I had no idea what to hope for or fear. The first 30 minutes are entertaining as they mainly focus on the Bucket family, but as soon as we step foot in the chocolate factory (not nearly as lush as one would like), the film dies. The Oompa Loompas have far too much screen time and you can't understand the lyrics to most of their songs. While Johnny Depp's Wonka is humorous in his sissy way (reminiscent of his performance in Sleepy Hollow I might add), his character ""arc"" (as tiny as it is) is not believable. The golden-ticket winner kids (with perhaps the exception of Violet) do not improve upon their predecessors. I didn't mind Burton's darker interest per say, but all in all very disappointing.

A great re-make,"I saw this movie in Johnstown, NY on the night before I left for camp. I wanted to see it, and boy, am I glad I did. It was sooooo much better than the original. Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors, but he was slightly creepy as Willy Wonka. Which I think was intended. Freddie Highmore re-teams with Depp, after playing Peter in ""Finding Neverland"", and plays a wonderful Charlie Bucket. He has the strongest performance of the child actors. The only weak performance was Philip Wiegratz as Augustus Gloop, which I think was because he wasn't on for very long. My favorite character, like the original, was Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb). They changed her a little bit for the new movie, but she still was quite enjoyable.

"terrible version, just awful","The original Willy Wonka left things unsaid for us, the Burton remake beats us over the head with elements because we must be too stupid to understand anything. Why does Charlie have to have a dad in the remake? Would it hurt society if he didn't? There is no warmth to the film or the characters. I hated the weird voiced and, at times, mean spirited Wonka. The oompa loompas were terrible and it seemed lazy to me by duplicating one person. I can't go on because I don't remember the other things that bothered me and there is no way that I can put myself through that poor excuse for a movie to refresh my memory. I am trying to repress that part of my memory. Awful.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stark raving Wonka Bonkers!,"First and foremost, I have not read Roald Dahl's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Most of you will think ""then how can I review it?"". Well listen up; this means I can keep an open mind on certain elements as of course I won't be judging the entire film purely on its faithfulness. But going by the accurate title this time round, I figure Tim Burton is going down the old 'faithfulness' road.Little in the previous Gene Wilder film did we ever assume Wonka is crazy. In Burton's new adaptation we are given a number of hints such as Wonka repeating himself when he is not aware. His obvious social detraction from society and the misencounter of love. After spending a number of decades in a chocolate factory along with 'little people' you'd expect to be slightly bonkers.Towards the end of the movie I began to feel the heart of this film is about the Wonka's exploration of 'what is love?' Given that you know from either the book or the Gene Wilder version that nearing the end Wonka offers the factory to Charlie on the condition that he lives there by himself. Wonka has trouble understanding his negative choice because he hasn't felt love or a connection to people before.Here is where Burton's film has something over the 1971 movie; now we are given a number of flashbacks from Wonka's childhood and his story of why he lives the way he does now. We understand him more than we did in the 1971 adaptation.Now lets get down to it. Is Johnny Depp a better Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder? Take a seat. I'd guess those die hard Dahl fans will say 'yes', going by those I heard on the way from the cinema to the car anyway. Personally, Gene Wilder is much more of a comfort to watch because his fun and joy for the world is shown much more humanely. His hobbled entrance to the film was such a great example of his playfulness. We can relate to Wilder's Wonka much more...but maybe we're not supposed to. We have to take on board Wonka has been self-isolated the majority of his life, lives in a chocolate factory alone with a number of Umpa Lumpas and as a result of this, how can he be like the rest of society and how can we ever think for a second he's like us???There is one problem I had with this film and that was the new Umpa Lumpa songs. My god they got on my tits. It just didn't fit in the tone of the film at all. They were far too Modern Pop; the song in the squirrel scene was almost...Backstreet Boyish. Danny Elfman is the master, and achieves this title by his atmospheric soundtrack. He's a complimentary to fairy tales. He hit it on the nail with the actual Willy Wonka song which is featured during Wonka's entrance and the first trailer for the film. So why the hell couldn't he carried on hitting that nail all the way down with the Umpa Lumpa songs?I really should read the book though.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A largely faithful sweet treat,"Having read the book, and seen the film starring Gene Wilder, I was pleased with the new film, and the fact that they stayed pretty close to the Roald Dahl book. The pluses were the chocolate garden, the pre-story Oompa Loompa scene in their natural habitat, and the squirrel scene (far better than the golden goose in the old film). Not so good was the flash-back to Wonka's father, or the reuniting scene, which didn't appear in the book. Also I feel Tim Burton missed a trick leaving no way for the sequel film following the book.Unlike ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", which as I type is being televised and looks very dated (pinned at all corners to the 1970's), I feel this 2005 version will remain timeless and a classic suitable for the audience the book was intended - children of all ages. The casting was excellent, with good use of the big name stars, particularly Johnny Depp as the most excellent Willy Wonka. The dirty city scene was so fitting for Charlie and his family, and the iconic chocolate factory in the midst of it.However, one word of caution. Before you let your younger children see the movie, I suggest they read the book first. The morals of the story will not shock when seen in all their graphic glory in the film. But even if your children don't read the book, I would commend it as a good stand-alone view just so long as you explain the somewhat real-looking nasties are not real at all.I do admire Tim Burton's work. When your little urchin is older, do see Corpse Bride!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A unique film that can be enjoyed by all ages,"Many people tend to bash this film and call it a ""terrible remake"", but I disagree with those statements. Roald Dahl is the man responsible for one of the most creative and likable stories ever written, and seeing it get transformed into the vibrant film adaptation that this is was truly amazing. Yes, there was another film adaptation years before this one was released, but are people so blind that they can't see the obvious differences in special effects technology that this movies possesses? Speaking of the special effects, they were simply fantastic in this film. They made Willy Wonka's land of candy look so much more colorful than it did in the original film, and it made everything simply fun to sit there and stare at mindlessly in the sheer awe of its beauty.But pretty and cool-looking special effects do NOT make a movie great (See Ultraviolet). But however, this film has FAR more to offer than special effects, believe me. Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was absolutely stellar, as I believe everyone expected it to be, since Depp is known for playing off-beat characters so very well. Freddie Highmore did excellent with the role of Charlie also. This kid could really be bigtime in the future.This film had it all- Uniqueness, Diversity, Comedy, and as mentioned, Great Acting. If you're looking for a fun film that will please all age groups young and old, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the ideal choice.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Another bad remake,"Once again, we are subjected to greed and self promotion as another classic gets copied by today's filmmakers who shamelessly abandon creativity.First of all, let me get this off my massive chest. Yes, it is a REMAKE. The original was made in 1971. The arguments about the changing of the title or that it is closer to the book have no merit. It is a COPY of the 1971 classic with the SAME characters and basic storyline.Johnny Depp's performance falls so far short of Gene Wilder's and this is obvious to everyone. Wilder's wild, eccentric, poetic, unpredictable style was superior to Depp's reclusive, socially-moronic, mumbling, flashbacking attempt. Speaking of flashbacking, was that really necessary? Christopher Lee is a fantastic actor but this is wasted on one of today's ideas of having to pick through the origin of some of the best misunderstood characters in entertainment. Why oh why do people feel the need to go back in time to see Darth Vader, the Grinch, and now Wonka's child highlights when leaving it all alone is much more mysterious?The kids......2005 Charlie looks like an imp with over sized ears. Whenever I look at him I just can't get by those bat-wings! 2005 Verucca, though cute and talented, was nowhere near as bratty as the original. Making 2005 Mike Teevee a video game freak was to be in touch with the times, the original Mike was still superior. The original Violet was more obnoxious which equals better. This new one with the win-at-all-costs mentality falls short.The CG-generated Oompa Loompas were a lame joke. Mass producing that goofy looking filipino was totally lame. Though their songs were taken from the book, I thought the Augustus one was OK but I remain faithful to the original Loompa songs which were far superior, humorous and ingenious. I also remain faithful to the original 1971 movie which filled me with magic and adventure as a child.I also remain faithful to the original in terms of grading. 2005, made for the ignorant who missed the first one, is a failure. 2 out of 10 stars.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The trailers don't do it justice!,"There's no doubt you've seen the trailers for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but there's also no doubt the trailers left you doubtful. This is unfortunate, because this movie is outstanding and a cant-miss-fall-thriller... on-the-edge-of-your-pants-action-packed-comedy/romance-thriller. You wont be able to stay in your seat with cameos popping in every 17.6 SECONDS! Neo, The Terminator, Mr. Bean, The Godfather, George Lopez, and Chuck Norris all appear in this film. The plot is much closer to the book than the original musical of course, which features the nutty squirrels, the Oompa-Loompa background story, the evil natures of the children, and of course Chuck Norris. After Marly receives the golden ticket in his Willy Wonka Trading Card Booster Pack, he takes is uncle Buck to the Wonka Soda factory to find the truth behind Willy Wonka's mysterious nature. After touring the facilities for about 10 minutes they decide to take the WonkaVator to the moon and see if it is really made of cheese. (this is where the terminator shows up).

VERY disappointing to say the least compared to Mel Stuart's version,"I, like many others loved the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I felt connected with Charlie, and I felt as if I was the one inheriting the Factory. It was a classic, but by today's standards it looks very outdated. The main problem with Burtons ""adaptation"" of the book, was I felt he went for style over substance. Sure, this one looks better, the factory and elevator are superb, but this just ISN'T a good movie AT ALL. The oompa loopas in this one are all the same lame person(Deep Roy), and I was very upset over that, seeing as I loved the ""Oompa Loopa Doo Ba Dee Doo, I've got a Brand new puzzle for you"" songs, NOT the dreadful ""songs"" in this one. I just couldn't get into the children at all, Veruca was poorly done, same with Mike Teevee, Violet. I didn't buy Deep for 1 second as Wonka, not 1. He was just annoying, humorless, and creepy. Grandpa Joe sucked in this one for sure. There wasn't one scene where I thought that there was a reason for remaking it except for money. Then there's this pointless sub-plot with Wonka and his father. The point is, even though Mel Stuart's version steered away from the book, it made for a MUCH BETTER movie. DO NOT see this one expecting a well done movie at all, in fact it is quite the contrary.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
wow,"i must admit that i was a little sceptical when i heard that a new Wonka film was on the books but i changed my mind after i saw it. its absolutely amazing! Burton's use of fiction, fantasy and reality comes to great context of this whole genre and i will now admit that he has done the film justice!!Gene Wilder was a brilliant Wonka in the first film but Depp has made Wonka into a slightly twisted yet fantastic character. The scenes and settings created a whole new fantasy world that the viewer would just love to delve deep into and explore the whole array of lights and textures.

Has enough new stuff to keep it fresh and different from the original movie ...,"I had mixed feelings when I was about to watch this. On the one hand, Johnny Depp is a great actor ... he really personalizes the characters he plays, and makes them so distinct. On the other hand, I'm not much of a fan of Tim Burton, although I do like some of his movies. Then I also read a bad review of this one, so .....I was pleasantly surprised that there was enough new stuff in the movie, while still following the general theme. It's different from the Gene Wilder version, but in some ways the same. I laughed quite a few times too.I guess my only gripe with this is the build-ups to supposedly major scenes didn't pack as much of a punch; it had a very even-keel feel throughout, which I felt that Burton could've done a better job at.But by all means, go watch it. :)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Another goof,"It seems to me that nobody noticed an oddity about the Iraqi flag displayed in the flag room. It is established in the movie that 20 years ago, when Grandpa worked for Wonka, Wonka was already an adult (played by Johnny Depp). In the flag room scene, however, we see Wonka as a boy walking past the Iraqi flag that contains the words ""Allahu akbar"" between the stars. As we all know, Saddam Hussein added those words during ""Desert Storm"" (on 14 January 1991, to be precise), which was less than 20 years ago.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Review,"Charlie and the Chocolate factory was an excellent feel good film. It gave great insight into the master chocaltier and explained a lot of un-answered questions left from the original Gene Wilder flick. Johnny Depp portrayed Willy Wonka expertly and i feel it was a great role for him, he and Tim Burton are one of the best actor/director duos of the 21st Century. Freddie Highmore gave Charlie Bucket a realistic feel and gave him a more developed character. The ending was the most climatic where Charlie was torn between the factory and his family, but it also helped to develop Depp's character further because he finally realized that a family is everything to a little boy, just because he didn't have a good childhood it didn't mean that he had to frown upon others. Christopher Lee portrayed his father excellently, giving the character a cold hard repressive state. He loved his son but he just didn't know how to express that love, until the end. The final scene being the most heart warming. It was a great movie and it is one when it comes to DVD in Australia i will buy and watch over and over again, Tim Burton is an excellent director.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Worst Remake of All Time,"Johnny Depp played some cross between Michael Jackson and Gary Coleman, not the mysterious old man portrayed by Gene Wilder in the original. Depp acted disturbed and perversely childish. Tim Burton took too many liberties, significant parts of the story from the book that were included in the original were cut from this movie. The ending tried to tack on a message about the importance of family, however that failed miserably. The music was probably the worst part, the songs were not cute and catchy, but jazzy and Vegas-like, with unintelligible lyrics sung by Deep Roy (Umpa Luma). Roy was also miss-cast looked too much like a human which detracted from the illusion. Visuals took little advantage of the advances in technology over the past few decades, some scenes such as the chocolate room (chocolate meadow and river) were much more elaborate in the original despite being filmed 35 years earlier. Finally, there were a lot of inconsistencies of time and place which did not seem purposeful and detracted from the story.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I saw the original when I was 10 on the big screen,"I was there when Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory came out. Yes, that was back when all movies were on a big screen! It has been my very favorite movie ever since. I watched it at least 3 times a month since it came out on video years ago. I did not think there could ever be a remake that I would like of this wonderful story. My husband and I went to see Charlie and the Chocolate Facotory at the local IMAX theater. We loved it! It is enough the same and enough different. Johnny Depp was fantastic! I still love the old one but it is a toss up of which one is my favorite. I will have to get the DVD and view it many more times to determine. As for those that feel it is too scary for young children...NOT! They said the same thing about the first one when I was a kid. It is great for kids to watch! It teaches that parents that don't do their job...end up with spoiled brats! And spoiled brats get nothing but pain and agony and nice little children (with Character)win. This tone is in the original and in the remake.

A Good Update,"This movie is good but everyone who says it is not as good as the first version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has hit the nail right on the head. That isn't too much of a surprise though when you consider what a timeless classic the first film with Gene Wilder was, he was so great in the role not anyone could measure up, not even Johnny Depp who is one of my favourite actors. Depp does a great job but he still doesn't quite compare to the way Wilder played it. The effects are obviously much better and the film looks great but this version of the movie doesn't seem to have the same heart as the first film, and it isn't really as touching. Still this movie is worth seeing and is still good, I think a lot of kids today would prefer this version even because it just looks more modern and has such a great set and effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sucks to be Willy,"As cheesy and sometimes laughably bad as the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka film was it at least came through with the goods in the end. This much slicker and overall better version makes a few fatal mistakes and collapses with 15 minutes left.I guess having our current Weirdo Wonder Boy in a role as an eccentric recluse makes any harm done to the overall story justifiable. Therefore, we have a ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" in which Charlie isn't even the main character.In fact, to call Charlie a character at all would be a major embellishment. Our Charlie starts the film as the Perfect Little English Boy and end exactly as he began. He has nothing to learn from Willy Wonka or anyone else for that matter.The only story arc belongs to good old Willy. I enjoyed Depp's performance for the most part but I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for him to tell us something worth hearing. The movie is ultimately a failure because he has nothing to tell us. He's a nut, nothing more.The only point the movie has is made painfully obvious 10 minutes in, everything else is pure eye candy.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Neither Better Nor Worse Than The Original,"CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (3 outta 5 stars) A decent enough version of the classic children's story which was the basis for the beloved musical ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" I didn't find this movie any better or worse than the original version... just different. Johnny Depp's bizarre performance as Willy Wonka is definitely the best thing about this movie... just as Gene Wilder was the best thing about the original ""Wonka"". I was a bit puzzled as to why they decided not to use the original songs from the first movie... but then they went ahead and created new songs for the Oompa-Loompas anyway... I guess it was cheaper to make up new songs than to pay the original composer for the rights to re-record them. I like the character of Charlie more in this new version that the annoying little goody-goody in the first movie... but I think I prefer Jack Albertson as the original grandpa. The storyline basically is the same as the earlier flick... except for the conclusion (I'm not sure which ending is closer to what was written in Roald Dahl's novel... I guess I'll have to read it one day). I was a bit dismayed by the fact that the greedy, nasty kids in this movie don't seem to learn a lesson from their harrowing experiences in the chocolate factory... they seem just as selfish and ill-mannered when they leave as when they arrived... you'd think a near-death experience would shake them up a bit more...",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Good Effort!,"The film was a good effort. Johnny Deep gave a decent performance, Charlie also. Very good shots and settings. The parts they changed ruined the film and that is why a 7 is the best they can have. No outstanding acting. But the magical feeling and the mood and genres created were hit right on target and some feeling was expressed. Some good one liners as well. And fantastic Liz Smith was amusing. A good winters film, a good family movie. I am harsh with marks, but from me a 7 does. So a good effort. And recommended. But for me, the key part missing was that special bond between Wonka and Charlie. I remember the two having a really sweet kind of bond in the first one, this was nowhere to be seen in this one.So to improve they could have- Used more character relations between Wonka and Charlie, stuck to the original plot and get some more funny and embarrassing moment of that kid/child vulgar humour over.

Too dark to watch,"If you love kids, don't let them watch this darkness but warn them against its cruelty; have them see the 1971 Wilder version instead: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/ though even it is regrettably dark, parental discretion & warning strongly advised. I have no desire to be negative about Johnny Depp's considerable gifts; it's rather the film's monstrous concept that's the problem, though I've no idea whether this or the 1971 Wilder version is closer to the book original. While Gene Wilder's 1971 version is a not-quite-so-dark delight, this darker version is needlessly and gratuitously cruel (not knowing which version is truer to the book original), kind of like the current vile, sadistic ""angry birds"" phenomenon that kids also don't need, as harshly as the cold, selfish, senseless world in which they're made to suffer already seeks their destruction. So much for the high price of post-Christian anti-God ""freedom"" (e.g. the hypocritical Star Trek delusions of godhood) where the imagined ""cure"" is vastly worse than the disease so grossly ignorantly and hypocritically condemned by lawless fascists, as the once great and literate civilization sinks ever lower into gross illiterate barbarism, as seen in this film, significantly surpassed by the 1971 rendition & its wonderful musical nature, seen at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I hope we get to see more of the two of them together. But not in a Charlie and the chocolate factory 2. That would ruin the gem the movie is on its own.Grandpa is also a gem.

"Bigger, Not Better","The biggest problem with ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" occurs when you compare it to the Anthony Newley/Leslie Bricusse musical version, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" And there are a lot of comparisons to be made between these two films.Of course, this version has the Burton touch of bizarre whimsy. And Freddie Highmore is charming enough as Charlie Bucket, but he doesn't have much to do. In fact, all of the golden ticket holders perform well with what they get. But the fact is, there isn't any way even a talented director like Burton could tell this tale any better, so he did the only thing he could do: he told it bigger.Unfortunately, there is not a lot of charm to this ""oversized"" edition, and even the opening titles, which mimics the original candy factory production sequence, seems more sinister, not inviting as the original was. The point was this candy factory is where people wanted to go, and that attraction is missing here. And without that attraction, why would anyone want to buy the candy bars to win the chance to visit it?The use of Deep Roy as every oompa-loompa was a somewhat amusing trick and those production numbers featuring him/them were good. Generally speaking, the special effects overall are staggering, which is where this version excels beyond the first.But Johnny Depp cannot equal Gene Wilder's brilliant portrayal, and that's where the film lacks the most. Despite the constant denials, Depp seems to be channeling a latter day Michael Jackson in his performance. How could such a freak have created such a massive factory? Where Wilder's Wonka could convincingly be thought of as a well planned businessman, Depp's Wonka is just a glorified ten year old or Pee-Wee Herman. Who would believe that such an innocent could make everything in that factory happen?Even with this criticism, I can say this is not a horrible film in the least, it's just not as good as the first. When there is a moment in the film that is similar to the original (and there are many such moments), it is clear where it fails. And the irony is the original film, which had Willy Wonka's name in the title, probably should have been the name of this film, with several looks into the past of the chocolatier.Despite this, if we could only keep either ""Willy Wonka"" or ""Charlie,"" this would not be the one to survive.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I give it two thumbs up!!!,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a great family film. Johnny Depp did an amazing job of playing the crazy character of Willy Wonka. It really shows what a great actor can do. Also the child who plays Charlie (Freddie Highmore) is adorable!! Freddie really makes his character believable and he so gosh darn cute that I would think that would be enough motivation to see it!(Not to mention Johnny Depp). All the characters have great chemistry on the screen which also makes the movie so much fum to watch. This version of the film is so much better than the classic version starring Gene Wilder. The old one is very creepy but this new one is very different and has a lot more humor. The new movie also goes along very well with the book. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is definitely worth seeing. Tim Burton has done it again!,,Anonymous,Comedy
Redundant remake but they had some fun with it.,"I won't say this isn't enjoyable in a high fructose, corn syrup drenched, blockbustery way.It really isn't Roahl Dahl's Charlie, it's Tim Burton's Charlie with Dahl left far behind. (Actually I suppose it's the screenwriter's Charlie, whoever that is, I'm too lazy to check).Grotesquely funny though never quite as much as it thinks it is, they really fanfic this s#@* up with Wonka getting a back story even. The whole thing has a luridness that can be hard to get used to, but is weirdly appropriate for what was always a rather bitter-not-so-sweet story.Charlie is similar to his counterpart from the other movie yet strangely synthetic and hard to like. The depiction of the loving but poor family is way too maudlin.The other kids are actually quite captivating. They're bratty but they've got a good bit of spunk (Or should I say spice? ...no) and they are a pleasure to watch with some great young acting behind them, especially a really Violet Beauregard.Depp's pantomime Wonka is by turns fun and painful. It's Johnny does what he can but the script should have picked a lane. You can be funny and creepy at the same time but the ingredients were just applied in the wrong quantities.The imagery is imaginative but it can often look pretty fake.Ultimately, nothing close to the magical, funny, emotional powerhouse it seems to think it's capable of being but if you go in expecting it to be trash it's kitsch good fun.Like the book, the narrative is flawed by the real conflict ending way too early and relying too much on coincidences.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Adequately charming and entertaining. True to the dark and creepy book by the dark and creepy Roald Dahl,"I liked the original, even though the 'special effects' of that one were lame, even by the funky FX standards of the early 1970s. This second one was better in some respects, not as charming in others. The first had heart, however contrived it may have been. But do remember that with the era of the first one, none other than the ancient, albeit venerable, Sammy Davis Jr., famous lounge singer from the 1890s, seemed the appropriate choice to snatch the 1st movie's theme song (Candyman) and make it his own signature tune. Anyway--- that just shows how old and fusty the first one was.The second one, this movie, is a lot truer to the original Roald Dahl book. But hey, as much as the unwashed masses are keen to admire the 'emperor's new clothes', that is, to praise Dahl as a genius of kid books, Dahl is, to be honest, a very dark creepy writer. In my humble opinion, I question whether his books are even suitable for children. After having read his actual books, and not just having seen movies based on his books, I myself would not allow any child over whom I had responsibility or influence to read them. They are mean-spirited, ugly, and really, kind of disgusting.Having said that, the marvelous and always amazing Johnny Depp did a good job. The kids were great, and Helena Bonhan Carter was a brave trooper to sport real 'Englishy-looking' teeth as the poor mother. It was also nice to see Missy Pyle, the hottie alien from the great 'Galaxy Quest', begin to emerge from what had begun to look like permanent third-banana character actor status.Given the dreary and disturbingly creepy book source, this movie was adequately entertaining. TAKE your kids, though-- and be prepared to talk with them and comfort them as needed. Do not just send them in to the theater alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Johnny Depp as great in that movie. I heard a bunch of people saying that he was trying to be a Micheal Jackson.,I love Johnny Depp and when I went to see that movie it was great but everyone was saying how creepy he was in that movie. I think that they did a great job of redoing the movie and all of the characters were great. To tell you the truth I liked the Johnny one better than the Gene one. I thought every thing was a lot funnier and cooler than Gene Wilders. I mean I liked that one when i was little. My Aunt and my Uncle liked it. My favorite part was when he had those dolls singing at the very beginning of the entrance!! that was funny but a lot of other things were to!! I mean just the whole thing with Johnny Depp was amazing. I live overseas so i cant really see it right now but it will be coming out in 1 month or so!! i cant wait to see it again!! i hope that if you get to see it then you will like it. I would see it again because of all of the characters and all of the people who played there roles good... Because if they did not play there roles good then they did not do there part!,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Is this sweeter than the original,"Take Roald Dahl, add Tim Burton and sprinkle with Johnny Depp. Roald Dahl was well known for his dark stories and dark undercurrents in his more light hearted works. In comparison to the Gene Wilder original this was going to be less candyfloss sweetness than the rightly celebrated 1971 movie.Tim Burton has added his touches to this classic childrens story. He presents Willy Wonka with a palour that hints at somethnig more menancing under the top hat. Johnny Depp's Will Wonka has more of the Peter Pan, the boy that never grew up, whereas Gene Wilder's was an adult.In remaking classic movies, a new cinnamon twist is needed. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have found an interpretation that is distinct from the 1971 movie and is more faithful to Dahl's novel. Recommended watching and then watch the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Movie More for Adults than Kids,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. In fact, I like it more every time I see it. This version is truer to Dahl's book than the original movie, starting with the title. Of course, the special effects are terrific and Johnny Depp's performance is wonderful. (It disturbs me that people see similarities between Depp's Wonka and Michael Jackson - including Roger Ebert himself!)That being said, I have to convey the opinion that, while this film can be considered a family film, I think it appeals more to adults than children. There are a lot of ""hidden"" jokes and innuendo that children would not understand and which may be, some perhaps would say, inappropriate for kids. It is a little more violent and certainly much darker than the 1971 film.I would also go so far as to say that this is not a remake of the 1971 Gene Wilder film, but a different adaptation of Roald Dahl's book done brilliantly by Tim Burton, of whose films I am a great fan.In short, a great film with brilliant performances. But I would think twice before classifying it as a ""kid"" movie. It's so much more!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Poor Remake,"I was very disappointed in the movie. Johnny Depp was more like a demented robot than a real character. The children's characters were not complete and poor imitations of their 1971 predecessors'. This is one of the times when less would have been more, even for Tim Burton it was too flamboyant. The oompa-loom-pa had very little character and seemed mean and nasty. The squirrel thing seemed more like a rip off of the ice-age popularity. Thankfully the original film is on DVD as I am sure this will be soon. I did like the Grandpa Joe character. All the characters were played from an evil point of view and where was Slugworth?",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An excellent movie definitely worth seeing!,"'Charlie and the chocolate factory' is a great movie that is almost completely different from the original 'Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory' movie. It is about a poor boy named Charlie Bucket who finds one of Willie Wonka's five golden tickets and is given the once in a lifetime opportunity to tour the marvelous chocolate factory. Each of the four other children are one by one faced with a terrible fate for being very rotten and not worthy of earning the grand prize set for the child who is the last remaining contender. Now this may sound similar to the previous movie but you will find that the factory is highly different and some of the less interesting ideas have been cut from the new movie. A lot of new features have also been added including the new and improved Oompa Loompa's who just so happen to be excellent singers. This movie is much better as it goes into a great amount of detail about Willie Wonka as a child and also how the factory came to be. The old movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered and many loose ends but this movie finishes nicely by Willie Wonka being reunited with his long lost dad and Charlie and his family actually movie into to the factory where Charlie and Willie become business partners of such. This movie also shows the other four children and their parents leaving the factory in a different state to when they came in. Overall, this movie was excellent and is suitable for all ages. One of the best movies i have ever seen!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I didn't like Depp's acting in this movie,"As a visual it was not bad. I didn't watch the original. Not yet. It was interesting story, but i didn't like Depp's acting in this movie and on the other hand it was a little bit boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not what I expected...,"Was it just me or did Johnny Depp sound exactly like Michael Jackson? Even the billboard I saw after viewing the movie reminded me of the MJ look. I've always been a Johnny Depp fan, but I can't give him high marks for this one. The film had highlights of added humor and far more flashbacks than the life of Charlie. Wonka is depicted as a lunatic and the film lacks a good moral story. The humor in some scenes revolves around immoral acts such as Charlie's father stealing caps from the toothpaste factory.Slugworth didn't lurk around each golden ticket winner, so there wasn't any temptation for the children to be deceptive. Instead the film revealed that all of the children were ""rotten"". This area of the film perturbed me. There was no character building, learning from mistakes, or any scruples to to this wonka story except, ""you won Charlie because you were the least rotten kid""The classic songs were replaced with either flashbacks or humorous antics such as the grampa dancing like the Six Flags Commercials.As the children enter the factory there was this somewhat amusing set up with singing toy dolls, yet it self-destructs and the toys catch on fire. You could literally see the dolls melt and eyeballs sliding off! Once that happened, it was not amusing but sick. Willy wonka was right there behind them, ready to pull out his cue cards to begin the explanation of his factory, you would think he would know what to say, but for some reason his role in this film was to be the look alike MJ insane guy, with a horrible father who would not allow him to eat chocolate. As far as I could tell that was the only reason he ran away from home.Gene Wilder from the original was not insane, but funny, goofy, playful, and serious when it came to someone stealing his ingredients. On the other hand Depp just didn't like kids and really expressed that with Mike TV when he kept pretending that he didn't even hear him.Other than Mike bringing his wimpy dad and Violet bringing her baton twirling mom, the others brought the same gender of parent as the original. The differences were in acting abilities. Other than Mike TV and Charlie, the kids did not act with as much intensity as the original and the parents did not show a great sense of loss or love as their children were stretched or juiced. It seemed as if they went along with Wonka and knew their kids were rotten. For example, Augustus's mom didn't scream out like she did in the first one as he is being sucked up through a pipe. Veruca's father had to be pushed into the ""bad nut"" shoot by a squirrel. Yes I said squirrel. They changed the 'golden egg' to nuts and a bunch of nut crackers - squirrels. The motif of insanity is played on in that scene. Mike TV did not say anything once he was removed from the TV by his father as a little person. His father didn't reflect much facial emotion when they announced he would need to go through the taffy puller machine. The Granpa was OK, but not as 'into' it as the first one. Veruca didn't put her whole heart into being the spoiled brat, she was a little better when she was trying to get a squirrel, but once they carried her to the shoot, her acting abilities were lessened.The Oompa Loompas were all the same guy - just duplicated and were not midgets, but little men. Their music was different and included many wardrobe changes and even swimming formation acts. They sang after each child disobeyed and made up a song including their name. They left out the Oompa Loompa song - one of my favorites. The oompa loompa also posed as Wonka's psychologist, another indication that Wonka was a little off.The improvements were the special effects of the elevator and utilizing it during several scenes instead of just the last one. Also, showing the characters leave the factory at the end, was an added plus.The bubble scene where Charlie and Grandpa fly up was not on this film, and most likely because that was a character building part of the original, where Charlie learned from his mistake and did the good deed giving back the gobstopper. He showed honesty, bravery, and selflessness Burton's film did not show that heart, softer side. It was all about colors.The added storyline was the relationship between Wonka and his father, which was less than entertaining. Every time there was a flashback, Wonka would black out, thus indicating his further entrapment to insanity. He was reunited with his father at the end of the movie and found enough forgiveness to accept Charlie's family into his factory, but they still kept their little crooked house and moved it into the factory. That was strange - you would think they would have given that up! The other added story was how Wonka found the Oompa Loompas and saved them, yet made them his slaves for chocolate.Overall I did not see a real moral strength to this film, but merely colors, lights, and sounds... but even the sounds weren't as good as the classic music featured in the original. The children were made out to be brats, with Charlie being the ""less rotten"" of the bunch thus winning the prize. So it would seem it is a typical Hollywood film reflecting what our society, or is it a reflection of what our future holds... uncaring parents, rotten children, and no emphasis on morals.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A celebration of all things sweet,"This film is an adaptation of the famous children's book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", which I really enjoyed reading when I was young.This film is a delightful adaptation of the book. It is visually stimulating and rich. The sets are vibrant and colourful, and sometimes even psychedelic. The first room where there is a chocolate river amazes me! The characters are likable, especially Charlie, whose innocence shines throughout the film. The character development for the other 4 children is successful, and it makes them vile and unlikeable. The film is a celebration of all things sweet, be it chocolate, sweets or the warmth of a loving family. Tim Burton is greatly successful to make this film appeal to everyone, and yet retaining the ""cult"" feel!",,Anonymous,Comedy
A good remake,I think that this movie is very good because it is an excellent remake of the old film and johnny depp (willy wonka) plays an excellent roll as him. hes very funny and takes all of the children's comments sarcastically. i also think that the children are more realistic than in the original. Freddie Highmore does a good job as Charlie bucket but in the film they have changed the end which isn't as good. This film wasn't hyped up like some other films which turn out to be rubbish. I would definitely go and see it again and recommend it to friends with children because the lids will enjoy it so will the adults.

Burton and Depp... Again?!,"Burton and Depp team up for the umpteenth time for a new remake: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This film is about a young boy wins a tour through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world, led by the world's most unusual candy maker.This film is weird and eye popping. The sets are amazing. The songs in the film are entertaining. The special effects are great. Almost everything in this film is great. One problem is Johnny Depps character, Willy Wonka. He looks like Michael Jackson! Now that's wrong. In my opinion, this film is better than the original. Willy Wonka is crazy. He is funny. He makes funny lines that makes you laugh. This film is just freaky. It'll freak your freak. This type of Willy Wonka is not nice and sweet as the original was but this type is just parent hating.The main character is what we all want to be, or at least I want to be.

Bitter. Dark. Perfect.,"Were it a chocolate bar, Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" would be dark and bitter. Just the way I like it. Staying closer to the source material than the 1971 version did, ""Charlie"" gives Roald Dahl fans reason to rejoice. No longer is Willy Wonka the sunny, cheery twit that Gene Wilder crafted. In the hands of Johnny Depp, Wonka is a twisted, depraved, and sadistic man. He takes great pleasure in the thought of putting spoiled children through pain and suffering, and he doesn't mind admitting that he hates grown-ups of all stripes. This is how Wonka should be.Another improvement over the original is the Oompa Loompas. Their original back story, not told in the first film, is told here. Also they sing the songs from the book, not that garbage from the first film. The musical numbers are inspired, ranging from Bollywood musical to rock and roll to pop ballad. Deep Roy, who plays every Oompa Loompa, does a fantastic job of giving the characters life and making them a little scary even if they are only one foot tall.We also have Tim Burton's stunning vision to bring the quirky tale to life. The factory is a candy-colored den of nightmares with boiling hot rivers of chocolate and torturous uses for seemingly benign candy making machinery. But the interesting thing is that Burton makes the factory as pathetic as it is menacing. Willy's mechanical greeters at the gate explode and his pipes burst and the very mention of the word ""parents"" brings everything to a screeching halt.Willy, as it turns out, had a dentist for a father, and thusly never knew the joy of candy until he ran away. And when he tried to return home, Willy found that his father had left and taken the house with him. So Willy locked himself away inside his factory, where he developed a complexion so pale that he actually seems to absorb light like a black hole. He retains the maturity of an infant and the mentality of a candy-addicted twelve-year-old, making him a societal pariah even though everyone adores his confections.No, Willy Wonka is not a pleasant character. He's not meant to be. He's meant to be a depraved freak who learns to grow up with the help of the world's most mature little boy, Charlie Bucket. Freddie Highmore is incredible as Charlie. He gives the character so much emotional weight that he easily blows the previous incarnation of Charlie right out of the water. Depp hand-picked Highmore for the role, and it's obvious why. Highmore shows the potential to be as talented an actor as Depp, with just as glorious a career.""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a film that will put a smile on the face of older fans of the book, and nightmares inside the minds of young newcomers. And that's how Roald Dahl would want it. The story may be bitter and dark, but it will leave a good taste in your mouth. This is one of the year's finest and perhaps Tim Burton's best.PS: Some folks might say Depp fashioned Wonka after Michael Jackson. I say Jackson fashioned himself after Wonka. Either way, they're both kind of sad.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Brilliant and a total feel-good movie,"Personally, i thought this film was absolutely amazing and its now one of my favourites. The story is of a young poor boy who adores the amazing chocolate of Willy Wonka but only gets one bar a year. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) announces that 5 golden tickets have been put in chocolate bars and shipped all over the world. There's a rush as shops are selling out of Wonka bars amazingly fast and children all over the world are buying millions of them. When there's only one ticket left, Charlie finds some money and buys a bar, inside is a gleaming golden ticket! His whole family are thrilled. And thats only the beginning of the movie.Eccentric Willy Wonka is a lovable character that will make you laugh and Johnny Depp plays it so well he is amazing.I won't continue with the story so that those who wish to see this film and have not read the book will get to see for themselves what happens.This is a film that you can watch over and over again without getting bored. Its also a film that will make you laugh and satisfy you with a good story. Its amazing and will make you feel all warm inside.The original film was good but Johnny Depp is just so much more than Gene Wilder can ever hope to be (from my point of view). In the original, you don't feel any connection with Charlie where as in the updated version you cant help but love him, same with wonka himself.I love this film and i hope all of you do too, its amazing I've already seen it twice but would love to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Flat, plodding, awful adaptation","Flat, plodding, awful adaptation of Roald Dahl's extraordinary novel. Once again, Tim Burton demonstrates that he is not a storyteller; he is, in fact, a man lucky enough to be able to surround himself with very talented cinematographers, production designers and publicists. Unfortunately, he has no educated friends who are script editors.His only brilliant film, ED WOOD, is light years away from this putrid mess and was good because of the script and despite Burton.One thing Burton is incapable of doing is giving a narrative momentum. In this outing, Wonka takes his children and their guardians on a tour of his factory. We follow the group from room to room and are forced to endure cataclysmically puerile songs from cloned Oompa-Loompahs, all played by the same irritating midget.The film does not have the darker subplot of the original film and the wheelchair-like pacing drove me close to igniting the screen with the nearest blowtorch.Johnny Depp is just wrong as Wonka. He's boring, too, because he's a ""weirdo"" who knows he's a weirdo and wants everybody else to know it, too. He's like the annoying guy at a social gathering who tells everybody how crazy he is. No, Mr. Depp, your weirdo is a bore.The production design is what you'd expect for the fortune spent on this abortion and the cinematography is adequate.Only the gloriously overrated Tim Burton, who has managed to pull the wool over many people's eyes for over a decade now, could make a rich concept such as this a forgettable bore and a candidate for PND (Permanent Negative Destruction).As for screenwriter John August (scribe of the rancid BIG FISH), please throw your computer away and retire with Burton.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Wonderful Movie!!,"I saw this movie yesterday and found it be one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've had in a long time! Can't wait to see it again and pick up on all the little nuances I may have missed the first time around. I was a huge fan of the original as a child but looked upon this movie as simply a different interpretation. I smiled through the whole thing!! It is absolutely an imaginary feast for the mind and eyes. I can't understand some other peoples' inability to see this as: A.Not a remake but a new way of looking at this story, B. a whimsical story of fiction in which Not everything can be explained logically (I thought the father's house being 'ripped' out of its foundation to be hilarious!), and C. another awesome performance by Johnny Depp. He wasn't 'reading off the cue cards', people.

"Overall, it was entertaining","This is an odd movie  Tim Burton of course, so that will be normal  but I'm not sure quite how to rate it. I loved the original movie with Wilder, didn't read the book so I can't comment there; but my daughter did and says this new version is closer to the book, so we'll rest that angle. It really doesn't matter to me if it is or not, but to some it does. And I can honestly say that I was entertained throughout the film. However, some parts are jarring. For a children's movie, or at least one in which a lot of children will be taken to, there are some decidedly adult type comments and situations. The music is not as good as the original, and maybe it was just my theater, but it jumped several decibels whenever it started up. The supporting cast is quite ordinary, and the scenes with Highmore and Depp don't begin to approach the chemistry between the characters in the original film. Moreover, Wonka's back story with Christopher Lee isn't necessary, nor did I find it the least believable due to the ancient look of Lee in all his scenes.Regardless, I read the mediocre reviews, got dragged to the movies, and generally enjoyed watching it  for the most part. The cute quips from Depp, the best ending with a punctuated and rising '...little girl', still sound humorous. He is of course the best part of the film (leading actors usually are), despite the many comments heard about his Michael Jackson-like appearance and moves, many of which I didn't see or notice. All in all it could have been worse  at least I didn't sit in front of one small toddler who screamed each time the music began, and then just as promptly shut up when it stopped",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Overhated, but still not very good","First thing I need to say. This is and never was a reboot to the 1971 film, the writers had never even seen the film. This film is an adaption of the original book and a much more accurate one at that. That being said it's hard to not compare this to the original film and quite frankly while I do think the story for this film is much more interesting and has more character and development and effort put into it. The 1971 film is simply just better. Charlie is just painfully boring in this film, he never really feels like a real character. The other characters are pretty good if not better but their acting does feel a bit off. The songs are really cool and very entertaining but they are pretty forgettable. The cgi doesn't look the best and feels a lot more creepy than the whimsical magics of the 1971 film. And finally probably the weakest fact of this film, it's just awkward and not funny. With all that being said I do love how they handle Willy, I love the backstory they give him and I love how unsociable and awkward they make him (just like how he'd be in real life). While this movie has a lot of issues I will always appreciate what it did with its story and I can say I recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Depp doesn't meet expectations...thank goodness.,"I loved CATCF - but admittedly - it wasn't at the top of my favorite Depp films upon first viewing. After I left the theater on opening night, I wasn't quite sure what to make of Depp's performance. NOT because I saw 'Michael Jackson'...THAT freaky image never popped into my head, thank goodness...but - in all honesty - because I was expecting 'Jack Sparrow', especially considering the target audience. Although a Depp 'career supporter' for nearly 18 years now, I expected him to do what the likes of Tom Cruise, or Brad Pitt, or so many other actors do today: Give the exact same performance as in the last movie. I SHOULD have known better, seeing Depp go through his chameleonic changes film after film, character after character. But THIS time I expected him - for some ungodly reason - to try to capitalize on his newly acquired fame by sticking with 'Jack Sparrow's' formula for success. But, thank goodness, he didn't. Instead he spun the audience around and baffled them with what seems to be an awkward performance, leaving them shaking their judgmental heads. However, the problem was not with Depp's acting, but in expectations. Why DID we expect Depp to repeat any of his critically acclaimed performances of the past...why did we even expect him to TRY to appeal to the masses? This is a man who would rather hide under a rock (or funny hats, glasses, ponchos, floppy hair, etc...) then be praised for his 'appeal' as an actor.So I went back to see CATCF again...and again...and WOW!! How refreshing to see something completely different on the screen!! Depp DIDN'T make it easy, this is a 'thinking man's' performance...and you're either going to accept what you see on the surface, or you're going to look a bit deeper. I looked deeper, and I have come to the conclusion that Wonka alone stands out as Depp's most complex character to date. This character is complicated - childlike, but sinister; confident, but insecure; a genius, but an idiot - he's the Ultimate Paradox...and we don't know whether to laugh with him, or at him, or to even laugh at all. Well...I am now doing all three, and doing so in earnest...but perhaps not the way you would think. Wonka's awkwardness breaks my heart, his cunning glances and sinister smirks make me *squeeee!* with delight, and his lame-o jokes make me roar with laughter, as if I'm in on some weird inside joke. This is a brilliant performance and shouldn't be written off too soon as 'less than stellar'. I think time will prove that even as a dysfunctional, giggling chocolatier, Depp is a true wizard at what he does and, perhaps, the last true visionary standing in Hollywood today.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A young kid behind us was crying because one part was so freaky. I wouldn't recommend taking young children to this movie.

Great film far succeeds the first...,"For those of you who have written bad comments about this movie, i'm not going to have a go at you, but i suggest you go back and watch it again, because you obviously fell asleep after the adverts at the beginning, because it's absolutely FAB!!!!! I have read the book and seen the original since watching the movie and have compared the two, (I'm sad like that). The second movie sticks more to the book than the 1917 version. But also adding in it's own bit here and there just to give the movie a bit of a lift and to make it more their own...I've always admired Tim Burton's work and i love 'Nightmare Before Christmas.' But Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is by far his best film yet. And having Johnny Depp play Willy Wonker is fantastic, they've done so much work on Johnny Depp that he looks nothing like he's usual self.I found it a bit rude that people have started calling it 'Willy Wonker and the Chocolate Factory,' but by the way the movie is done it dose seem that thats the idea. They've added flash backs and everything to enhance Willy Wonkers roll, and less about Charlie and his life etc... Also another down side was when the children and parents first meet Willy Wonker. In the book he comes out and dose cart-weeks and stuff, which sound really amazing for an old man to be doing. But Tim Burtons added his own little warped bit and made a little scene where something catches on fire, (like in most of his movies). But it still looks cool.My favourite part of the film is where Willy Wonker tells Mike off for 'muttering,' it's soooo funny! I've got a big poster of Willy Wonker on my wall.

It also tries too hard, and most of the musical numbers generally suck. The digitally cloned dwarf dancing is positively corny. Also there's something a little dark and disturbing about the Willie Wonka character that I didn't like.The movie ends on a positive note- but still failed to move me very much.

What A Waste of Time,"I think this is one of those movies where you are either going to love it or hate it. I fall into the second category. I loved the Gene Wilder version of Willy Wonka as a kid (my two kids love it as well). I knew going into this that it was supposed to be different and more true to the book. I have never read the book so I can't comment on that but I found the basic story very similar. Anyway, I just didn't like this movie. You can tell right up front that it's a classic Tim Burton movie. Everything is very surreal looking. But I was just bored. I thought once they got to the chocolate factory that things would pick up but no such luck. While I generally like Johhny Depp, I didn't like his portrayal in this movie. I didn't like the way he looked or sounded. And I can definitely see the Michael Jackson comparison (although Depp has said this was not intentional). That just creeped me out even more.

"Johnny Depp can't hold a candle to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, but this is still a good second adaptation of the book","In 2005, I heard about this then-new version of Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and how Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka in it. It had been years since I had last read to book and seen the original 1971 adaptation, ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", but I still remembered the story very well and went to see this second big screen adaptation in the theatre. I was impressed at the time and still was months later when I saw it again on DVD. Earlier this month, I watched the 1971 film for the first time probably since the late 1990s, and thought it was an overall excellent family film. Over a week later, I watched this Tim Burton version again for the first time in several years, and thought it slightly inferior but still very good.Charlie Bucket is a young boy in a poor family, which consists of him, his two parents, and his four bedridden grandparents. His father can barely support the family by working in a toothpaste factory. Near their run-down home is a chocolate factory, run by a reclusive man named Willy Wonka, whom Charlie's Grandpa Joe used to work for. Nobody knows who currently works there, as nobody is ever seen entering or exiting the building, but world renowned candy keeps coming out of it! When it is announced that Wonka has put golden tickets into five different candy bar wrappers, which could be found anywhere in the world, and the five recipients will get a tour of his factory, chaos begins! The first four tickets are acquired by four mean-spirited kids, and since Charlie's family can hardly ever afford chocolate, it's highly unlikely that he will get one. However, after he finds money left out in the snow, he goes to buy a Wonka bar with it, and finds the fifth and final golden ticket inside! He gets to go on the tour, and takes Grandpa Joe along, but they are in for some surprises!One of the major differences between the two movie adaptations is Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka here. It was apparently inspired by several famous children's TV hosts, and this version of the character is not one of the stronger aspects of the film, and not one of Depp's strongest performances. It cannot compare with Gene Wilder's portrayal, though it isn't exactly bad, and the character can be pretty funny at times here. Despite that one flawed performance, the cast of this 2005 version is mostly very strong. In the role of Charlie, Freddie Highmore is just as good here as Peter Ostrum is in the 1971 film. They also got talented cast members to play Charlie's family members, including David Kelly as Grandpa Joe and another common Tim Burton recast (like Depp), Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Bucket. Most of the cast performances are impressive, another example being Deep Roy digitally multiplied as the Oompa Loompas, who sing songs, play musical instruments, and parody various rock bands! I just didn't care much for Missi Pyle as Mrs. Beauregarde. This film has the usual dark and amazing Tim Burton visuals, and like the 1971 version, great sets were made for Willy Wonka's factory! For the most part, the story is very entertaining as well, even if the ending could have been a bit better thought out.Some say it's best not to compare the two silver screen adaptations of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, but since I've watched this one again shortly after revisiting the original after so many years, it's kind of hard for me not to. 2005's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is unsurprisingly weaker than 1971's ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", and I know many fans of the first adaptation have shown great disdain for this remake, but personally, I think both of them are highly entertaining family movies, though I can understand how Johnny Depp's portrayal of the reclusive factory owner could put many viewers off. This Tim Burton film does take some liberties with the story, and I would be giving away too much if I mentioned many of them, though it also features aspects of the book not included in the 1971 version, such as Mr. Bucket being alive and working in a toothpaste factory and Grandpa Joe telling his grandson about chocolate palace in India, not that I'm saying any of this is good or bad. If you're a fan of the book, both adaptations could be a lot of fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wow! A decent Tim Burton movie,"Normally I liken watching a Tim Burton movie to going to the dentist, but for the first time since ""Batman"" i was pleasantly surprised.The original is legendary, so it was always going to tough work for Burton , but he did a solid job. The movie isn't an exact remake and is quite different in many regards, and surprisingly often for the better. There's a solid cast who all do a solid job. Many dedicated fans of the original were horrified when they heard Johnny Depp was playing the main role of Willy Wonka, but I feel he did a good job. It was quite a different Wonka than in the original, wisely, and Depp did a good job.I wasn't a huge fan of the second half of the original as the story really wanes, and not much was done to rectify this in this remake. This is one of the few flaws of this movie. Otherwise a decent family for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
the best movies of all time,"This movie came out in Australia only just over a week ago, I am a big Tim Burton fan and like all his movies. So I was looking forward to it since I heard that he was making an adaption of Charlie. So I went to see it first day and was very excited when the screen lit up. In the first 10 minutes my face was stuck facing the screen, it was amazing! The sets, acting, unique characters everything was good. Johnny Depp hadn't even come in yet! I was worried that Tim Burton would go too far with this movie and would lose his style. I was so wrong! Most people my age hated this movie but it was the best movie of all time! And then the chocolate factory scenes came in and my head was even more frozen in position of the screen. Johnny Depp has always been one of my favorite actors. His performance in this movie is incredible, he is so different to other actors and so much better. So I strongly urge everybody to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Start of the Burton Slide,"I used to be a huge fan of Tim Burton. His eccentricities and oddball imagination made him a true visionary artist and his sense of humour was sufficiently askew to make his work not only funny but pleasingly strange and refreshingly unlike that of any other Hollywood director.
However, increasingly these days, his work is (I want to tear my tongue out for saying this) stale and samey, and the trademark Burton humour seems to have been replaced in large part by a need to show just how eccentric and weird he can be.
This trend, I think, began here, with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Rather than being warm, charming and funny with just the right amount of weird darkness, which used to be the way of things when it came to Burton projects, this movie, as far as I can see, has dispensed with a lot of its predecessors' warmth and charm, instead opting to put the onus on the strange.
Depp's performance here, too extracts the intimidating aspects of the character of Willy Wonka together with any interesting traits of the character that have made him such an appealing and intriguing figure, and just kept the unsettling weirdness.
The positives here are that, in the main, the acting is pretty good; the look of the thing, as always with Burton, is lovely; and this version of Roald Dahl's novel is a lot closer to the source material than the 1971 Gene Wilder version.
In the end, as films in general go, this is probably about average, but, as Burton films go, it's below par, or rather, it was when it was released. Now I'd say it's there or thereabouts in terms of what to expect from Tim Burton, and that makes me sad.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Question the Critics,"I'm sorry I went into this film thinking that I would love it like all the critics views I read. However, this was one of the worse movies I think I've ever witnessed. It was boring & so over the top, I just couldn't get into it. Johnny Depp as always was good but the voice he used for Willy Wonka was irritating. It was to the point that at the end of the film I wanted to reach in & choke Willy Wonka just so I wouldn't have to hear the voice anymore. The coloring didn't make any sense either, he was always either green, blue or pale colored. Depended upon what scene he was in. He just looked sickly. He had absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I didn't see the need for the incredibly stupid flashbacks to his childhood. It made no sense in the picture & was irritating. The Umpahs were OK... I didn't like the singing because most the time we couldn't understand what they were singing about. I thought the kids were fairly good. I really liked this kid who played Charlie much better than the original... he was good. I've always been a fan of Tim Burton but I know he's done much better.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"Tim Burton's reworking of the Roald Dahl story. With Tim Burton as the magical confectioner Willy Wonka lacks shearling candy Gene Wilder brought to the role.It is a more sumptuous film, with dazzling set designs. The grass and the chocolate pool really do look edible.Burton has added a backstory about Willy Wonka as a child denied sweets by his strict father, an orthodontist played by Christopher Lee.Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is the little lad who lives in extreme poverty with his parents and four grandparents who all share the same bed. Their ramshackle house is outside the town where Willy Wonka's factory used to operate. Grandfather Joe (David Kelly) once worked in Wonka's factory before it was closed due to rivals stealing his recipes.Charlie's father was laid off from a toothpaste factory because of automation. Hence why Charlie only has enough money to buy a Wonka bar once a year.Is located. The family subsists on cabbage soup and good cheer in their miserable surroundings, as the kid's father works the assembly-line in a toothpaste factory until laid off because of automation.Suddenly one day Willy Wonka comes out of his reclusive lifestyle to announce a competition. He has hidden golden tickets inside five bars Wonka candy around the world. Those lucky enough to find the tickets will be treated to a tour of the largest chocolate factory in the world.Luckily Charlie becomes the fifth and last golden ticket winner, the only one of five kids who is not obnoxious. He goes on the factory tour with his grandfather Joe.With Willy Wonka s their personal guide, the other kids suffer mishaps mainly due to their own behaviour. Augustus Gloop is a greedy pig. Veruca Salt is apolit by her parents. Mike Teavee is clever but addicted to violent video games. Violet Beauregarde is overly competitive.This version has fewer songs and only one Oompa Loompa actor (Deep Roy) who is multiplied. The songs lack oomph and are not as memorable to the ones in the Gene Wilder version.Depp's version of Willy Wonka was a bit of a misfire as a creepy man child who failed to grow up. His character lacked bite compared to Gene Wilder.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Horrible,"I loved the book and the first movie, and I was looking forward to this new movie with great anticipation. (Especially when I heard Johnny Depp was to be Willy Wonka.) However, after seeing it, I cannot imagine any way to make it worse. Willy Wonka, instead of being depicted as the eccentric genius he is supposed to be, is portrayed as a sissy pervert. He looks, talks, and acts like a cross between Michael Jackson and Pewee Herman. Grandpa Joe was also terrible. The oompa loompa songs should have been scrapped altogether, as they were the worst part of the original movie. But instead, they were transformed into some kind of Marylin Manson type freak-show. I hated it and could not wait for it to be over.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Roald Dahl & Tim Burton = Awesomeness,"One of my favourite directors, Tim Burton, adapts a story that was written by one of my favourite writers, Roald Dahl. Thus, I was expecting nothing short of great. It's been ages since I last saw Mel Stuart's 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' and I don't remember much but even though I dislikedBurton's more recent 'Alice in Wonderland', I thoroughly enjoyed 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. The movie is best enjoyed with the family and I must say that one should have some chocolates nearby when watching it because this film induced some strong cravings. Thankg goodness there was some chocolate cake.Tim Burton once again creates a unique world and his use of colour reminded me of 'Edward Scissorhands' where the interiors of Edward's house was dark while the neighborhood was filled with colourful houses. Here Willy Wonka's factory is full of colour but the neighborhood outside has a gloomy look. It works because it reflects the impoverished family life of Charlie that is lit with his family's optimism and it also accents the greed and hypocrisy among the rich. Burton does a delightful job in representing Dahl's story. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is full of imagination. The art direction is stunningand the special effects department have done a first rate job. The songs were also wonderfully adapted and visualized. Even though they sound rather modern, it doesn't feel out of place. Cinematography is excellent and editing is brilliant.Ideally a children's film, adults can enjoy it just as much, as I did with my family. In a way 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' awakens the child inside us and gives the viewer an opportunity to walk down memory lane. August has written a splendid screenplay. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and not a single boring sequence. The suspense is very well maintained.And the acting: Johnny Depp is remarkable as the quirky, somewhat childlike, Willy Wonka. His interpretation is quite different from that of Gene Wilder and while Wilder's Wonka was more suitable for Stuart's film, Depp's wacky Wonka is the requirement of Burton's adaptation. The supporting cast that includes Christopher Lee, Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, David Kelly, Deep Roy and Missi Pyle are great. Freddie Highmore does an adequate job. The kids who play the hateful contestants do a fine job in irritating the viewer (which is intentional of course).'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is among the director's exceptional works. Tim Burton has spoken to the child inside us. I'd recommend everyone to watch it with their family and celebrate the kid inside while having some chocolate.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Tim Burton is a genius,I want to preface my statements by stating that I have not been a big fan of Tim Burton movies. However after seeing this movie I can say he is a incredible director. Once the movie went to DVD I immediately went out to purchase it. My two-year-old son has practically memorized the whole movie...oompah-looms dances and all! It is a wonderful remake of a great movie. Johnny Depp and Deep Roy should receive HUGE bonuses for their performances. The 2005 version of Willie Wonka did nothing to diminish the original performance of Gene Wilder and I commend Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. All in all this is a wonderful movie that the whole family will enjoy for years to come! I would recommend it to everyone.,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I don't like musicals,"First off, you need to know that I absolutely detest musicals, and I couldn't stand the version with Gene Wilder. However, I love Johnny Depp, so I thought I'd give this film a shot. I must say I was pleasantly surprised though Johnny's impersonation of Michael Jackson was a bit eerie.Charlie Bucket is poor, yet at the same time he is the richest kid in the world because he has a family who loves him. Though they have no money Charlie is a happy child. His only wish is to visit the chocolate factory where his grandpa Joe used to work, but it has been closed for the public for years. The eccentric owner Willy Wonka, played by Johnny Depp, has not been seen by anyone in the town for years.Then as if someone granted his wish, Mr. Wonka writes out a contest. Five golden tickets are hidden in the Wonka bars that are sent out all over the world. Charlie has very little hopes of finding one of the golden tickets because he only gets one bar a year - for his birthday. But low and behold, Charlie manages to get two more Wonka bars this year and actually finds the last golden ticket. He takes his grandfather to the factory where they meet Willy Wonka himself. And odd things start to happen.A lot of effort and energy has been put into this film. It is definitely a signature Burton film, which is a good thing in my book. Johnny Depp is fantastically eccentric and eerie, his performance is up to par as per usual. He is funny, yet at the same time he manages to give you the heebie jeebies, and on the other hand he doesn't have that hysterical thing Gene Wilder had going in the previous version. In this version I felt sorry for Willy Wonka, whereas in the 1971's version he just freaked me out.The Oompa-Loompas in this version are cute, but started to annoy me when they burst into song and dance. Plus the fact that the Oompas are all played by the same actor is kind of annoying. Miss Julia Winter does an excellent job at portraying the spoiled brat Veruca Salt, and I believe we'll hear a lot from the boy who played Charlie Bucket, Freddie Highmoore, in the future.Would I watch it again? Perhaps. If someone held a gun to my head. I did really enjoy it, but I just don't understand the concept of musicals. Therefore I think it'd be wise for me not to try and watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Burton and His Cast Have Done Dahl Right,"As much as I like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" this was a film crying out to be remade. It was a minor classic thanks to the performances of not only Gene Wilder (still the definitive Wonka, I think), but also the rest of the cast (especially Peter Ostrom)--as well as its often witty script. But it was dragged down by depressing production design (which resembled a mini-golf course built in an old waterfront warehouse), those Bricuisse-Newley songs (stop the movie I want to get off), and the hideous Oompa-Loompas (purple-faced, orange-haired freaks in genie shoes).Burton's remake gives Dahl's classic story the production values it deserves--and ratchets up the creepiness. Johnny Depp's Wonka is a ten-year-old, and a rather anti-social one at that, in a adult's body--a freak with Carol Channing's hair and smile, Jack Skellington's physique, and Oscar Wilde's wardrobe. Depp does an excellent job, but he doesn't make the character quite likable enough (Wilder's Wonka was mercurial yet affable); still, he fits Burton's vision of Wonka's world. (I've often thought that Depp would be the only actor other than Wilder who could play this role.)Danny Elfman does excellent work on the score. The various Oompa-Loompa songs (Dahl's words set to different musical styles, such as 1980s ""hair metal"") are great numbers that ""doop-a-dee-doop-a-dee"" beat the original movie's rather sugary tunes.Best movie of the summer so far.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"This is the worst remake of any movie, I've ever seen!","As far as I'm concerned, they took what was a perfectly good children's movie and remade it into some sort of demented freak show with an evil feel to it. I wouldn't bother to record it, let alone spend my money to buy a copy of this atrocious piece of modern garbage. Johnny Depp is the worst, in this movie. His character is somewhere between homosexual and the devil himself. Willy Wonka was supposed to be neurotic, not evil and mean spirited. In fact, the only good character in the whole movie is David Kelly as Grandpa Joe. I can even deal with Freddie Highmore as Charlie but the rest of it is full of deplorable performances and like I said, an evil and mean spirited overtone. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with small children as it will most likely give both, the children and their parents nightmares.Nuff said..",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Amazing movie!,"I saw this last weekend because ""The Island"" wasn't playing at four. I was blown away!

Tim Burton creates a wonderful world of imagination, color, and magic.I've heard a lot of people say that they didn't like it because Johnny Depp ""Act's like Michal Jackson"" Well, if you have read ANYTHING Johnny Depp has said about this you will know that he did NOT base Willi Wonka's Character on Jackson. I personally thought he was funny (as did everyone else in the theater I was in) and the back story that Tim Burton and John August have added to his character explain why he acts so... different.This is a wonderful movie, and one of my personal favorites.10 stars outta 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst film since Ishtar,"Never in my life would I have expected it to have been as awful as it was. This film will (read should) make it up to the ranks of films such as Ishtar. It makes Showgirls look like Shakespeare. The film was full of pointless imagery, and disturbing visuals. All of the children, with the exception of Mike Tevee and Charlie have been dressed in make up to like living china dolls. Violet's mom looks like a psychotic killer who just escaped from Archam. The list goes on. Disturbing to say the least. Watch this film with caution. . I can only say I feel bad for anyone who pays money for this film. For the children who are introduced to Dahl's magical storytelling through the vehicle of Tim Burton. And just like an old Chevy truck, Tim isn't firing on all cylinders. The film seems like it was made by someone who likes listening to the sound of his own voice. It was the equivalent of watching two hours of Jar-Jar talk about the pre-colonial economies.

Bitter Chocolate,"Looks like I'm a lone voice in the wilderness here but those are the breaks. If I want to see a fantasy involving a boy named Charlie I'll stick to Cedric Kahn's charming 'L'Avion' made for probably a 20th of Burton's budget and barely a special effect in sight. I've never been much of a Burton fan - unless we're talking Richard - though I appreciate and accept that each generation needs an eccentric/rebellious/avant garde call it what you will figure and Burton seems to be this season's Godard. Okay, I don't have to go to his movies if I don't want to and mostly I don't want to but this time I read all the hype and thought well, why not, he has to make a half-decent movie SOME time so maybe this is it. Alas! I'm not much of a Depp fan either so I had a lot of prejudice to overcome but I gave it the old college try only to find myself falling asleep. I haven't seen the original Gene Wilder version so I have nothing to use for comparison but I found it screamingly obvious from the initial shot of chez Bucket, a blatant 'steal' from the National Theatre production of 'An Inspector Calls' to the 'cute' homilies 'my family is more important to me than anything' and only WE the audience can see these Addams Family first-drafts as the grotesques they are.

A good movie for the whole family but isn't better than the 1971 classic.,"There were so many people who wanted the role for Willy Wonka. Marylin Manson was dying for the role and if he got it, I wouldn't even want to see it in theaters. It would be a movie to wait for the DVD. But Johnny Depp got the role and I was shocked when I heard about it. After I saw this movie, I knew that Johnny Depp will win an Acadamy Award for one of his movies.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't only a remake of the 1971 classic ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" but it is based on the book. I loved the 1971 classic. It's one of the best movies ever made, and I know that for a fact. The thing I liked about this movie is that you go deeper into the movie. It shows you what happens to the characters after the factory and it just goes way into the story.Gene Wilder was a much better Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp was acting like a woman and reminded me of Michael Jackson. But when you think about it, Depp is a really good actor. The only character who I like more in the new version then the old one was Charlie played by Freddie Highmore. I liked him more than the old one. I liked all the old characters more than the new ones. There was just something I didn't like about the old Charlie.Charlie and the Chocolate Facotry was my second movie on my list as my ""Top 10 Summer Movies"" and I finally saw it.

Beautiful...,"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a Fantasy - Musical movie and a darkly whimsical twist to Roald Dahl's classic tale, in which we watch a young boy and four other kind winning a tour inside the famous chocolate factory of Willy Wonka.The movie's set design is beautiful and imaginative, creating a visually captivating world that brings the fantastical elements of the story to life. The interpretation of Freddie Highmore who played as Charlie is heartfelt and sincere, but the rest of the characters, particularly the spoiled children, feel one-dimensional compared to the source material. While Johnny Depp is delivering a peculiar and offbeat portrayal of Willy Wonka that makes it unique despite that sometimes feels more eccentric than endearing. To sum up, I have to say that ""While Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a beautiful movie and very enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dark Chocolate,"As per usual the team of Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton can always be counted on to deliver from the dark-side. Thus it is with this remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory though this was actually done under its original title.Depp expands his list of quirky characters and expands his range which I think is bigger than any other player around today. His chocolate magnate Willy Wonka is a dark character, so different than Gene Wilder back in the day. His character is great, but it might have frightened a few little tykes going to a family film.The story is basically the same, young Charlie Buckets a kid from a poor and extended family where both sets of grandparents are all under one roof. He lives in a town where years ago all the human workers were given the sack from the Wonka Chocolate Factory and it became fully automated. What grief he must have gotten from organized labor can only be imagined.Anyway Wonka who's become so obsessed with being the Chocolate King he's got no family and no heirs. We're not even sure, but that he might be celibate. He's put five gold tickets in one of his millions of Wonka Bars and the lucky five kids who get them win a trip inside his factory where no one has been.Charlie turns out to be one of the five and accompanied by his grandfather and the other kids and their guardians he takes a magical tour of the place. They meet the little tribe of Oompa-Loompas who live and work in the factory.Freddie Highmore is an earnest young Charlie. I do miss Jack Albertson as the grandfather from the first film. He registers far better than David Kelly in this one.The film really is a star vehicle for Johnny Depp, more so than the first film was for Gene Wilder.

another hit,"Is it just me, or do Tim Burton and Johnny Depp just go well together? Their first collaboration was ""Edward Scissorhands"" and amazed audiences in the early nineties. They teamed up again in 1999 to make ""Sleepy Hallow."" Again they made a wonderful movie. They have come together again to make ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"" and I think that audiences will be pleasantly surprised with this movie. A Quasi-remake of the old 1971 film ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" staring Gene Wilder, the newer ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"" goes in a very different direction mainly with the character of Willy Wonka. The stock characters of the various children that enter the factory with Charlie stay relatively the same. Mike ""T.V."" changes partially to a video game wiz-kid Violate is turned into an overconfident bratty martial artist, but they are still the same basic character. Even Charlie and his Grandfather stay mostly the same.While I have not read the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"", from what I have heard, the newer version follows the book more closely than the original film, and this can be partially given credit for the changes.Those of you who thought that the original ""Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory"" was ""creepy"", I would encourage you to try this movie out if only on DVD or VHS. Tim Burton brings a new outlook to the Oompa Loompa's and as such changes the feel of this film significantly.For any Tim Burton fan this is another must see. If you aren't sure then I would say to trust Tim Burton and his artistic take on things. With such hits like ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", ""Beetle Juice"", and ""Big Fish"" you can trust that his directing will keep you captivated for a few days after you see the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Run Away From This Remake,"I just got out of this movie and have to say some things. First of all, for those who read the book, get into the 21st century will you. No one should base their opinion of a movie off of a book. So what if he is closer to the book than the older movie. What kind of biased opinion is that. If you like the book so much go ahead and read it and quit saying the movie is good because it goes with the book. Anyway, just judging this movie off of it's pure entertainment value it sucks. The acting and wooden dialog sunk it. The character development was nil. The sound editing was terrible (I couldn't understand a word the oompa loompa's were singing). There wasn't any emotional investment in any other characters except for Charlie and Wonka. I had no feelings for any of them. It was lacking in humor. So what kind of movie was it? A bad one. Most of the critics out there are blinded by Tim Burton and his ""artistic"" viewpoint. I don't want art. I want entertainment. I feel sorry for the real lessons that could be learned about the kids in this movie. Most of it was really glossed over and their bad habits were less than side stories. The search for the golden ticket wasn't that good either. It was very rushed and each kid got 1 minute to show that they had bad habits. For you book people, I think Charlie's father is actually missing in the book but yet somehow he is alive this whole movie.

I want my old chocolate back,"I always describe myself as a chocoholic man. And my favorite quotes in life is ""the only thing better than a good friend is a good friend with a chocolate""So when I heard about the recreation of the movie ""Willy Wonka & the chocolate factory"" with the name ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" I was really excited and could hardly wait till the moment I watch the movie, specially that Johnny Depp is starring in itbut after I watched the movie, I was really frustrated, the movie was just a demonstration of visual effects capabilities nothing more...I remember watching Gene Wilder ""Willy Wonka"" in the old movie, I really liked the character, he was so simple in every thing, and you can feel that he is really a chocolate lover. But in this Movie, Johny Depp is great actor, no question about that but the Role itself is what I need to talk about, I found myself helpless but hating Willy Wonka!! a very complex character who is only concerned with his own life disregarding the chocolate manufacturing, his workers and every thing else, for example when Charlies' Grandfather introduced himself to him all what concerned Wonka was ""Are you one of those who tried to steal my secrets?!!!"".Wonka was as bad as the winners of the 5 golden tickets, I didn't even feel that he loves chocolate. It was just a matter of His father bans him from all candies, so he just wanted to eat chocolate behind his father's back, that is all. In the old Movie I felt that there was a strong relationship between Wonka and chocolate, something called ""Love""the second point was Charlie Bucket himself, Peter Ostrum, the kid who played Charlie's Role was very far from being a poor kid. He couldn't show why he needed the golden ticket that bad.Also the Oompa Loompa's, those small characters who really cooperated very good with Wonka to insure the idea of enjoying being badBut to be fair, I must state that the visual effects were really great specially the chocolate River, the elevator, the Squirrels.Also the Sound track was cool. it really helped me a lot in watching the movie.Big Sorry for Tim Burton, couldn't help it but I don't like your Movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nice movie for today's kids.,"I only recently watched the original movie as part of my ""classics I've never watched"" retrospective, and while I can see why there are elements that kids back then did like, it definitely didn't have the same effect on me and I found it a bit boring and dated. So without any nostalgia, I do think the Tim Burton treatment from this more recent take on the story does improve things quite a bit; I don't have children but if I did, I would be more likely to let them watch this version over the old one. That said, I still didn't enjoy it much more than that so besides entertaining your kids for a little bit, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Oy! Awful,"Sorry to report: Don't bother. Please. I'm glad I waited until we could order it through the digital cable, rather than shell out the bucks and sit through the whole thing with two young squirmy kids. Depp is simply creepy and entirely unrelatable. I liked the bratty kids better than his Wonka-- not the way it's supposed to be. We saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in a Junior Theatre live production-with an all kid cast- that was way more entertaining. Burton seems unable to decide whether he's going to go all-out crazy, over the top, Nightmare before Christmas/edward scissorhands surreal, or make it into a genial kids' movie, and flops. The Wilder version is better. I thought at least the effects would be better, or the movie would be visually better. It's not. Very disappointing. The parts with Charlie's parents/grandparents are the best/most interesting spots in the film, and that shouldn't be. Save it for when it appears on TV. We ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it-- that's how boring it was. Ouch!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Trip to the Chocolate Factory,"The original movie was good. If you have seen it, picture that with even more detail and background. That is close to what this film is. Tim Burton did a very good job with this and took us around the Factory while providing more insight than the first movie did. There is no better and worse here because they are both very good. This was a well-done movie. I enjoyed it and was glad that I saw an advanced screening to it. It was warm, charming, and fun. Depp did a superb, outstanding job as Willy Wonka. I know that many doubted that he would be able to do the job, but think about how long of a way he's come. He is a very good actor, and he proved so more here. I totally forgot that it was Depp playing the character. All I saw was Willy Wonka. He was just that convincing. If you want to see this movie but are worried about how Depp will do, relax now and go watch it because you will most likely not be disappointed. The movie is good and touching at some points, giving some details to Wonka's past, which is not emphasized in the original version. This lets you see who Willy Wonka actually is and why he is the way he is. There is a lot of symbolism, which is one of the movie's strong points. I like how there is a reason for everything and everyone. And in conclusion, the trip to the Chocolate Factory was a great and interesting one. The children will enjoy it especially with the many funny parts and everyone else will like it because it's entertaining. The worse thing I can mention about this is the way the songs were done by the Oompa Loompas. But they were still all right. They were passable. The great and artistic Burton did an overall good job with this film =)7.5/10 Stars",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Can't believe all the praise!,"When I look at all the positive reviews I can't believe my eyes. I really liked the first part of the movie when the 5 winners are found and presented. But what happens in the chocolate factory itself is visually stunning but very low on a human level. You never have the feeling that the kids are in a real competition and the parents react so strangely unemotional when their children screw up and must leave the party in such a painful way. Too bad! The 2001 joke was very funny, though. Of course there are some great candy ideas presented in the factory. But when you've seen one, two or three, then you've seen them all. The Gene Wilder version was much warmer overall. So I prefer that one when you compare the two.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"The idea is novel, but the plot is soso","The only twists and turns of the film is the plot of getting the chocolate coupon. Other plots can be guessed easily.

At the end, the reconciliation between father and son is also hasty.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A whimsical but mixed adaptation,"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" directed by Tim Burton and released in 2005, is a visually imaginative adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved novel. The film follows young Charlie Bucket as he wins a golden ticket to tour the fantastical and mysterious chocolate factory owned by the eccentric Willy Wonka, played by Johnny Depp.Tim Burton's signature style is evident throughout the film, with its quirky and darkly whimsical aesthetic. The set design and special effects create a vibrant and surreal world that captures the wonder of the original story. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is unique and memorable, though his interpretation is more peculiar and less warm than previous renditions, which may not appeal to all viewers.The film's strengths lie in its visual appeal and the performance of Freddie Highmore as Charlie, who brings a sincere and heartfelt presence to the role. However, some of the changes made to the original story and the added backstory for Willy Wonka feel unnecessary and detract from the overall charm.While ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is an entertaining film with a distinct style, it may not resonate with all fans of the original book. Its quirky and sometimes dark tone, combined with Johnny Depp's unconventional take on Wonka, make it a mixed but intriguing adaptation.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Willy Wonka is semi-sweet and nuts,"The first adaptation of the Roald Dahl book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was the movie classic Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), it had a particularly satisfactory performance from actor Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, good songs, and a use of imagination when it came to how the factory looked and how the candy/chocolate was made; so, it is interesting to see how Tim Burton can do a different adaptation on the book, now with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. Tim Burton's adaptation Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) has good performances with Johnny Depp's performance being the standout, the CG and practical effects are well-done, and the factory has a strange look to it; unlike the other movie where it focuses more on Charlie, this focuses more on Willy Wonka by giving some backstory to him, and how he got the Oompa Loompas, which was a bit interesting to see in his occasional random flashbacks he has during the tour through the factory.Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka gave a weird performance with strange interactions with the kids, but he can be funny from time to time, and the backstory on him was interesting with it relating to his dad in some way; though Gene Wilder's performance in the last movie was bit subtle on how weird he is, Johnny Depp's performance is more out there with acting weird and saying similar lines of dialogue from the previous movie. Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket gives a reliable performance, but Charlie as a character was standard, because I thought he was too perfect while Charlie in the previous movie acted more like a real kid when it came to emotion and personality; if he was shown like a real kid, then he would have been a bit more of a likable character, despite not being the main focus. Lastly, the other kids named Violet Beauregarde, Veruca Salt, Mike Teavee, and Augustus Gloop played by actors AnnaSophia Robb, Julia Winter, Jordan Fry, and Philip Wiegratz were good in the movie, and the film updated the character's quirks they had from the last movie making it work well with the movie.The movie does not have the songs from the last movie, but it has a good score by Danny Elfman and songs from the Oompa Loompas that are also made by Danny Elfman, what was interesting was that each song the Oompa Loompas would perform it would be in many styles or different music genres. The look of the factory is not bad, it has cool and weird looking rooms with beneficial effects and some effective uses of CGI, though some of the CGI does not work, it mostly all practical; the details in the backstory of Willy Wonka was interesting and made enough sense to why he started making a chocolate factory and acting the way he does, especially when he acts weird about certain things being asked to him about his past during the tour of the factory.Tim Burton's adaptation Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) was not bad, but not as good as the Gene Wilder movie, though I did like what this movie expanded on where the other did not; the movie had good performances, beneficial effects, funny moments, a unique style from Tim Burton, and a good score and songs from Danny Elfman. The movie has quite a few issues, but it does not make the movie awful by any means, I just do not see myself rewatching this that much despite it being a good adaptation; I just prefer the Gene Wilder version, but if you like Johnny Depp as an actor and Tim Burton as a director, then I would recommend giving this at least one watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
When will people realize...,"I saw this at a free screening, and first of all, before I talk about the movie itself, I'm going to yell at everyone who is trying to compare ""Charlie"" to ""Wonka."" It's ridiculous. Depp and Burton have stated, numerous times, that they are not ""remaking"" the first movie. They are making a new movie, based on the book. Depp has never even seen the old movie before, on purpose. Also, looking at the other side of things, they are NOT trying to purposefully be unlike the old movie either! If anyone thinks Tim Burton would be that petty, they don't know Tim Burton's attitude towards film making. Okay, now that that's off my shoulders. The movie was excellent. I went in not knowing what to expect and came out with a grin that wouldn't go away. The effects were great, the acting was magnificent throughout, and thank god they cast Depp instead of some of the other strange considerations they were thinking of. To some who say Jim Carey should have played the role, I say...dead wrong you are. Jim Carey has made one good movie, and that was eternal sunshine. He's not a good comedian and I hope he realizes that soon. Anyway, I digress. The movie was excellent, that's all there was to it, and I bet if the first one had never been made, more of you haters would think the same thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Perfect movie,"Charlie Bucket comes from a poor family, and spends most of his time dreaming about the chocolate that he loves but usually can't afford.

The kids who find the tickets will be taken on a tour of Wonka's chocolate factory and get a special glimpse of the wonders within. Charlie miraculously finds a ticket, along with four other children much naughtier than him. The tour of the factory will hold more than a few surprises for this bunch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Could they have done this any cheaper????,"It seemed that they were trying to cut corners with every scene. I remember Willy Wonka as being a great epic full oompa loompas and great acting. This movie takes one oompa loompa and pays him a days wage to play all the oompa loompas. Doesn't impress me, it just looks cheap. Many of the scenes were cut off looking as if it were filmed in the same undersized sound stage for each scene.And as for a good story line. could you maybe have given us something to care about before offing each child. And I seem to remember a great build up to Charlie finding a ticket. This one was so matter of fact. Booooooooring. Better to have just released the original on a special DVD with a picture of Johnny Depp on the cover.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pure Entertainment,"Tim Burton does it again. Along with Johnny Depp as the star and Danny Elfman creating the music, I don't think they could of found a better trio to make this movie anything less than great. I took my kids to see this movie at a sneak preview and they loved it. Johnny Depp is an excellent Willie Wonka, and gives it a great twist to the character. Johnny Depp has the ability to create a character that fits the roll. If you have seen Freddie Highmore in Finding Neverland, he was the best choice to play Charlie. Each character was well chosen and the humor is great. The script also gives wonder background to who Willie Wonka was before he became the eccentric later on in life. This is way better than the original. So if you watch it will be for pure enjoyment, taking you back to the simplicity of childhood, but with the complexity to remain true to the original book.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Some film you will not forget,"This film is very different to the first version of the film that is for sure.In 1971 the first film of Charlie and the chocolate factory you will see a romantic style to it with music and a light hearted storyline to go with it. Also the lovable actor/chactactor Gene Wilder who is Willy Wonka which I though he made this character's his own.In the updated version it is dark and wacky, the storyline is slightly different to the first version but most of the elements are their, with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonker who plays a dark and wacky Willy. This version it not a musical. You will either love it or hate this film.It show a more darker side when you look at life and people.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Too many old classics being changed,"I know i shouldn't be judging this movie before i see it but i cant bear to watch!!! There once was a time in America when kids wouldn't think of whats on TV or who likes whom but now everything has changed. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a classical movie of a simple boy and they changed it to make the movie rude and todays modern kids. I absolutely hate this whole making movies newer and funnier with insulting comments. I cant believe people would pay to see this. I know i should see this movie before i make comments on it but i cant stand to see old classical movies that are harmless and sweet turn to gross movies with Johny Depp in it. Now people wont listen to the morals in this movie but just stare at Johnny because he's SO hot or something. what happened to those sweet musicals kids would adore and actually learn something from??

Sweet Success,"As a lukewarm fan of the original Gene Wilder film and knowing Tim Burton's track record for films with great production but no substance, I went into this with low expectations but I was very pleasantly surprised of how enjoyable this was.I loved a few of Burton's movies (Big Fish, Ed Wood), but he always seems to make great looking films and his problem was that he never let the audience get to know the characters. Here we get a nice background and glimpse into Wonka's upbringing and why he became such an eccentric. The rest of the film follows along with the book and the original film pretty closely sans much of the music.Wonka invites 5 kids and a guest to get a tour of the magical factory via a golden ticket. Whichever of the kids is the least irritating wins the ultimate prize. The oompa loompas, chocolate waterfall, and everything you might recall from the book are there. Burton creates everything to his imagination and employs his usual staple Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. Depp is pretty good in his role as he plays Wonka like a little kid.The original film was the very first movie I ever saw in a theater and it scared the crap out of me. Hey, it was 1971 and I was 2. There is nothing scary in this film and the whole family should get a kick out of it. (***)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Almost exactly like Dahl would have wanted it,"I was always a huge fan of Dahl's book and had read it many times before seeing the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" The original film left me disappointed, mainly because Wilder's Wonka wasn't how the book had portrayed him, and the added scene with Charlie and Grandpa Joe sneaking a drink of the lifting stuff made Charlie out to be sort of a ""bad"" kid for an instant. This movie, however, has gotten the book onto film almost perfectly. The sets, costumes, characters are absolutely breathtaking-- they're all insanely colorful and unique and entirely Tim Burton's style. Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka very well. I won't get into specifics, but the approach he took with the character was less of Wilder's ""father figure"" and more of a brilliant and eccentric, yet somewhat callous, inventor. This movie will captivate audiences from the very beginning. I only wish Roald Dahl was still alive to see a movie that does justice to his classic book.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Looking Back, It's Not Awful","It's so tempting to make endless comparisons to the Gene Wilder version of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, but I think it's important to let this movie stand on its own merits - because it does manage to stand entirely on its own.Firstly, this film has the usual high points of a lot of Tim Burton movies: Tim's dark, zany storytelling methods mixed with Danny Elfman's phenomenal scoring and music. This movie, as with most of their other projects, is a near-perfect marriage of the two. It tells a story we already know - and, for anyone who was raised on the Gene Wilder version, loves - but it does it in such a ballsy, original way that it offers an experience unlike anything else.Johnny Depp is fantastic as the erratic Willy Wonka, a man you can never quite trust and that you wouldn't want your children around. Allegedly, Depp based his portrayal of Wonka off his best friend, Marilyn Manson, a parallel which becomes extremely obvious the more you watch. It has a nice blend of Sweet Dreams-style Manson, both alluring and repelling simultaneously; beautiful and ugly. He really does a good job of the character, giving something that doesn't just seek to imitate the incomparable efforts of the late Gene Wilder, which was what I feared would happen when I watched it for the very first time.The kids are all great. Freddie Highmore is a wonderful Charlie Bucket, albeit one that is far too saintly for his own good, but it's a fact that can be easily looked past.A story like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one that practically begs to be adapted by a mind like Tim Burton's and, although it was far from a perfect film, I can't help but think that most of its detractors are merely fans of the original film to the point that they can't see this one for what it is. It's much more faithful to the classic novel that kids and parents have loved for years and, while not being better by the Wilder film by any means, is still a charming yet dark and creepy journey to take.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Watch it!!!,"I watched this movie today, thinking that it was going to be pretty good, truer to the book, well acted, nice visuals, thinking that I had set my expectations too high, and guess what: It filled all my expectations!!! This movie is so true to the book, and is jet fresh and new.Me being a big fan of Rhoald Dhal and his book, I always thought that the Gene Wilder version was a little bit too detached from the great book version. I prefer this movie over 71 movie.Don't get me wrong! I really, really like the movie with Gene Wilder (a role he did great), but I love this movie.So, even if you're very fond of the old one, try watching this movie with a fresh mind, and if you're a fan of Rhoald Dhal, this movie is all you ever wished for.That's also why I believed this is (hopefully) the last version of this. There's a rumor of a sequel, (Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator) which I hope they will make and I will definitely watch.Johnny Depp gives us a great Wonka, Freddie Highmore is just the one as Charlie.The parents, grandma's and grandpa's all do it great.All the kids really are great, especially Jordan Fry as Mike Teevee. Julia Winter is more 'spoiled' instead of 'bratty' than Julie Dawn Cole in the first version. Philip Wiegratz is just it as Augustus Gloop, and finally Annasophia Robb does it amazingly well as the always winning chewer.The oompa loompa's are alway's fun. The music fit's every moment and has this such great visuals.This movie is a must see, even if you liked the older version. I did, and I still do.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Mid-way through I decided I didn't like it,"Tim Burton misses the mark... again. Here is a story that it seems to me would be difficult to ruin: a kid's movie about magical chocolate. The movie starts off well enough. We are introduced to Charlie's family and town and learn about the Chocolate factory. The finding of Charlie's ticket to visit the factory slowly lumbers towards its inevitable conclusion. This is my first complaint that the finding of the ticket was not serendipitous but treated as if desire can influence reality (remember kids, you can win the lottery so long as if you really, really want to win). OK. So what. It's forgivable. The story moves on and we find ourselves on a tour of the factory. For a while things are fine and then with one new plot device -- the elevator -- things go completely downhill. Now effects rather than character take over the story (I don't call them special effects because it's not often anymore that they 'wow' us... they are ordinary effects). The characters also act completely unnatural during some of these scenes (i.e., the parents and Wonka just sit back and watch barely concerned as their children do dangerous things). Anyway, the movie goes on until the end. There's no point about it except the most cliché of moral lessons ""your family is important"".The kids in the theater laughed a few times (but not as much as they have the potential for). As an adult, I laughed twice. Once was at a pretty good joke, I must admit, about what's edible. The other was at something that wasn't intended to get a laugh.Oh, regarding Wonka, what a strange dude! He's got problems... real problems.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The best movie on your screen in a long time!,"This movie is fantastic. It's directed by the brilliant Tim Burton and stars the hottest of hot Johnny Depp!

It is all about Willy Wonka and his truly awesome factory full of the coolest creations! (And little funny people!) I easily give this full marks. I love Willy Wonka as he has flashbacks and when he does his sad look you want to hug him. He also knows how to dance! Anyway my point is, is that this movie is fantastic and I don't think it matters if you are; young, old, weird, twisted, sick, funny, outcast, reject, mutated or afraid or small people (like myself) you will love this film and find something in it that moves you in a certain way. Of course small children may find Johnny Depp some what disturbing but they just don't understand the meaning of ""hot"" yet.

"Sweet flick, but Depp is a little tangy","Firstly I would like to point out that I have not read Roald Dahl's novel from which this movie is based off, but I have still been a huge fan of Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket since first watching Gene Wilder's ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory""...and then in every repeated viewing since. I was eagerly anticipating this movie for quite some time, especially since ""Big Fish"" has made Tim Burton one of my favorite directors. And, despite my high expectations, I liked it! The basic plot line of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is pretty well-known. Charlie Bucket is a exceedingly likable kid who loves his family and dreams of touring the mysterious candy factory headed by Willy Wonka. And when Wonka creates a contest to let five children into his factory by hiding five golden tickets underneath five Wonka Bars, his dream is finally realized. The story in itself gives the feel that the aura of the movie should be one of magic and mysticism, and Burton does a pretty good job at giving us that. While I generally favored the 1971 film's version of generating the mystery behind Willy Wonka, his contest, and his factory, the quirkiness of this trip cannot be denied.The highlight of the film is Freddie Highmore's portrayal of Charlie Bucket. Every time he gave a line, you just fell for his naturally good-natured attitude towards life, despite the challenges his family faces. I only wish he was given a bit more air-time, because the movie is worth seeing just to see Highmore act. The other four children (Veruca Salt, Augustus Gloop, Violet Beauregarde, and Mike Teavee) are all very lovable in their own respects, and are easily as good in the roles as those in the other Willy Wonka film. Sometimes they have a bit too much edge in their step, but it's all part of the nuttiness of the movie. Their parents don't have the impact they had in the original movie (all of them were hilarious in that), but their positions here are not completely compromised. The Oompa Loompas were right on point, and their classic songs have been pretty well updated for some good laughs from the audience. More back story to the Bucket family is very much appreciated as well.The only major qualm I have with this film is Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. I absolutely adored Gene Wilder as this character, with his quick wit, memorable one-liners, and general attitude towards his factory, the children, and the magic surrounding them all. While Depp does an incredibly good job as the character he develops (a nervous, neurotic Wonka), it just seems off somehow. While his character was written to be one a bit mental from his isolation, he appears to be engulfed in trying to be too weird. It is rather easy (while unfounded) to see where the Michael Jackson comparisons come in. He can be pretty funny at times, however, and it is also wonderful to see how Willy Wonka came to be with some ""increasingly"" common flashbacks with the splendid (but rather scary for this movie) Christopher Lee as Willy's father.But this is a pretty good film. While not as candy-coated as the 1971 classic, it's perfect for today's audiences. It is definitely worth seeing by old and young...but make sure to see ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" first.My Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Flat and plastic, with no help from the modern special effects","I did not think a remake of this story should have been made, but when I heard that Johnny Depp was to play Wonka and that Tim Burton would direct I figured if any...these were the people who could pull it off. They simply did not. This film lacks all depth and emotion and all of the bright colors and sweet goo could not bring an honest smile to my face. Where as in both Dahl's fine story and the 1972 film every character had some depth and warmth about them, and I truly felt pulled into a magical space, not without difficulty and pain (as in all of Dahl's work), in this 2005 production I felt as if the editor may has well have shuffled the scenes at random. Watching this film I felt as if I were walking down a cereal isle at a grocery store....surrounded by colors and sounds to entice, but with each box full of promises and distraction....each scene in truth sits isolated from the next, and most all are filled with sugar, artificial colors and air.All that I can hope is that anyone who cares to enjoy this fine story do so by picking up the book or watching the original film.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Besides the visual side with art direction and photography sensational, the film fulfills its primary objective to teach through fun, the magic of the cinema","When the egocentric Willy Wonka, owner of the largest chocolate factory in the world, decides to conduct a worldwide competition in which five children win a visit to their factory had been closed for more than fifteen years, a shipment of endless chocolate and one would still have one big surprise at the end of the tour, which inherit the chocolate factory. Among children was Charlie Bucket, who enchanted with the wonders of the plant, along with the other is fascinated with the visit and explore each compartment of the place.We can say that where Johnny Depp and Tim Burton are not go wrong with a view to long and fruitful partnership the duo. For the synopsis of the plot, the visual potential and creativity in such a process, Burton was the most obvious choice to lead this great cast. The main events and characters of the first adaptation are present and even better. Remake of the movie starring Gene Wilder in 1971, came a new generation avez be impressed by this classic of children's literature. You must agree that the first film has become a classic of cinema child and family, but I confess that I see no real reason to do so. Despite awakening our nostalgic side, is the fact that the characters were bizarre that caused more fear than empathy, the production was bad and depressing scenarios with ridiculous effects, besides having a cast with very weak performances and a screenplay extremely simple and without any depth. It was in short a plot and artistically bizarre without any refinement in its production with scenes totally badly finished. Now listen to some, as I've heard, the movie was wonderful and much better than the version of Burton's unfortunate. Some older works have their charm and are often damaged or represented so inferior in their remakes, but this rule is very widespread radicalism, especially in this case. Not only by modern production and the features and effects that had not at that time, it is much more than what Burton in snatches.In this Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Burton manages to develop this work treading the ground where you feel most comfortable, where he can actually develop, create, have fun and abusing his talent for the visual side of the plot. Here we see a color version, magic, music sticky but interesting, and that leads to a unique and captivating. In addition to the authorities already mentioned effects, the interesting scenarios that traveled during the visit by the factory, we have here also good performances from the entire cast. It is true that, as the original film and the book itself are extremely cartoonish and one-dimensional characters that do not see a concrete development, especially children. They are there simply to pass moral lessons and values to the viewer. Yet all do well. Jordan Fry like a glove to represent Mike Teavee showing his side fanatic violent videogames and a smart kid and like many technology of today. Philip Wiegratz as Augustus Gloop gave life to the inveterate eater chocolate. Julia Winter perfectly portrayed Veruca Salt, the spoiled and annoying to the extreme that does not like to be contradicted, and whose father makes all your wishes. The beautiful AnnaSophia Robb as Violet is magnificent showing inveterate mascadora gumball, world record holder and extremely competitive. And Freddie Highmore who was perhaps the only one that could further deepen your character, just do the basics and also shows a Charlie Smart, dreamy, family very humble but great heart, ie, the son that every mother would like to have and son that every mother would like to have.In the adult cast, Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, Deep Roy, David Kelly, Christopher Lee and others will also fine. But the highlight is the same Johnny Depp who gives life to an egomaniac, bizarre, bitter, needy and funny Willy Wonka. He steals every scene and even exceeds the protagonist of the story, Charlie, that gives title to the film. In my opinion far exceeded Gene Wilder. And to show preference Burton Wonka gradually creating certain expectation was valid and worked well. Another unquestionable is the fundamental work of Danny Elfman's soundtrack forward in bringing the magic while the dangers of visited environments.Besides the visual side with art direction and photography sensational, the film fulfills its primary objective to teach through fun, the magic of the cinema. Through stereotypical children are taught several lessons in morality and values. The ending is satisfying and closes the story with beautiful scenes of redemption, love, sensitivity and the main lesson that we can not rely only on material things and we find ourselves self-sufficient and the idea that we do not need anyone else to be happy. The family is our foundation and is necessary for all people, for only thus find true happiness, and that forgiveness and understanding are mandatory in our lives and essential to move forward.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nice kids movie,"First off, I have to admit, that I haven't seen the original Charlie & the Chocolate movie. So I won't be able to compare the movies with each other. But I can tell you that this is a nice little kids movie, that you've got here. Johnny Depp, a Tim Burton regular, plays his role with much gusto.But the kids are great, too. Not to mention the squirrels or Charlie's helpers, who are also great. But it's all too neat and as an adult and/or as a frequent movie goer, you'll know where this is going. No surprise there, but still plenty of fun to be had, if you let the movie have an effect on you. Also noteworthy, Burtons wife is also in this movie, as in his other efforts, too and the really great Christopher Lee has a small, but significant role to play here too!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Wonderful Chocolate With Fun Filled Center,"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is an absolute blast. You can't help but laugh your way through this one. The tale follows the novel much closer and keeps you in stitches. Johnny Depp brings Willy Wonka to life and his quick wit, and comedic performance will have audiences wanted a second viewing of the movie. I have tried to think of something I really didn't enjoy about the movie but haven't been able to think of a thing. From old to young audiences will enjoy this romp through the factory. I take nothing away from the original or Gene Wilder who have kept us entertained for years, but Depp has really brought Willy Wonka to life. If you don't enjoy this movie it is probably because of it's silliness, but if you like fun and fantasy, this movie is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Strange portrayal by Depp as effects run high, but the plot doesn't","In this adaptation from Roald Dahl's novel, Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands) stars as Chocolate maker Willy Wonka, who offers 5 kids across the world the chance to win a tour around his chocolate factory.It is amazing to see how times can change in the film industry, particularly in the animation aspect. If you were lucky enough to catch the original film with Gene Wilder in 1971 then you would have really appreciated the thought and dedication that went into the film.The effects and acting were stunning, none more so than Wilder. Now we find it hard to find a film without heavy dollops of animation, particularly in the fantasy genre.Yes the graphics in this Tim Burton adaptation are good, as is his direction, but there is no real beating the original.Depp's portrayal of the chocolate maker is very interesting to watch, an almost complete contrast to Wilder's. Wonka is portrayed by Depp as closed off, harsh and very insecure. This was based on his father's treatment, an interesting sub story which was not in the original.Personally I was not a fan of this portrayal as I had always imagined Wonka differently, but it was interesting to watch and understand.Highmore is good as Charlie, a more likable young kid than Peter Ostrum was. Though his constant pestering of Wonka can be annoying, his general character is sad and his helping has to be admired.The plot is fairly consistent, with many up and down moments. It isn't predictable but isn't funny either. The acting isn't the best and although the effects and dark opening are really impressive, it is a pretty average fantasy comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Burton pulls it off!,"8.3/10 When i saw the trailer for this film i thought it would be a terrible copy designed to get money with a popular name. I was wrong. Tim Burton does an amazing job with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Lets start with the acting. At first i thought Depp was a bad choice but he gives us a superb and different portrayal of Willy Wonka. I hate his haircut though. Freddie Highmore as Charlie was also excellent and he fit his role well. David Kelly as Grandpa Joe was pretty good but not excellent. Helena Carter and Noah Taylor also did a good job. Annasophia Robb, Julia Winter, Jordan Fry and Phillip Wiegratz all fit their roles perfectly as the bratty children and were very convincing. John August's screenplay was almost perfect. I liked the part about Wonka's childhood with Christopher Lee. Some of Wonka's lines were bad but overall the screenplay was funny and refreshing. My biggest problem with this movie was Danny Elfman's terrible oompa loompa songs. They are nothing like the catchy tunes from the original movie. Usually i like Elfman though. The cinematography of Rousselot shows the wondrous factory and Charlies poor family's house. Tim Burton has made an excellent movie out of otherwise used material. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though many reviews criticized it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Agustus Gloop digitally created?,"My wife suggested to me during the movie that Augustus seemed like an animated character so we were both paying very close attention to this during the show. Neither of us had heard this mentioned from anyone prior to the seeing the movie. It is very suspicious that there seems to be no other information available about this so called Philip Wiegratz. Apparently, there is also some confusion about his age and where he is from. It would be very politically correct and believable that Hollywood would create a digitized character for a child who is ridiculed to this extent. The whole thing seems very ""simone-esque"".Anyone know anything?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

He truly has become one - if not the - best actors of our time. All the children made the movie great with them being unique and creative. I liked the gum chewing girl and Charlie. The effects that they used to make the chocolate factory was incredible. The Oompa-Loompas looked so funny and their acting and dancing was hilarious. The director Tim Burton has great vision and the minor changes that he made from the original bring today's version easily into our homes. The only real weakness in this movie is that its kinda too dark and Charlie is very boring, he barely shows emotion, that messes it up. This movie can be boring sometimes and it feels a little weak, many people will enjoy this but others will hate it. Remember, this is just one guys opinion",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Love Them Both, for Different Reasons!","This latest adaptation of the children's classic CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY may suffer in the shadow of the 1971 original film starring Gene Wilder, but the new version of CHARLIE is full of its own brand of chocolaty goodness. Fans of the Roald Dahl novel will be pleased to learn that the larger portions of the film follow the book more closely than the Gene Wilder version, with occasional modern-day updates (such as TV addict Mike Teevee's portrayal as a video-game junkie).The child-cast play their bratty characters to the hilt, coupled with wonderful reactions from their equally loathsome parents, while Charlie and his poor-but-loving family are unfailingly heartwarming and honest. Johnny Depp plays a slightly squicky, hands-offish Wonka (think germ phobia, but for children) that is miles away from Wilder's devilish candy-maker. While Depp's Wonka may be off-putting in his first few scenes, by the end of the film he is not only enjoyable, but almost lovable. Add to this scene-stealing performances by Deep Roy (who plays a whole factory of Oompa-Loompas voiced by composer Danny Elfman) and Christopher Lee, and you have a wickedly wonderful film--and this from someone who went into the theatre ready to defend to the death the 1971 version!If you loved the Gene Wilder original, find a place in your heart for the very different charms of CHARLIE.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Imaginative and Different,"There are a lot of good things about this version of Roald Dahl's classic. I loved the interaction between Charlie and his family. The scenes in the chocolate factory are imaginative and fun to watch. Loved the production numbers with the Oompa Loompas, but found myself wanting the words on the screen...there were times I couldn't understand them. The fates suffered by the nasty children are all fitting and fun to watch. In the 1971 version, we never saw what happened to the kids later, but they did show them leaving at the end of this one. That was a nice change, and funny.I think the movie would have been better had Wonka been made a little more likable and warm. He comes across and just a little too creepy to be likable. Having said that, there were several good laughs in this, and lots good special effects. You can certainly tell that Tim Burton directed this. It is indeed darkly funny, and some smaller children may be disturbed by this.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Left a Sour Taste In My Mouth,"Being 18 the original Willy Wonker was one of the first films I ever watched. Therefore seeing a remake with star cast and big budget set me off in high hopes. How sicken therefore to find this abomination of such a fantastic memory, I don't think I will be able to watch even the original again and still enjoy it. Perhaps first it is key to highlight the disgusting way Depp plays Wonker with his unbelievable similarity to Micheal Jackson! Some of the lines I actually found disturbing. Then add into the mix the fact half of the message was cut out in the fact No-one was bribed to smuggle recipes out and Charlie didn't float to the ceiling and already the recipe for this Wonka treat look disastrous. Then don't forget the tacky additions of Wonka's troubled childhood and them not finishing the story where the should because they made a jackass of keeping to the original plot and you have a pretty good idea of how bad this is. I feel sorry for children who never see the original and instead have to claim this as their only version. A complete letdown! RIP Willy Wonka!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
blew me away too!,"I am so incredibly impressed with the team that made this film. They all did an amazing job.

Deprive the world a new & wonderful story that has the benefits of all the technology that has come our way..since what? 1971, was it?

if you hate croclate you like it anyway,"I have seen Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion, the journey M. Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it ""reality"" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with ""real"" sets, ""real"" Oompas Loompas, ""real"" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film.After that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many – the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those ""weird"" (a word he likes – you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.What can I tell you more ? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.As for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the ""family"" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the ""Edward Scissorhands"" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Failed, to my disappointment","After reading a glowing review in Entertainment Weekly for this movie I eagerly rented it and settled in for a cozy movie night. What I got was a head-scratching film that left me with a distinctly sour taste in my mouth. The original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of my personal favorites. I was well aware that this would be a far cry from that version. This version is decidedly more faithful to the book but I feel it reflects more of Tim Burton's need to be kooky than it does of capturing the sugary irresistibility of the book. The movie, simply put, is not simple enough. Granted, the book is often maniacal and bizarre but too much emphasis is placed here on the look. The actors seem, to me, to be wandering aimlessly among the sets, seeing them but not feeling them. The children fail to provide a new and interesting interpretation on the characters, instead becoming blah clones of the feisty five-some in the original. In fact, you would think their parents dragged them to the set every morning against their will. Their ""parents"" fare no better. How anyone could possibly laud these performances compared to the 1971 original is beyond me. Depp's Wonka is passable but far too creepy to be endearing. He has his moments though. The music is, sadly, another weakness of the movie. It is simply too jarring and techno-modern for this version, even if it is a contemporary remake. There are a few bright spots here and there. The visuals are gorgeous and I was delighted to see the more accurate portrayal of the boat (a viking ship instead of a strange floating surrey thing). Deep Roy (how can I get a name like that?) does an admirable job as all the Oompa-Loompas. Not one of them looks exactly alike. I wasn't too fond of the character design though. Overall, not the best of Burton. See this one for a quick trip but see the original to be truly transported.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Especially the first room where they come is of course really very beautiful.The characters in the movie are really very funny and fun. My favorite character is definitely Grandpa Joe.

When I heard Burton (one of the best directors of our time) and Depp (BEST actor of our time) were going to do this, I was excited. Then the commercials came, and I was even more excited. I went into this and wasn't disappointed. I'm not kidding, I laughed so hard, the only times I wasn't laughing was when I was listening to the lines delivered by Depp. Depp gives an awesome performance. It is just what the books meant him to be, crazy. He very much reminded me of Mr. Rodgers. All the kids were great. The directing is awesome. How could you expect less of him? The sets and everything is magical you just get absorbed into this movie, and you believe everything he tells you. Now to the music. I was worried when I heard the Oompa Loompas sing, but when I heard it was based off Dahl's lyrics, I wasn't worried. They were hilarious and the Loompas were great. This has some interesting new things to it also, like the back story of Wonka. I say if you see one comedy this year. See this, it sure kicks Bewitched's ass.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Perfect in every aspect,The movie that is meant to focus on the book closely did an exceptional job in keeping to the format of the book of Roald Dahls book. I loved every moment of it.

As soon as i say the first few minutes of it i wanted to watch more and more and i was so engulfed by the movie and i couldn't stop watching it. If you read the Roald Dahl book and really liked the way that it then this is Definitely the movie that you should watch because it is the better one of the two that are already in existence i.e. Willy Wonka being Gene Wilder in the older one and Johnny Depp in this one.,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Fun Movie, But Still Not As Good as Wilder","I saw the movie this weekend and really, really enjoyed it. Burton achieves so much more visually and with the script than the earlier version. However, I came away favoring the Gene Wilder version over the Johnny Depp version.Primarily, it was because with the Gene Wilder version, you could tell that everything that happened with the children and their parents was known to Wonka. It was a if every single event and utterance had been pre-scripted by Wonka and the visitors were merely acting out their assigned roles--even if they were unaware that they had been assigned parts. Wonka was a bit snide, more than a bit pixie-ish; he was displaying all these wonderful toys, events, and observations and was just *hoping* that someone would notice. But, of course, no one did because they were too greedy and too preoccupied with stealing the secret for Slugworth. Everyone, that is, except Charlie and Grandpa Joe...And we soon learn that Wonka (the Gene Wilder one) knew that Charlie would be the winner and, in fact, planned it that way up to and including the final test.Johnny Depp's character, however, was simply neurotic. He didn't know of the children (Gene Wilder knew all about them). Depp's character was lost in his own factory, surprised when one of the children acted up, was childishly enraptured with the Oompa Loompa songs, and seemed startled to discover that--suddenly--Charlie was the only survivor. Furthermore, he was genuinely shocked when Charlie valued family over candy. His repeated ""interactions"" with the glass elevator didn't help at all.Additionally, the movie seemed forced to super speed. The kids were hardly in the place before they started being eliminated. We really got to know and despise the kids in the older movie...here, they almost seemed as afterthoughts. It is true that the older movie seemed to take about 2.5 hours just to GET to the factory, but it made the elimination of the kids all the more pleasant.And the Oompa Loompas? Great concept. However, I have no idea what they were singing during their songs. Loud, raucous, grating rock-and-roll presented at hyperspeed? Danny Elfman is a master, but that was a poor, poor choice of presentation. I'd almost rather have not had any musical interludes at all.On the plus side (and there were plenty). I loved the Wonkitania boat (although I loved the older boat ride...much creepier than this one was exciting), loved the squirrels, the Oompa Loompas, Charlie's relationship to his family. The chocolate room was lush (although brief, brief, brief compared to the older movie), the children and parents were absolutely delightful and spot-on with their portrayals (we just didn't have much time to get to know and hate them), and the backstory about Willy and his dad was a nice addition.So...it was not (in my opinion) a bad movie. By itself, there's nothing to not like (except maybe the Oompa songs). But when compared to the older movie...well...I'm pretty sure that any of my return visits to Wonkaland will have Gene Wilder as my host.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
No Heart No Soul,"This is a so-so adaption of the book. However I love the first movies lovable brats! This film not even Charlie is lovable!The original movie has a heart. You liked the bratty children and Willy Wonka because were relate-able. No so in this version. The original also had a very magical spirit to it. This movie has no heart or soul! It is creepy.In the first movie The children were regular children. In this version we have ""Hollywood Children"". There is a bigger budget for this production but that was not an improvement.This movie has has ""Millions to spare"" on special effects. Since these effects are done in post production the children in this production had nothing to act to when they shot their part. So they are emotionally not involved in the scenes which harms this film!The film is over produced.(They have 1 man play all the om pa- lompas). However the best thing they did with the millions was the demise of Veruca Salt. They were able to do the squirrels (that was in the book). However I like the first movie's Veruca Salt's better.Johnny Depp plays Wonka like he is Michael Jackson. So that means he is just creepy. In The book Wonka isn't a creep! He loves children! In this movie he isn't a nice person! I am sure this movie will be a box office hit! I just hope if they do ""Charlie and great glass elevator"" they will make it with care. In fact they should let Chris Columbus direct it!Tim Burton is good in worlds of his own creation but his bizarre touch harms the overall effect of this film .Do yourself a favor buy the original film and pass on this!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A strong revisitation of the classic, although quirkier and slightly updated.","The original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilder in the lead is somewhat of a classic for many people, and much like with The Planet of the Apes, I just didn't think it should be remade, or indeed could be.Yet in this version the story is very close to the original and only deviates in some places.There's the same degree of oddness as well as good fun but also there's an added adult level to play to which is rather quite effective.The whole movie proves to be very close to the original except for the ending which takes the story in a new and altogether well fitting direction.Johnny Depp is surprisingly good as Wonka. I have to say that when I first saw and heard him in character I made a mental comparison to Wilder and rejected him immediately. Yet during the film he managed to pull the character off really well portraying stupidity alongside a calculating, almost malevolent quality. He certainly has captured a completely quirky and non-grown up persona.Freddie Highmore is also very good, not being too sickly sweet but capturing that childhood innocence very well. The other children stand strong alongside him, but none truly shine.One of the notable things about the movie is the addition of a new family and Golden Ticket winner, the TV family. To modernise the movie the child is a mind of information and has assembled it all through watching TV and also playing videogames. It's slightly twee in the concept, but it works well.Although there are these tweaks and updates to the story, it's not harmed the movie any and still retains a lot of the feel of the original. You feel the emotion when Charlie shares his Birthday chocolate bar with his family or when he finally finds the Golden Ticket, or even when Wonka meets his Father against and we understand some of his quirks.Tim Burton has done a good job and given us a very entertaining family film and pulled another excellent performance from Depp. A very good revisitation of the story, surely set to be the replacement on the Christmas TV list.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wonka's a Weirdo!,"Well, I saw this movie today and didn't quite know what to expect. Depp as Wonka is, I must say, a tad on the creepy side, but it was probably intended that way. I must say it's always nice to see bad kids get theirs. That little Freddy Hightower was wonderful in the last Depp picture (Finding Neverland), and he's great again in this one. What a wonderful little child actor. My favorite stars of the movie were not human, however. My favorites were the squirrels. They were very squirrelly-ly portrayed, and if they were CGI, I couldn't tell. The oompa loompa's dancing was a little clumsy, but their singing was good.

A young boy wins a golden ticket to go inside the chocolate factory of his dreams!,"Once again the partnership between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have successfully made a brilliant film. Personally i have never really like the musical version of the Roald Dahl book and was looking forward to see how Tim Burton had really got to the dark side of Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp like always gives a tremendous performance as Willy Wonka, he was funny and dark at the right times which gave extra depth to the character. Like many of the Tim Burton films there was a quirky element throughout eg, making the Bukett house look like it was slopping so there for everything seemed to be on a tilt. he also (which i have to praise him about) got rid of the hideous white/orange/brown Oompa Loompas and brought in the wonderful Deep Roy, who did a good job by playing all of the factory workers. Overall i think this film was excellent and recommend that everyone should see it even if they didn't like the book or don't like the actors i assure you that you will be leaving the cinema or switching the television of and wanting chocolate!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Road to creativity,"Tim Burton usually creates wonderful fantasy movies but this time he adds an extra layer that lifts it above his previous work. Part of this comes from the story by Roald Dahl, but here he squeezes everything out of it and then some.Chocolate making serves here in the story and movie as a metaphor for creative thinking. Four children represent a characteristic that hinders creative thinking: greed, excessive competitiveness, money and science. Each is eliminated in the road to creativity except for a heart (family values). These are incorporated in the end to give sense to the creative process. One level higher we have Johnny Depp as the creative actor and Tim Burton as the creative moviemaker. Both face the same obstacles as Willy Wonka; Tim Burton is Willy Wonka to be more precise.The movie resembles and refers to The Wizard of Oz in its sets and music. And there is a nice reference to 2001 when Mike Teavee is made shorter, 2001 being one of the most creative movies ever made. The criticism of TV is still up to date nowadays.This succeeds also thanks to the wonderful work of the production and art departments but it is the cinematography of Philippe Rousselot that gives the movie something extras in shaping the worlds. Once he did Diva, a movie that redefined existing art direction. The enormous color contrast between the gray cities and the colorful sets enhance the experience here.Anyone who thinks this is about Jackson hasn't got the message. Besides that Burton has clearly dismissed all references. There is however a short dance by one of the children that resembles Jackson's and the interpretation of his role by Depp makes all the gossip somewhat understandable.The songs are not the most creative parts and somewhat repetitious. They could have edited this to a shorter movie. Why do most movie makers still think that more is more?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Complete garbage,"Can't rate this any lower, but if there were a cringe factor then it would get a 10. I found it 'nearly' as bad as Blair witch project (only this was in color!). As i grew up with the original I class it as a classic. This movie will be quickly forgotten due to the slow, boring and unexciting script and storyline.The story starts out well enough but the agonizing slow and unspectacular way Charlie finds the golden ticket is reflective to the rest of the movie.Not going to the movies all that often i was looking forward to relaxing and watching what i thought would be and entertaining movie. The closest i've ever been to walking out of a movie. This is two hours of my life i'll never get back.. Don't let it happen to you!To other people who have commented favorably to this movie..

If it's not broke.....,"First I must start out by saying ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is my all time favorite movie. There I said it, now lets talk about this Luke warm attempt at a re-make.Loved Johnny Depp, the trailers don't do him justice, but he does give Willy a creepy Michael Jackson quality.The movie starts off really wonderfully, I was excited to hear the kids reactions when there was no golden ticket and when there was. It gives me a warm fuzzy to hear those innocent reactions to story they haven't heard yet. So that said....The factory. Tim Burton can not tell a story or convey the magic of the original. He even said in an interview he never liked the original and also wanted to remake the story. He needs to go back and read the book and find the story. His transitions are boring and uneventful. His characters are lost and unlikeable. Unlikeable, but we really don't care what happens whether their good or bad.A friend summed up this movie in a nutshell. ""Image visiting a house you grew up in, it's been remodeled and new people live there, and you just feel awkward being there.""I can't recommend seeing this flick, because it just encourages Hollywood to keep remaking and ruining classic movies. Just look at this summer ""War of the World"", ""Willy Wonka"", ""Bad News Bears"", ""Herbie"", ""Amittyville"", ""Wax Works"" etc. There's slump in the box office, according to Hollywood, and it's because of this rehash trash.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hats off to Tim Burton,"I went to the first showing of this film yesterday, and I have to admit, I was in no way disappointed! Burton has most certainly done an excellent job in remaking this classic, giving it a more modern flare. His slightly creepy humor gives this movie the impeccable taste that was so appeasing in Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow.Jonny Depp does an excellent performance as the slightly demented, but lovable, Willy Wonka. He proves, once again, that he is able to take any role, and portray it with the ease, and believability that many people crave for in movies in this day and age.The children discovered for this movie were perfect. They all had wonderful personalities, and never left the viewer board. The boy casted for Charlie was WONDERFUL. He was the absolute perfect part! All in all, I believe Tim Burton has done it again, another wonderful movie with many laughs, and a good lesson too. I'm ready to add it to my DVD collection, as soon as it comes out!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An in-Depp spin on Wonka,"I just finished Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and was very impressed. Burton dazzles us with startling imagery and a perfect modern recreation of what we all envision the towering Wonka factory to be. Though Johnny Depp hasn't always impressed me, his quirkiness plays a vital role to bringing the ever-so disturbing character of Willy Wonka to our hearts. We see very quickly how much this movie differs from the original, in some distinct ways. Parts of the setting has been modernized, and is a very interesting mix between times and generations. Also, we see some background to Willy Wonka and explanations to why exactly he is the marvel he is. This movie for every sense was beautiful and stunning. Burton really hands us a treat with this one, and we should treasure it like a tiny morsel of creamy chocolate melting in the mouth. The reasons this movie is not a 9/10 or a 10/10 starts with the oompa loompas. While often funny and strange, the original orange and green oompa loompas served the setting much better. Everything is so colorful in the Wonka factory, why not the oompas? Also, they tried way to hard on the songs and just seem to come out over-the-top and not with the power held by the original's. Also, I would have liked to see Charlie's character have a larger role in the picture. They have reduced his role in the story to give Wonka a bit more depth, which in my opinion hurts the final 20 minutes of the story and impact that it is supposed to serve. Overall this a great movie though and I would recommend it to anybody. If you've never experienced Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, get ready for visuals the will spark your inner child and definitely an in-Depp spin on Willy Wonka and his amazing factory. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Don't listen to the critics... This movie has charm,"I saw ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" this weekend just after it opened, and all I can say is that I thought it was a heck of a lot better than the critics made it out to be. Johnny Depp played the part of Willy Wonka exactly as I had pictured him from the book, and it was a shock to know that this quirky chocolate maker had also been Capt. Jack Sparrow from ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Talk about talent. Another thing was that the movie followed the book a lot better than the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" There were a few parts added to give Wonka some background, but nothing major. Plus, all of the other actors (the children, in particular) gave perfect portrayals of their parts. This is a must see for the whole family!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Decent but for a real treat noting beats the original's sweetness..,"I respect Burton's attempt at re-shaping a classic. As re-makes go, it was alright but as a movie by itself, it lacked luster. Nothing was very memorable and Depp came off as a creepy, Micheal Jackson-like character who's weird ways in no way reflect the genius Wonka supposedly has. The Oompa Loompas (or the one guy playing all of them) were very forgettable, and made me long for the rhythmic rhyming of the 70's Loompas. The little comedy that Burton is famous for throwing into his films wasn't very apparent in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and so dumbed down, the moments often went unnoticed. Overall, the film was basically trying to modernize an already great movie for the sake of dollars, banking on Depp's abilities, which unfortunately couldn't bring this rather boring copycat to it's full potential . Gene Wilder hopefully realizes he has nothing to worry about over his title as the one and only Willy Wonka.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
not worth your money at all,"After suffering through the incredibly boring and 'bad-taste' version of this '70s classic only one good thing came out of it: I decided to join this movie review site and check every movie BEFORE I bring my kids to the theater. Don't even dream about wasting your money buying the DVD!!!!The adorable oompa loompas that I remembered from the previous version were substituted by boring, unattractive copies of mechanical dancers. The scenes of Charlie as an abused boy were disgusting and not appropriate for children. No kid laughed even once during the whole movie!!! that should tell critics something!!!Innocence, laughter, creative mystery and funny jokes are not a part of this movie. Just because technology is there to make movies it doesn't make a movie is good or worth watching. Depp is a wonderful actor and that saved the movie in a way but I'd like to see him be more careful in choosing the movies he makes for children. This is a negative step in his career.

Not that bad of a movie.actually pretty fun and entertaining,"Some things that i liked about this film were the family and Charlie. Charlie is perfectly cast, i also like the grandpa better in this film than the original and the mom is played by Helena Bonham Carter who has also been in Tim Burton's Sweeny Todd and Planet of the Apes. I liked how Wonka is not displayed up-front from the start even though we know its johnny deep and we've seen what he looks like in the trailer, by not showing him right away it helped add some mystery to the character which carried through out till the end of the movie. The special effects were very good everything seemed to belong in this fun world, nothing came across as a 3d computer building or bad use of special effects.In this story they go into Willy Wonka's past too his child hood which really helped me to understand this character something the original really didn't do also they give us a better understanding of how this chocolate factory works, example the oompa loompas have a back-story that perfectly explains why they would want to work in this factory.Some things I didn't like about this movie were unfortunately the oompa lumps they really didn't work or should I say he didn't work for me at all being as its only one actor being duplicated on screen. The actor was good but I felt like I was seeing the same actor duplicated and not individual oompa loompas that looked alike. Also the oompa loompa songs weren't anything to remember they were actually really annoying and slowed the movie down, I was actually hoping to hear Deep sing since Gene Wilder sang in the original but there was no singing from Deep here.If you are a fan of the original Willy Wonk and the Chocolate Factory and Burton and Deep's collaboration's like Ed Wood,Sweeney Todd,and Edward Scissor Hands then you will probably like this movie as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This movie isn't a tribute to Mr. Wilder, it's not supposed to be like the original. It's a tribute to Mr. Dahl, the original writer of the book that inspires it all. And it's a fine tribute, at that. I was lucky enough to see this at a 'sneak peek,' and would gladly see it again. I only gave it 8 out of 10 stars because it did take a bit of a wild turn towards the end of the movie. This is a great movie and enjoyable for both the young & old alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The original musicals were pretty good, sung with appreciation and talent. Can't say the same here.Depp's performance, as bizarre as it is, is rather woeful. Reminds me too much of a Michael Jackson imitation and that's not what you want to be thinking about watching this film.The overall plot more or less follows the original in some ways, but really there's nothing to be gained from it. It wasn't ambitious enough, although the imagery was nice and splendid, it was sadly backed up by shoddy writing and direction.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tim Burton and Roald Dahl:  A Movie Marriage Made in Candyland,"When my husband and I heard that Tim Burton was making a new film version of Roald Dahl's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY starring his favorite leading man Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, the world's quirkiest candy maker, we knew it would be a perfect match of filmmaker and source material, and indeed it is! Burton's inventive imagination and dark, twisted sense of humor suits Dahl's gleeful misogyny perfectly, yet still results in a family-friendly film simply because, like Depp's Willy Wonka, it doesn't pander to the young'uns. Indeed, Wonka doesn't even seem to like the golden-ticket-winning kids he invites to his weird and wonderful confection factory, though in his own oddball way Wonka eventually warms up to our hero Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). Who wouldn't like the selfless, poor-but-thankful-for-his-blessings Charlie, especially compared to the four spoiled brats competing against him for the ""special prize"" Wonka dangles before them? The kids' acting styles work well, with young Highmore's un-actorish down-to-earth quality playing off well against the appropriately flamboyant brattiness of AnnaSophia Robb (as super-competitive Violet Beauregarde), Julia Winter (Veruca Salt, the overindulged rich kid), Jordan Fry (Mike Teevee, now an aggressive video game freak as well as a television addict) and Philip Wiegratz (Augustus Gloop, a sweet-faced but selfish glutton). Wonka is also given a back story of funny yet poignant strife with dad Christopher Lee, a dentist (!) who takes his work just a little too seriously. This angle could have been as overly sweet as a bad piece of candy, but the cast, Burton, and screenwriter John August work it gracefully into the family theme. Unlike Wonka, Charlie has a loving relationship with his eccentric family (all played with warmth and wit by a cast of fascinating faces, especially David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, Noah Taylor as Charlie's dad, and Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's cabbage-soup-making mom). It helps that Depp and Highmore have good chemistry. (Fun Fact: Depp recommended Highmore to Burton after working with the lad in FINDING NEVERLAND. Another FN veteran in the cast: Eileen Essell of DUPLEX fame, playing Charlie's Grandma Josephine.) With Alex McDowell's production design, Philippe Rousselot's lush photography, and Gabriella Pescucci's costume design, the movie is deliriously gorgeous to look at, like a collaboration between Edward Gory and Peter Max. Thanks to the deadpan performance (or should I say performances? :-) of a CGI-multiplied Deep Roy, along with Danny Elfman's fabulously fun score -- with songs based on lyrics from Roald Dahl himself, yet reminiscent of Elfman's work with Oingo Boingo -- the Oompa-Loompas' production numbers are a delight to watch and listen to (no cover version of ""The Candy Man,"" sorry! :-). Our whole family had a blast -- CHARLIE... is the tastiest sweet-and-sour sugar rush of the summer!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A magnificent tale for children.,"Charlie Bucket is the son of a very poor family, but he is full of hope and each day, he falls asleep with the dream of the chocolate factory near his poor house, the Willy Wonka's factory, the factory of a man full of genius.

Nevertheless, each day many trucks leave the factory with goods for the whole world and nobody knows how the shop is be able to produce these goods. But, on day, Willy Wonka decides to open his workshop for a visit to five children, each of them that have found a golden ticket in a chocolate tablet. Charlie is one of the winners. During the visit of the factory, the four other children that are bad ones encountered problems and Charlie remains the only one to win the final reward: the property of the chocolate factory. But for that, he might leave his family and he refuses the reward to remain with his parents and grandparents The movie is a brilliant and amusing tale, full of inventiveness and of special effects that is refreshing movie for children, but also for all adults who have preserved their childhood soul.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I was very frustrated about the songs and that they weren't the original songs. I understand wanting new songs to make a more original movie but somehow Ijust expected oompa loompa doopity doo! :) the end had a nice twist though that made me a little happier with the movie, and it did have a subtle family plot that was absent in the original movie so overall it was pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Wow, what weird fun!","I had the pleasure of taking two of my three children. My seventeen year old daughter loved it, however, my nine year old son didn't care for it. She is a HUGE Depp fan and thought he did an excellent job. I thought the special effects were unique and this movie was much more in line with the book. What I thought was interesting was that Dahl wrote the screenplay for the first movie - to me it was as though, he was trying to appeal to children on their level. Whereas, Burton told the story using flashbacks - for Wonka and this seemed to line up with the theory of psychoanalysis and film.I would highly recommend this movie to students who have previously read the book. It holds true to that medium and trying to compare it to the previous movie is like trying to compare a bicycle to an automobile.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A film of the book, not a remake of the 1971 sickly sweet debacle","I read the book when I was a kid. I loved it. So I read the sequel. I loved that too. So re-read both... over and over again. The movies of my mind were magnificent.One day I saw that the 1971 movie was being shown on TV. So I watched it. I was so disappointed. It was nothing like the book. Sickly sweet and lacking all the darkness, full of stupid schmaltzy songs and a Charlie, Grandpa Joe and Willy Wonka that were nothing like the ones of my imagination.When this film came out I was already a parent of children who had read the books. I doubted it'd be very good, but being a Tim Burton movie I thought I'd give it a go.Apart from the needless Willy Wonka backstory, it's entirely faithful to the book. The Bucket house, Charlie's family, his home town, the factory... everything. The only songs, the ones the Oompa Loompas sing whenever one of the kids gets what he or she deserved, were worded from the lyrics Roald Dahl wrote in the books. The result is a dark series of cautionary tales that does total justice to the first book, and one that I believe Roald Dahl himself would have loved or at least approved of. Because he too hated the 1971 film.If you were a child who read the books, a true icon of children's literature, you'll probably love this. If you were a child enchanted by the 1971 Hollywood travesty then you'll hate it.I know which camp I'd rather be in.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - Tim Burton's take on the famous Ronald Dahl novel. Though Charlie (Freddie Highmore) is sweet, sensitive and good natured, just as Charlie should be, this is Johnny Depp's show. As Willy Wonka, he is kooky, awkward, and always funny. The camera just gravitates to what he is doing at all times. His voice is a sort of hybrid California Girl giggle mixed with someone slightly Canadian. And not every other sentence out of his mouth is a literary quote. David Kelly seems far less creepy than he did in the trailer, but rather a very endearing grandfather. The four little devils all have plenty of personality to go around, and sometimes too much so. I think everyone'll be glad to see them meet their inevitable punishment.Surprisingly, Burton's version is far less dark than the 70's version. I actually liked that we saw the four greedy children alive and well after their mistakes, whereas in the other movie it was rather like ""Maybe they're dead. Maybe they're alright. Who cares?"" This happy ending isn't held back by 4 possibly dead children who paid through the roof for their foolish mistakes, because we see them alright, or severely altered.I was a little unsure about the script writer John August, because I saw the dastardly Charlies Angels2 movie. Surprisingly this script is filled with humor and moments both tender and awkward (but in a good funny way). Wonka and Charlie both have more fleshed out with family backstories which adds to the characters. Charlie has his loving mother and father (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) who we see in quite a few scenes. Wonka has his dentist father (Christopher Lee), whose strict rules on candy caused Wonka to go into the business of candy-making. There are way too many funny quotes to count.As with all Tim Burton movies, atmosphere is the name of the game. Wonka factory is this giant factory amid all the little people, with Charlie and his family living in this little shack that would not meet even the loosest of building requirements. England is dull and snowy. The jungles of Loompaland are vibrant and earthy. Wonka's factory is bright and colorful. The production values are top-notch.In conclusion, if you were not taken with the other Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie, as I was, give this a try. Sorry Gene Wilder, but I like Depp's performance better. This gets an A-",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wonka a triumph... excluding the songs.,"Johnny Deep does a wonderful job, and continues to impress his versatility on moviegoers in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocalate Factory"". Similarly, Tim Burton gives us all we would expect along the lines of creativity. The children in the move were especially impressive in the individual styles they portrayed. I probably could have watched a whole movie about the fat German kid. Anyway, the film is much truer to the book than the 1971 version, so you can take that for what its worth. The MAJOR detraction from my viewing experience was the umpa-lumpas or, rather, the terrible songs they sang. Danny Elfman (music) is usually a tremendous addition to the movies and series he is involved with, but I would say that his work with these songs downgraded the entire film. They were mesmerizingly corny, each trying to touch upon different genres of popular music. They were long and overemphasized as well. Elfman is a very talented composer, but he leaves much to be desired in his lyrics. I might be alone in this, but I don't much care for watching and listening to hundreds of little umpa-lumpas in tight latex choreographed like a highschool musical and dancing to crappy songs. I am going on about this because I think the songs shrink the potentially broad age-range that would enjoy the film. Otherwise, it's a great movie. I could go into all the things I liked about the movie, but I'm sure they are all covered in other reviews. Rock an roll.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tim Burton is dead! Long live the next great director!,"We endured Big Fish, we even managed to swallow Planet of the Apes, however, a man who was once a king amongst directors (back in the good old days of Batman, Beetlejuice, Scissorhands) has sadly passed away and resorted to making pointless tripe that is little more than a step up from the Teletubbies!!!! Though I have seriously disliked Burton's latest 'sell out' movies, I have to say that even THIS was too awful for him! I would liken it more to The Cat in the Hat or The Grinch. The character's are completely 1 dimensional wierdos (even Charlie and his family who are supposed to be the warm, familiar, human side of the story) and none of the actor's appear to have no chemistry whatsoever (even Charlie and Depp, who I thought worked well in Finding Neverland together).Traditionally, you would expect the Burton version to be much darker than the original, however, in this case, the original is the darker of the 2, whereas Burton's version is more like an episode of 'My Little Pony!' I would recommend this film maybeye to a 14year old girl who owns a Jack Skeleton backpack, listens to 'My Chemical Romance' and thinks that Donnie Darko is "" Like, the cleverest cult film ever!!!""

"Perfectly created, perfectly realised fairytale","I don't usually go big on kids movies. Animation, for instance, makes me grit my teeth. The Harry Potter movies left me exceptionally unimpressed. I went into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory half expecting to be bored after the first half an hour.OK, it's got quite a bit going for it - Tim Burton is not exactly a beginner, although his films have been a bit uneven. Johnny Depp's forte has long been fantasy, and the combination has yielded some of Burton's directorial best (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). Finally though the team have come up with their most polished and flawless work yet.

And don't tell me about escapism, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers' mindless fluff had more wit than this. Escapism is not supposed to embarrass you, and this movie made me flush. Johnny Depp acted like an idiot. None of the kids had any personality or acting talent, the grown ups were cardboard, and the oompa loompas were one guy digitally made smaller (death to all things digital) and multiplied. Oh, and one had a baritone voice, how funny is that? How funny are inside Hollywood references and pop references? It is so embedded in the idiotic current ideology (parodies of pop culture, bad humor, political correctness up the ass), that it turns bland and one forgets it the next day. Who is going to remember this 20 years from now? No one. As far as all new movies go I am taking on a strictly Holden Caufield attitude. They are crummy. They suck. I hate it.

I actually saw a few wince at some of the scary parts and sat motionless at the funny/nice parts. It just doesn't capture it. I can't put my finger on it - but I left the theater wondering what that was about. They spend a lot of time showing how awful the other children are and no time spelling out the lesson - just disposing of the character. Wondering really if any of them learned their lesson. Depp as Wonka was hard to swallow - he was just plain creepy and reminded me of what Jacko would be like in Neverland. Eep. I always respected the IMDb community, but you guys are too easy on this film. Must be the lack of good movies out there and we are showing our desperation. I'd pass on this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Am I the only person who knows what Willie Wonka is supposed to be like?,"This version of Roald Dahl's brilliant book begins beautifully. It does a wonderful job of creating a sense of wonder and excitement about the chocolate factory and Charlie and his family are quite appealing. And like all Tim Burton films, there is a great visual sensibility.Then Willy Wonka shows up.There have been two film adaptations of the book, and both have radically altered the character of Willy Wonka, who in the books is an affable elderly man. In the first movie, Gene Wilder played Wonka as sinister and hostile, while Johnny Depp plays him like a children's show host who has lost his mind (or, as many people have pointed out, as Michael Jackson).Both of these portrayals were completely off the mark. Dahl underplays Wonka, and that makes him very funny. He simply acts like nothing particularly odd is happening and genially goes on with things as a series of disasters strike. But for some reasons, film makers want a more malevolent take on the guy.Burton compounds this by making the movie more about Wonka than about Charlie. He gives Wonka a tortured past and drags out the story's ending, giving it a fairly absurd last minute and also making Charlie the only character who is not tempted by anything during this tour, which I'm sure Dahl would have considered an unacceptable change.Still, the movie is really good looking, the acting is generally good (even Depp, I suspect, if you aren't familiar with the book), there's a lot of clever stuff in there and the original Oompa Loompa lyrics are used, and are musically quite good. The movie moves fast and it's generally entertaining. It just happens to be a movie made by someone who has decided to replace Dahl's sensibility with his own, and while Burton has made a few great movies among a bunch of overrated ones, he is not in the same class as Dahl.Dahl's book is so descriptive and straightforward that really, all a director needs to do is take what's there and make that movie. I hope someday someone who really understands the source material takes a shot at this.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a successful remake!,"One of the better films to come out of the remake factory, Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's beloved book is an unqualified success.Setting aside memories of the 1970s Gene Wilder Willy Wonka, here we have Johnny Depp with ghostly pallor, squeaky giggle - altogether a more creepy and weird prospect (and very like Michael Jackson, whether this was intentional or not).Charlie Bucket - cute little Freddie Highmore - is so obsessed with Willy Wonka and his factory that he has built a replica in his house. he only gets one choccie bar a year but hopes to find the elusive Golden Ticket which will get him into the factory. The first four tickets are snapped up by stereotypical kiddie horrors - Angustus Gloop, who just eats and eats; Veruca Salt, a spoilt brat from Buckinghamshire; Violet Beauregarde, gum chewing, kick-boxing American champion; and Mike Teavee, obsessed with the flickering box in the corner of the room and his noisy Playstation.Of course Charlie gets his ticket, too (it wouldn't be Charlie and the Chocolate Factory if he didn't) and off we go into an inventive trip around a magical, crazy place populated by numerous identical Oompa Loompas (lots of computer generated Deep Roys singing and dancing in formation). The fun as ever is seeing how the horrid kids get their just desserts during the trip.Illustrious casting (James Fox, Helena Bonham-Carter, David Kelly, Liz Smith, Christopher Lee) and fabulous special effects (the Great Glass Elevator; the river of chocolate; the trained squirrels; the Oompa Loompas), together with Dahl's dark humour, make this a confection to be savoured.May be a little scary for the smaller child, but this is a surprisingly good film. Wonka's character is a little more developed than in the earlier film, and although the ending has been tweaked in true American saccharine fashion, it works. It has the feel of a Christmas release rather than a summer blockbuster, but there's nothing wrong with that.I especially loved the Oompa Loompas' different musical styles for the songs, from disco to heavy metal - inspired!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Burton film,"Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is, like all of Burton's films, so visually delightful that the plot almost doesn't matter. This can make and break a film; sometimes Burton can undermine the importance of his story with the quirkiness of how it looks, like with ""Edward Scissorhands"". But his best films (""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Big Fish"") marry the visuals and the plot, so that the two work together to create an even flow for the movie.I'd say ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" almost succeeds at that, but there are times when it feels like we're looking at post cards from the infamous factory. The film, like the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", is about a poor boy (Freddie Highmore) who wins a contest and travels with four other kids into the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, run by the even-more-mysterious Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). From there on in, it's an adventure through the many bizarre - and sometimes surreal - departments of the factory.In the original, Willy Wonka was played by Gene Wilder in a mostly straight performance that channeled the witty, cane-twirling comedians of the thirties. Here Depp does carry a cane, but he does no twirling, and the performance is far from straight. His Willy Wonka is a mix of Michael Jackson and a Barbie doll, and grows more unnecessarily confusing as the movie goes on. It's not exactly a bad performance, but it does feel like Depp's parading his versatility. I think he should have toned it down a little, and gone for the innocence of his Sam character from ""Benny & Joon"".The movie is not a misfire, as it has many good aspects. Freddie Highmore is excellent as Charlie, he is believably earnest. In fact, all of the child actors are pretty good. Most of the adult ones seem a little understated, impressive that they let the children take the foreground. David Kelly shines as Charlie's Grandpa Joe, giving probably the best and funniest performance in the movie - why hasn't this guy been a star for the past few decades? The Oompa Loompas are all played by Deep Roy, who manages to be creepier than those in the seventies version, who were orange with green hair. When you think about it, Roy's performance is tremendously complicated, as he had to move in synchronization with himself thousands of times.Occasionally the movie gets lost in itself, raising questions that are never answered. Near the beginning Grandpa Joe tells an anecdote about Wonka's building a chocolate castle for an Indian prince. I was interested in seeing how this fitted into the story later on, but that's just it: it didn't. It seems to be just a comment on the film's own special effects. What Burton needs to learn is that it's mostly dangerous to remind his viewer's that they're watching a movie.The plot is also a little too similar to the first's, it never really throws any new curves at us, we know exactly what to expect (though, curiously, the magical floating bubbles scene from the original is missing).In short, it relies a little too much on Depp's performance and the set design - it seems Charlie and Grandpa Joe are almost forgotten when they enter the factory. But it's not boring, if predictable, and it's interesting to look at, and Depp's performance is intriguing, if not fitting.Come on, it's a Burton film.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Cool, Strange, & Fun","You want a weird movie? This is the one to see! I enjoyed this movie immensely because of Johnny Depp's strange portrayal of Willy Wonka, which is frightening, funny, and overall just cool. Unfortunately, and this may just be my hang up, whenever I see little Freddy Highmore (who play Charlie) I'm haunted by his portrayal of a sad little orphan in Finding Neverland. I tried to get over it and I think he is a great kid actor, but it added a tinge of sadness to the film for me. This shouldn't both most viewers though. I enjoyed all the cool new plot lines that vary from the original film including the Oompa Loompa history, Wonka's hang ups with his father, and Charlie's sweet parents. It's a great kids film, very colorful, and I can appreciate this film just as much as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory of long ago from my early childhood. See it!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Trades in joy in favor of awe,"As one would expect, this modern take on Roald Dahl's story benefits greatly from advances in special effects; the look of both the bleak town and the factory interior are spectacular. I feel a bit of ""awe fatigue"" at this point, though, since $200 million films routinely strive for surprising visuals (often to the detriment of more down-to-earth qualities) and there's only so many things we can be truly surprised by.The most glaring shortcoming of this ""Chocolate Factory"" is the bizarre, off-putting performance of Johnny Depp. He is as badly miscast as Gene Wilder was in the earlier film (Willy Wonka was both very old and a dwarf), but Wilder was very likable. Depp is just strange.This one isn't a musical, so I can't really criticize it for not having songs, but I will say this: it could use some songs (besides the Oompa-Loompa musical lectures). The ""reimagined"" children are disappointing (gum-chewing and TV-watching aren't interesting enough flaws anymore so now we get hyper-competitiveness and technological precocity in their place). Veruca Salt is still a spoiled rich girl, but now she's self-aware enough to be two-faced, instead of throwing tantrums. It all makes for a long, slow tour through the factory.The Oompa-Loompas are better in some ways and not in others--their look and songs are different, but they're too ""modern"" and seem out of place. They also pull the punches--we're told before he's even gone that no harm will come to Augustus Gloop, despite his clearly deserving it. It's better that we're not sure (like in the 1970 version).All in all, this Tim Burton Vision of Dahl's story is a big, fat disappointment. The best parts of the story (like when Charlie believes the 5th ticket has been found, then gets the double surprise of the revelation of the forgery and getting his own ticket) are almost entirely skipped here. It's as if Burton doesn't want us to enjoy the story. If so, he got his way (at least with me).",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Disgraceful,"I saw this movie when it came out and I was disgusted. I usually like to watch a movie a second and third time to get a better perspective and I usually end up with better outlook that second or third time. Not this movie, every time I watched it I felt more offended and disgusted than the last. This takes all the magic and the charm out of Willy Wonka that you almost feel like puking. How could they have gone from the original to this, ooh wait, I forgot its easy. The rap/hip hop was the first mistake. Why take the great songs and turn them into the lowest form of ""music"" there is in the world. It would have sounded better if a bunch of cats were dying to the beat of the music. Secondly, the actors, besides Johnny Depp, were all flat. They were 2-dimensional and boring. Nothing shone from anyone besides Depp, who wasn't too great either if I may add. Yet it wasn't Depp's fault and I know this, the rest of the cast made him look like a mediocre actor, which he is definitely not. This movie would have done much better if it was cast into a fire before release, that way nobody who saw the original would have to suffer through this pile of feces.

Family,"The main idea at the end was really perfect. Family is the best thing in the life. The messages which was trying to give were also good. Forexample the spoilt girl whose father gives everything she wants was really in bad condition at the end, or the mumbler boy. To be good person, good family is needed. Although it is a children movie, I could find some clues about life:). Also I liked when Willy Walker had hair cut he saw one silver hair and he felt that he is old. But I feel that something was missing when I was watching the movie and I always guessed what would happen in the next scenes also I did not like the flashbacks of finding new tastes and the dentist father.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Feast of Eye Candy,"It's a fact that Roald Dahl did not like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" the first adaptation of one of his most famous works. Years later, Tim Burton has directed ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" hoping to adhere more faithfully to Dahl's book. With Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, the movie finds a darker tone. Depp's performance is a wonderful combination of a friendly man-child and a creepy character with dark secrets. The imagery is amazing, as Burton has done for many of his movies. Much has been made of such details as the waterfall of chocolate, and the specially-trained squirrels. While trying to be faithful to the original story, Burton adds a fascinating look at Wonka's background. What made him become a chocolatier? He was rebelling against his father, a dentist on an anti-candy campaign. This elements adds another strange facet to Depp's performance. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" has proved itself a tasty entry in Tim Burton's canon.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A decent film, entirely dominated by Depp","When I was growing up, I didn't much care for children's stories (I know....stunted childhood...sound of tiny violins playing etc.) and so missed out on any number of classic tales. As an adult, of course, I preferred more mature stories. And so most traditional kids stories are pretty much new territory for me. In some ways this is good - I come to these film versions without any preconceptions - and in other ways bad - I have no idea if the film captures the spirit of the book. All I can do is judge them on how well they entertain me as they are.This version of CATCF is a remake of the Wilder version. I haven't seen this ""original"" either, so I can't even compare it to that.All I can say is this:1. It's pretty entertaining.2. The sets are exceptional.3. Johnny Depp absolutely steals every scene he's in.4. It's all good fun! There's not really anything here that you need worry about letting your little 'uns see. It's all harmless entertainment of a sort that you don't see much of anymore.As I mentioned, I haven't read the book so I can't comment on how faithful a version it is. But I'm guessing it's not that far off the original.Anyway, worth a watch for Depp's scene-stealing, if nothing else.PS: Is there no ""weird"" movie he won't do?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Johnny gets wild; Kids version,"Started to see at the opposite direction of years, which the movie where released in. First we've seen ""Wonka"", then moved to see this one and at the end of the process we shell inspect whether the original movie from 1971 [""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory""] still holds after so many years.The kids loved it, Johnny Depp is funny and the flow of the movie is great. Can't compare this to a single thing because I haven't seen the original movie (yet) and have never read the book. But now, thorough the kids, I just might even get to those two.Tim Burton's style is noticeable on each and every step of the way. Though it is classified as a 7+ movie, I have been pretty tensed through the whole runtime, to see that none of Burton's old tricks will pop of in the middle of the movie, or that my young kids will notice some grown ups jokes that are supposed to fly on top of their innocent heads.Johnny Depp is good, even great, but it is not his greatest show ever. However; it is truly one of his most memorable roles from the last two decades and it means he won at the time test. Helena Bonham Carter is being used as a decorate here, Noah Tylor is also unnoticeable and only Christopher Lee's short performance sticks, because he is so good.All and all its a good movie, which was adapted to the beginning of the 00's and seems that now, the terms and conditions of technology gives extra advantages to creations as ""Wonka"". Maybe in 20 years we will witness another upgrade that will do its best to make Charlie and Willy more accessible to our grandchildren.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

i loved the original too much.,"Charlie and the chocolate factory. I have been in love with the original film since I was small boy and must have watched it over fifty times. (My sister and I can really annoyingly quote huge pieces of dialogue and frequently do when drunk!) So it is with slight apprehension I go to see Tim Burton's remake/interpretation of the Roald Dahl classic (lets not forget what he did to planet of the apes!). Firstly I have to say there were things I loved about his version and things I preferred from the 70's one. It's so hard not to compare the two. Burtons film starts off very flat, when introducing us to the bucket family we are supposed to feel so sorry for but it lacks emotional depth, in fact all the kids do, I couldn't really care less about any off them. The 70's ones were much more bitchy and spoilt and that's what made you almost root for their demise. Now don't get me wrong here this film is a sight to behold gone is the campness of the orange faced ummpa lumpas and instead comes the uniformity of using one actor to play all of them to startling effect. From the moment they arrive on screen to perform the first song they have you in fits of laughter as Willy Wonka says 'they like to be mischievous'. Obviously Johnny Depp turns in another amazing performance as Willy complete with mannerism usually associated with Michael Jackson's childlike freakishness. All false smiles and twinkling eyes and a nervous disposition stemming mainly from his dislike of children and families. The songs here are funny and come in styles ranging from pop, rock and disco, with the ummpas pulling off dance routines that the village people would have died for. With most of the script and jokes aimed firmly at kids you have to regress slightly to get full enjoyment out of the weirdness of the factory as Willy leads you around from room to room visiting the places where his imagination becomes reality. There is nothing bad about this film apart from the fact they didn't ask gene wilder (the original Wonka) to play Willy's dad, and a few brilliant lines from the original were sadly missing. The 70's version was a lot darker and gene wilder's Willy always came over a little schizophrenic where as Depp's seems slightly playful and just not all there. Sadly for me being a fan of the first I missed Roy Kinear, fizzy lifting drinks and lickable wallpaper. But the new version brings back the squirrels and is magical to watch. Like a fruit and nut bar laced with drugs this film will leave you wide eyed.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enjoyable but will probably disappoint huge fans of the 1971 film,"Touted by many advocates as being closer to the original Roald Dahl book than the 1971 film, director Tim Burton's version both restores some elements of the book and adds just as many changes as the Mel Stuart-directed film. Even if authenticity to the source is of prime importance to you, this version is worth seeing, especially for fans of Burton and star Johnny Depp.Burton sacrifices some of the mystery of the 1971 version in favor of trying to more ""realistically"" ground his odd characters, at least psychologically, as he often does--for example, in Batman (1989). Other characteristic Burton touches are present--grandiose yet lachrymose sets (an asset), regular references to other films (usually a detraction here), and the music of Danny Elfman (enjoyable, but the songs are not as sublime and memorable as Anthony Newley's 1971 music).Burton and Depp wisely avoid paralleling Gene Wilder's most famous scenes as Willy Wonka, and Depp takes the character in a very different direction, though equally quirky (and different from the book). Here, Wonka seems to be a bit less god-like and a bit more in a psychological world of his own, but it works in its own way. Still, huge fans of the original film (and I'm one of them--it's easily in my top five of all time) might have difficulty not making comparisons, and Burton's version will suffer in their minds because of this.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
See this film!!,"With all the expectations surrounding this film and the shadow of the earlier version, I wasn't sure what to expect from Burton....but I have to say this is one of the most entertaining films i have seen in a long time. Although it's a kids story, and I was expecting a kid's film, it's impossible not to get lost in the magic of the whole thing. The story, of course, is fantastic to start with thanks to Dahl, but the big screen version manages to absorb you completely and brings it to life brilliantly. It's beautiful to look at and somehow, completely believable! Jonny Depp is amazing and definitely manages to steer away from merely recreating the Willy Wonka from the last film - fantastic and disturbing all at the same time. The whole cast works brilliantly together and Charlie Bucket is definitely one to be watched for the future.This version sticks to the book a lot more, so is quite different to the older film and also offers a lot of laughs for kids and parents alike. The sets are beautiful and the whole thing looks like a bag of candy from start to finish! As with most Burton films of course, there is a dark side to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that makes the film really interesting and leads it to be a lot more than just a kids film.As you can probably tell i really enjoyed this film lol :P and it's one DVD i'll definitely be buying on it's release.

A fun summer movie with enough humor to keep viewers of all ages entertained.,"It probably bears mentioning at the onset that this latest creation by director Tim Burton (of Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas fame) is not a remake of the 1971 movie, but rather a fresh reinterpretation of children's author Roald Dahl's original book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.I've only seen parts of the older movie years ago, but from what I've heard, Burton's take is somewhat darker and more bizarre. If so, it's not necessarily a bad thing; after all, Dahl was known for writing about nasty things happening to children in all his stories. That said, I enjoyed Burton's style of visual design, which made for plentiful eye-candy (no pun intended maybe) from start to finish.The movie started off strongly with a fantastic score by Danny Elfman to accompany its title sequence. In fact, I wish we could have heard more of that one particular part of the score throughout - an energizing composition of broad orchestral instrumentation coupled with mechanical effects that so perfectly encapsulated the mystery, mayhem, and mischief of the factory.In contrast, I wasn't terribly fond of the Oompa-Loompas' musical numbers or their costume design. Give us quirky characters dressed in their native garb from the book, please, not clones in skin-tight plastic suits!Actors Johnny Depp and Freddy Highmore, who were last seen in Finding Neverland, team up once more to form a believable rapport on screen. Depp, true to his character acting form, is reported to have modeled his interpretation of Willy Wonka after part mad-genius inventor Howard Hughes and part shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. Highmore performed admirably, with some of his best moments in the beginning portion of the movie.For some reason, they decided to shift the lead character focus from Highmore to Depp halfway through, loading poor Mr. Wonka with some unexpected emotional baggage. I can't decide whether I liked the change they made to the ending or not. Still, at least the movie was amusingly self-deprecating about it: ""Sorry, I was having a flashback."" / ""Does that happen often?"" / ""Increasingly so, today.""While I sat for close to two hours with a grin on my face, I couldn't help but feel that something was missing or empty about it all. In part, it was because a linear storyline made the watching experience an exercise of counting up to five and then back down to one, but Burton and company are not to blame for it, as they stayed very true to Dahl's original tale. Moreso, any deviations they did make were for the purpose of attempting to add more depth to the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Great ""ORIGINAL""! Not remake!","This should be considered the ""ORIGINAL"" version of the book. Although the 1971 version was very entertaining, it was lacking the ""flavor"" of one of Roald Dahl's best works.

The wonderfully strange Johnny Depp portrayed Wonka much like the book had described him. Don't be ""stuck"" on the Gene Wilder Version as it did not do justice to the story. Mostly Hollywood Hype & glitz & glamour was the selling point for the old version of this film. When you do decide to see this film, scrap all the ideas of it being like the 1971 version.

I hated it.,"To begin with, I realize that this version is closer to the novel, I also realize that the filmwork and casting was overall pretty good, but I still hated it, and here's why: This is not a happy movie, this is not ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", and Johnny Depp is not Gene Wilder, and you realize these points from the beginning. One thing that really, really bothered me about this picture were the oompa loompas. Now I understand that Burton made it a point to avoid the staple, cookie cutter oompa loopma design, but these newer ones lack whimsy, and resemble shrunken ethnic men. None of the original music is here, which goes without saying because the obvious point of the movie is to prove that Burton can remake a movie without resorting to the old stuff from the original. However, the newer stuff looks like crap in contrast to the stuff that we were introduced to thirty years ago. I found this movie extremely depressing overall, and everything that I really liked in the original is really different in this version.On the other hand, I have thought for years that Johnny Depp hasn't made a good movie since ""Edward Scissorhands"", and although I really disliked this flick, his performance was pretty good.

It teaches them about loving ones family and following ones dreams. And it does so in a lovingly sneaky way. The filming of this was done so well, it felt like a psychedelic Disney ride, annoying puppet songs and all.Johny Depp did an amazing job as always.

My problems with this boring movie,"First off, I am fully aware that this is in no way a remake of the '71 version with Gene Wilder, and I know that this version is more true to the book, so don't bug me about the comparisons I am about to make. My only problem with this movie is that they could have at least made it remotely enjoyable. First off, this movie tried waaaaaay too hard to be funny, with little success. Of course in my theatre I heard all the stupid kids laughing(yes I know, it's a kid's movie, but I don't care) and some adults. I didn't laugh once, I snickered a few times though, but I don't watch movies to snicker. The jokes were lame and the movie lagged like no other, I was so happy when it was over. The oompa loompas were EXTREMELY annoying, but their songs were good, not the actual music but the lyrics so props to that. The '71 version at least made me laugh and it was entertaining, unlike this one which I can't say enough! The one part I remember from the early one was the moment when Charlie opened the wrapper of the golden ticket-he did it ever so slowly and when he finally saw the gold it made it such a great scene. Every single time I see that part it makes me so happy that the poor kid actually found it. In this version, he opened it so fast and so blah that I just sat there with a grim look on my face just thinking what a boring scene i just witnessed. That pretty much summed up how the whole movie was for me, very bland and not funny at all.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Well done, but not that original","I had the idea of watching first the original movie and then this one. The script is almost identical, except for the last few minutes. The effects are a lot better, of course, but the movie did not remove the things that annoyed me in the first 1971 movie, nor did it make me feel more than the original.Wilder was creepy in the role of Willie Wonka, but Depp, even if he played marvelously, was only a bit weird, in the harmless way. Both the original movie and this one portraits parents that are rather passive to what happens to their children. I hated the songs in both versions. The good things are related to the quality of the visuals, of course. The end (different in the sense that the concept of family is held high like a banner in the forefront of the battle for our children souls. What, did I overdramatise? So did this movie) did nothing for me.Now, that I read my own review, I realize that I liked the original better. It felt out of time and kinda low budget, but it was better in the emotional sense and the storyline.It is essentially a children's story. Maybe I am not the one qualified to comment on it, then.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""But that, my dear children, is called cannibalism which is in fact frowned upon in most societies. "" -  Willy Wonka","There's been a lot of buzz about the updated version of Roald Dahl's beloved novel 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. Most critics have been raving about it, saying director Tim Burton (Edward Swissorhands, Ed Wood, Big Fish) and actor Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean, Cry Baby, Finding Neverland) make a wondrous team. Going in to see it I was extremely skeptical and I was kind of expecting not to enjoy the film. First of all, whenever Burton makes a film it's off the freakin' wall, and judging the previews of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' I figured it would be strange to the point of just being annoying. The movie trailer made it look creepy and weird just for the sake of being out there, and I had a hard time believing Burton would want to remake such a classic film like 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. Another reason I had a hard time warming up to this film pre-screening was my feeling that Johnny Depp couldn't compare to the brilliance and style Gene Wilder put into Willy Wonka. Well, when I finally saw 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' I have to admit I loved it. It's an incredibly imaginative, carefully crafted and beautifully designed motion picture that's a pleasure to watch throughout.The 2005 version of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' follows the book more closely than the 1971 version with Gene Wilder. First of all, the updated Burton version isn't a musical (except for the musical numbers performed by the hilarious Oompa-Loompas.) It follows the poor, kind-hearted Charlie (Freddie Highmore - Finding Neverland) whose perfect in every way. He lives with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor) and his grandparents in a little rundown house. Every year for his birthday, Charlie gets a Wonka chocolate bar, and when the inventor of the chocolate Wonka himself (played expertly by Johnny Depp) decides to put five golden tickets in five of his candy bars all over the world, Charlie has to have one. After not getting it the first time or second time, Charlie finally gets a Wonka bar with one of the five coveted golden tickets with the help of his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly). With the golden ticket, Charlie gets an exclusive tour of Willy Wonka's factory along with four other golden ticket winners -- Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb), a goal obsessed sports fanatic; Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), a spoiled rich girl who gets everything she wants; Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry), an aggressive and nasty video game fanatic whose also a genius; and Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) a morbidly obese greedy German boy whose obsessed with chocolate and in great need of the Atkins diet. Wonka despises all of these kids except for Charlie who will eventually cause Wonka to open his heart and re-introduce him to the concepts of love and family. The film also stars Deep Roy, a little Indian guy who plays all the Oompa Loompas, Missi Pyle, James Foxx, Adam Godrey, Franziska Troegner and Christopher Lee who plays Wonka's evil dentist father who's totally anti-candy.'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is great family fun as well as plenty of laughs and things to enjoy for the more mature crowd. Johnny Depp is fantastic as Wonka because he brings so much energy, style and sheer originality to the character. I refuse to speculate who makes a better Wonka, Depp or Wilder, because they both play him so differently. Freddie Highmore is perfectly cast as the sweet Charlie but he of course gets constantly out-shined by Depp's electrifying Wonka. David Kelly is great as Grandpa Joe, Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor are good for the precious few screen time they have, the four kids are very good, but Deep Roy steals the show in my opinion with the funniest part -- the Oompa Loompas. Deep Roy's musical numbers throughout the film are definitely the highlight of the movie. Christopher Lee does a fine job with his small role as Depp's father, while Tim Burton gives his best direction since Edward Swissorhands. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' posses Oscar worthy set, makeup, costumes and visual effects, while the script is very solid. I'd say one of the only things that bothered me about this besides it being extremely weird, is the hidden sexual references throughout. I felt it was very unnecessary and instead of laughing at them, I kind of rolled my eyes in disappointment. Everything else in the film however is brilliant.I highly recommend seeing 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' in the theater if you are a fan of the novel, original film or just love extravagant and bizarre motion pictures. People expecting something very mainstream I think might be let down with Burton's take on the classic children's book, but I actually applauded the fact the film possessed bizarre qualities. For the best viewing experience, I recommend seeing it in IMAX in select AMC theaters. Grade: B+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30 (the IMAX experience), Phoenix, Arizona, 7/21/05)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just Awful,"Clearly the studio shills/plants are out in force for this dud. Word of mouth should be just dreadful.Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka is downright creepy. He vacillates from kid-hating to having an almost pedophiliac attraction to them. And that's when the sensation jells. His outrageous wardrobe, his sallow, flawless skin, his pageboy haircut make him look eerily like the eerie Michael Jackson. That image and thought certainly yanked me out of the moment every time he appeared (which didn't begin until the film was one-third over).The film adds another subchapter to the book's ending, but otherwise follows the original storyline, with poorer-than-dirt Charlie finally finding one of five golden invitations to visit the Wonka chocolate factory.Settings inside the plant reviews, this movie is just awful.Unlike ""Willy Wonka,"" Burton's film isn't a musical. But it has several musical production numbers in it, all featuring the omnipresent Oompa-Loompas. Shifting gears from the uneasy comedy to the song-and-dance segments is one of the great transitory troubles here. Stay Away.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Movie Philosophy,"The philosophy of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" revolves around the idea of morality, consequences, and the value of virtue. It explores themes such as the dangers of excess, the importance of family, the rewards of honesty and humility, and the power of imagination. The characters' experiences in the chocolate factory serve as allegories for broader life lessons, emphasizing the virtues of kindness, integrity, and gratitude. Ultimately, the film suggests that true happiness and fulfillment come from leading a virtuous and balanced life.Also delves into the concept of childhood innocence and wonder. It celebrates the imagination and curiosity of children while cautioning against the corrupting influence of greed and selfishness. Additionally, the film underscores the idea that success is not solely defined by material wealth but also by inner goodness and fulfillment. Through the journey of Charlie Bucket, the film encourages viewers to cherish the simple joys of life, appreciate the magic of the world around them, and embrace empathy and compassion towards others.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Charlie and the chocolate factory is a disturbing film about a psychologically damaged candy maker,"As a person that appreciates the art of film, I find this monstrosity to be absolutely insulting, I know that I'm on a minority here but while we're on the subject I'd like to point out that the original was FAR from perfect, in fact I rated that a 5/10. The only thing that kept me watching that one was an eccentric performance by Gene Wilder. And the willy works in this one delivered a simply DREADFUL performance.Let's talk about the characters.
So the main character ""Charlie bucket"" is so bland and doesn't have a personality, in fact he is so bland they could have made him an actor on twilight. Willy works is a difficult character to sympathize with, due to his belief that bad children deserve to be physically punished. Another thing that makes Charlie so unremarkable is that he didn't even WANT a golden ticket, and he doesn't seem to care that ""oh a child just got turned into a blueberry, why should I care?"" Or ""oh, a child just got shrunk and is about to have his body stretched out, no way that will effect his life.""For the plot, I would like to start out by talking about how needlessly long it was for the children to actually get to the chocolate factory, and when they finally do the plot gets worse and worse. Everyone's main complaint about this film is that there is a needless backstory for willy wonka, but that is far from the worst part of it. The plot simply consists of the first 30 minutes being as dull as hell, as the children find golden tickets, then when they finally get into the factory the only plot that happens is that they go from room to room, making each child more horribly deformed than the last.This should without a doubt, be in the 100 lowest rated movies on IMDB",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"This is a huge step down from the original but still a very entertaining, worthwhile picture that I recommend seeing once","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the classic tale of a chocolate factory that still operates but has been closed from society for a long time. A notice is sent out around the world that five lucky children will be selected to enter the factory and win a prize. Their notification will be determined by their ability to find a golden ticket within a candy bar. As the candy bars are sent from the factory the hijinks ensue.This movie is directed by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands) and stars Johnny Depp (Nightmare on Elm Street), Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland), Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd), Noah Taylor (Vanilla Sky), David Kelly (Mean Machine) and Deep Roy (Star Trek).Making a remake of the original is so hard and watching this you have to try and give it its own lens. Depp was nowhere near as good as Wilder as Wonka and there were some very awkward, unnatural moments in this. I loved Lee's opening monologue, but I'm not sure we needed the entire subplot of Wonka's daddy issues.I will say the special effects were awesome, as were the settings, circumstances and universe. The ultimate resolve was good too. I even liked the back story on the Oompa Loompas, I just wish they used more than one guy and a bunch of CGI to create them.Overall this is a huge step down from the original but still a very entertaining, worthwhile picture that I recommend seeing once. I would score this a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Better be good with chocolate in the title,"I loved this film from beginning to end. It was better than the original in almost every way. I love the new Oompa Loompas and Johnny Depp is terrific. Nothing against Gene Wilder but I always thought his Willy Wonka portrayal was cold and creepy. Johnny Depp plays the character so much more sympathetically. Plus, it was an improvement to get the background on his character.The one thing I did miss from the older version is the Oompa Loompas song. The new versions of the songs are definitely rockin'. But I couldn't understand what was being said half the time. especially with the TV kid.This movie was better than I expected. Great job.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""Let's Boogie!""","I was talking to my mother the other day, telling her how I loved to see Johnny Depp on film. I was thinking about the excitement I get when I'm going to see one of his pictures. Anyway, besides Depp's presence there were plenty of elements that made this an expecting ride for me. Roal Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is still (or I like to think so) my favorite book. I often remember some parts and I haven't read t many times but the first time I did I couldn't believe my eyes. Charlie Bucket; that extremely lovable character, and even more lovable in the skin of the talented Freddie Highmore.I could neither believe my eyes once Depp's Willy Wonka opened that little (well, not that little) door and I was driven to that fantastic production design, colors and environment that I'm getting convinced I'll only see again in a Tim Burton film (even in an old one). With Alex McDowell at the top of the production design team, Burton made sure everything look beautiful, and it did. With ""Big Fish"" a couple of years ago, I was amazed, but it was actually long ago, probably in 1990, when I discovered he was a genius. In ""Edward Scissorhands"", in that unique world...Which takes me to Johnny Depp, another genius. Maybe that's the main reason why he and Burton work so well together: all the things they have in common. A friend of my brother and a friend of mine told me some weeks ago that Johnny Depp was gay. Gay because he chose to play gay characters and so. ""The pirate, the writer, that investigator was also a little gay..."" I would prefer the word eccentric, or better, another word comparable to Tim Burton; unique. He's been, since ever, choosing characters the rest of the actors wouldn't even dare to get near of.This and many others are Depp's qualities. When he and Burton get together, we're grateful of watching unique (yes, again) film-making. This is not, however, his best collaboration yet, which in my humble opinion continues to be ""Sleepy Hollow"". It doesn't make a difference anyway, because it is a different movie, with different characters, with an inside sad story about heart and family and a very good piece in the end. It's also a very good performance by Depp. ""The magician"", as I call him, stands out as another completely different being in a memorable composed portrayal of the ever known Willy Wonka. He worked his ideas over the original book before the screenplay was finished; he is that committed. Memorable portrayal, however polemic (for reasons I won't detail); and that could be a disadvantage for the recognition.I say ever known Willy Wonka because it is ever known by me. I got somehow moved when I saw the glass elevator going up, or the Ompa Loompas working inside the factory; but it will be just as fun for anyone who hasn't read Roal Dahl's beautiful book, because John August (who also wrote Burton's ""Big Fish"") created a screenplay that brings the fable alive, with perfect narrated moments and words each person will understand. This is what I call a movie for the whole family. Don't even mention Danny Elfman's score, with the beautiful songs (he also sang them!...with machines and effects of course).And last but not least, two, if not three supporting performances for the times. David Kelly, splendid as Grandpa Joe; Deep Roy, perfect as the funny and adorable Ompa Loompa(s) and if I may say, a deep and moving Christopher Lee as Willy's father, Dr. Wilbur Wonka. In the film's most moving scene, they both meet again, and you wouldn't imagine how the father admires the son, when we are made to believe he wouldn't.The screen went black and people started cheering, clapping their hands. I hadn't witnessed that since ""Titanic"" in 1997, because there are times when I feel like clapping, but nobody else does, so I have to stay quiet.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Review for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"This was a film that I avoided originally. The earlier version with Gene Wilder was one that my sister and I would watch regularly. It is still a favorite. Now my wife, Jaime, has seen this a lot. We watched it together as part of our podcast, JwaC Presents Depp Dive: A Depper Look at Johnny's Feature Filmography. I'll admit, I was intrigued and wanted to give this a fair chance, since I am a Tim Burton fan as well as seeing this featured Christopher Lee.Now something I need to say here is that this isn't a remake, but a re-imagining of the source material. I know the book was read to me when I was in 4th grade, but outside of the ending, I don't remember much. Jaime did have the audio book read to her and said that this is closer to the source with different things. This one is more high-tech and a bit less surreal. That's not to say that Burton doesn't put his touch on it. It does good things with the different rooms and how the 'naughty' children are punished.There is a commentary here that I've never picked up, but this is a variation on the seven deadly sins. Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) is pride, Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) is greed, Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) in this version is wraith, Augustus Glupsch (Philip Wiegratz) is gluttony and I guess you could say that Charlie's (Freddie Highmore) grandparents are sloth. We are still missing envy and lust.I will say that Depp as Willy Wonka is better than I expected. He plays it quirky, which I figured. There is an odd element of him being callous when bad things happen to the children who don't listen. That mimics Gene Wilder's take. Depp just plays it more eerie with how happy he looks when Wilder is more tired.Something else that I wanted to bring up is that I personally do not believe there are bad children. I think there are bad behaviors that aren't corrected so the parents are partially to blame for why the children act as they do. This is missing Charlie messing up and I think we do need that. He almost seems too perfect where we don't get a redemption. Having that piece would make this work better.I'll then end out by saying again that this is well-made. Burton does a great job capturing how magical this factory is. That is something I appreciated. What they do with the glass elevator is also good. My biggest gripe here though is with the songs and the Oompa Loompas. This isn't a critique of Deep Roy. I love that he got paid more and his performances as the different versions are wonderful. The songs aren't as good, but I love that Danny Elfman took the lyrics and then the songs are representing different genres. That is a good touch. The effects here are solid. Not all hold up as well and that is the nature of CGI from the era. It doesn't ruin this by any stretch.I will say that despite my apprehensions, this is a fun movie. It isn't as bad as I had in my hand and rather enjoyed this overall. I would recommend it. If you are a giant fan of the original like I am, come in with an open mind. Also, think about this as a different take on the novel and not a remake.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"decent, wait for DVD release","Burton is NO genius and he's proved it again. Depp's performance was odd and stale. Unsure of a specific way to speak makes watching him very uncomfortable. Look, DeNiro would make an awful Ace Ventura and Depp makes an awful Willy Wonka. Most people saw that before the movie was released. The children's performances were roughly the same. You could replace the personalities in each child and you wouldn't know the difference. Veruca's behavior was the most disappointing. You end up hating Charlie's Grandfather more than her!! On it's own, it's not bad, if you compare it to the book it's pretty decent, if you compare it to the '71 release than it's superior in technology and movie making, but falls short in magic and overall experience.4 out of 10",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Charlie and Chocolate Factory,"We took our 6 year old son to see this movie. It is a magical tale about 5 lucky winners of a golden ticket. Charlie Bucket is one of the lucky winners. Charlie finds his ticket and struggles briefly with a decision to keep it or sell it, and is given some beautiful words of wisdom from someone he loves. At first I felt some of the images might be a bit disturbing for my son, but he loved the movie and wants to go again. Depp is superb as Willy Wonka, and reveals just enough mystery about his own past to keep you on the edge of your seat as he mesmerizes the ticket winners (and the children in the audience)with the wonders of the factory.

Ugggh...One felt that the ""demise"" of each child was treated a little bit too much as ""Ok.. that's another one down, onto the next one"".The segues between the various demises were poorly thought through and their only redeeming qualities were the various spoofs/homages to other movies (Space Odyssey 2001 reference had me laughing quite a bit... *cue music*), a bit of drug humour (""Do you often have flashbacks?"") and various other black humour references (Reference to cannibalism *chuckle*).I'm wondering why it was so rushed - you would think this second movie would have more than the first, not less.

Charlie And The Chocolate Factory,"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, is based on the book of the same name by Roald Dahl, and was also previously a film in 1971 entitled Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. The film is about Charlie Bucket, a poor boy who lives with his parents and grandparents in a rundown house. Charlie, is fascinated by the town's chocolate factory run by the mysterious Willy Wonka. Nobody has seen him for many years and nobody is ever seen coming or going from the factory and yet his chocolate and candy treats are available all over the world and are very popular. One day it is announced that Willy Wonka, is having a contest where he is putting a golden ticket into five different chocolate bars and the child who receives a golden ticket will get a tour of his factory and a special prize will be given at the end of the tour to one lucky child. Charlie hopes very much that he will get a golden ticket because it is his dream to go into the factory. One day he discovers a golden ticket and along with his grandfather Joe, go along with the five other kids also accompanied by an adult guardian. The first is Augustus Gloop, who is an overweight boy who never stops eating. The second is Violet Beauregarde, who is very competitive and always brags about herself. The third is the spoiled and bratty Veruca Salt, and the fourth is a mouthy boy obsessed with television named Mike Teavee. Willy Wonka, leads them all through his wondrous factory and along the way they discover how bizarre Willy Wonka is himself and of course something unexpected awaits the kids further along in the factory. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration, good costumes and makeup. As a child I read the book Charlie And The Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl, and I loved it. Soon after I saw the 1971 movie Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, which I also thought was great and have since seen it a couple of times and have always enjoyed seeing it again. This new version is a great looking film with great sets, art decoration, costumes and makeup and it is visually imaginative and has a lot of neat visual treats that director Tim Burton, is well known for. Besides looking great the film is well acted and despite what some people are saying about Johnny Depp's performance of Willy Wonka being too similar to Michael Jackson, I thought he did a good job. The film was also entertaining and a fun movie that both adults and kids will enjoy. I was however disappointed that a lot of things from the book were changed in this movie whereas I would have liked it to have stayed faithful to the book. I also thought the 1971 film was a lot better because it was more faithful and it was a very charming film. For a reason that will always puzzle me author Roald Dahl, did not like the 1971 film and has since passed on. I'd be curious to know what he would think of this version if he was still alive. This version is good too but I think I liked it more for it's visuals and sets then anything else and in a lot of ways it lacks the magical charm of the first film. I'am still recommending this film and I also recommend the original version and the book as well which is a great book for kids as well as any book by Roald Dahl.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Oompa-Loompa's should stage a revolution,"As a world famous writer of Children's stories, Roald Dahl is also famous for the fact he doesn't like children. For this reason a story, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is full of horrible children, who are of course tortured and punished in appropriate ways.This may be why children love it so much.This adaption of the book well and truly has the stamp of Tim Burton, same type of music, same sense of lighting and kooky characters. If you don't know the story, here it is. Willy Wonker, reclusive, genius, chocolate maker gives away tickets to 5 children to view his chocolate factory. This is a chocolate factory as it should be, an amazing land of chocolate rivers and weird machines.But such a place also has dangers for the unwary.Johnny Depp's performance make me wonder why they didn't just offer the role to Michael Jackson. That same feeling of loss of childhood and need for approval exists, along with the white skin, crazy clothes , inane smile and very high voice.Charlie of course is bland, as is the nature of the character, while the other characters live up to the book.Ultimately we get the Tim Burton movie experience, which, while I like Burton's movies, is failing to do too much on top of what he has done before.Good, interesting, worth seeing. The musical numbers of some of the best in a children's movie in a long time simply because they are so obviously meant to be bad.PS: surely the Oompa-loompas should be given control over the factory, it would only be fair.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This was the biggest surprise and enjoyable ride of a film I have ever seen.,"When I watched the previews of this film I was full of so much doubt. I thought the scenes would be freaky, even freakier than some of the scenes in the original (A GIANT LOBSTER! SWEET FANCY MOSES!), and I thought that Johnny Depp would not do well at all as the famous chocolatier. I remember hearing myself say ""I am going to stay away from that movie as much as possible. TIm Burton made it so it has a good chance of making me wet my bed at night"" well, I actually said the first half, but until this movie I believed the second half. This movie was soooooooooooo much fun. It has the perfect blend of humor, aesthetic images, and bizzareness. There was a thrill in seeing something new, exciting, peculiar, humorous....I felt like I was on an amusement park ride. I didn't want it to end. I also felt like eating candy until my navel blew out like a party favor.Johnny Depp is hilarious, and even though he as Willy Wonka was strange, he prevents the movie from exploding into particles of confusion, and creates a peculiar sense of sanity with his sarcastic comments. TIm Burton kept the movie true to the book, and made it a visual masterpiece. the special effects were absolutely incredible. It definitely contends with Narnia, Kong, and Episode III in the effects race. The Willy Wonka factory is much more believable as a pioneer in candy innovations in this film than in the original (punching gloves to pound flour? I mean, come on.) One of best parts was the oompa loompas, their songs, the fact that they weren't orange with green hair, and the fact that they were all played by one actor. Even the voices in the songs were voiced by only Danny Elfman, who is also the score writer. The songs were catchy, fun, rockin, funky, and hip. Whoa, I feel old, I just said a song was hip. anyone have any prune juice?Overall this movie was absolutely amazing. I will never judge a film based on on what creepy things its director has done in the past. I love and recommend this movie.

In the original you really felt sorry for Charlie and his family but this film didn't convey the situation very well.The acting in the film was good but it really lacked the magic that the original had. I don't understand why they decided to use one oompa loompa and make the sets look fake. If they hadn't done this the film would have been much better.

Quirky Eye Candy,"Set design, images, and CGIs to realize such imagination of Tim Burton alive on the screen. All the visual efforts bring in fairy-tale and fantasy-world ambiance. And I LOVE Danny Elfman. His music makes this movie so special and bright. It fits the movie perfectly in vibes and stories. Danny Elfman's music makes Tim Burton's movie more Tim Burton's. The weakness of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is lack of connectivity among stories.

I'm not sure the director intended this effect or not, but the result fails the audience. Wonderful to look from outside but very few left inside.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Little Nonsense Now and Then Relished By the Wisest Man,"There are two ways to take Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with respect to this review's title: a line sung by Gene Wilder's Wonka in the original, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The first is that even though the remake is largely nonsensical (not just a little bit), it is still relishable when placed in the spectrum of all of life's gravity.Indeed, Johnny Depp's impish characterization of Wonka plays very well to children--much better than to adults; though, I heard plenty of adults laughing at the pure slapstick of his walking into the invisible doors of the glass elevator....twice! While the visuals are quite remarkable, there is little to hold the movie together besides the storyline of the Dahl book, which honestly, I cannot easily separate from the original movie.Yes, the same thing could be said about the original; we go from chocolate room to inventing room to golden egg room to TV room with little alacrity. The tonality of those original settings is as disparate as the settings of the remake. The difference--and it's an appreciable one--is that the masterful quality of Gene Wilder's Wonka holds it all together. Even if we feel like we're on a jarring ride in the original, Wilder's cool and collected Wonka assures the audience that it's going to be alright: even if we cannot see how. And in the end, we all are a little wiser for it.Which brings me around to the second way of taking the subject line: the way Wilder sang about it in the original. We can relish the nonsensical parts of the original because they are juxtaposed so finely by the menacing wit of the rest of the movie. This juxtaposition simply isn't possible until the very end of the remake.Johnny Depp's characterization of Wonka isn't bad, so much as his character is written too shallowly. This is never more apparent as when he repeats a none-too-acerbic observation of Mike Teevee's mumbling. Yes, we are led to believe that Depp's Wonka is scatterbrained--as is demonstrated when he launches into a scripted welcome of his guests after the same welcome had already been extended. But this just adds to the remake's inauthenticity, because Depp's Wonka seems acutely incapable of running a chocolate factory: something I never felt about Wilder's Wonka. The redundancy of lines via the scatterbrained characterization of Wonka felt like an intentionally lazy (or impotent) turn by the remake's writers.There are more loose ends tied up in the remake than the original. We actually see the nasty Wonka kids leaving the factory in their altered states. We find out a little more about how Charlie's family actually makes the move into the factory. We learn how Wonka got into the chocolate business. And, we learn more about the Oompa Loompa's origins; though the surreal nature of the Oompa Loompa's identical appearance makes me almost wish I hadn't. *laughs* All in all, the remake is a little bit of tasty nonsense which I will only relish now and then: not persistently like the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"This movie melts in your mouth, not in your hand.","I like chocolate. I like Tim Burton movies. I like the original Roald Dahl book (and its sequel). I even liked ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" but not as much as a lot of others - though still more than Dahl did (he loathed it as much as he liked chocolate). And I like Danny Elfman. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" therefore, is a treat for fans of all of the above.Burton and screenwriter John August improve not only on their own ""Big Fish"" but also on the previous movie in a number of ways, and not only in terms of effects (with a gap of 34 years it stands to reason that Violet Beauregarde's transformation into a blueberry would beat the original, helped by Annasophia Robb's excellent turn as a superhumanly self-confident little gum-chewer). The movie's addition of a backstory for chocolatier par excellence Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp, turning into another marvellous turn for the master) - like ""Sleepy Hollow,"" he's given a less than happy young life, though at least his dentist dad Christopher Lee doesn't kill his mum with an iron maiden - can seem like an unnecessary addition which weighs the story down and serves as an excuse for a happy family ending (which is a bit strange, given that Dahl's book had one anyway), but it doesn't really harm the finished result, and in fairness you can understand the desire to give Wonka something to do. Something apart from be the unquestioned star of the movie, that is.Wonka's edge is less prominent here than in Gene ""I was the best Wonka, dammit"" Wilder's performance, but it's here all the same; and if the movie does stack the odds in favour of Charlie Bucket (and that's putting it mildly), so did the book. In any case, Freddie Highmore is so appealing as Charlie that you're rooting for him anyway, and the other child actors are fine as well for the most (oddly, the girls do better than the boys overall - I believe this is called ""Friends Stars In Movies Syndrome"").The movie is as much a treat for the eyes as the heart, with the chocolate factory seeming like the greatest theme park there ever was and some of the best effects work in a Burton movie (kudos to Cinesite and the Magic Camera Company); Elfman contributes one of his tenderest works for Burton to date, and his songs for the Oompa-Loompas (with Dahl's lyrics from the book) are all without exception highlights.At the risk of sounding like one of those film critics whose quotes have ""A+"" and exclamation marks a go-go, I can't really deliver a measured examination of this movie - just go and see it. In spite of its pro-chocolate agenda, it's better for kids than ""Madagascar"" and its ilk. And it won't make you feel sick afterwards if you're diabetic. (Believe me, I know.)",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Blood Sugar Blues,"I'm not sure if my comment contains a spoiler, but I have noted as such considering a few elements are discussed which some readers may not have been aware of, especially if they had planned on comparing this film with the original.I grew up loving the original film and read the books and was giving this movie high hopes, but it didn't work completely for me. I still gave it a 6 for the craftsmanship behind the scenes and a genuine love of the story I could feel coming from the cast and crew. It's not a total waste, and the good parts I will let you discover for yourself, but there are flaws.My main problem with the film is the pacing, and even worse, the choreography was terrible. I guess I was expecting moves like Oscar giant ""CHICAGO"", and considering Elfman did the underscore for that film, I'm totally saddened that the dance sequences weren't as tight as the music. Only one moment when the Loompettes were bouncing off of Violet's totally outrageous blueberry frame did I actually sit up and notice. But it was very brief and I was left wanting more.I also felt that the effects destroyed the pacing of scenes, like the perfection of them were holding the story hostage. Since they were paying for such wild and realistic shots I can only guess Burton was compelled to include them all without editing them down for the sake of timing.The scene where Varuca Salt get's thrown down the garbage shoot could have been compressed a wee bit more to augment the urgency of the situation, which wasn't suspenseful enough for me. No, I didn't believe a little girl was being overpowered by squirrels, despite the squirrels looked great.Johnny Depp as Wonka is just plain creepy. He's a great actor but I would have thought someone ""down to earth"" would have made a better Wonka. I guess I saw Wonka from the books as being more like the Artful Dodger from Charles Dicken's OLIVER TWIST; someone vulnerable but strong, with color in his cheeks and boundless confidence. Wilder came close in the first film, but his Wonka was more airy, and Depp's Wonka was more metallic. Willy Wonka bonds with Charlie at the end of the story, so their connection must be genuine and solid. But someone like that obviously wouldn't have fit into the added subplot of a grown up child who hates his father for not letting him eat candy in his formative years. I think this irritated me most of all. Wonka is a hero, not a cripple! The children carry the psychology of the story, Wonka is just the provider of organized chaos, only so he can find a worthy successor to his throne. Reward comes from non-attachment and selflessness. That's the story! Nothing else required.The bottom line is this is a great film to look at, the characters are classic, the morals are there, the music is catchy, the effects are superb and the finale is touching. But it didn't make me want to see it again. Like walking through a museum, it's more of a gallery of experiences than an actual ""ride"", despite the glass elevator is pretty cool.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Finally a version of Charlie & the Chocolate that is true to the book!,"I had no doubt when I heard about Tim Burton making his own version of Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, that it would be wondrous, as well as a little on the dark side. After reading the book when I was in 4th grade and being infatuated with the story, as well as the quirky way Roald Dahl tells a story, I found myself disappointed in the first movie, ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,"" with Gene Wilder. It was toned down quite a bit from the book, and having also a musical made me cringe.This new version shows not only the connection between Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket, but also shows just how strange Willy Wonka was portrayed in the book. No one else but Johnny Depp could have done such a wonderful adaptation of the character. Let's face it, he was bottled up in that factory for 15 years living with no one else but Oompa-Loompas, and that alone would make anyone a little strange. Mr. Depp showed him as wary of adults, as well as children who would not understand his genius mind. An eccentric as he was in the book made his taste for clothes very lavish, and his being cut off from the world for so long made him think that his hairstyle was ""cool!"" Yet Johnny Depp was able to also portray a caring side of Willy Wonka, wanting to find an heir to take over and take care of his precious Oompa Loompas, and continue his work. And being able to find a family he could love and be loved by.People shouldn't compare the two movies in any way. This is not a remake of the original, but a ""TRUE ORIGINAL."" The sets are wondrous, the casting superb, and the adaptation of the story even more fun! Thank you Johnny Depp, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman for a fun filled, quirky, ride with twists and turns that only a reader of the original book could enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
There is no glitter of gold under this paper wrapper!,"I have really liked other Tim Burton movies, but this was just odd, heartless & cold. I adore Johnny Depp but he is no Wonka. Here he just comes across as a creepy Michael Jackson type character with an effeminate, whispery voice, plastic looking grey skin & looking far too young to play Wonka. From the time line of the story Wonka should be aged in his mid 50's at least, as he wished to find a child to whom he can tell his secret to before he retires. Regardless of these facts, the script does not help as it comes across as odd. Even the CGI is not that good. Where is the joy & wonder on the childrens faces when they first see the chocolate room? Why are the parents oddly calm when their kids are dissapearing to face some nasty fate? What is the stuff with Wonka's dentist dad backstory? & what about the Ommpa Loompas? I have always loved the work of Deep Roy, but to have hundereds of his clones just comes across as lazy film making to me. Would CGI Ooompa Loomepas have been better? Very sorry but this movie left me with more questions than answers, however I did enjoy Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs Bucket, which was perhpas the only highlight for me. I also have no doubt that the child actors are perhaps very good, but the script they were working from was just strange. In short I did not feel as if this movie has much heart or soul. Perhaps it is good that this is not a long movie, in fact parts of the story seem to be rushed, so it does not drag on.Well some younger people may still enjoy this, but I simply could got get past the weirdness of it all. Sorry.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Amazingly AWESOME!,"Wow, it was amazing! Now I'm a HUGE fan of Johnny so I was excited to see it, but in the back of my mind, I was thinking, ""oh wow, the first one was actually almost perfect, how can you redo it & NOT flop?"" But Tim Burton was smart on that one lol...It really is different from the 1st original movie. Yes, the principle is the same, but it's not the same movie. Johnny is hilarious & really shows what an amazing actor he is. For all the people that only saw Pirates & thought he was good, you'll be amazed at his wide range of characters. To go from Jack Sparrow to Willy Wonka, well that's rather a stretch, but Johnny handles it well. He's amazing. Freddie Highmore was so cute & innocent. I think he's becoming a wonderful actor. He shows so much emotion & really gets you to believe him. All the other children were true to their character & made you hate them lol They were also amazing! The film was just wonderful & I don't think it can be compared with the original because it's different. It's stupid for everyone to be comparing the original & this one. They are two different movies & this one is NOT a remake. But it's awesome on a different scale & level. You should definitely go see it, it's wonderful & funny!

"CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY : Might Not Be Gene Wilder, But Still Lots Of Fun...","CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORYThe main thing I admired about this version of Roald Dahl's classic is that it clearly set out to find it's own visual style and overall tone when compared to the classic '72 Gene Wilder version. Tim Burton creates an ambiguously surreal world for young Charlie (Freddie Highmore), the young boy who visits Willy Wonka's famous chocolate factory. This skewed reality allows Burton to create captivating visuals in every situation, whether it is in the grand scale candy room and chocolate river... or whether it is the mere visualization of Augustus Gloop's obsessive chocolate intake.Everything in the film is stylized, and I loved that aspect. Every child has one element that is played up to a much more dramatic extreme in this one versus the original... and it works. The children are honestly the best part of the film. The performances aren't as nuanced or natural as those of the original children... but they are more distinctly defined. These children obviously all went over the top to play to their stereotypes, but they all kept it natural and fluid enough that I never lost interest. This might be the finest ensemble of child actors I have seen in a long while. I loved every one of the kids in this version more so than in the original.However, some elements Burton seemed to add to differentiate his film, though admirable, just don't managed to be as good as they once were. The oompa-loompas are nothing short of incredibly disappointing. Their songs lack the humor and straightforwardness... lyrics are barely understandable... and there is so much action going on that any element of humor in these songs is impossible to catch. Also, the demise of some of the children is made too grand. Violet turning into a blueberry used to be the simple image of a young girl waddling about, and it was hysterical... here, the computer imagery and confusion with the Oompaloompas is just a bit too much.The only other major flaw of the film is an incredibly mediocre and disappointing performance from Depp. From the previews I thought his interpretation would make me mad the entire time... it didn't. I bought into his approach and went with it, but I was never won over. Gene Wilder managed to make Willy Wonka the comedic center-point of the film... always holding the audience's attention in the palm of his hand. Depp just kind of blends into the visual spectacle that surrounds him and gets lost. Whenever the film tried to focus on his character (with that insufferable back story with his father... this part just dragged the movie to a screeching halt any time it came up) I was simply wishing for more of the children.Overall, although their were disappointing moments... on a whole the film had me completely interested. I loved the kids, and thankfully they are the focus of most of the picture. Tim Burton's visuals were beautiful and unique... and the movie constantly supplies it's audience with a fun/harmless/visual treat.WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY will for me be the classic version of the Roald Dahl book forever... however the new CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY deserves it's own viewing, and it's own fan base. It's simple minded fun with enough going on to keep any audience interested. Just don't expect the perfection of the original.... B- ...PS - The film gets bonus points for showing what happened to the kids once they left the factory. This was one of my favorite moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Durably charmless,"Although Gene Wilder's Willie in 1971 was genuinely creepy, Johnny Depp's is pretty skin-crawly itself, coming very close to a Michael Jackson impersonation in this tale of a fabulously wealthy Peter Pan entranced by his childlike dream of sweet-tooth omnipotence. At one point, one of his child-victims asks, ""Why is everything so pointless?"" Yeah.But then again, maybe it's not so pointless; maybe it's more of the tired, piddly indoctrination Hollywood loves to run on us. It has all of that community's favorite villain/stereotypes (and love/hate obsessions): Germans, blonde Southern women and avaricious WASPs. Even that ol' bugaboo - the American military - is represented by the preteen video-game abuser.Director Burton needs to retire the ""dark holiday"" motif, at least, find better music than the tinkly, minor-key monotony here. And speaking of dull, why don't the characters show at least a little wonder at rivers of chocolate and fantastical machines? To a person, they react to Wonka's wonderland as if they're shopping for shoelaces.This is for people who truly hate children, and prefer them, as W.C. Fields opined, ""properly cooked."" Not sure what the message is (unless tormenting ""mean"" kids IS it), although I kinda liked Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompa multitudes. And the cast, including the amazing Depp (who based his character, evidently, on Carol Channing) is first-rate.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Liked better the original Wonka scoop of chocolate!,"Oompa Loompa Loompa Di Du.. OK, I will fall short from singing the infamous catchy tune from the celebrated children's classic film ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". Unfortunately, the song was not included in the Willy Wonka remake ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". That is not the only reason why ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was not able to surpass its predecessor. For those of you who are not familiar of the chocolate dark side of this sweet fable, here it is: Charlie Bucket is a sweet destitute boy who gets a golden ticket in his Willy Wonka chocolate bar which enables to him to get invited to the mesmeric Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. He takes his granddaddy along and encounters other golden ticket raffle-winning children who are definitely not a bunch of sweet vanillas. Wonka himself is an eccentric who probably had too many nuts in his ice cream as a child. Johnny Depp stars as Wonka; it is wilder than the original Gene Wilder ""Wonka"" performance. However, wilder does not necessarily signify better. Even though Depp was ""depplicious"" at times with his nifty verbose, it still did not satisfy my taste buds because of the unnecessary slapstick that was instilled in his character. Director Tim Burton does create a compelling Wonka World but he did have his ""rocky road"" in direction by sinking too much into Wonka's mundane childhood. Child actor Freddie Highmore was able to find neverland in his affecting performance in ""Finding Neverland"", but he did not exactly melt me with his inflated ""Charlie Angel"" effort. The rest of the cast: David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, Noah Taylor & Helena Bonham Carter as Mr. & Mrs. Bucket, and Christopher Lee as Dr. Wonka was not the supporting acting dessert I was craving for. ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"" is not exactly a ""bucket"" of . , but I would also not spend too much golden money to get a golden ticket to see it. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Typically Burton!,"take a pinch of chocolate powder, mix in 2 spoonfuls of Mr J Depp and his unique madness, coat thoroughly with lashings of creativity by Roald Dahl and you have this movie. look and think, remember all the madness that Tim Burton - Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Beetlejuice - has brought to us over the years.This retelling of the story of Charlie Bucket sticks more close to the original book than the Gene Wilder version which was so Hated by Roald Dahl.The film still bumps off the various horrible children one by one in methods that reflect their vile personalities and character flaws. The Oompa Loompa's still sing stupid songs in almost Busby Berkley type dance numbers.One man plays all the small dancing freaks (Deep Roy), although I think there must be more midget extras who are unseen to carry the huge bar of chocolate in the homage to 2001: A Space Odessey.There is no Mr. Slugworth appearing to tempt the kids to steal Mr Wonka's secret's, although he is mentioned by name in another section of the movie. Charlie has a father and mother, differing from the Gene Wilder version.The ending of this actually does tally with the end of the book, leaving open the option of finally making Charlie and The Great Glass Elevator.Money, lawyers and Roald Dahl prevented the making of the second film when Wilders first version was created. Perhaps the madness of Tim Burton can tempt the Dahl estate into allowing this to finally appear on the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Chocolate-inspired fun,"With this film you constantly hear people comparing it to the previous film version starring Gene Wilder. Well not here, because although I think I've seen it at some stage, I don't really remember it all that well. So obviously it didn't make a great impression on me.For the few who don't know this is based on the book of the same title by Roald Dahl. The plot is centered on the chocolate factory of the title, its owner (Willy Wonka) and Charlie Bucket. Charlie, played by Freddie Highmore from Finding Neverland, comes from a family so poor that all they seem to eat is cabbage soup. His four grandparents share the one bed, and never leave it. Every year for his birthday Charlie gets a bar of chocolate, the only one he'll have all year. He always gets a bar of Wonka's chocolate and loves the stories his grandpa Joe tells about the factory, and its mysterious owner Willy Wonka.When a competition to allow five children to enter the factory is announced the chances are slim that Charlie will get a golden ticketNow my memory might be faulty here, but wasn't Charlie supposed to be English? So why did he find a dollar bill? Why does he use the term candy? But those are just minor quibbles. All in all I really enjoyed this film. Depp's Wonka is wonderfully weird and, well, just plain wacky. His disdain for the children is perfect for the film, as are the Oompa Loompa's crazy routines. Certain reviews have compared Depp's Wonka to Michael Jackson, but I have to say I don't see the similarities. Yes both are unnaturally white, but Wonka is not interested in the children at all, he doesn't care about them, all he cares about is chocolate and sweets and inventing.From the outset it is obvious that this is a Burton film, there are all those weird but great visuals, not to mention Depp's take on Willy Wonka. Although I did think that the music wasn't especially Burtonesque, and in most places didn't really stand out. Having said that I did enjoy the Oompa Loompa's songs.The children are all well-cast, Highmore especially is perfect as the scrawny underfed Charlie. But my favourite was the spoiled-rotten ""Veruca Salt, the little brute, Has just gone down the garbage chute"".",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Magical experience,"But just as Depp's entry and the ""Wizard of Oz""-like transition from the purposefully understated ""actual"" world into Wonka's fantasy one give the movie momentum, it starts to lose steam.However, the backstories concocted by the screenwriter John August to depict the young Willy's conflict with his dentist father (Christopher Lee) only serve to accentuate the mystery surrounding how the adult Willy lost his English accent. The Oompa-Loompas, small creatures Wonka acquired from a desolate foreign planet to meet his labor needs, are featured in these song-and-dance interludes.This part of Dahl's 1964 narrative has always had a rather unsettling imperialist undertone, and Burton's portrayal of it did little to change that impression.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
How does Johnny Depp keep getting hired?,"It seems that if you see Depp in something, it is going to be directed by Tim Burton, and it's going to be bad.
I wonder if Burton hopes that Depp will come back into fashion, despite him not being any good.
I mean, it seemed for a minute that he might come back, as he was enjoyable as a secondary character in the first 3 pirates films (until the series got it wrong by making him the main character in the terrible fourth one that nobody liked).Maybe Burton thinks if he keeps making films with the same visual style, and starring the same people, enough times that he might accidentally recapture Edward Scissorhands.Having said that, Ed Wood was good, so maybe this approach worked.

"Good movie, not as impacting as the original","I hate to compare 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' with it's predecessor, but 'Willy Wonka' was such a wonderful movie that it's hard not too.I enjoyed 'Charlie'. There were some wonderfully funny and wonderfully warm parts. The introduction of Wonka at the factory was potentially my favorite part(the song is still stuck in my head). Freddie Highmore is excellent as Charlie, and the showing of the family relationship he has is really touching. The scenes in the beginning with his family are some of the best(David Kelly is wonderful). Then comes the aforementioned scene of the unveiling of Wonka. Up to this point the movie is very enjoyable. Now arrives the factory tour, which is my only disappointment with the film. It seems very rushed to me, with each scene racing to get to the next child elimination. In 'Willy' they take time to appreciate all the wonders that are the factory. 'Pure Imagination' is deeply missed in this version. They just wizzed by to get to one less child and an Oompa Loompa song(which have nothing on the originals). For how visual Burton is, I'm really surprised at the little amount of time that is dealt to the wonders of the factory. I also felt there was too much focus on what was wrong with the kids, it was just evident in the original and not put under a giant magnifying glass. Also, Charlie and his Grandpa are hardly featured once the factory tour starts, when they really are the most wonderful part.On Depp's performance, a wonderful performance by a top-of-the-class actor. In watching him, I couldn't even tell I'd seen him in anything else before. I don't think it was entirely the right interpretation of Wonka(but I also was in love with Gene Wilder's performance), but it was an amazing performance nonetheless.I have to say, the scene with the squirrels is potentially the scariest thing I've ever seen. It jumps ahead of 'Christmas Vacation' for scariest squirrel scene.The ending of the movie was very disappointing for me. I thought a lot of it was unnecessary and tried too hard to be touching.All in all, it's a fine movie. It doesn't have the resonance of 'Willy', and I could have lived without it being made, but it is not a waste of a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The flashback interrupted the movie and kind of sent it in another direction for those few minutes, when they were over it sent you back into the movie wondering where you left of. The parents of Charlie were great, they looked like if they really would be his parents. As for the oompa loompas they look like modern oompas, and they're songs were boring.

a balance of caricatured characters and visual wonder,"Tim Burton is a director who has always been at a disadvantage when applying his unique visual style to the half-baked screenplays he is all too often saddled with--no amount of 'flair' or signature weirdness can cover up flaws in character and story (""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Beetlejuice"" in particular), but with ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (a return to the grind of Roald Dahl's book, first filmed in 1971) he meets his match. While not as downbeat or malicious as the earlier film, Burton's handling of the characters and situations melds well with his directorial flourishes--with an eccentric Willy Wonka (the playfully androgynous Johnny Depp) and an overwhelming wonderland contained within his factory, the exaggerated, bratty children (plus the humble and compassionate Charlie) and their parents are the pitch-perfect accompaniment to all the visual caffeine. The cast is in fine form, with Grandpa Bucket (David Kelly) and Wonka's father (Christopher Lee) to provide some chuckles for adults, while children will be hypnotized by the fantastic yet menacing factory; like most of Burton's work, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" too often threatens visual overload, but at least all the elements blend together finely, like a chocolate waterfall.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Only slightly spoiled chocolate won't melt your heart,"Amazing sets and catchy tunes aside, this remake of the 1971 original suffers a bit from an intentionally effected performance by Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka but is buoyed tremendously by Freddie Highmore, playing Charlie Bucket. Whimsical and highly imaginative, Tim Burton's latest melange of creativity is wholesome without being entirely pure, although the edge of the original film (and Roald Dahl's story) is somewhat blunted.Wonka's world-famous candy factory has been closed to the public - anyone, really - for decades, although candy still emerges each morning, neatly packed and ready to ship. Then one day, Wonka himself announces he has placed Golden Tickets in five Wonka Bars distributed throughout the globe. The children who find the five tickets are thereupon invited to a Grand Tour of the mysterious factory, and one of the kids will get a Veddy Special Prize at the end.The kids are the same as in the first film: snotty spoiled brat Veruca Salt, overachiever Violet Beauregarde, glutton Augustus Gloop, hostile Mike Teavee, and waiflike Charlie Bucket. Throughout the tour, each exposes his or her own self as a greedy, conniving fiend - except, of course, for poor (literally) Charlie, who's accompanied by his superold grandpa (David Kelly, who's fantastic).The sets are stunning, from the chocolate river to the squirrels' QC lab, and this allows one to forget how annoying Depp's Wonka is. He's intentionally unique, which is sort of a euphemism for ""we want him to be as strange as possible, the better to distance him from the people from the outside world."" Some have said that Depp was consciously aping Michael Jackson in his mannerisms, but I don't really see it. Heck, his Wonka doesn't even like kids, and he detests any kind of familial arrangement. I admire Depp for trying to make the role his own (and thus differentiating his work from that of Gene Wilder), but his Wonka was a little too loopy for me - it was tough to get a handle on him. And when you did think you knew what he was about, he'd say something that disproved that; sometimes that seemed to be a heavyhanded approach, a way to cynically manipulate the audience. If it was supposed to keep us on our toes, it failed, because I got tired of the character's contrarian attitude.A real treat, added just for the movie, is Wonka's father, played by the estimable Christopher Lee. The senior Wonka is a dentist (of course he is) who has not seen his only son since the latter left home to become a chocolatier. Which brings up an interesting question. How come Dr. Wonka looks older when he reunites with Willy than when they're together in flashbacks... but Willy doesn't? In fact, Willy Wonka looks pretty young - Lee looks more like his grandfather. Depp still has quite the boyish look about him; he appears to be in his late twenties, possible midthirties.I also enjoyed the Oompa Loompas, played by exactly one guy - Deep Roy. Roy repeated the movements of the Oompa Loompahs hundreds of times, and then he was digitally repeated over and over again, creating the illusion that he was many instead of one. A fine, fun job.Highmore is a truly great find; he played Peter in Finding Neverland, also starring Depp. Depp recommended Highmore to Tim Burton for the role of the angelic Charlie, and it turned out to be a most excellent recommendation. Charlie is alternately sage and blissfully naive, wise beyond his few years but still innocent at heart.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't as meanspirited as its predecessor, but it does have better scenery and fine performances - even the kids, so horribly bratty in the original, are merely rotten in this one. Burton proves again he has the visual part of directing down pat, although sometimes the heart eludes him.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
3 thumbs up!,"I loved this version very much. I especially liked the spicy Grandpa George and the spacey Grandma Georgina. I have new respect for Mr Wonka after the explanation via increasing flashbacks of his childhood. I understand why he's so strange. Deep Roy as ALL of the Oompa Loompas was a surprise and not as disappointing as I've heard from the ""peanut gallery."" Johnny Depp was superb. Danny Elfman was a perfect candidate for the music :) I just loved every part of this movie from every character to every scene. The only question I had was, ""Wouldn't you be screaming and/or shrieking during the boat ride...or at least have a 'roller coaster ride' reaction?"" All in all, I give it an 11 out of 10! Favorite lines: ""I love grapes!"" Grandma Georgina rocks!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A fun filled journey with enjoyable twists and turns.,"When I first saw Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory some unknown years ago, I was convinced that no other movie would ever take me into the world of fantasy and magic the way that movie did. Of course, as I grew older and saw more movies, I would be convinced several times more, by movies such as The Princess Bride, The Lord of the Rings, and Big Fish just to name a few. Nevertheless, Willy Wonka always held a special place in my movie memories. That being said, I went into the theaters last week to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with great anticipation, if not trepidation.I found myself pleasantly surprised as the ending credits rolled. Though I never read the book or any literature concerning this story, I understand that it was suppose to be more true to the book. Regardless, this movie explored many aspects of the characters, including Willy Wonka himself, in ways that the first movie never did. That said, many questions that I (as well as many others) had concerning the first movie was answered in Tim Burton's version. There are also several interesting twists toward the end of the movie, all leading up to a rather satisfying conclusion.My few criticisms about this movie concern more about the acting than the story. First, despite a strong performance by Freddie Highmore (Charlie), he was never as convincing as Peter Ostrum (the original Charlie). Ostrum was able to portray himself as a genuinely good kid, but at the same time depict realistic childhood behaviors, such as when he stole some of the fizzy pop. I felt that Highmore's Charlie was a bit too forced at points in the movie. Gene Wilder's performance was also better in my opinion, maybe because he showed a bit more humanity and love for his work, his oompa loompas, and Charlie himself. I know this may be different than what the original author intended, and Depp may have played the role the way it was suppose to be played, but nonetheless, he came off alien and disconnected at various times in the movie.Despite all that, this is a must see for everyone who was a fan of the original, and a must see for those with an imagination as big as their appetites for chocolate.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
True to the book!,"After hearing about this movie, reading the book by Roal Dahl, and seeing the original, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory,"" I wanted to see this movie so badly! This movie was true to the book, and I love it when that happens. I saw ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""James and the Giant Peach,"" two movies based on books by Roal Dahl, and I was disappointed with both of them, because they weren't true to the book. But this movie, ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory,"" was one of very few movies that were true to the book. I also think that Anna Sophia Robb did a great job of acting. She was so different in this movie than ""Because of Winn-Dixie,"" and I like it when actresses are really different in different movies. This movie rocks!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A remake unlike no other...,"Sorry to all those Johnny Depp fans out there but I went into this film with a lot of expectations and was concerned greatly whether he could carry off the role of Willy Wonka. I have never been a fan of his however I was very much impressed. What a show it was! He did an interview with one of our late shows here (Equivelant in USA to your David Letterman etc.) over satellite and said that as soon as he got the part to the movie he stopped watching the original with his kids. He wanted a fresh new approach to the character of Willy Wonka, and that, he DID! He came off eccentric and clever. I did feel however some of the dialogue that was used from the original film was not well brought across to the new screen. It was satisfactory however still entertaining and humorous. I am like many of the fans out of there of the original film. Nothing will beat the original. I also believe this film is more true to the original book. Not ever reading the book I cannot comment on this.The sets were colourful to be expected with some new scenes. However those expecting to see Charlie and his Grandfather floating to the ceiling in the bubble scene will be disappointed. In this movie, Charlie is always the good boy placing his family first.What can i say about this film. Well i loved it. Since i am now father to a 5 year old son, I have watched the original over and over again now as an adult. It brings me back being a child again. I escape in the magic of it all. The new film was no exception to the rule. I know remakes have been very fashionable in the last 5-10 years and original ideas are becoming more rare every day, this is one remake you WILL want to go and see.Johnny, you did well. I loved the casting of the old Grandfather. Anyone remember Waking Ned Divine??? I believe it was the same guy.Go see it. Whether you are a parent or not or with children or not you will enjoy it.

"A bit disappointing, but not too bad either","The story 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is originally by Roald Dahl, a man with a giant dose of fantasy, and just like Tim Burton, a (sometimes) morbid kind of humour. This story is about little and poor Charlie Bucket, who magically finds a Golden Ticket in the wrapping of a Willy Wonka's chocolate bar. This ticket gives him the opportunity to visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, a place where no one has come in or out for many, many years. Together with his grandfather Jacob, and the finders of the four other Golden Tickets, he enters the magical world of Willy Wonka. Many surprises await him, including a big prize.Tim Burton is my favourite director, and Roald Dahl is my favourite writer, so I had high expectations of this movie. But I'm a bit disappointed. And I blame John August, who wrote the screenplay. I don't really mind that they change the story a bit, but only if it is for the better. On the one hand they spiced it up a little, by making Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) weirder than ever, by making the kids and parents (except Charlie) more obnoxious, putting the Oompa-Loompas in latex suits with vivid colours, giving it all a sharper edge I had no problems with that. That they gave Wily Wonka a past, and a father, well  OK. But it also took the myth and the mystery around Willy Wonka away (he could have at least come from another planet) But what I really, really disliked about this adaptation is that they also sweetened it up  a lot. First of all, Charlie is said to be a normal kid, but he isn't: he is so sweet and so moralistic that he is everything but normal. Second, and worst, they created a whole new ending telling us how important family is, showing Willy Wonka as a poor traumatised man. Roald Dahl's version of the story is already rather moralistic, by telling us it is bad for kids to watch too much TV, to be spoiled by their parents, to eat too much candy, to constantly chew gum, That family is important, is present in the book too, just by showing how close Charlie's family is, but why, oh why did they have to exaggerate on this aspect in the movie? By changing the story, by spicing and sweetening it up at the same time, you get a confusing mix of craziness and morals, of fun and seriousness. Because it constantly changes it is impossible to get completely sucked into the atmosphere, like I usually experience when watching Burton-films. One moment it's all sparkling crazy fun, the next moment we go back to Willy Wonka's traumatic youth, this breaks the tempo of the wild ride on the great chocolate river.Besides this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, on the contrary. Visually, this is a real Burton film, except that it is more colourful (most of the time) than most of his oeuvre. The scenery looks magical (I especially loved the little house the Bucket family lives in). Another thing that was typically Tim Burton is that everything is a bit weirder than it already was in the Roald Dahl story. Everything and everybody looks and acts very surreal. First of all it is rather weird that all the Oompa-Loompas are all played by Deep Roy, and consequently all look the same. (Female Oompa-Loompas are also Deep Roy, but dressed in women's clothes) As I already said, Willy Wonka is weirder than ever. I've never seen Johnny Depp so crazy, and that is saying something. The kids are just as surreal as Willy Wonka, the movie makers even added some obnoxious habits to the kids' characters. The young actors, picked out to portray them, are absolutely great.Danny Elfman had lots of fun composing the music for the Oompa-Loompa songs that go with Roald Dahl's lyrics, and I had lots of fun listening to them, and watching the crazy dances of the Oompa-Loompas while singing. He chose a different style for every song (Broadway, 70's, rock, ) and Tim Burton added a matching dance for each one.The movie is lots of fun, it's like watching the craziest and weirdest circus show, suffused with beautiful visuals. If it wasn't for the spoiled story this would have been a definite four star movie, maybe even five. It makes me almost angry knowing how magnificent this movie could have been, why didn't they just stick to the fun stuff?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Violet... you're turning Violet!""","Tim Burton's personal style is all over Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, an updated version of Roald Dahl's book that inspired the 1970s Gene Wilder movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The dark undertones beneath a happy, bubbly exterior, the heart of the movie is about greed while we enjoy the candy. The essence of chocolate is what this movie is about. While we enjoy the junk food, there is nothing good for you in it, and there is something evil about it rots your teeth. Burton's knack for making what was once a light and fluffy piece of work a darker, more foreboding piece of art shapes the effectiveness of this movie. He did it in the Michael Keaton Batman movie, and here, he uses a Johnny Depp that is channeling Michael Jackson to bring a new Willy Wonka to life. The man who lives within his own chocolate factory is eerie enough, but one who reminds us of a once famous pop singer who lives in his own Wonderland takes the movie to another level. Unfortunately, the timing could not be worse for the movie, as the weirdness of Mr. Jackson kind of ruins the effect of Depp's decision to make Wonka a weird-loaner type character. Freddie Highmore plays Charlie who lives with his family in a small house where all of his grandparents live in one bed. His one grandfather used to work for Wonka, and when Charlie finds the last golden ticket and wins a trip to the chocolate factory, he takes Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) with him. It's Charlie and 4 other children, all of which fall to greed and excess. The fate of each child is truly frightening, and parents should be warned that their children could be scared. The factory itself is truly awesome. The set pieces are wonderful, great looking, and allow the Oompa Loompas (all played by Deep Roy, digitally reproduced to give the allusion of an Oompa Loompa army) to stage their productions with ease and glamor. The music used is catchy, not the Oompa Loompa song from Willy Wonka, but instead 5 different styles, from rock to jazz. My only complaint came in the scenes explaining Wonka's motivation. It involves scenes with his father (Christopher Lee, which had to have set a record for most blockbuster films starred in in one decade) and his anti-candy bias. The reason for this provides a momentary chuckle, but I don't think I needed to know what made Wonka tick. Overall, the movie looks great, but the execution of the story is brought down by Depp's decision to make Wonka a modern day Michael Jackson, in an age of Michael Jackson.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Not Burton's best, but still good","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a whimsical and magical adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's book. The movie follows the story of Charlie, a kind and humble boy who wins a Golden Ticket to tour the mysterious and fantastical chocolate factory owned by eccentric recluse Willy Wonka. The movie features impressive visuals, unforgettable characters, and Burton's signature dark and eccentric style, making it a standout children's film.I wouldn't say that this is Burton's best movie. Far from it. But it definitely does a great job in terms of blending Burton's unforgettable style with Dahl's magical atmosphere.

Didn't quite grab me 100%,"{Written directly after returning from the cinema.)As an appreciator of Depp's past characterisations, especially in 'Fear and Loathing' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean', I was eager to see what he would come up with for Willy Wonka. And Depps performance is very much central to the film: a 'showcase' as they call it.Opinions have be circulating that he had borrowed a lot from Michael Jackson, and the expectation of witnessing some sort of insipid beautification of Jackson's character did cast a shadow of foreboding over my trip. But given that I'm not sure as to whether or not this is true after watching the movie, this matter will probably remain in the realm of speculation (unless Depp himself has a comment there).In fact Wonka's pallor, his timid voice, and his vulnerability reminded me mostly of Edward Scissorhands.One thing is sure, his performance owes nothing to Gene Wilder's nose-powder interpretation of Dahl's Willy Wonka.Depp's Wonka is more vulnerable and has psychological depth. The film is not so much about a fulfilling of the dreams of a disadvantaged boy: it's is more about the salvation of the psychologically scarred Mr Wonka. (Indeed, in one scene he is 'on the couch').Tim Burton has mellowed out a lot since his 'isn't-life-awful' early movies, something which is evident in this film: the 'PG' certificate was probably settled by the toss of a coin. There is nothing in this Burton offering that instills dread in the soul.It's good, it's very good. But like I said: it didn't quite grab me. It sorta lacks heart. The whole production just sorts of slides past you like a Wonka Bar on a conveyor belt. And you enjoy it like a candy bar. Then forget about it. Although completely engrossing, the film was a bit lazily put together in some ways: in some parts the cast seem to be standing in the wrong place and some effect is missed because of this. One minor annoyance is that I couldn't understand half of what the Umpa Lumpas were singing. (Some large, multicoloured subtitles, or something similar to the 'displaying of key-words' strategy in the original film would surely have helped there).If the film was about to be erased from my memory, (by means of some novelty Wonka candy created to do this), before I eat this magical candy I would write a note to myself to go see the film again.And the message in that note would also I think be valid to all those out there who would like to escape reality for a cuppla with a trip to this absorping, charming and captivating candyland:""Go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Perfectly captures the magic of the book,"I might be in a tiny minority here, but I actually prefer 2005's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' to the original 'Willy Wonka' film from the 70s. Yes, the original is considered a classic and rightly so, but there is something about this version that I love that just isn't found in the original. It remains loyal to the book whilst adding the odd new element to give it a fresh feel.I've seen this version a few times now and always enjoy it immensely. I particularly like how we learn more about the mysterious Willy Wonka character as we're taken back to his childhood. Johnny Depp is brilliant as Wonka, delivering a truly captivating performance and giving his own take on the character. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' turned out as well as it could have for me.

Among Johnny Depp's best work.,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Fantasy/Comedy 2005I really want to get on with this review, so I'll sum up the synopsis part quick as can besince we're all familiar with it anyway: Quirky, reclusive owner of the greatest candy factory in the world, Willy Wonka, has just sent out five golden tickets to allow five children to tour his factory with a surprise at the end for the child that impresses Mr. Wonka the best during the tour. Okay, we all know how this movie goeseven if we haven't seen it. We've seen the original or one of the millions of times it's been mentioned, referenced, or parodied over the years in places like the television shows ""Futurama"" and ""Family Guy."" So let's get on with it:Here's the breakdown:The Good:--For anyone worried that ""Hollywood Elite"" status has ruined Johnny Depp, worry not. Everything about this movie could suck and it would still be watchable just because of him! His acting is brilliant, fantastic, hilarious. He injects mannerisms and attitude into Willy Wonka that are impossible to hate. And some of them are so minor: When everyone's boarding the boat on the chocolate river, the mother of one of the children is very obviously attracted to Willy Wonka and creepily trying to impress him. The disgusted and nervous way Johnny Depp says ""All aboard"" is immensely subtle, but still laugh-out-loud funny. Sure, Gene Wilder was brilliant in this role, but hellit's like it was always meant for Johnny Depp. He doesn't mind looking funny or acting sillyin fact, he seems to revel in itand the audience receives some of the best entertainment we're likely to find in any movie these days. Everything about Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is sheer perfection. Subtle mannerisms, weird joking, his joyful disdain of the rotten children, his looks, attitudeeverything. He is this movie.--Okay, that said, the rest of the acting was also quite gooda real plus from the boy playing Charlie. He's likable and heart-warming. The other kids? Just as obnoxious as can bewhich is just the way they're supposed to be.--Classic, great story.--Generally excellent compositing and special effects work, even if it is all CG. CG work these days is getting more and more obvious for some reason, and more and more overused. Now, while that is the case here, there are still some very impressive sets and not all the CG is obvious. It's better looking that, say, 95% of the films released the past few years.--Absolutely fantastic setsclassic Tim Burton. Dreamy and detailed.--Danny Elfman's music is as brilliant as always.--After watching this film, it's hard to imagine the Chocolate Factory without Depp, Burton, and Elfman making it what it is. And it's damn near impossible to put into words just how it looks and feels.--Excellent dialog, especially (of course) from Depp. ""Everything in this room is eatableeven me. But that, children, is called cannibalism and is frowned upon in most modern societies."" Sure, this is zany writing, but what really makes it memorable is the way Depp delivers all these lines.--This is a family movie that can actually be enjoyed by adults. A lot of them are billed stating that they can be enjoyed by adults, like ""Madagascar"" for instancebut are still too childish. My son is two years old and he couldn't take his eyes off the screen for most of it. And I loved this movie through and through. We have a rarity herewhole families actually can enjoy this one!--Excellent writing, and great comedy moments. This is the best thing Tim Burton has done in years.--Tons of cheesinessbut the good kind. The kind that makes the movie fun. You'll see--The Oompa Loompas are all the same little guy. He was Mr. Soggybottom in Burton's ""Big Fish.""Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The songs by the Oompa Loompas are a far cry different from those of the original film. Some people may not be too keen on this. All of them themed differentlylike, there's a Disco song and an 80's Hair Metal/Hard Rock song (which constantly reminds us of Van Halen and Quiet Riot) to name a couple.The Bad:--Unfortunately, it's another remake in a remake-heavy era of Hollywood.--A tad over-reliant on computer graphics work. Didn't ruin the movie, but I think it's time that production artists get off the computers and into the studios again.The Ugly:--The four children that aren't Charlie.Memorable Scene:--Any time Depp speaks.Acting: 10/10 (Johnny Depp deserves even higher) Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 10/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 Violence: 2/10 (very minor comic shenanigans) Gore: 0/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Direction: 10/10Cheesiness: 5/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 10/10So there you have it. It's one of the best movies made in the last year. Perhaps, in the last few years. It's certainly the best remake in well in ages (and I've seen King Kong 2005). It's different enough to make the original with Gene Wilder still well worth owning and loving. However, Depp surpasses Wilder in the role, in my opinion. In the original, Gene Wilder shares the spotlight with the brilliant factory and wacky visuals. Here, everythingthe other actors, the scenery, the musiceverything is second string to Depp's compelling, and brilliant performanceamong the best he's ever done. It really feels like, all these years, ever since the story was writtenit was always intended for Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. Watch it.www.ResidentHazard.com",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Charlie And The Chocolate Factory **1/2,"As if the mere fact that even today's major Hollywood film-makers - Tim Burton, The Coen Brothers, Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone - have resorted to remaking earlier successes was not alarming enough, here we also have a remake which, despite being helmed by a vastly more talented director than the original's anonymous Mel Stuart, proves to be much less appetizing (pun intended). The thing is that, while the remake has all the visual flourishes and outrageous production design synonymous with its idiosyncratic director, it is fatally compromised by the distinctly unsympathetic characterization given by Johnny Depp (ironically, my favorite actor working in films today) in the all-important role of the reclusive Willy Wonka. While I haven't read the Roald Dahl book myself, so I can't really say with any measure of accuracy which of the two characterizations - Gene Wilder's in the 1971 original or Depp's in the remake - is the closer to Dahl's conception of Wonka, it goes without saying that Wilder's is the winner here. All in all, in fact, although I didn't enjoy that film on second viewing as much as I did the first, I prefer Wilder's version in practically every department. Also, while I did get used to the bizarrely ""modern"" musical numbers as the film progressed, I don't think they were really suited to the material. The appearance of Christopher Lee as Depp¡¦s dentist father was a welcome addition, though, and in a way his scenes helped make some of Wonka's eccentricities more palatable. In conclusion, while Burton's remake of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY wasn't as disastrous as his 2001 version of PLANET OF THE APES, which was decidedly his nadir, here's hoping that he gets back to concocting his own original visions before long.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Great Children's Story Turned into a Swanko Acid Trip of Stupid Bunk,"Johnny Depp is a strange, quite bad, scraggly-looking actor. Tim Burton decided to swank up and nice, happy-go-lucky children's story into his ""Look at me I'm Tim Burton and I will swank up this movie and show you how swank I am"" movie. In addition, Willy Wonka never looked like a pimp, as he does in the movie, with a face that looks like it's made out of plastic. By the way the self-indulgent claptrap trailer that the audience hissed at, is no different than what one visualizes when on a trip of acid and/or LSD. Another thing, I'm pretty sure Johnny Depp is imitating Michael Jackson. Well anyways, my point is, don't see this incoherent, swanky, acid-trip like, lame embarrassment to the cinematic arts.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Depp was perfectly strange as Wonka; in fact, the whole movie was incredibly well cast! The sets were stunning (I read that the 'chocolate river' was really made of a toothpaste base with bean paste thickener - ugh)and the oompa-loompas.... added a whole other element of weirdness.

Excellent,"I went into the theaters wondering if I would enjoy this movie or it would leave a lot to ""Pure Imagination"" Tim Burton definitely took a gamble here. He took a great original and decided to mess with it. That's a pretty big risk, but overall I think it paid off. Johnny Depp's amazing ability to play any character in almost any role is truly amazing, and he shows off his skill very will in this film. You will see many references to the original in this film. The main, and most noticeable difference, was Wonka's sarcasm. I found myself laughing at many things that no one else in the theater did, and it was packed out. Perhaps the locals don't appreciate good sarcasm, or maybe I'm just heartless? Either way, I got quite a few good chuckles.This film also differs from the original considering there are only four songs performed during the movie, compared to the original version, which had nine musical performances. A good comparison to this movie would be the ""Shrek"" series, because it's acceptable for younger children to watch, (and believe me there were plenty there) and it also has plenty of adult humor. By saying adult humor I'm not referring to sexual innuendos or vulgar comments, mostly only sarcastic humor. Wonka's indifference to the children is absolutely hilarious. I do have to say this though, I felt that Wonka and Charlie had a better connection and relationship in this one compared to the original. Near the end of the movie you can see that they begin to bond a great deal, a lot more than the original.For those that are entering this film expecting a remake of the original, prepare to be astonished.

Box office loser! Don't insult us,"Gene Wilder is Right! Why remake a perfect movie? Money.This movie is just an attempt to make money for the studio and the actors involved. This movie is in one word: insulting This movie ruins the image of Willy Wonka. He is no longer a weird, reclusive, lovable hero. Instead he is a weird distant drug user. Willy Wonka is suppose to be about imagination, hope, and mystery.The music lyrics were inaudible at times and not in your face like the original.There isn't any ""oompa Loompa Doompa de do"" with fun loving oompa lumpas. Instead the oompa lumpas are cold faced clones with a cheesy special effect. There isn't any personality to these little guys. And they certainly are not cute in anyway. They are suppose to be weird like cute helpers.The theme of ""Pure Imagination"" has been removed and there is nothing to hold this film together. Apparently, imagination is lost.There aren't any lovable characters to speak of.The acting is good by most of the cast but goes no where. The special effects are very cheesy, a boat in one scene looks like a Disney ride then a model in another.If you do see this movie, you won't want to see it again.Another attempt to make money fails. I predict it fail at the box office after the 1st week, and maybe pull in $150 million by the time it hits video. For the $150 price tag, they will only make a few million dollars if they are lucky and they ruined Willy Wonka forever.Stick with the imagination and hope of Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This Chocolate Tastes Bad,"Horrible. I saw this movie last night and I really hated it. I wasn't hoping for an exact remake of the great original, and, with Burton directing, I wasn't disappointed in that regard.I suppose, for me, it was just a bad marriage of director and movie. It could have been good in another directors hands. But Burton makes ...his own style, I guess you could say. He's made some movies I have really liked: Edward Scissorhands, for example. This, his latest effort, just falls flat for me.Depp is creepy as Willy Wonka, and that's not really what I wanted. I could never get into the character at all.If this version of Willy Wonka had been the original, trust me it would not have became a beloved classic.There is simply no way that this movie will be remembered thirty plus years from now as the original one is today.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I wish i had a golden ticket,"I've seen the original and still love it but this version seems to have polished some edges without destroying the point of the story. Johnny Depp made a fantastic Willy Wonka and I cannot think of anyone better for the part. The casting for the children was pretty spot on too. Also worth noting, the visuals were great.Initially, I wasn't too sure what the point of the slightly divergent storyline was (you'll know what i mean) regarding Willy's past, but it all comes together quite well.The only drawback for me were that the Oompa Loompa song's weren't that great and a little convoluted, but i guess the originals tended to wear thin after awhile too.Don't let the idea of ""remake"" stop you from watching this. It's a great movie for kids and couples.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Depp and Burton give depth and excitement to Wonka,"Goth kids and women everywhere united in one voice when it was announced that Johnny Depp was going to be playing the well known Willy Wonka in a movie directed by Tim Burton. Calendars were marked and people were ready to see the successful team of Depp and Burton redefine movies again. As the date of release grew near some people I talked to were getting nervous. Would Depp go too far? Is such a thing even possible? Still, I went out the first day of release ready to see what the verdict would be and if the expectations were set too high.As the beginning credits roll we follow chocolate being made by sophisticated machines with Danny Elfman's music setting the pace. We meet Charlie first, a normal kid who's day ends with cabbage soup every night with no complaint, is played by Freddie Highmore, who stared with Depp in Finding Neverland in 2004. He does a wonderful job playing the sweet boy who makes the best of his family's low social status. The sets have Burton's hand on them, with the slight cartoonish feel to everything we see. This continues when we meet the other children who will follow Wonka on his factory tour- Augustus Gloop( Philip Wiegratz) with his rosy complexion and chocolate smeared face; Veruca Salt( Julia Winter) her blue eyes glittering like her mother's large ring under the attention of the cameras with her prize; Violet Beauregarde( Annasophia Robb) has the cool blond hair matching her white skin giving her this cool, unemotional attitude and Mike Teavee( Jordan Fry) with his eyes taking over most of his face as though he's watching everything but with a very unhealthy dose of skepticism. The children all did an amazing job personifying their bad traits and I was very happy to have more about Violet than in the 1971 version. Burton gave the children their moments to shine just as much as Charlie, which I thought was missing in the earlier version.Depp as Wonka was perfect. He gave the character a little more depth, a man who made candy but didn't even like children. The flashbacks to Wonka's childhood made more of Wonka than a crazed candy maker giving him layers and ideals behind his love of candy. The children and Wonka seem to be at odds the moment they enter the factory but being as Wonka hasn't had human interaction in years, it isn't out of place. His sayings and quick wit responses to the children may not make as much sense to the younger viewers but parents will appreciate them. Wonka's sidekicks, the Oompa Loompas ( played wonderfully by Deep Roy) were the perfect compliment to Depp. The songs and dances, different from the 1971 version, all had a different theme and attitude which added to the difference between the children and their faults. These dances were without a doubt some of my favorite scenes in the whole movie.In the end, you have to forget what you know about Willy Wonka and Charlie and the factory. Forget the happy-go-lucky Wilder character and indulge in a new and more faithful version of the story. The acting was all amazing, the sets were colorful and made you unsure of where to look next, as a trip to a real Wonka factory would have been like. Depp has created another memorable character along the lines of Jack Sparrow and with such a supporting cast, this movie makes a great treat for anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Re-makes can be better than Originals,"When I read most of the reviews, I saw that a lot of the people were Tim Burton fans. When I heard that he was going to remake this timeless classic, I thought ""well here goes another great movie down the drain""...don't get me wrong Tim Burton is OK but not really my taste.....Boy was I wrong....I had the great pleasure to see this wonderful movie yesterday with my son, we both had a ball, we laughed and laughed. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka was perfect and the special effects, fantastic.

"Bold, Bright, Fun","At fist I was hesitant to see a movie I thought needed little revising, but in the end I was glad I went. Overall the film had a bright and cheery visual look that contrasted with Burton's dark little extras. The scenes within the chocolate factory closely matched the book's description and were alive with loud contrasting colors. Each bad child character, (i.e. Varuca Salt, Mike Teavee,) was wisely cast with some sort of grotesque physical aspect that matched the character's flaws. The only addition to the storyline was Willy Wonka's father, and it was played well by making him a dentist who found candy useless. Moving at a much faster pace than the 1973 version, Burton's version is an enjoyable interpretation.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Scrumdiddlyumptious!,"I admit that I went to the theater with apprehension, having grown up with the Gene Wilder version of Roald Dahl's wonderful story, but I was soon transported into a fantastic film that exceeded almost every expectation. If you are a fan of the book (meaning that you have read the book more than once), you owe it to yourself to see this cinematic version. They say ""don't judge a book by it's cover"", well I say, don't judge a film by it's leading actor, or previous versions that you may have seen of the same story. Johnny Depp is no Gene Wilder, but then this is not Gene Wilder's film. Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka, and that is all that really matters.There is a subtle sub-plot that was invented for the film which I found a little disturbing, but even with this addition the film was still very enjoyable. I'm not going to give anything away, but suffice it to say that the added material only goes to enforce the morality story that is the main thrust of the original book.The last Tim Burton/Johnny Depp film that I saw was ""Edward Scissorhands"" and I must say that I was more than a little worried about Tim Burton's handling of this joyous material. Again, I was overly worried for no reason! The colors are bright, the characters are played to perfection by the young cast, and Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance as the mysterious, slightly screwy candy man.""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was a great film for the 60's, but there were limitations to the technology of the day. For a technologically fantastic film that more closely follows the source (albeit with one glaring, disturbing plot addition), I would highly, and exuberantly (is that a word), recommend this film!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Depp & Burton forever!,"Don't mind about the trailer,which is quite ridiculous indeed:this is Tim Burton's best movie since Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns.Roald Dahl's unforgettable novel is faithfully brought to the screen,as we see poor boy Charlie (Freddie Highmore,much more cheerful than in Finding Neverland)winning a trip inside the local chocolate factory. And it is an AMAZING factory:almost entirely built from scratch,with limited use of CG,it's a pure and simple visual joy,reminiscent of when the director gave cinematic life to Gotham City. Along with Charlie there are four other kids,perfectly played by the young actors.The only problem is the obnoxious, TV-obsessed Mike Teavee (fitting surname, huh?),who's even more boring than in the book,the only character you really hope will get in trouble. The Oompa Loompas,all played by the same actor,Deep Roy, are very enjoyable,even in the musical numbers,not really necessary ,but charming (they're voiced by Danny Elfman,whose score is terrific as usual).This really is a Tim Burton movie,and you notice that from the beginning:the snow falling down and even covering the Warner Bros.logo,the camera moving inside the factory,which reminds of the opening sequences of Batman and Edward Scissorhands,the thrilling music... He's even made it more personal by adding an interesting back-story involving Willy Wonka and his father(a welcome return to creepy characters for Christoher Lee). Which brings us to the real reason you watch this movie,the amazing chocolatier...Johnny Depp! He's not acting, he IS Willy Wonka,and he's obviously enjoying himself,portraying someone who's twice as mad as Jack Sparrow,sorry,I mean,Captain Jack Sparrow.Depp and Burton working together is always a guarantee of quality,and this fourth collaboration of theirs is a perfect return to the weird,slightly Gothic movies that made us love them,after their recent,and rather good by the way,mainstream efforts(Big Fish and Pirates of the Caribbean). Don't get me wrong,children can watch,and love,this film,but it really is something everyone should enjoy,no matter how old they are(actually,when I saw the movie,there were only 4 or 5 kids,and 20 adults).I haven't seen the original movie with Gene Wilder,but thanks to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp,this version is already a classic. I'm really looking forward to seeing Corpse Bride and any other movie they might make together.Batman Begins aside,this is the best film of summer 2005.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quite good!,"I will admit, that I was expecting a dark, dark film by Tim Burton, but was a little disappointed, and at the same time happy since it is a kid's movie, that it wasn't. Johnny Depp was outstanding, as always, and there were times when I found I had to remind myself that it was actually him, because he is so believable in every character that he portrays. I also don't think, I've ever seen a bad Depp film, and this one is included.Based on the novel, and the original film, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp now takes the lead in this quirky, unusual type family film. I was impressed with everyone involved with the film, especially the little girl that played Verusa. She was outstanding, and what I think I was most impressed with more than anything else, was how much like they were able to get two of the children to look just like two of the original children in the previous film.It was funny, and there were a few very touching scenes. I was obviously very impressed with Johnny Depp's performance, but then, when am I not? It was a great watch, and I recommend it to kids and adults of all ages, there is nothing in the film to be offended by, and even adults will enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is a poor remake or a great original film,"While the story line in this version follows Dahl's story closer than the Willy Wonka movie, but it lacks the energy and characterization of the original film. Tim Burton's Wonka is a neurotic runaway child, not the creative and eccentric Wonka in Dahl's story. Burton apparently got wrapped up in the Wonka character, because no one else in this film has any life. The children are cardboard cutouts who either have no real energy or overact when they are not being wooden. Grandpa Joe's character suffers the same fate & Charlie's parents might as well not be in the film at all. Burton tried to make up for this with elaborate sets & all kinds of gadgets & special effects, but those cannot overcome wooden performances and lack of direction.I said this version followed the original story more closely than the original. However the addition of the byplay being young Willy and his father (who is not in the book) is merely distracting and does not help the story at all.I am sure Burton felt the rock 'n' roll Oompa Loompa's would be a hit, and I assume the lyrics they sing were in Dah;'s original sorry (I could not understand the lyrics since the music was so loud). But the pithy ditties created by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse in the original were much better and added much more to the story.Bottom line: a flashy remake which does no justice to the original.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An equal on the original,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is great film and I would recommend it for anyone. Somehow Tim Burton is back on track with his excellent direction of this film so close to the book. Roal Dahl should be proud. Johnny Depp as always is excellent and play a great Wily Wonka. The original is brilliant but I find the second one to be far more what Charlie and The chocolate factory should be. Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka Just as Micheal Keaton will always be Batman. But this film has to be one of the most fun and well put together of this year. If you haven't seen it go see it and don't expect the original. Johnny Depp is great the film is cast better and seems to flow a lot better than the first movie.

visually and emotionally satisfying,"Tim Burton has redeemed himself with this interpretation of the classic story by Dahl. He has put together a group of talented and charismatic performers who bring out the spirit of the original story and enhanced it with amazing production values. Yes, it's different and at times, it feels odd, but it contains a good message which it delivers in quite an entertaining manner.The beginning is reminiscent of ""Edward Scissorhands"", introducing us to Charlie's family and setting up the big scenes to come. Freddie Highmore's Charlie Bucket is a sensitive and quite mature youngster who has been raised with good values by two generations of his family. They echo the strong family relationship of ""The Waltons"", and Burton makes sure the early scenes display both sweetness and uniqueness. These folks might be honest but they are also very interesting to listen and look at.The early segments also introduce us to the other four children who play important roles in the development of the story, and it's a hoot to see some of their introductions. Here's when we first encounter the twisted sense of humor that connects the rest of the film and makes the experience in the factory a true delight.There are moments in the factory scenes when Burton appears to be trying a little too hard; however it is the originality of his approach, coupled with some of the most incredible art direction presented in a modern film that makes the film a treat. There are a couple of musical number that would have inspired Busby Berkeley.He might not be the main reason the film succeeds, and yet his performance is once again a triumph of the amazing talent Johnny Depp has. His Wonka is to put it mildly ""odd"". His speech and his facial expressions captivate, repulse, and hypnotize at the same time. He commands the screen and easily fits into this wondrous universe.Be ready to enjoy the ride and appreciate that Hollywood is capable of creating magic. Here is a film that justifies big budgets and respects the value of good source material. Depp, Burton, and Hightower are names that Oscar should keep in mind at the end of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Could have been good but failed,"When I was a kid, Roald Dahl was one of my heroes. His books really understand some of the ways kids think. They're downright nasty at times but they ring true to children and adults. So therefore, I would expect any movies based on his books to capture that essence and to look the way we imagined the story or to show a new way of imagining it that is just as good as our version.In 1971, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a perfect movie version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It didn't follow the book all the time but it captured the heart of the story and, at times, told the story even better, especially in the character of Charlie. Other directors have made good films out of Dahl books as well, even when they deviated from the material. Since Burton wanted to make an adaptation that was closer to the book, I was excited to see what he came up with because it really is a good book.Let me make something perfectly clear. This movie could have been fantastic under Burton's direction. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has some intense and almost disturbing ideas and had Burton intended to make this a horror film he would have succeeded with a lot of the elements in the movie staying the same. The soundtrack sounds like something in a horror film. Some of the scenes are scary enough that a bit of tweaking could make it fit the horror genre (especially the blueberry scene, little tip, that wasn't supposed to be scary, it was supposed to be WEIRD). And had they made this a horror film, tweaking Depp's performance would have worked to its advantage seeing as he's already creepy enough. Yes, this movie could have worked. But like with The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, they decided to take this dark and disturbing direction and market it to children and, even more insulting, Dahl fans.Taking lines directly out of the book does not make this movie more faithful to the book. If that had been Burton's intention, he would have made the movie a little brighter and a lot more whimsical. Neither Depp nor Wilder really capture the Wonka from the book (who acts a bit like the 11th Doctor from Doctor Who, now I think of it) but deviation from the character isn't necessarily an issue. Wilder drew on the mad scientist elements from the book and made the role a real joy to watch. But Wonka from the book was odd, yes, but not awkward like Depp's portrayal. I don't know what drugs he was on but his performance was awful. Depp could have been a good Wonka and that makeup would have worked, again, had they wanted to turn this into a horror film. Coming back to the lines taken from the book, had Depp performed the character just like the one in the book, the lines would have worked. But they simply didn't work for his portrayal. Nothing worked at all.One of the few things I thought the film did a little better was making the kids more bratty. They should have toned down Mike Teavee, however, who was annoying but not necessarily a complete jerk. Violet's upgrade worked well because it played on a stereotype we've all seen, the kid who has to win everything. If there's one error in Dahl's writing, it's that his earlier protagonist children didn't have much personality, an error he fixed with later books, and that's very obvious with Charlie but Charlie was a nice kid with the spark of imagination and he was a bit of an idealist. Peter Ostrum's portrayal took that and improved on it. Freddie Highmore, who is a fine actor but nonetheless was subject to the directing, took that character and did NOTHING with it. In fact, he gave the character even less personality. The exact same can be said for Veruca, who was a brat in the book, even more bratty in the original movie, and had no personality in this movie.Long story short, this was very close to being a good film. The tone should have been shifted to horror and it would have worked on every level with a bit of fixing here and there. It was already dark and creepy and removing the stupid, horrible jokes would have made it a lot more scary and thus it would have been an interesting take on the book. As it stands, it simply does not work for anyone. It's too scary for children and too stupid for adults. Half the characters and cardboard cutouts or stereotypes and the other half are over-acted or over done and the one character that actually worked, Violet, still was bogged down by everything else that went wrong. Read the book, watch the 1971 film, but don't waste your time on this film. It's not worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The original movie was terrible, the Tim Burton version is way better.","Sorry to make you upset, but isn't Charlie and the Chocolate Factory SUPPOSED to be dark, twisted, and scary? Look, the 1971 film was terrible. It was a critical and financial failure upon its release, and I'm not even kidding when I said that. The 1971 film was made just to be a feature length commercial for real life Wonka candies by Quaker Oats (no joke).I am so tired of people saying that the 1971 film is far more superior than the Tim Burton version. No offense to Gene Wilder, but Johnny Depp is the true Willy Wonka. Slugworth wasn't needed, no fizzy lifting drink scene, no easily forgiveness, and all we see is exactly how Roald Dahl wanted. Sure, they may not've included Wonka's poem, but the tunnel scene is still creative and fun.Seriously, if you read the original book, you'll know why people love the film. Sure, not every film based on a book repeats the book beat by beat, but Roald Dahl stories are different. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a critical and commercial success. It stayed true to the original source material, it has better writing, and the bratty kids actually get punished for their bratty actions.It's like this film doesn't believe in karma houdinis.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory delivers a delicious bite!,"As usual, the original is better. BUT!!! This is Tim Burton's version, and it is a completely different version from a light and chipper story to a little bit more dark. Everything on this movie has Tim Burton's name on it. His classic trade marks and actors are in this film. While I'd rather show anyone the first and original Willy Wonka, this one isn't even half bad. As an updated and closer to the book film, this movie delivers everything you could want. It's interesting, funny, creepy, dramatic, and loving. It's a charming movie and so far one of the best for the year of 2005 that I've seen. I'm very impressed, Tim Burton.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sweet without being sickly,"As a huge fan of Roald Dahl, I loved this movie. I was moved to tears on a couple of occasions.I had re-read the book a few days before seeing the movie and was pleased to see that for the most part, this movie was faithful to the book. A few additional creative touches were added, which I felt did not detract from the overall story, but gave fans of the book something additional to enjoy.The acting was excellent, especially from the kids, who lived up to their characters superbly. The sets and colour were fantastic and a good Dahl interpretation from Tim Burton. Johnny Depp was suitably eccentric as Willy Wonka, altogether different from what I had imagined, but nonetheless enjoyable.I did not like the original Gene Wilder movie as I felt it too far removed from the story and too Americanised.One aspect that I found disappointing was the Oompa Loompa songs. The music drowned out Dahl's lyrics, so the lessons we were supposed to be learning from the obnoxious kids were somewhat lost in a mumble.Possibly slightly long for the under 6's but perfect in my book. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Can't decide...,"I can't decide whether the people who write positive reviews about this movie simply have very low IQs (maybe 80 or so) or are just being paid heaps of money by somebody to advertise the movie on IMDb. I don't understand how someone of even moderate intelligence could like this movie. I'm not going to go into its many, many, MANY faults because everyone else has, but I am just intrigued at the fact that there are ANY positive reviews at all.To all those who thought he looked like Michael Jackson: I always thought so too. I'm glad I'm not the only one. It makes the Depp's portrayal of his character even creepier, given the allegations made about Jackson.It's a pity, really, because Depp is a fairly good actor, when he has good material. I wouldn't say I liked him in all of his movies, but he's not a bad actor. Just terribly, terribly WRONG for this movie.Mind you, I doubt it would have been any better if someone else had played Wonka, there are so many things wrong with this movie (kids, parents, Oompa-Loompas, music - WHERE are the good songs? - melting puppets, the script...if I wanted to submit myself to the torture of seeing the movie again I'm sure I could find more things, but I don't). I'm glad I didn't pay any money to see it.I've recently watched the original for the first time in probably about a decade, and I love it even more than I used to. Wilder's dead-pan ""No. Don't. Stop."" is delightful, along with ""I know a worse one"" in response to Veronica's ""Spitting is a dirty habit"" while picking her nose. He plays the eccentric recluse wonderfully. On the other hand, Depp's dismissal of the children when they offer to introduce themselves is annoying and pathetic. The whole reason Wonka distributed the golden tickets was to find a potential heir (though why, at his age? He doesn't even look forty!) - shouldn't he try to learn as much as possible about the children for that purpose? There, I did go into it a tiny bit - merely the tip of the iceberg, though. (Where's the psychedelic boat ride? Mind you, I don't think they could have pulled it off with the high-pitched voice they used for Wonka.) Honestly, how anyone could really like this is beyond me.Bewildered",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprisingly I liked it better than the original.,"I would say I do not know why, but I do, Johnny Depp does a very good job as Willy Wonka, even better than Gene Wilder who did a good job himself. The plot is actually better and does not take that bizarre dark twist here and there like the boat ride through hell, or the strange man trying to get the secret recipe. In fact, at the end of this one Willy does all he can to try to get Charlie to take over his family. I also like that you did not get left in the dark about what happened to all the other kids that happened to be on the tour. Another thing is Christopher Lee has a short, but very good stint in the film as Willy's dad. Funny how Depp played a movie with not one, but two horror screen legends during his career, Lee in this one and Vincent Price in Edward Scissorhands. The story has some of the same story elements here, but there are enough differences to really keep it fresh and interesting. You actually get to see Willy's time in the strange forest where he first gazed upon the ompa loomps and those guys are not as creepy this time around. So be prepared for a bit the same, but a lot of nice differences.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Disappointing,"Perhaps die-hard Burton and Depp fans will find this remake worth watching. I expected a family film, and found a dark interpretation of the Dahl children's book. Depp seems to have found his inspiration for Wonka in Michael Jackson and imitates him almost perfectly - down to the falsetto voice, glasses, and gloves. This Wonka does not like children or their parents and has bizarre flashbacks to his own unhappy childhood (not in the book). Some of the special effects are noteworthy but overall, this is not a happy film. The boy who plays Charlie is a bright spot in this dark film. If you are into goth, Burton, and maybe - art films? you may be satisfied. For me the spirit of the novel was violated and a lot of money was wasted on another remake.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

God Awful!,"What can I say about how incredibly bad this movie was?? Everything about it was just wrong and even mildly offensive...the ugly oompa loompa (as people have mentioned, one ugly little man computer generated into many), Johnny Depp's creepy and weird interpretation of Willy Wonka (I'm not obsessed with Michael Jackson but you can't deny that there are serious similarities including that femininely creepy giggle of his), Danny Elfman's really bad songs (which is weird because I normally love his composing), and the whole back story to Wonka's childhood--completely unnecessary; more character development for the kids could have been used in that time. But that's no surprise given the fact that the plot in general was all over the place and almost sloppy. To top it all off, the pace of this movie is slow, which is odd for a story that has so much going on.Basically, the whole movie just rubbed me the wrong way and by the time the credits rolled I was certain that I hated it.I have liked some of Tim Burton's previous work (as well as Johnny Depp's) and though I pretty much knew it wasn't going to live up to the original (and realized it would definitely be darker with Burton at the helm), I never imagined it would be this bad. It's dark and twisted (not in a good way) and just plain creepy with no real heart and charm. When people start making jokes about cannibalism in a ""kids movie"", I think it's pretty safe to say you should head for the exit.That being said, there were two good things about this movie...one was the boy who played Charlie...probably one of the few actors here that had any genuineness and charm at all....and the sets and special effects. Visually this movie is stunning in parts, but that certainly doesn't save it. Not by a long shot.

very disappointing,"Well i went,with high expectations i may add,2 watch this alleged blockbuster recently and came out of the cinema 2 hours later totally baffled as to why this film is supposed to level off and even exceed the original of Roald Dahls classic.There was so many aspects of the film that made for some very painful viewing.One of the first things that hit me was the constant interpretation,word for word,of the script used in the original film.For me that showed a distinct lack of imagination in order to try and expand on the old version and gave me the impression the whole film was,in some areas,lazy. I thought the acting was extremely corny,from practically all the cast members,for the duration of the picture.Beforehand i'd heard that the kid that played Charlie Bucket was a gifted young actor who played a terrific part.I however thought his efforts were shoddy and showed no signs of emotions or any excitement.Grandpa Joe's role as well was pathetically played and i found myself just getting more and more irritated by his presence as the film dragged on. Easily for me for one of the films worst moments,was when Veruca was being carried away to the rubbish chute by the squirrels and Wonka was calmly fumbling through his keys to open the tiny gate to enter the area.Veruca was just looking up and calmly shouting dad,dad oh dad.when u get a minute could u come over here and kindly pull these squirrels off me and stop them from throwing me down this deep hole.I must admit i couldn't stop laughing at that scene because it was just so BAD.That scene,for me,sums up the acting throughout the entire picture.I was expecting to warm to Johnny Depp playing the eccentric candy maker but i thought his role was at times bland and at times just plain weird.Tim Burton decided to add in some new ideas in this updated version,that wasn't included in either the old movie or Roald Dahls novel,that gave some background into Wonkas childhood, and Grandpa Joes incite into his old employment by the candy maker,both of which was presented in a number of flashbacks. I felt that neither added anything to the film and just assisted into making the film drag on longer than was necessary.Overall,this film will probably appeal to young children who are new to the tale of Willy Wonka who haven't seen the old version.But to anybody older that has learnt to appreciate the classic this will go down as one of the most overrated and disappointing sequels of the decade.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"This is a remake of the timeless 1970's film ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".  This slightly more distorted Tim Burton film is a great spin on the tale.","Many think this movie is completely distorted and mutated. I, however, feel exactly the opposite. This movie is great and can make anyone laugh. If you feel that it isn't that great, watch it again with a completely open mind. If you aren't looking for the ""mutations"", it is an awesome movie. The one thing i didn't like was that only one person was used for all of the oompa loompas. This movie is not only a comedy, but also goes into family issues. I personally like Charlie's family better in this movie than in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". His grandparents are hilarious and his parents are completely loving. I would recommend this to anyone who has a trace of a sense of humor.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't watch it.,"It's not good.I've seen most of Tim Burton's movies and I think I'm up at 22 of Johnny Depp's. But I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a movie before. The book (and the sequel, for that matter) are among some of my favorite children's books, and I couldn't wait to see the film adaptation, which I then, afterward, wished I hadn't.It seems like a poor excuse on Burton's behalf to make yet another Depp movie where he plays a freak, to be frank. Johnny Depp's Wonka was everything Dahl's Wonka *wasn't*, and the movie focuses more on this character than the Buckets. Wonka was initially just a supporting character, in my opinion.But it drags itself up to two stars for the cinematography or art direction or whatever made the movie beautiful to look at. But muting it while watching wouldn't hurt, it might even save you for the ruining of an old classic.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Tasty Remake!,"This remake of the classic tale about Charlie, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is just as dark, fun and twisted as the book (written by Roald Dahl) and the original film starring Gene Wilder (""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"").Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a great family fantasy film that is filled with delicious looking movie sets, vibrate costumes and great special effects. The acting is wonderful - each actor brought to life the strange characters from the colorfully written book.If you have not read the book by Roald Dahl then you should - you may appreciate the efforts put into this film. Also follow up the book with the second book ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"".I will have to rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
That's not Chocolate......It's a piece of crap!,"This was THE worst remake of a classic film I have ever seen. It was like some bad high school play. The original was a classic comedy that made us laugh, and hate those horrible little children. The children is this version, while they were obnoxious, they certainly weren't horrible enough to warrant the horrible things that happened to them. As far as Willy Wonka? Gene Wilders character was funny, eccentric, kooky and always kept surprising us. Jhonny Deeps Willy Wonka, was more like a creepy Michael Jackson kind of creep. Not funny, not eccentric, just a big freak that didn't care for children. The omba lompas weren't cute and curious, they were scary and ugly. The songs were boring and showed to excitement. This film was an insult to the original. It's should've been called Charlie and the crap factory.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
musical performance and the homage to other films,"This is one of the greatest film which were made by Tim Button even though this is not the best. I am sure that his best film is ""Batman"" or ""Edwood"". In fact, I thought that he became too old to make a post-modern,creative and imaginative film, but I was wrong. Tim Button and Jonney Depp encountered again since ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Edwood"". Jonney Depp was really well performed, and there was definitely good casting. I liked some of musical performance by a small guy and the homage to other films, especially, ""2001, A space odyssey"" (change from Monoris to Wonka chocolate ^^). That was really funny. Anyway, I am expecting Tim Button's next film.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's return to a classic film.,"In my review of ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001), I wrote that the film was Tim Burton's worst film up to date along with it being the worst remake I have ever seen in theaters where I'm going to admit that I didn't enjoy it very much. However, when I saw the trailer for this remake of the Gene Wilder classic ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" I was amazed to see how amazing it looked before buying the film on DVD in which I got my treats after Halloween in 2005.""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", going by the same title as the famous book, is about a poor boy name Charlie (Freddie Highmore) living in a shack house with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor) and four grandparents where after his father loses his job because a machine replaced him at the toothpaste factory, they must do things to make ends meet while on in the rest of the world, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) has a contest where five tickets are hidden around the world in five separate Wonka bars. The first ticket goes to a fat boy name Augustus in Switzerland; two tickets hit the United States where a karate/bubble gum lover gal and a video game punk addict win the tickets while in England the last two tickets go to a spoil English girl and Charlie.The five kids along with their adult guardian head to Wonka's factory where if you seen the original movie, there's no reason for me to continue with the summary.Tim Burton's ""Charlie"" is a gift from the director where he gives more an elaborate on Willy Wonka than just showing him as a goofy man. The performances are outstanding with Freddie Highmore portraying Charlie as a reasonable child who wants nothing more than to be with his family along with Johnny Depp off the Jack Sparrow as Wonka where even though its strange to see Depp playing such a quirky guy, there's nothing stopping the actor. The rest of the great cast include David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, AnnaSophia Robb as Violet, and Deep Roy not playing one, but many of the oompa loompas in this film where he even got paid a million dollar bonus.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny and original remake,"I enjoyed the remake of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Johnny Depp portrayed a more comical Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder, who was on the more phsycadelic side in the 1971 version. The special effects are of course more amazing as well. The oompa-loompa songs are new, and hysterical.When it was first announced that Johnny Depp would be playing Willy Wonka, I thought ""Oh, great. They are going to do a butcher job on that one."" But I was wrong. He was witty and sarcastic, and very perplexing. My friend and I laughed at his many jokes and sometimes complete misunderstanding of children.On an interesting note, we get to see more of Willy Wonka's childhood life, and why he grew up the way he did, shut in the chocolate factory all by himself. The ending also has a fresh side to it. Go see it, and you will see what I mean.I was pleased that they made this movie comical and enjoyable, without ruining Roald Dahl's original story. 8 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Another great movie from Mr. Burton!,"Yes,I liked it! I knew it after the first 15 minutes.It's because Burton knows how to make the audience,LOVE the personages in his movies.That's why I enjoy most of his work! The whole cast is fantastic.Johnny Depp makes a really great role! Actually he climbed up a few spots in my personal chart of favourite actors. The sets bring something more to the atmosphere and complete the overall picture,but Tim Burton have always been a visual director, who gives a pleasure to the eye(and the soul).Once again the vision is stunning,the humour-high quality(...and dark...),characters-from weird to nuts! The only thing I didn't like is that the most of the strong,emotional moments were at the beginning and make the final a little ""dry"".But that's nothing compare to the gooood stuff in the movie!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Horribly disappointing,"I was really excited about this movie considering that I grew up with the original and thought it was great, plus it had Johnny Depp in it (despite the fact that Tim Burton directed it and music was by Danny Elfman). However, from the opening scene where you see the chocolate being poured into molds and hear the creepy music (which doesn't fit the scene AT ALL), I knew it was going to be bad.The character of Willy Wonka was pathetic. His character was so weak that it was ridiculous to watch. At least in the original, Gene Wilder's character was written to command the attention and seem strange-but-not-someone-to-mess-with. In the new one, Willy Wonka is an absent minded child with no presence (and what's with the make-up?!). This version of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory also revealed too much about Willy Wonka's past, making him a pathetic man, rather than a mysterious candy maker.Further, all of the Oompa-loompa's being played by Deep Roy was disappointing and frankly, didn't make sense. The flashback scene to discovering the Oompa-loompas was completely unnecessary and added to the ridiculousness of the movie.I thought that the characters of the 5 children were also poor. Their characters were more like caricatures and the dialogue so contrived that it made me sick.I would still recommend watching this film if only to better appreciate the original.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie was fantastic!,"Charlie and the Chocolate factory is one of my favorite movies because of the liveliness and energy put into it. I know that Tim Burton's movies are creepy which in my opinion make them spectacular, well this movie had its own hint of weirdness which gave it the little extra spice that made it more enjoyable. Johnny Depp played the spectacular role of Willy Wonka, and did a perfect job of it. With the spectacular blend of music, characters, and creativity this movie is an enjoyment that is worth watching again and again.In the beginning of the movie, I was totally amazed and drawn into it with the images and music. After the beginning I was pumped and ready for the rest of it. I was amazed and excited throughout the movie with the surprises and excitement that are around every corner of Mr. Wonka's factory. It is an exciting movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat during each song, line, and pretty much the whole thing.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) **,"I have often said that Johnny Depp is a fine actor - one of the best today, actually. But his eerie interpretation of Willy Wonka made me uneasy, repulsed, and - had I been a small child - I'd imagine also pretty frightened as well. As some commentators have said, this is not a movie for little kids. For an intended wondrous, child-like fantasy of this type, where an eccentric larger-than-life candy maker invites five lucky golden ticket-winning children to visit his marvelous factory for one whole day, there were far too many horrific sights and a generally dark, gloomy weirdness to these proceedings. Totally joyless, they even made 'me' feel repelled rather than delighted.I went to the movie because I like Depp, and I'm a long-time fan of Christopher Lee (who plays Wonka's dentist daddy in flashback sequences). I also have a cheerful wife whose favorite childhood film of all time was the old Gene Wilder version of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and, to tell you the truth - she's like a little kid herself whenever she thinks of this story. So I wanted to go to this new Tim Burton movie partly because I knew I'd be tickled to see her so happy, as I anticipated she might be - and for what it's worth, she did come out liking this film as much as the older one, sure enough. At least THAT was some kind of solace for me.Right after seeing Burton's take on Charlie, I dug out my wife's copy of the 1971 Gene Wilder film. I watched it and have come to the conclusion that this new version is obviously done on more of a grand scale, and there were elements of it that worked better than before; but at the same time, the original had more charm and less grimness. Some of the changes I liked better would be: I think the boy playing Charlie is more sincere and pitiable in this 2005 edition, but the neighborhood that Burton has him living in looks like something out of Gotham City from his own BATMAN ('89). I know Charlie and his family are supposed to be impoverished, but their crooked little shack that looks like it's ready to collapse any second is taking it a bit too far. I also liked the new addition of the ""competitive"" girl and her striving mom who seem to have their eye on the ""prize"" as some sort of fierce competition instead of just trying to have a good old fun time.I liked most of the songs heard in the 1971 version better than the musical numbers in this one, and while the old feature could be pretty mean at times in its own right, it's child's play next to Burton's horrors, and Wilder still made for a more acceptable choice as the unusual candy showman than Depp does. If I were a child, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near Johnny's Willy. For those insisting that Burton's film is true to the Roald Dahl book, I haven't read it, so I don't know. But word on the street from those who have read it say that CHARLIE is not 100% faithful either. But get this -- while watching the 1971 movie, however, I was surprised to learn that the screenplay was written by Mr. Dahl himself -- so, whether completely in tune with the novel or not, I'm taking the Gene Wilder film to be straight from the original author's mouth (and pen). It had his seal of approval. ** out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What happened?,"OK, I love Tim Burton, I love Danny Elfman and I love Johnny Depp, however I did NOT love this movie. I don't know, it seemed so artificial and Hollywood and Willy Wonka was so dismal and odd in a way that I did not care for. I walked out of the movie theater feeling like I had drippy over sweetened goop all over me. YUCK. I think Burton is a little too full of himself these days... I heard Tim say that he did not like the original.. well I don't like his version...thoroughly disappointed.. :-( I guess we all have our own version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory from reading Roald Dahl's classic and mine is totally different than Burton's idea.

"Very Strange, Yet Very Good","This movie is nothing like the original. Sometimes this is a good thing. For Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it turned out to be a good thing. From the imaginative mind of Tim Burton, comes a better Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It is a darker, funnier version of Charlie and it is much better than the 1971 version.This version of the famous novel written by visionary author Roald Dahl, has many advantages over the original movie made back in 1971 and directed by Mel Stuart. First of all this version of the classic novel has better special effects. Which isn't a very big surprise considering special effects has come such a long way over the past 30 years. Another thing that is better about this one is there is less singing. Don't get me wrong though. I don't mind a little bit of singing in a movie but the original movie had way too much singing. Another thing better in this version than in the original is the acting. I found the acting in this one quite a bit better than in the original. Especially the child actors. I saw a big improvement in the child actors in this one.The verdict: This movie is very good. If you've seen the original, then you would love this version.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Johnny Depp never performed so sweet,"In this version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I must say that Tim Burton did an okay job in adapting it to a new generation, though, I believe Johnny Depp's acting as Willy Wonka, was a little too exaggerated, I mean he acted a little weird, especially at the ending, but I must say it was clever, and he looked cool, the hat and the hair, he looked Marilyn Manson a bit, and he was really inspired by his look too. And I liked the way he spoke also, especially when he was reading the cards, and when he keeps getting flashbacks, especially when he remembers his dad, I liked that part. And I must say the umpa lumpas(not sure if that's how it's spelled) were very cool, and I liked their songs. Overall a nice movie, but another remake, but it is not one of those bad ones, but still, this has to be one of the most promising movies out there, and this being a Tim Burton film, most of his films are amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
johnny depp?,"I was appalled by the selection of johnny depp for this movie. I thought he was disappointing to put it in the least way. He just didn't pull it off the way I was hopping he would.

Johnny depp is in like every movie he makes like ""Corpse Bride,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" and even other movies. How about some variation. I would have gone with jim carrey. He would have fit the part perfectly.Another problem I had was every oompah loombah was the same person it just looked so strange and kind of creepy. The songs were just plain sadistic and didn't compare to the original. They even pretended to be Kiss! Thats not oompah loombish if you ask me.Finally The kids were casted well but their parts were poorly written.

What up with the hate?,"OK, true this film does have a certified fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and currently a 6.9 on IMDb. However it seems that everyone on the internet hates this movie. Why? Because it isn't as good as the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It seems that that film was one that should not have been remade. Alright, let me make this clear, I LOVE Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it's a classic, I've loved it ever since I was a kid, and it still holds a special place in my heart. But it is a terrible adaptation.I didn't get around to reading the book till long after I saw the original movie. However when I did I found out that that film had changed a lot, and I mean a lot. This film, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, follows much more closely to the book. Charlie's father is still alive, the songs are more closely related to the books, they have squirrels and bad nuts, and more. Now true the film does have two big problems with it.One is that Gene Wilder was a much, much better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp. The other is the subplot involving Wonka's father, this was never in the book, and seems out of place since the book is supposed to be about Charlie. But overall the movie has the same message as the book, as the original film did too.I can't decide which adaptation I like more, Willy Wonka is more nostalgic for me, while Charlie is much closer to the book. I love them both, but I can't deny that this film is much much closer to the book.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Extremely Disappointing!!!!,"As soon as I heard Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was being remade with Johnny Depp as Wonka and directed by Tim Burton I knew this movie wasn't going to be an actual remake and I could not wait to see Burton's view of this film.The excitement I felt for this movie was so overwhelming that my friends knew better then to say no to seeing it with me. Being a huge fan of the original, I used to skip school to go with my mom to the video store she worked at and watch it repeatedly, I was expecting something a little closer to the original just darker. What I got was a lot of boredom and a lot of dissatisfaction. Some of the better parts of the original were nowhere to be found in this one. When we first saw an Oompa-Loompa I thought hey they look good, until I realized all Ooompa Loompas were played by the same man, Deep Roy.The scenery in the movie was quite nice, nothing great. The children's characters were well done and similar to the original so no disappointment there. The old people were lovable, you felt for Charlie's family and you also felt how much they wanted to give their little Charlie his dream of setting his foot into Mr. Wonka's Factory.I gave this movie three stars because of Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka, he plays it in his usual dark Johnny way so he didn't disappoint at all. Two of the stars though go to Charlie, Freddie Highmore, he has got to be the cutest, most believable child actors I've seen in a long time.Over all this movie sucked. I kept waiting for it to get better but I just got more bored and restless, I couldn't wait to see the credits. I would not recommend this movie to someone I hate and I'm going to be a little more hesitant about seeing anything remade by Tim Burton.

TOUR TO A MAGICAL MYSTERY WORLD,"I'm aware that certain unpleasant characters or even situations will appear in children's fantasy films. It, of course, refers to the villain. There have been several disputes over whether the film should have an age restriction and how the narrative is slow.PLOTLINE: A poor boy named Charlie Bucket wins a golden ticket at Wonka Bar and has the chance to see Willy Wonka build the world's first largest chocolate factory. There are four other kids throughout the world who have won golden tickets. Finally, the lucky winner will get the life-changing award.CHARACTERS: Very absorbing. Willy Wonka and the other golden ticket winners were my favourites. They've stayed so true to their characters that it's difficult to forget them if you see them in other series or movies.PRODUCTION: The massive sets, costumes, and most importantly, the ability to make everything appear genuine, win the hearts of the audience.MUSIC: The music here is largely geared toward tiny tunes sung by the chocolate plant workers. It's lighthearted, jiggly, and enjoyable. As we all know, soundtracks work best for these kind of flicks. It's the same situation here.MY OPINIONS:
If I'm not mistaken, this is the second Willy Wonka adaptation following the first, which starred Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. Many people have criticised this film for including Johnny Depp as the main character, but I believe he did an outstanding job in the part.Johnny Depp is witty, unusual, satirical character. The music here is largely geared toward tiny tunes sung by the chocolate plant workers. It's lighthearted, jiggly, and enjoyable. As we all know, soundtracks are ideal for films like this. The scenario is the same here. It's a typical Tim Burton picture in every way, with magnificent cinematography, bizarre humour, and unusual characters, all while maintaining loyal to the novel's essence. Roald Dahl would've been overjoyed.I want to read the book after seeing the movie to see whether it fits the aspects, but I trust Tim Burton. The entire cast also gives amazing performances. Johnny Depp delivers an odd, even terrifying performance. Willy Wonka as the satirical dark character and Charlie as exploring, innocent boy. The Grandparents are loving and eccentric, and the five other children and their parents are hilariously annoying.I haven't watched the first adaption yet, which was original but I'll give it a try and compare why some people have revolting reviews over such a good film. Tim Burton is known for making animated short fantasy movies, here his efforts won my heart.DIRECTOR: TIM BURTON
The cinematic adaptation of Roald Dahl's great novel of the same name. Mr. Burton was tasked with adapting this legendary novel into a film because he knows how to entertain an audience with a great story and superb cinematic flair. Mr. Burton is fortunate in that this is his fourth collaboration with the film's lead, Johnny Depp. Both the director and the celebrity are aware of what the other expects of them. The picture is a marvel of inventiveness, with a film that will appeal to both youngsters and adults. John August's screenplay complements both the novel and the picture. Mr. Burton has given the movie a sparkling look that makes it difficult to be distracted at any point. We were so involved in the movie that we didn't even realise it had ended, leaving us wanting more.RECOMMENDATION: I would recommend this movie more than one watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

To be honest, I prefer this over the first one. And I'm glad that Tim Burton created such a wonderful adaptation of the book. It may be too scary for young kids. It is pretty dark and scary.

"I wouldn't say that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory holds up as a standalone movie, let alone a remake.","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is Tim Burton's 2005 adaptation of the book with the same name. Just watching the opening credits, in all it's dated (even for 2005) graphical glory, you can see the names appear on the screen: Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp, music by Danny Elfman. We got the whole Burton crew here, boys, let's rumble.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, if you've seen the '70's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, is largely what you'd expect; the reclusive candy-man Willy Wonka has announced that he will open his mysterious factory to the lucky children who find the several Golden Tickets hidden within chocolate Wonka bars.Let me just start off this brief review to say that I wouldn't recommend this movie. I didn't enjoy the songs, the characters, or the stylistic decisions. I couldn't help but compare it to the original which I've seen countless times. The first portion of the movie is mediocre enough. It looks kinda like a Wes Anderson movie (he directed The Grand Budapest Hotel and Moonrise Kingdom) but more black and white checkerboard. But as soon as Johnny Depp comes into mix, everything takes a sharp downward turn.You know how sometimes, especially with action movies, the hero eclipses the rest of the movie? It doesn't really matter about what is going on because we get to see the hero kick butt. For example, at first, there was Terminator and then shortly thereafter, there were Schwarzenegger movies. It doesn't matter who Schwarzenegger is fighting as long as I'm along for the ride. This works with Tim Burton now that I think about it; there was Nightmare Before Christmas and now we have Tim Burton movies. It doesn't really matter what's going on as long as I get to see some whimsy.Now, with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, we spend a decent amount of time establishing this whimsical movie about a poor boy named Charlie but, once Depp is introduced, the focus shifts to him. If any movie should be called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory it should be this one.Depp's representation of Willy Wonka makes me really uncomfortable. He seems to be channeling Michael Jackson but, doesn't the whole pedophile thing color this in an odd way? I mean, Wonka is inviting half a dozen children into his mysterious wonderland for a contest for which only he knows the rules. Sure we get to see Wonka's backstory (to explain his childlike nature) but that juice ain't worth the squeeze. I was attempting a more candy oriented phrase, but that's all I could think of.I have pages of moleskine notebook notes about what I didn't like about this movie and why and how but, then, last night I re-watched Ratatouille. I'll go into more details about the plot but, for our purposes here, the main villain in Ratatouille is a food critic named Anton Ego.At one point he says, ""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so...""The above quote makes me wonder about movies like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. There are plenty of movies out there and even plenty of fun bad movies. I can even see having a fondness for bad movies (even if they aren't fun). That said, I'm recommend avoiding Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. If you want some whimsy, why not go to watch one of Tim Burton's older movies? And if you want some Chocolate Factory, I'd recommend the original film, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.Thanks for reading!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Brilliant, Magical Reimagining of a Classic","Tim Burton's 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a visually stunning, whimsical masterpiece that takes Roald Dahl's beloved story to new, enchanting heights. From the whimsical, over-the-top sets to the quirky, vibrant musical numbers, this adaptation is a visual feast. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is eccentric and unpredictable, bringing a fresh twist to the character while staying true to the spirit of the original book.The casting is perfect, with Freddie Highmore as Charlie offering an earnest, heartfelt performance that contrasts wonderfully with Depp's wild Wonka. The supporting cast, from the unforgettable Oompa Loompas to the spoiled kids, adds layers of charm and humor. The movie perfectly balances the dark humor and moral lessons that made the story timeless.The musical sequences are standout moments, with each song and dance bringing the story to life in a way that's both nostalgic and imaginative. Burton's unique visual style transforms the factory into a dreamlike, otherworldly place that feels both magical and slightly unsettling, perfectly capturing the surreal nature of the story.I love both the 1971 Gene Wilder version and this 2005 remake - each has its own magic and charm. Where the original is a bit more whimsical and surreal, Burton's version dives deeper into Willy Wonka's backstory, giving us a more layered, emotional portrayal of the character. The film's darker tone complements the story's themes about greed, vanity, and the importance of family, making it an unforgettable experience for all ages.This version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a true work of art. The captivating musical numbers, incredible production design, and brilliant cast make it a magical, heartwarming experience that will leave you smiling long after the credits roll. You simply can't go wrong with both the original and this 2005 remake-each one offers its own unique, delightful take on a timeless story.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Updated Charlie,"Some love this version of the story and some hate it, we think this adoption of the classical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory tale is well made and one of our favourites! We do always enjoy watching it.Johnny Depp sparkles with a solid performance and also the imagery of Tim Burton makes it easy to get sucked into the imaginary world of a grimm Chocolate factory owner and the world of poor Charlie and his family who just want to endulge in the bitter sweet taste of Mr. Wonkas chocolate creations.As a chocolate company ourselves we do like that an awareness is shown to the craft of making chocolate, we would have love to see more manual labor but Mr. Wonka is known for his machinery and Oompa Loompas.We totally recommed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tim Burton Ruined a Classic!,"First of all, let me just say that I am a fan of Tim Burton's films. I love the dark Gothic themes he usually sets his films. But his version of the classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory completely ruined it for me.Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of the worst remakes I have seen. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is just terrible! And the Oompa Loompa musical numbers are horrible! Also there is no need to add the Willa Wonka back-story into the movie. I did enjoy Freddie Highmore's performance as Charlie and the other children were also good. The set design is great, the only thing Burton did get right.Overall, this is the worse of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, both of whose work I normally enjoy. This film is a major disappointment.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Disappointing movie,"Tim Burton is my least favourite director. I have never been a fan of him, and I never will, but hey-that's just me. In my vision, all the man does is remind you that you're watching a ""Burton"" movie, rather then just a movie, and for Charlie & The Chocolate Factory; it's excacly that. I remember when I was younger, I loved Gene Wilder's Wonka. It's a classic. the best thing about it was the oompa loompas. Anyways, Looking at the previews I knew this flick wasn't going to be good, but decided to watch it anyway--for my love for the 70's version. How right I was. I felt embarrassed watching this flick. I used to love listening to the oompa loompas sing after one of those spoiled brat kids gets killed, or whatever the heck happens to them. In Burton's version when he made his oompa's (Or should I say Oompa) sing I said ""Do I really have to listen to this crap 4 more times?"". I didn't think Depp put up that good of a performance in this movie, he looks like a Creepy Michael Jackson type character who pauses to much in the film while talking with a little girls voice. It kept having annoying visions of him as a child, which was completely pointless. I give this movie a 1-10. But you know, that's just my opinion on this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
CATCF Review,"I had first seen this movie when I was just a girl. I remembered how much I loved the movie aesthetic, and the storyline. Yes it was childish and funny, but it was enjoyable in all types of ways. The movie stayed with me throughout my life, junior high, high school. Etc. I would never forget how good the book was after I decided to read it as well. It's great for all ages of course. Kids or adults. The message that it portrays is hidden, but prominent in child development.On occasion, I have the guilty pleasure of watching it on the weekends. The quality of the film is exceptional, and the actors represent a character that can be felt on a personal level. With this movie, I feel like I could watch it repeatedly, and never get bored. However it doesn't just give a satisfying performance. It touches on the problems with raising the ¨perfect¨ child, and acceptance. Scenes in the move for instance show the problems of not being raised properly, or an overarching theme of forgiveness. With Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, it gives a splendid look into the life of a boy thriving off being the balance in a group of the flawed.This whimsical film begins with an vision of just how complex the factory is. The process that sends chocolate to cities worldwide is fascinating just as it is mysterious. It then focuses on the main character of the movie, Charlie Bucket, and his family. A quest that is sent by Willy Wonka has people from all around the world looking for a ¨golden ticket¨"" in their candy bars. His yearn for the last golden ticket sent him on a fateful trip to the candy store. Children that discovered the golden tickets popped up fast. From spoiled to unhealthy, the unlikely group of foul children explored the factory, and took away valuable lesson they'd surely remember.The film touches on how to raise a perfect child. Not unhealthy, spoiled etc. But like Charlie, possess characteristics of a well maintained kid. Near the beginning of the movie, we see the kids who discovered the golden tickets in their Wonka bars. The first kid to find the golden ticket was Augustus Gloop. A laughable line exclaimed from Mrs. Gloop read, ¨We knew Augustus would find the golden ticket. He eats so many candy bars a day that it was not possible for him not to find one!¨ He is clearly not healthy, and is indulging in very bad habits at such an early age. The next kid to ¨find¨ a golden ticket is Veruca Salt. Spoiled by her parents, she gets just about anything she wants. The rich father of Veruca told reporters: ¨soon as my little Veruca told me she had to have one of these golden tickets, I started buying up all the Wonka bars I could lay my hands on.¨ Not only was she just handed a ticket that wasn't even earned, but what she says after receiving the ticket is that she ¨wants another pony.¨ Next in line, headlines blast that Ms Violet Beauregarde has found the 3rd golden ticket. A bratty chewing-gum obsessed bragger is sure to stun the press with her trophies. She states that she is gonna get the special prize ¨because i'm a winner.¨ Not caring about the other kids, she boasts that her cocky attitude will earn her the first place spot. Last but not least, the 4th kid to discover a golden ticket is Mike Teavee (Ironic). Screaming and gunshots heard in the background indicated that this was another prime example of a tech obsessed youngin. When asked how he felt about the taste of the chocolate bar he replied, ¨I dunno, I hate chocolate. Now buzz off, okay? The Sopranos is starting.¨ Good thing he is touring a chocolate factory.
Seeing the lineup of kids touring the factory, it seems as if there isn't one good thing in any of them. Bratty, spoiled, unhealthy,and tech obsessed behavior, are factors of bad parenting that can teach many kids and parents a lesson. It appears that they need the perfect kid to balance out the attitudes.Another theme hidden beneath the creative storyline is forgiveness. Nearing the final clips of the film, Willy Wonka is conflicted. He recalls to when he was a kid, and was basically abandoned by his father. His father was a dentist that would hammer Willy about consuming any type of sugary food, including chocolate. Willy decided for himself that he would leave in protest, but returned to find nothing. Upon finding where his father had resided, he decided to pay him a visit. When Wilbur (Willy´s father) had first encountered his son, he simply thought that it was a regular visit. Wilbur muttered, ¨Heavens, I haven't seen bicuspids like these since... since.. Willy?¨ They hugged awkwardly afterwards, which they hadn't done in presumably a long time. Willy had been dreading to go visit his father for fear of his reaction, however they hugged as if nothing ever happened all those years ago. This teaches any age that its okay to be scared of trying to mend broken relationships, but it can be reliving to turn the new leaf. Family issues may be solved over time, and it will ultimately be a regret of not fixing dead weight placed upon someone's shoulders.When I go back and watch this movie, I still get the same happy feeling afterwards, as I did when I was a kid. I don't think parents will rely on a children's movie to inform them on how to parent, but it gives an image of how it should not be done. I can say with certainty that this is still one of my top 5 favorite movies. Not only does it convey inspiring themes, but it just sticks with you. I have seen several movies that made me laugh, and then want to cry, but this movie makes you feel like you are in the shoes of a boy who truly wants nothing more than for love to spread through his family and community.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My opinion,"Although I do not find this movie as good as the original, I do love the twist Tim Burton has done to this classic story. The more out there thinking that Depp has brought to Willy Wonka makes his performance unforgettable. Some will say this movie is a waste of money and may have not liked it, but if you take into account the age group this movie is aimed at it has the great balance of humor, most young teenagers will understand.This movie has a great quirkiness that gives it a charm and has been harshly evaluated by a lot of people.

"It's just a good reboot, simple as that!","Based on Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory starring the late Gene Wilder, this film is arguably as inventive as the original and a unique experience that brings so much to the table .Burton's version of Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) is a bizzare, yet extremely likable take on the classic character with new storytelling elements added in to give more depth to Wonka than ever before.As much as I personally love the original, I find myself coming back to the reboot just as much, almost as if the film is a missing piece to the puzzle and to be honest, you can't say that about most films of this nature, but Charlie And The Chocolate Factory lives up to the source material unlike most films that attempt to alter a classic formula.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

forgetful musically and creepy chocolate maker,"this is a remake, which is based on a child's novel. I've tried to give this movie higher rating, but it's impossible. Lets get this over quick, unlike this revamp of a classic ""no need to update"" film, which drags on and on and on. First, Johnnie Depp drops the ball for possibly his first time. He comes off scary or creepy, How many people hint to Micheal Jacksonian? pale white, creepy demeanor and aimless babblings? This Wonka is ""to"" alienated and removed from reality, unlike the very wise, eccentric, sarcastic and yet confidently and upbeat as well as resilient Mr. Wonka in the book and 1974 classic film, this Wonka is one slip away from suicide watch or a protection order to stay 1,000 feet away! that right there ruins the entire premise. No matter how many cynical teens or adults (few parents over 30) like this, it was made to be a children's film. an eccentric and wry confectionery King, who loves sweets should never be played so near scary and creepy and weird. eccentric and weirdo are not the same. Also all the kids and parents chosen are bland, forced and uninteresting in there characterizations. The songs are not hum-able, does anyone even mumble to themselves any of the songs throughout this lame flash and shock film? notice how it's rating keep slipping over the 7 years? great film maintain and increase. soon my 2 will be the average,..watch the original, don't waste you time on this big money and hype offering.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I love this move from start to end and Johnny Depp portrays the role of Willy winks amazingly in his own quirky way. Since it's based on a children's book, there are not much variations of the side characters as they are portrayed as 100% bad or 100% good with no grey area what so ever.

Delicious Adventure,"The eccentric manufacturer of chocolates and candies Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) promotes a tour through his chocolate factory, the greatest in the world, through five golden tickets hidden in the bars of chocolate.

Tim Burton changes his usual morbid scenarios to very bright ones, and keeps the usual very weird character, magnificently performed by the awesome Johnny Depp. This movie is highly indicated for the whole family and it is an excellent entertainment. Unfortunately I have not had the chance to watch the original 1971 ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" to make a comparison, but this remake is really a great movie.

Heavy chocolate.,"A lot of press has been made of this version ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" being more faithful to Roald Dahl's story than the 1971 ""Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory"". After having seen both, and having read the novel to my kids for years, I have to say that this movie has given me a greater appreciation for Gene Wilder's nuanced performance in the earlier movie, as well as director Mel Stuart's shrewd choices.It's true, the new picture's director, Tim Burton, had the budget to make a more accurate film. It is more accurate in it's details. And it's clear that Burton has a real affection for the story. But, the details do not make for a whole that has the impact of either the book or the earlier movie.The reasons involve Mr. Burtons bewildering deviations from this ""more faithful"" rendering. For one, Mr. Burton feels compelled to add back-story explaining why Willy Wonka is the way he is, and so he and/or the scriptwriter, John August, have added a pointless subplot involving Wonka's father.Secondly, his take, or maybe Johnny Depp's take, on the character of Willy Wonka is just plain bad. Willy Wonka, as originally written by Dahl was a spritely little man, an eccentric driven by humor, and a love of chocolate and children. He was light. He had to be light to balance out the mean-spirited nastiness of the children. Not this Willy Wonka. This guy is heavy. He doesn't care about the kids, and he doesn't seem to care about chocolate as much as be obsessed by it. His eccentricity is driven by a self-absorbed humorless desire to escape his dysfunctional relationship with his father. (Like Spielberg in ""Hook"", Burton has bent a classic story to deal with his ""Father"" issues. Is this a Hollywood thing?)Even the Oompa Loompas are heavy. In the book, they are characterized by their humor, by their joy. They laugh a lot, and their songs come from their joy. Well, there's no joy here. These guys are serious. Serious when they work, serious when they dance, serious when they sing. Serious when they psychoanalyze Mr. Wonka.Yes, the details here are more loyal, more faithful to the original story. But if you want to see a Willy Wonka more as Roald Dahl intended, and a story whose details may be less perfect, but whose broad strokes are, unlike this movie, right on target, go down to you local video store and rent the 1971 film.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Tim Burton is a magician and a movie whiz!,"This version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" intrigued me the first time I heard about it, with Tim Burton at the helm and Johnny Depp as Wonka. It also made me go back and reread the beloved book by Roald Dahl, and then, as I thought about Depp as Wonka, I was a slight bit worried about it. I didn't want Depp's Wonka to be *too* weird.However, the movie is excellent, and though Johnny Depp does of course portray Wonka as quite weird, it's perfect, and has hilarious results. Freddie Highmore as Charlie is also just right: caring, loyal, imaginative, and unselfish to a high degree. There was hardly a moment when I found myself comparing this film to the Gene Wilder version, and when I did compare the two, it was never unfavorably, just remarking on how different the two versions are. Danny Elfman's score is also perfect, with the Oompa-Loompas' songs and the main title theme.I think Tim Burton was absolutely correct in stating that his version of ""Chocolate Factory"" is a whole different take than Gene Wilder's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"": it's not a remake, it's actually truer to the book. (Not saying that either version is better than the other.) I think kids will love the wondrous scenery of the factory and the brattiness of the other four kids. But if you're not a kid, you can still wholeheartedly enjoy this funny, fantastic, and totally entertaining movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

If you haven't seen it yet..save your money... and rent it when it comes out on DVD. I just want to say it was sooooooooo baaaaaaaaaaad. Johnny Depp was awful as Mr. Wonka and none of other characters had any appeal..maybe I would give a few points to Charlie but thats about it.

A remake that is worthy.,"The Wizard of Oz, Charolette's Web, Mary Poppins, and of course Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory were my favorites as a kid. I remember popping popcorn and spreading my sleeping bag out on the floor directly in front of the television to be sure I had a front row seat for the very rare occurrence of a network special presentation for one of these films. Gene Wilder will always be The Candyman that made the world taste good, and I still hear his voice to this day singing those exact words. Mr. Wilder, you've brought joy and laughter to millions throughout your career, and as far as Hollywood Legends go, you truly are the Everlasting Gobstopper.Now about this time last year when word of the remake started to circulate the headlines I thought what is happening to Hollywood. You can't just simply remake such a beloved classic. Then word reached my ears that Tim Burton was set to direct and Johnny Depp to star as Mr. Wonka. I then saw hope, for they had chosen an actor I believe could pull off anything, and Johnny Depp delivers a fantastic performance.The story, with slight alterations at the end, remains practically unchanged. Even the sets and wardrobe hadn't appeared to have strayed too far, however there seemed to be a darker feel or perhaps a sinister undertone to the overall film and specifically the character of Wonka. I'm guessing Director Tim Burton may have put some personal touches on the film that are unique to his dark, but intriguing style. And with the help of such a talented actor, that he obliviously favors, it's really no surprise the end result would dazzle the audience. Depp delivers us a more eccentric and sarcastic Candyman, where Wilder was more enthusiastic, humorous, and witty. Either way, all the pieces fit and a new generation will get to enjoy a wonderfully surreal Chocolate Factory.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Great Summer Hit!,I was presently surprised with this film as I had told it was too dark for kids. My 7 yr old and I loved this movie! Johnny Depp at his best! I recommend this flick to all at least 7 and above. A great story about selfishness and about family. Charlie is committed to helping his family no matter what the sacrifice to his own wishes. His parents and grandparents are also willing to sacrifice their comfort so that Charlie will have the opportunity to live out his dream. Charlie is the only kid to survive the culling process because of his innocence and lack of vice. This movie is better than the original. The special effects are phenomenal.

But Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka made this movie practically unwatchable. Every scene that he was in, I couldn't wait end. Gene Wilder was an odd, witty, likable eccentric, Mr. Depp on the other hand was distant, pretentious and uncomfortable to watch.

Charlie Bucket and Veruca Salt on the other hand were very fun to watch, too bad their characters couldn't save this sour remake.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Freddie Highmore is adorable and did a great job playing Charlie. As a Depp fan I expected a lot from Johnny and as usual I was not disappointed. I heard a couple of critics describe his role in this movie as ""too dark,"" but the only thing I can figure is they must have been wearing sunglasses in the theater because he was funny and a pleasure to watch.

Semi sweet and rather nutty....NOT A REMAKE,"First I will say that I have been awaiting this film eagerly for a long long time. I have always thought that Willy Wonka was one of literature's best characters. He's a genius, he's crazy, and he's oh so intriguing. I love the book as well as the 1971 classic film. However it should be known that the book and '71 film were written by the same Roald Dahl and are obviously intended to be different from one another. This film IS NOT a remake but in fact an adaption of the novel as imagined by Tim Burton. Those who know Burton's works can probably guess that this film is just as awe inspiring as a triple shot of LSD. Burton achieves a gorgeous and stylized treat that will keep your eyes glued to the screen even if you hate the movie. As for staying true to the story they stick to the book with surprising accuracy except for several key parts. Willy Wonka as portrayed by Johnny Depp is an eccentric and slightly frightening candy maker who is haunted by an unhappy childhood as shown in a series of flash-backs. These scenes add significant elements to the film that fleshes out Wonka more than ever and alters the ending slightly. The children are all portrayed by talented actors and actresses who do all but add horns and wings to the children to make them as detestable as possible, making their demises satisfying rather than disturbing. A fresh new twist on the oompa looma chants deviates from the well known chants of the '71 film but uses lyrics found in the book. I found Charlie Bucket portrayed by Freddie Highmore to be far less irritating than Peter Ostrum's portrayal of the boy in 71. As for Mr. Willy Wonka. He is far more upbeat with a much wilder disposition and wit with a much more fleshed out character who seems to have been affected by the 20 years of isolation through his lack of social graces and crazy nature. It's wild, fun, and pretty. Depp is incomparable and Burton's vision is brilliant. All of this topped off with much more humor and a superb score make this the family movie of the year. As for which film is better, they cannot be compared they are two uniquely different but equally superb films. Those who enjoy a light musical and a more laid back film should stick to the 1971 version. Those with a love for the odd or who want a more faithful adaption should see this one. Everyone should see this one if for no other reason than it's beauty. I LOVE WILLY WONKA!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst Ever,"I can honestly say that Johnny Depp sucked as Willy Wonka.

I left the theater less than 45 minutes into the film...that's how bad it was!The Oompa Loompa's were cloned images of the same individual and danced around to disco, rap, and terrible contemporary music.

Unsatisfying re-imagining of the Willy Wonka chocolate empire...,"1st watched 5/27/2023 - (Dir-Tim Burton):
Unsatisfying re-imagining of the Willy Wonka chocolate empire by Tim Burton and crew. Being a big fan of the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", I was hoping I wouldn't compare this too much and give it a chance, but unfortunately I tended to do this and it fell flat as far as pure entertainment value compared to that one. Depp wasn't as bad as Willy, the chocolate mizer, as he came across in short bursts of trailers, spots etc... and the story shared more about him and his empire, which was interesting. I felt the minor characters were pretty flat compared to the original. Freddie Highmore was good as Charlie, but Grandpa and the kids in the factory left a lot to be desired. The ending varied and tried to tug at our heartstrings, but at this point in time there was no build-up to care for Wonka for any real reason. I'm glad I viewed this version, and it has spurred me into wanting to read the original book to compare the differences - but as a film it left a lot to be desired. This is not one of the best Depp/Burton collaborations, in my opinion.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You never think you're gonna like the remake more.....,"For everyone who loves Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) and is worried that seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) will be a waste of time, I would like to offer the following suggestion: You Could Not Be More Wrong!! I have been excited about the prospect of a new version of an old favorite for some time now, but still entered the theater with some skepticism. I left with nothing but a smile and wishing I had not waited until the very last show of the day so that I could have gone right back in and watched it again. This film further convinces me that Depp and Burton are somehow matched on a mystic or cosmic level. No two other people could have pulled off what they did. So much more of the original book was explored and such wonderful surprises pop out around every corner. From the troublesome children to the oompa-loompas you will recognize characters but in a way you've never seen them. Some scenes are as enchanting as ever (like the first room they enter) and others are brand new and utterly fantastic.

Johnny Depp was a disaster, trying to re-invent the legendary magician as a Michael Jackson looking - Rosie O'donell baby talk speaking character that does not work. The original, played by Gene Wilder was hilarious. I expected to get some comic relief out of the new remake of the children's classic. Sadly, this remake will stiff you, without a laugh and leave you wondering what the makers of this poor synopsis were even thinking. Computer graphics do not a classic make.

I like the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but this movie just took it to another level for me and I will definitely buy the movie as soon as it hits stores! I am so pleased that Tim Burton brought this movie back. He has an excellent and creative mind and Johnny Depp is one of the best versatile actors I admire. I think each character played their part great in similarity to the original. I would recommend this movie to anyone with or without kids. It is a classic that has show to be an all time favorite to all types of viewers, young and old.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
