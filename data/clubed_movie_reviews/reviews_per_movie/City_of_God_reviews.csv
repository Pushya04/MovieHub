Stunning - in every sense of the word,"Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.Based on true events and characters who live in the overlooked and poverty stricken slums in the shadows of Rio de Janiero, where life expectancy doesn't reach the 30's and drug dealers are kings.The tale of the City of God, and its myriad of characters is told by Rocket, a young man who struggles to make something of his life, other than to wind up another victim of drugs or gang wars.Not only are the characters in City of God absolutely fascinating, and also very endearing, but also convincingly acted by groups of young and unknown actors. The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Goodfellas"", but with its own unique flavour to it.The City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""One of the best films you'll ever see!""--Roger Ebert, does it live up to the hype?","The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence.The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children.The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all.10/10, A+Would also recommend: Bus 174 and Carandiru",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Brazilian masterwork,"Such an amazing film that deserves the accolades and acclaimed hype it's garnered. One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.Perhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be ""entertained"". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.The story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly.Overall, a masterwork. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best unseen foreign films,"I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.The characters really make this movie come alive with each of their compelling personalities shining though in the backdrop of oppressive conditions and constant violence. One thing which clearly comes to mind is ""Lil' Dice's"" ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.The City of God is a world you don't want to visit, it won't be featured on a post card, and it's said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it's violent temptation. More importantly, it's about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.This movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it's worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.You see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cidade De Deus,"The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.  The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket.  The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component.  The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons.  The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation.  And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here.  The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.Martin Scorsese seems to have a heavy influence on the direction of this picture, with many moments looking familiar to fans of the legendary American filmmaker.  Close ups, sweeping scene shots, freeze-and-zoom shots, and a frenzied handheld approach are all trademarks that will be recognisably traceable to Scorsese, having been used throughout his career. Many shots remind the viewer of Scorsese's narrative dialogue-camera relationship in Goodfellas, in which the camera was used to brilliant effect to highlight the main points in the script.  This technique is used heavily in the first twenty minutes of Cidade De Deus, with the freeze frame trick being used to introduce the story's main characters alongside the dialogue of narrator, Rocket.Throughout the film one cannot help but watch a scene and think, 'I've seen that in Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or Casino', and this may make some look less favourably on the film's direction.  However, it is not fair to consider this 'a Brazilian Goodfellas', as one critic has observed.  The story has parallels - the underlying ideas of gangsters, drugs and violence -, the direction is similar, and the story is told with narration, much like Ray Liotta's role in Scorsese's epic.  But to regard this film in terms of what styles it repeats or nods it's hat to, is to be very ignorant. Fernando Meirelles,  has done a wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles, and bringing them up to date with flashy and sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing.  Look only to the leaving-party scene in which strobe lighting is used to extraordinary effect, almost suffocating the story below a bombardment on the visual senses.  Think of a crossover between the visual energy of the Matrix and the violence of the club scene in Bad Boys.Cidade De Deus is much more than a directorial assault on the senses.  As Raul Walsh said if you don't have a story you have nothing, and many flashy Hollywood films have fallen short in using 'ultra-modern' direction to disguise the fact that no substantial story exists underneath.  Cidade De Deus is most brilliant in that it combines directorial and editorial brilliance with a story that is almost second to none in recent times. Only the true greats manage to cater to these two needs of cinema, and this is one that does.  The direction is amazing, but not to disguise the story flaws, and the story is brilliant, but does not overwhelm directorial originality.  But simply, Cidade De Deus is a perfect film for avid fans of cinematography, and those just in search of two hours of a bloody good story.I cannot decide yet if I would consider this better than Amores Perros, but it is certainly not inferior.  The at-the-same-time stylish and brutal visuals of Amores Perros are replaced by a grittier, more hands on approach to the subject.  Whilst in Amores Perros the characters took precedent, in Cidade De Deus the location is as big a character as those who live there. As a result we get a much greater feeling of the environment in which the characters exist, and so it is perhaps easier to empathise, and/or sympathise with them.  As the official press synopsis says, Cidade De Deus is a character, but is a place not a person.  Amores Perros triumphs in creating relationships between the audience and the characters, as it concentrates for a long time on relatively few people, each of whom we grow to know and ultimately care about, which is important for the emotional impact of the film.  Cidade De Deus deals with dozens, even hundreds, of characters, and so it is only a minority that we become attached to.  This means that while the film leaves a lasting impact we are not left with the same inquisitiveness about the future for the characters that we meet in Amores Perros.  Both films leave open ends, but Cidade De Deus feels closed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is a matter for personal choice.Cidade De Deus is essential viewing, and is cinema at its most brilliant. It will of course feel the wrath of critics who will dwell on the almost unimaginably high body count, but there are always those who will reject violence in the movies.  In fact the violence in Cidade De Deus, even the apocalyptic ending, is not as raw and bloody as many will expect.  Blood spilling is a rare sight, and the violence rests mostly, but not always, on choreography rather than in your face bloodshed.  The result is violence, but it is often so artistic that it looks beautiful rather than deterring. Like Scorsese's Taxi Driver the violence is abhorrent, but admirable from a cinematic perspective.In short, this is a superb achievement, and is easily one of the best films of the year, and of the decade so far.  Like it's predecessors, this is the latest film to come out of South America that indicates the emergence of major new talent in filmmaking.  Hollywood beware.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Raw and cult film,I agree with the other positive reviews here. I just saw this again after 15 years - still far exceeds anything made today when it comes to struggles of troubled youth in urban slums plagued by drugs and violence. So raw. So shocking to the system. Highly recommended!,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of God was Incredible,"I knew nothing of this film before I saw it by chance in a rare Pub open screening, but boy was I glad I got the chance to take a look. I was riveted all night - I completely ignored my friends! I thought it was an awesome re-enactment of a true story - powerful, moving, raw, real - and even funny in parts.

The Godfather of Rio,"Li'l Zé and his gang is having fun chasing a runaway chicken in a Rio favela called the Cidade de Deus ""City of God"". The chicken comes to Rocket with his camera. Then flashbacks to the 60s tell the story of Rocket who becomes the photographer of his friends. Li'l Zé and his best friend Benny grow up to be the crime boss of the city. There's Carrot who is a criminal leader tolerated by Benny and there's Knockout Ned who turned away from crime.It is truly a new Godfather. It is the harsh brutality of the slums. It's the randomness of the world. It beats with a human heart. It's a little messy. It's visceral. The kids are played by kids. The criminals are remorseless. The amateur actors are authentic. The cinematography is terrific. The location can't get more real. It is a new crime masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Shocking, Stylish & Brutal Story","Wow, this is one of those different movies - meaning not run-of-mill by any means - and one of those which isn't pleasant to watch but one you might find yourself mesmerized by it.This also is one of those ""based on a true story"" films which makes it even more shocking, if its mostly true. The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs. Overall, a very tough but fascinating film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
an exillerating ride through the life of gangsters,"I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvard intellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It even forces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs in the world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of my time and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Excellent and violent film based on real events,"The movie deals about children and adolescent factions in the impoverished Favelas , Rio Janeiro , for 1960 and 1970 years . And it centers upon a teen who tries to leave that world by means of the photography . The final confrontation among the motley gangs for Favelas control is pretty violent and bloody .In the motion picture there are shocks , emotion , sex , violence and a little bit of social criticism . Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and that's why it isn't boring but it results to be enjoyable . The picture is similar other film from 1981 : ¨Pixote¨ (Hector Babenco) that was likeness in atmosphere and showing the delinquent vagrants . It's a thought-provoking and clever studio of juvenile paupers and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro city , where teens and children become into burglars and assassins . The movie was not actually shot in Cidade De Deus slum as it was too dangerous ; it was shot in a neighbouring , less dangerous área . Principal actors' interpretation is outstanding , in spite of most are newcomers . All of the amateur actors were recruited from Favelas (slums) in Rio de Janeiro, and a couple of them actually lived in the Cidade de Deus (City of God) itself . Fernando Mereilles direction is awesome and stylish , he even has been hired by Hollywood to make lavish films . The motion picture had an Oscar nomination and obtained a lot of success at box office around the world . The movie is produced by Walter Salles , the best director and production manager from Brazil .The film is rated ¨R¨ for crude murders and sex and isn't apt for boys , only for old people (+18) , neither squeamish. The flick will appeal to social drama and thoughtful films lovers . Rating: 7/10. Well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of my top 10,"I have made an effort to watch all the movies in IMDb's top 100 rated list. As of now, I'm looking for a place where the DVD for Sunset Blvd. is (currently at #30). But this movie is one of the movies I've seen that's on the list. And I find it an amazing film (currently #5 on my top 10 list). What I enjoy about this film is the visual look of the film, but also the way the director puts you in the story. At the end of the film you have become friends with just about everyone in the film, even though some of the characters are very despicable people. The violence hits you in the chest like a load of bricks sometimes, especially when you recognize that many of the kids involved in the violence are right around 10 or 11, but you also realize that this reflects the culture of the slum these kids live in.Gangster films always seem to make for good dramas (e.g. the Godfather, Goodfellas), where the culture of evil almost always triumphs as the dominant character. This film is no different, but it shows the life of children in places where bribery and corruption reigns supreme. It also shows the bravery of many of these people when even the government won't stick up for them.If you're thinking of starting to watch some foreign language films, this is a good place to start. It is a classic IMO among films made in languages besides English. I did find that the subtitles in this film were done rather poorly (they displayed on my DVD player at the wrong times and it took a few plays to figure out who was saying what.) But I think the film itself is a truly great film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Down and dirty,"This movie does not take any prisoners. Although I have not been into any ""favella"" (= ghetto) and I don't really know if the movie depicts it realistically, I do know that it is a gripping story. About kids growing up in a violent environment. Not that this movie is an action movie. It's a drama, with action scenes in it.The style and the look remind you a little bit of a documentary, just to make things scarier/real. It fully achieves it's goal. The ""actors"" (the director mostly used people who really live or lived in Brazilian ghetto) are superb too. And since the story is well written and told, there is nothing more you could wish for. Of course if watch it in it's original version and don't speak Portuguese, than you will have to read the subtitles ... but it's more than worth it (and I personally prefer it that way)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Best Film Ever Made,"Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, ""The Godfather"" reigns supreme as number one, while ""City of God,"" or more appropriately, ""Cidade de Deus,"" is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to ""Crash."" They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, ""City of God"" is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and ""The Godfather"" has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference).Now, ""City of God."" What a rush! Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece is a film to behold. Many critics have described films as ""explosive"" for the punch they pack, and/or the unflinching reality of the subject matter. But there has been no film I have ever seen that can match ""City of God"" for energy. It has so much energy that instead of unfolding, it throws itself at you all at once, leaving everything else to be done afterwards. The actors don't act; they don't have time. They just...are. Everything is done to such an extreme, it's surprising that Meirelles manages to make none of it sensationalistic or exploitative.Some people will tell you that this film is the chronicle of two drug lords. While there is some truth in that, the plot, if one could call it that, is better described as the chronicle of the ""City of God"" itself. Characters float in and out, with the ""out"" part frequently involving a bang (or more likely, a series of them). The characters are given background only if and when they are needed.Like I said, there's really no time to develop subtly-nuanced performances. The film moves with such breakneck energy that to do so would only slow it down. There are only a few characters that really matter. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is our window into the hellish slums. The result isn't voyeuristic, instead Rocket is more like a guide (albeit with only the narration addressing the audience). He's a normal teen, with interests in girls (particularly Angelica (Alice Braga)), sex, and aspirations to be a photographer. But his main goal is simply to survive each day. Also of note is Li' Ze, who we see growing up with a taste for violence as a kid (kids shoot and kill people just as frequently, if not more so, than adults). His increasingly drug-addled brain and his ambition makes him more frightening by the minute. The only one who keeps him grounded and (relatively) under control is Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), the ""coolest hood in the City of God."" There's some truth in that statement, as spoken by Rocket. He's the shed of brightness in this hellish city (though he's no goody-two-shoes). Finally, there is Lil Ze's rival, Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who has the film's most notable character changes.But this is Fernando Meirelles movie. He throws in everything he can think of, and then some. References to Tarantino are abound, and there are probably more, but Meirelles takes the energy level up so high that there's no room for even a ""please"" or ""thank you."" Desaturated colors. A constantly moving camera. Loud noises. An upbeat soundtrack (which is the film's saving grace from becoming too grim). It's all here.People may not agree with me that this is the best film ever made, and that's okay. I respect that. But make no mistake, it's an unforgettable 130 minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's a masterpiece.,"A no holds barred look at life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, a place that consumes many, but now and then, people escape and make good.It is an outstanding piece of cinema, I was told to watch it, that I would enjoy it, it absolutely blew me away.I would argue this film isn't for everyone, it's not a thriller of drama as such, it's too real for that, instead it's a detailed look into real life. It's not casual viewing, you need to concentrate, so ensure you have two peaceful hours to absorb it.Relentless, bleak, at times it's quite upsetting, if you're sensitive, this will leave a mark on you, several of the scenes which involve kids are quite hard to follow.Gun violence, drugs etc, it really doesn't hold back, it's graphic.

The Other (Sad) Side of the Wonderful City of Rio de Janeiro,"The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids.This movie takes place in Cidade de Deus, a set of buildings originally built in the 60's for poor persons originated from a big flooding in Rio and from some slums. In the 60's, this area was isolated, without any infrastructure. Nowadays, with the construction boom, it is located close to Barra da Tijuca and Jacarepaguá, very valuables zones. Rio de Janeiro City is surrounded by slums, where the situation presented in the film is the reality of thousands and thousands of honest poor persons.This movie is remarkable: the screenplay, the direction, the performance of the cast, everything works perfectly. The frantic camera looks like a documentary. Today the DVD was released in Brazil, I bought it and I have just watched it with my family.I really can imagine the reaction of foreigners watching this sad side of Rio de Janeiro. It is strange, because a person who does not live in Rio probably may think that this movie exaggerates in some aspects. However, this is our reality. Lost bullets, robberies, violence is part of our day-by-day life. By the other hand, the same person may think that life in Rio 'stinks', and again it is not true. My city, like a golden coin, has two sides: heads and tails. If you can afford, you have wonderful places to live. But unfortunately, a great part of the population lives in slums, like the ones showed in this movie. The lack of perspective in life of the children, unemployment, ridiculous salaries, lack of education, lack of the faith, all of these factors contributes for the formation of the next generation of drug dealers and bandits. The traffic offers positions to the kids, like showed in this movie. And in the end, even when the 'grown-ups' are arrested or murdered, there is a bunch of children to occupy the spot. A sad social problem, but true. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Cidade de Deus"" (""City of God"")",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Sprawling crime masterwork from Brazil,"Wow, what a great movie! I'd heard plenty about this low budget Brazilian gangster film before I got around to seeing it when it showed on television in the middle of the night, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Many times a film has been hyped up so much that it's a let down when I finally see it, but not so this one: CITY OF GOD is a tremendous film, a masterpiece in fact. In many ways it's like a lower budget, more realistic version of the classic gangster films made by the likes of Martin Scorcese and Guy Ritchie and in many places it equals the heights of those two directors at the top of their game.The film follows the misadventures of various, almost feral children as they attempt to eke out an existence and then a living as they grow up in a Rio de Janeiro slum in the '60s, '70s and '80s. The central narrator isn't a gangster at heart; all he wants is to become a photographer and yet he's caught up time and time again in the violence surrounding his drug-dealing friends. Particularly good is Leandro Firmino as Li'l Ze, a psychotic hood who becomes a gang leader and who thinks nothing of having kids executed if they dare so much as get in his way.The direction is top notch, with Fernando Meirelles employing hand cameras on more than one occasion, so that this has a vivid, on the street look to it. The editing is slick and sleek, the music fits the action perfectly, and almost every actor seems to fit his or her role like a glove. I'm trying to think of things to criticise, but there's nothing, really: the story drew me in, got me interested in finding out what happened to the characters, and before I knew it a good two and a half hours had gone by while I sat back and was lost in this film's world. Of course, it's a tremendously violent movie, unflinching in its depiction of violence against children, and one of the most hard-hitting films I've witnessed, so not for those who prefer family-friendly fare; but if you're up for it, this just might be one of the best, most realistic crime films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Mindblowing Masterpiece!,"This movie is absolutely amazing! It is a cinematic tour de force. It is undoubtedly one of the top ten best movies ever made. Comparable to American masterpieces such as Goodfellas or Pulp Fiction. But it is its own unique film.It is based on a true story of one boys desperate attempt to survive and escape the city of god (the slums of Rio de Janeiro) a truly brutal and violent place. A place where murders, holdups, drugs, and criminals are commonplace.This film announces the presences of a truly talented filmmaker, Fernando Meirelles. He directs this film with a ferocious, frantic, intensity perfectly merging every aspect of the film. He uses many different filming tricks from split screen to freeze frame. Each one is used at exactly the right time for the exact right reasons.All of this combines to make an unforgettably perfect cinematic masterpiece that i highly recommend. 10/10 A++",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Simple life in a horrible world,"I finally got around to watching this much praised movie, and I can certainly understand why so many people have found it fascinating. It is very well done in a technical aspect, and it's easy to be seduced by the way it looks and the constant flow of action scenes, not very different from the efficiency of some glossy & clever commercial. It also shows a way of life and a part of the world that is not very well known to many outsiders, thereby invoking some sense of illumination. Unfortunately, looking beyond the interesting setting & the glossy surface there's not a lot to be found.In 'Cidade de Deus' we follow some dirt poor kids who live as brutal gangsters in a shanty town part of the Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro. The kids need money, so they steal, they deal in drugs and they kill. This is the basic plot for the movie. And then what, you may ask? Well, then there's  sadly, pretty much nothing more. What we get here is just a grim world contained within itself, where people perform a lot of horrible acts without really wondering why or thinking about any options or consequences. Now somebody could argue that this is actually the way that many people handle such savage situations, and so this movie is just portraying them in a realistic way. But even then, a filmmaker telling a dramatic story has many opportunities to put things into a broader context and he/she can make the choice to give the audience a more multi-layered view without embellishing anything. If you've seen something like the excellent TV mini-series 'The Corner' you know what I'm talking about.'Cidade de Deus' makes no attempt to explain why these kids don't have any other opportunities than a life of violent crime, so there's no real critique of the society that produces this horrible condition. Without even a glimpse of the reasons for this, you cannot give any real insight into the desperation that drives the characters to behave in the gruesome ways that they do. Instead it comes across as something that's inevitable and almost natural. Like wild animals eating each other, not because they're forced to by special circumstances that could be changed, but simply because it is their instinct. As we all know this will seldom apply to human beings since our existence is much more complex. Any such complexity is totally missing here. In addition there's not much effort made to show the devastating effects that drugs & brutality has on the human soul. Most of the times when something really awful happens in the story, like children becoming killers or getting killed, it's rapidly followed by some non-emotional scene with some cool music and flashy editing. There's no grieving for the victims, the movie is over 2 hours long & the director spends about 30 seconds of that time showing family members shattered by this unnecessary loss of life, which means there's no depiction of the deep sorrow & hopelessness that extreme poverty & violence creates. We get little or no reflection, just one gun-blasting action followed by another & then another. A lot of stuff for eyes & ears, less for hearts & brains.So 'Cidade de Deus' is a film that looks very good. But for me to agree with IMDb placing it among the top 20 ever made (we're talking higher than 'Citizen Kane', 'Apocalypse Now' & 'The Seventh Seal'), the director's ability to convey the depth of human beings should at least be equal to his flair for technical tricks & brilliance. This is truly far from the case here. I rate it 5/10 for the cinematography & editing and for showing a small piece of a harsh reality without blinders, but for me it felt more like an ordinary action movie than an epic masterpiece.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tall and Tan and Young and Packing,"'What are you doing, you're just a kid?' ""I steal, I kill, I carry a gun, how can I be just a kid? I am a man.""Many who visit Brazil the first time, tend to view Brazilians as lacking serious ambition. They seem to party the night away, and appear to seldom work. The old joke about Brazilians is that they have breakfast at 2:00 in the afternoon.But such a narrow view does not take into account the fact that while we in America work to live, sweating away for pennies which the government steals at every turn, they in Brazil Live to Live. It is a different kind of living, a life that sambas with the vibrance of the swaying palm and the bounding drum. A life that understands that we are only on this earth for a cup of cafezinho, and we should have fun while we can before the end comes, but quick.But as the City of God also shows us, Brazilian life is often nasty, brutish and short. A certain degree of anarchy overshadows all the denizens of the film. But Director Fernando Meirelles takes a situation lacking definite boundaries and clear authority, and creates a framework, a structure, that of Gang Rule. The gang-members are not seasoned, old-time criminals like Fredo Corleone or even Tony Montana. Instead, they are a bunch of sweet-faced kids. No one is older than 25, partly because of choice, but mainly because no one lives past this age.On the surface, in this context, City of God is a coming of age story of two young people, a sort of Brazilian ""Angels With Dirty Faces.' One character escapes from the City of God, while the other succumbs to it.But when one scratches beneath, one finds the film a comment on the morally bankrupt City of God in Rio De Janeiro, and a mirror on Brazil itself. Far away from the party hopping, Travel and Leisure postcard perfect white beaches, is another world, one of marauding bands of displaced children.The most surprising thing about City of God is its references to American films. Most Brazilian films, as the films of all countries do, owe allegiance to their own particular cultural situation. Brazil owes a cultural debt to Europe (Portugal, Germany, Italy) and Africa. However, the United States has a far more distant cultural relationship to Brazil. That is where City of God triumphs to me an American film goer. It uses the chapter format made famous in Pulp Fiction and more recently, Kill Bill. It uses the familial structure present in Goodfellas. It uses the 'white-suit cool' present in Miami Vice and the Bacardi and cola ads from the preview before this very movie.The fact that City of God can be subtitled Grand Theft Auto: Sao Paolo, is not a surprise nor a mistake. The film is built like a video game in its use of random acts of violence. But the fluid perfect camera work and editing give way to a film with enormous contradictions. Contradictions as large and as vast as the noble country itself.Stylistically, the camera work does not conform to its premise as a gangster film. A gangster film never looked this good. It is as if the camera is released in the wide open beaches, and kicked around like one of Ronaldinho's headers. It starts on the sand and moves steadily across. It picks up on the story but then heads into the sun. It then leaves us, the film-viewer, with the most indelible image in years as we see Sonia Braga (A world icon and sex symbol of Brazil)'s niece, sitting on the sun-drenched coast putting her arm around another young boy. The innocence conveyed in this scene is something to behold. It literally takes your breath away.You see the slamming of different, competing themes. You see the subtlety and tranquility of the beach, smashed into scenes of battered youths dying on city streets. You see a wealth of hypnotic ambiguous images pulled together, much like the very Culture of Brazil itself.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great,"Such an amazing film that deserves the accolades and acclaimed hype it's garnered. One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.Perhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be ""entertained"". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.The story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Phenomenal,"There are many films that don't live up to the hype they are afforded, particularly modern day films. 'City of God', directed by Fernando Meirelles is not one of them. From the moment the film began until halfway through the closing credits, my eyes did not leave the television once. Based on a true story, 'City of God' spans two decades and is about rival street gangs in the town Cidade de Deus (City of God), just outside of Rio de Janeiro. The city is one where the government sends the 'unwanted' residents of Rio, so most of the inhabitants are homeless, criminal and/or dirt poor. The story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who manages to stay on the outer fringe of the gangs, befriending some of the hoods, but not participating. What he discovers he wants to do is become a photojournalist, and begins to take photographs of his neighborhood. When he is in his late teens/early twenties, he goes to work delivering newspapers, when one of his photographs of the slum gang boss is discovered and published without his permission, putting his life in danger, but beginning his professional career.There are so many reasons why 'City of God' is compelling, but besides its stylish and flashy cinematography and brutally realistic script, the pacing of the film is unrelenting. Not one time did I check the clock to see how far along we were in the film, even though I was on a time constraint. From start to finish, Meirelles gives us a solid yet exciting film. Of course, since I had no idea it was based on real events, 'City of God' became that much more intriguing, especially when, during the closing credits we see actual news footage of some of the primary characters, and we can see how closely the film mirrored actual events.With a film like 'City of God' it is nearly impossible to convey why it is an excellent film because it is just seamless and well done in so many ways.All I can do is recommend the film to pretty much anyone who is looking for a good story and a great presentation. See this film. Now. 9/10--Shelly",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"In terms of movie-making, there's nothing like it.","City of God (2002)A broiling, gruesome, vivid, unforgiving submersion in the drug and crime world of a Rio de Janeiro barrio. You want to just say wow wow wow, it's so violent and awful, and yet the filming and acting, wow again, it's virtuosic and artful. On that most visceral level, there is no faulting a film with this kind of cinematic integrity.Questions start to rise by the last hour, however. In terms of the subject, you wonder, could it be so? Is life so apparently run by children with guns? Where are the older thugs, where are all the kids who aren't criminals, on and on? You come to realize this is a hugely partial view. That's okay, for sure--it's a movie--but it then draws attention to its own need for violence. You will never see so many people ruthlessly, heartlessly, even laughingly murdered, point blank, by children, on and on and on. This makes the movie awesome and awful, both. As a narrative story, it needs, it demands, greater complexity, and maybe, even if it's basically fiction, greater truth.On this level, the movie begins to depend on its energy to succeed. It has energy to spare, for sure, both in the acting, and in the camera-work, both of which are nothing short of unbelievable. But there is a lack, oddly enough with all these ""types"" of young men and boys, of actual ""character."" Where is some sense of the psychology behind so many of these people. Yes, the mood, the interactions, the scenes taken whole, the groups and even the confrontations leading (usually) to murder, all are filled with human depth. But the individuals seem largely to be types of people, not digging into their motivations and their inner states of mine. Maybe that's asking too much.I've seen the movie twice now, and twice I got anxious half way through because it was mostly kinetics and film-making on crack. And it really is astonishing stuff. But as with Slumdog Millionaire, the fractured and imaginative mise-en-scenes would mean so much more with deeper understanding of the human elements involved.A masterpiece, with some large chinks in its armor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Among the 24 best movies ever? Come on!,"Many consider a movie outstanding just because it shows tragic poverty and violence. Subconsciously, I mean CONSCIOUSLY. People feel ""politically correct"" for liking it. Praise becomes a form of self-elevation.An unpunished, 10 year old killer runs around, kills everyone and then bursts into evil laughs. The horrifying situation exists in reality. But a decent filmic approach ought to be different. This movie has been sold as a kind of triumph of the human spirit, yet it's no more than a typical mobster movie sited at Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro. Scene after scene, someone is killed and the deaths have the same depth or significance of a video game. The protagonist does nothing to improve himself. He is a social victim, period. He features the moral character of a robot. And banditry, to the pervert's delight, recruits untouchable children as hoods. A Guy Ritchie-like gang plot has more than its share of shock: non-stop bloodbaths & revolting human filth. For those fond of Grand Guignol, this is perfectly suitable. Horrible, cheap, including pain and suffering. City of God was just another product from the Third World that dazzled the radical chic community of the First World. Pathetically shot as an elegant, kinda commercial for a hipothetical HLM (Hoods' Lives Mater) movement, edited with rather annoying camera movements.

The gangs of Rio,"Quentin Tarantino, eat your heart out! At least in this film they outshot you big time. Watching this film is difficult at times. The violence is to such a degree, the viewer has a problem seating through it.Director Fernando Meirelles has an eye for realism and detail. The most disturbing thing about City of God is the fact that the killers are children playing adult games before they can be children. It is a well known fact that these kids' gangs created terror, not only in the favelas where they lived, which was unfortunate, but they mugged, robbed and just plain terrorized the big cities in Brazil. News about street children being shot in the streets of Rio or Sao Paolo were perceived as criminal because of the ages, but one can get a clearer picture in this film by coming to the realization these same children were killing real grown ups and getting away with murder.The only problem I had with this film is with the English subtitles. Sometimes, one doesn't know who's who. To make matters worse, the principal character grows from a young boy into a photographer who looks like a small boy himself.The plots and subplots are somehow hard to follow at times. The great accomplishment for the director is that he never preaches. He shows the world what went on at that particular time. The realism is extended to the way we see in gory details the corpses of the slain gang members. If Hollywood would have presented scenes that are so hard to take as these, many would be criminals would have been able to see first hand what bullets do to human beings: they kill!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Stunning,"One of my favorite movies. I can be very short about this film. Never has a movie evoked so many emotions in such a short period of time from me. From raw excitement during some scenes to sadness in others. The story is very well presented, with realistic characters. The good guys aren't 100% good, nor are the bad guys 100% bad. For me, every character had at least one thing I could relate to, even Zedje. Some may consider the film to be too violent, but I think the violence is needed to realistically portrait the hard life in the City of God, or any other slum where drug cartels are present.

Review,"The film was something very unexpected and interesting. I did not think that it would be something that I would enjoy or even think to watch. It made me question many things in society and within my own life. We live in a very sheltered society and it might make us more desensitized to the struggles of people across the world. We start to think in terms of ""us vs. them"".This film was very eye opening to the struggles of those involved in gang violence. It was so easy for people to get dragged into the problems. Even young children were not spared from this battle zone. Their naivety is taken advantage of and exploited for the gain of the gang leaders. It was heartbreaking to watch some of the scenes due to the intense violence shown towards such young people. People got involved regardless of their personal beliefs because their loved ones might be involved in it somehow even if they would like to avoid it. This cycle of gang violence and frequent change in leadership led/ leads to many problems.The film itself was very aesthetically pleasing visually and the storyline was built very well. I particularly enjoyed the visuals of the town itself during the 1970's. The color was very soft and the essence seemed more clean. The colors become more dark when the storyline became more current. This may have been to symbolize the darkness that was present within Li'l Ze. When the tender trio were in the city of God, there was more peace and tranquility in comparison to when Li'l Ze ""took over"".This film was one of those things that will most likely stick with me for years to come. It will make me see the world in a new light.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"If it's not from Hollywood, it must be good","There are certain people who have developed a very negative view towards Hollywood movies and U.S. cinema. In this mindset, any movie coming from the US is automatically lambasted, while non-US cinema is praised without merit. City of God, or Cidade de Deus, is one such case. Its serious overvaluing can only be attributed to a cloudy-eyed sentimentalism for the real situation behind the movie without even considering whether the movie itself has value in portraying that situation. And the unfortunate case is, no. Meirelles and Luns' generic directing is completely devoid of feeling and insight, and the actors are merely going through the motions, lacking any emotional impact in the actual proceeding of the screenplay. For these failings, the film collapses into a jiltingly generic mashup of violence and crime, with nothing to tell. There is no shock value, there is no empathy, there are no thoughts evoked. Perhaps this movie has some appeal and bearing to people who are more closely connected to Brazil and the kind of events portrayed, seeing as they can draw from another experience to put some weight into the matter, for this film by itself has none. It takes a special kind of pretentiousness and self-delusion to rate this film highly on its own merits, and the kind of a critic that dares not criticize a film with a sensitive subject. Yet this film desperately needs more of a voice of reason to call it for the empty shell it is.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Almost Too Much to Watch,"One must step back from an absolute sense of repugnance at the violence and look at what the filmmaker has done in this movie. Once you tune yourself into the lives of this cast of characters and their ongoing effort to stay alive and maintain dominance, you can reflect on the amazing cinematography and overall effect of the film. There is an ebb and floe that we watch, almost a dance in the slums of Rio. There is so much poverty that factions have grown up and the people are continually victimized by them as are there individual members. The police are perpetually on the take, so a military state is eventually set up. The main character is a participant early on and then an observer. His photographic skills are his ticket out and his ticket in. There is death and destruction, drugs and murder around every corner. Perhaps the scariest thing are a group of young boys called the Runts who are making a seamless transition into the horrors of the place, keeping things going for yet another generation. I think the most dominant theme of the whole thing has to do with the indifference toward death. Even those who are friends early on will kill their friends because a drug lord says so. It's an unforgettable film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Of how a chicken escaped alive,"Let's imagine for a split-second that you have not read a line about 'City of God' as you click Play in your remote. As the footage starts, the camera snaps back and forth in a frenzy, people dance the samba, a party is on the make, a poor chicken watches as her mates become chicken wings. And hence we get to the big chicken run. It's the most brilliant scene of the whole movie - in fact, the whole movie revolves around it. Around this frantic scene and the shooting that follows and that sadly shows the reality of thousands of Brazilians in Rio and elsewhere. There is no space in Paulo Lins' novel for the idle hedonism of 'Capitães da Areia', the renown Jorge Amado classic that tells us the story of a junior delinquent gang in the streets of Salvador in Bahia. 'City of God' simply has no space. Not even space for the viewer. From the first scene onwards, you are permanently reminded that you aren't but a viewer, that you are outside, that you have absolutely not the slightest-faintest-slimmest idea of what it feels like to be inside. The narrative structure is a strike of genius in that sense. Not that it was a cutting-edge idea - it has been done time and time again. But the manipulation of at least three hand-held cameras, the constant sound of samba and the relapses of the story, together with the sheer vivacity of the original dialogues (mind you, I do mean the original, extremely nuanced Rio favela-slang Portuguese dialogues!!) make the movie possible to be watched without post-traumatic-stress. You are outside, and you know it. Your whole body is either stiff or numb, uncomfortable in any case. That strange butterfly-cold-revolving sensation in your stomach reminds you that you are not comfortable. The way you breathe (or don't)reminds you that you're not comfortable. The way you bite your knuckles or shake your head in disbelief, perhaps the dampness of your eyes when that young child cries in fear of being shot dead reminds you that you are not comfortable, that this is not your world. Sometimes, in your deep discomfort, your thoughts will go ashtray, only to be rescued back by the next still, the next title, the nest flashback that requires your attention. That is the stylistic exercise that achieves the objective of keeping you focused and in your seat. That is the role Meirelles responsibly takes as film director.The rooftops of 'City of God' in the '60s remind me of Soweto. The street scenes in the '60s remind me of Soweto, Jo'burg today. Or Gaza. Or Bagdad. Or Monrovia. Or Mogadiscio. Or Rio, for the matter. See a pattern here? There is no innocence any more. There is simply the ignorance that another life is possible outside those impossible invisible walls of the favela. There is crime and punishment, cause and consequence, shoot and shoot-back, or better yet, shoot-before. It could be a war anywhere in the world. Yet, it's the city you choose to go to for holiday. You'll be dazzled after you watch these 130 minutes. Meirelles allows you the luxury of enjoying the story, despite the violence contained in it. But do stop to think about it for a minute afterwards. Think: how many of those real-life actors, casted in a real-life favela in Rio do you believe had a similar fate since 2002? Think again. This is the harsh reality. Imagine this was a documentary - you would need counseling after watching. But you do need to know what lies behind Morro-do-Pão-de-Açúcar (Sugar Loaf Mountain). Some wars happen in the gut of our society - in Rio as in Paris or L.A., and 'City of God' is there to remind you.And, well, contrarily to what you thought, the worse in Rio is not that your camera gets knacked. Now you've learned that you'll never see the worse, lucky you... F.y.i., the chicken escapes alive (clever chicken!).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
a horrible movie that I strongly recommend,"When I say ""horrible"" I am referring to the vileness of the characters and terrible images in the film. Technically speaking, this is a great film--with some of the most amazing and innovative cinematography I have ever seen. The stories are interwoven very well and the film seems so very real. It is so unfortunate at the film's conclusion you find out that although these are actors, the story itself is true. It's just so hard to imagine living in this hell on Earth in Rio. After seeing this film, there's no way I am ever visiting Brazil!! I'm sure many viewers feel the same way due to the absolute brutality of their slums where the police do little to interfere with gangs who run it.FYI--there's an excellent and sobering documentary on the Criterion DVD of this movie about the drug problem in Rio in the present day. However, it and the film itself are very intense and bloody so I would not allow kids or even teens to view the film. It's really a shame, as most of the way through the documentary I realized it would be a great thing to show my high school world history class.

"good film, but waaaaay overrated","I watched City of God a couple of years ago and was blown away on first viewing. I recently decided to watch it again the other night and was rather disappointed. Basically, COD is a massive case of style over substance - there's basically not much underneath the flashy exterior. For this film to be rated at number 18 in the top 250 is very hard to believe and I would presume that this is due to younger viewers being taken in by its easy charms (I'm only 24 myself though).On the positive side, the film looks amazing. The cinematography is beautiful, from the warm feel of the 'Tender Trio' story through to the bright colours of the later parts. The camera-work and editing are also first class and give the film a great immediacy, there are also some wonderful montages which really stick in my mind.The basic plot and milieu of the film is attractive, a potentially excellent base for a great film, but unfortunately it doesn't deliver. The most important problem with COD is a lack of any meaningful structure - the film simply doesn't 'go anywhere'. The only thematic development in the film is the perpetuation and escalation of violence to such a point that you just don't care anymore. I'm not sure how many killings there are in this film but it must getting on towards about 50, and the more this goes on the less impact it has. I understand that the film was making a statement about the 'reality' of life in a notorious favella - that violence is the norm - fine, make the point and move on, integrate the message into a meaningful piece of art. Instead the film just keeps on offering us another 'shocking' killing, and pays as little attention to these acts of violence as the thugs who commit them. Its overkill in more ways than one.The characterisation in COD is another one of its major downfalls. I just didn't care about any of them, or even have any basic interest in any of them (except maybe Lil Ze). The main character, Rocket, was a nobody in the City of God and also a nobody in the film, City of God. He hardly had any defining character traits - he was scared of guns and wanted to lose his virginity (this basically puts him on the same level as Scooby Doo who was scared of stuff and liked sandwiches - but at least Scooby is funny!). Rocket is dull, he is not funny, not cool, has no passion, little emotion - there's just nothing to care about in him, and the actor playing him fits the part perfectly. I felt that the best character in the film was Lil Ze, mainly because the actor did a pretty decent job in the role. But he is still a hugely underdeveloped character. Lil Ze is a psychotic thug who murders as casually as you or I might pick our nose, he kills about 10 people in a massacre in a hotel at about the age of 10. The deep insights that the film offers us into the creation of such a monster is that he is too ugly to get a girlfriend - is that it?! surely loads of people can't get a girlfriend? There are loads of other characters in the film with much weaker characterisations (e.g. Benny - 'the coolest hood in the COD', who isn't cool at all, just an annoying ponce; Tiago - a loser who hangs around trying to get drugs, he also has a bike; Carrot - a big dealer who doesn't like trouble). One character who did have potential was Knockout Ned, but he ultimately became just another (mostly) mindless perpetrator of violence.My intention is not to completely trash COD, just to point out its (major) flaws. It is a good film and I can understand its popularity, but no way the 18th best film ever! The film is lovely to look at, and guns, drugs, gangs and Brazil are cool - right? But the film has no emotional core. At no point do you feel anxious, sad, happy, affectionate, uplifted, empowered - you may feel shocked near the start but that soon wears off, and then you don't really feel anything.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very Disappointed,"Based on the near universal praise from critics and viewers alike and my interest in Brazilian culture, not to mention the buzz about the cinematography, I was eager to see this film, despite my lack of interest in violence as entertainment.I was disappointed on all counts. City of God seemed very amateurish to me, and I am still trying to figure out what is so great about the camera work. Done in a cinema verite style, it never seemed to rise above someone walking around with a video camera. I suppose that is the point, but it was very slack and unintriguing to me.None of the characters really got under my skin, they were merely shrill and unpleasant, and not in a ""good"" way.Most surprisingly, the hype about the violence is unfounded, and I am very sensitive to violence. Yes, there is a lot of shooting, killing, and depraved behavior, but it was presented in a way that oddly had little impact, let alone gore. I felt like I should have been utterly horrified by the scenes portrayed, yet it came across as not credible or realistic.City of God is certainly not a bad film, and it did have some moments of genuine truth and power, most notably in interactions with various girlfriends.My overall impression of the movie: - a noble and decent attempt at movie realism in that ""cinema verite"" style that does not succeed due to the lack of skill of both the director and the actors. Yes, I hear many of the actors were amateurs - but it doesn't work here.Guess I am pretty much alone here - but I will admit that I don't like very many movies made in the last 15 years or so, although there are a distinct minority that I will watch over and over again such is their quality.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
astonishing,"City of God is a masterpiece that the international cinema ever made. I consider it to be the best international movie I have seen so far. This film is a story about the violent life of the favelas in Brazil. City of God may contain the most violent content I have ever seen in a movie, to reflect the original true story. The experience the movie offering is really hard to watch. However, it holds you and you would get more attached more to the story. In the middle of the chaos and violence in City of God the film is about how a young peaceful kid wants to achieve his dream and make something out of his hard life. Also, how young kids can transform to be criminals because of poverty in the town.
The cinematography, music, and the timeline are astonishing, especially, the vibrant colors, which gave the film some life aspects besides the violent and the killing in the movie.

Visceral and Fabulous,"""City of God"" is an adrenaline jolt of a film that for once manages to find a balance between stylistics and substance.The director, Fernando Meirelles, stuffs his movie to the brim with machine-gun editing, swirling cinematography and pounding music.While this reliance on fancy tricks has ruined other films, Meirelles is so expert at blending them seamlessly into an engrossing story that the viewer quickly accepts them as inseparable from the world of the film.He delivers a deeply emotional and human story that obviously owes much to Scorsese and Tarantino --- but his movie feels completely original, never like a rip off.And underneath all of the action and plotting, there is a compelling message about about the power of art (specifically the camera) and a suggestion that, just as the pen is mightier than the sword, the camera is mightier than the gun.Can't recommend it enough!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

What an Experience!,"Writing this as an 18 year old, I sometimes find that certain films from before i was born have been hyped up to me so much that, though i usually still enjoy them, they can't quite live up to my expectations. City of God is an exception that enthralled me from the jump.This film is exquisitely crafted. Every shot is a frenetic, disorienting haze that quickly builds a real sense of danger and tension even in quieter scenes. The performances are dynamite as well. Each filled with raw emotion, helping them to feel truly authentic and helps to make the characters feel simultaneously like the anarchic problem destroying the city and yet renders them sympathetic to the audience as they are too the biggest victims of their circumstances.This film is phenomenal. Many movies are said to be based on true stories, but not many ever seem to feel as unrelentingly real as in Cidade de Dues. This is a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Masterpiece Holds up over Time,"Over two decades since the release of this stylistic, at every moment enjoyable, gangster epic! Roger Ebert, then reviewed it it call it the ""Best film you'll ever see"".Film at its best, transcending the ganster genre to build characters over an ambitious decade of excess and at times numerous exploits.City of God serves as a unique blend of Scorsese gangster stylized violence to even jump cuts and daring camera angles. Tarantino is brought to mind for the seamless dialogue to violence, which is more desensitized the point we are convinced with the gangs that this is truly the only way of life.Until we meet knock out Ned for the dangerously embarrassing encounter that shifts the narrative of the film. Although so many layers are pulsating all at once. Similarly we are following and being lead along the way at a safer distance with the films photographer. Who's mission is to find his way, lead us though it all so must root for him, a lonely hero.The main violent we come to appreciate is the couple of lead gangsters we grow to know and trust. A bold and handsome more intelligent one, balanced out by one that wouldn't hesitate to show he has much to prove. All the while entertaining an audience without reservations.City of God as layered and as long a scope as is undertakes, triumphs at every turn.I'd agree with other comparisons to the Godfather, with every scene to perfectly loaded with interstellar visuals, deep character interactions.

Just really an average gang movie,"I cannot say it is a bad movie. Actually it is one of the best i have seen lately... I went to the movies when the movie first came to my country, I didn't like it very much. Yesterday I wanted to see it again, because may be i couldn't understand it when i was 16 or 17 when i first saw it. I played the DVD tonight, and yes, i really hadn't catch quite the movie 5 years ago. Now I did, but that doesn't made me love it. Yes, the story was quite original and the director did a good job, but in my opinion this isn't enough for a movie to qualify in the top 20 of the greatest movies here... Leandro Firmino(Li'l Ze) performs great and deserves a high praise, but can it really compare to the performance of, for example, Al Pacino in Heat (160 positions under City of God in Top250). This is ridiculous. It is quite unfair that foreign language movies are rated so high, just because they are not American. I really don't mean to offend anyone. I still think the movie is good, but still cannot compare to much more valuable movies which even didn't make it to the top250. As I already said it is just an average gangster movie.

Kids in the Hood,"To sum it up in one word: overrated.Let's face it, the story isn't anything new (I know most things have been done before, but still). There's no shortage of films depicting the lives of gangsters from their slow steady rise, to that inescapable fall. What's new here is the fact that we're dealing with kids. It certainly is a different take on a familiar plot, but otherwise there are no surprises. For most of the film, it's various gang members shooting each other when they're not busy doing robberies and drugs.One of the arguments for this film being a classic is that the actors are amateurs and that they are ""real"". OK, if that's what they want to show - do a documentary about them instead of trying to gloss it up with fancy visuals and editing. The latter has also been praised to great extent. My question is: why? There's nothing here that isn't in every other film these days, and certainly nothing that warrants that extra high rating. It only detracts from the story, making the characters all the less believable.It seems like the subject matter (i.e. the horrible conditions under which these kids live - and the fact that it's foreign) has influenced viewers into thinking that the film is somehow better than it actually is. It's really nothing more than a typical genre movie. What's best about the film, and not often mentioned, are some very entertaining humorous scenes that you'd not expect to find in a film like this.

A Blistering Brazilian Snapshot,"City of God or Cidade de Deus is a high-intensity roller-coaster ride that does not allow you to exit. The movie is based on the real events that happened in the City of God in Brazil, and it shows the brutality of a city that is strangled by gang wars and drug addictions.The movie can be considered ultra-violent, but it manages to not lose itself in the bloodshed with moments that show tranquility. This leaves you with feelings of dread and joy that create a turmoil within as you are mystified by a story that holds no punches.City of God feels even more real when you realize that some of the unknown actors in the film are also people who used to live the City of God, and the movie is split into different ""stories"" that are meant to represent the lives of some of the big time players in the city. These tales can either be instances of complete horror or moments that are honest and wholesome.The movie's cinematography and editing are also worthy of commendation. The way that what is captured in the frame comments and exemplifies the story is an instance of genius.City of God acts not only as a record of a city that is embroiled in vicious violence, but it also acts as an example of the extent at which filmmaking can be pushed, being one of the most visually striking movies that I have seen. It is a movie that lets you gnaw on terror but only enough so that you do not burn your taste buds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This is the kind of film I'll rewatch year after year.Fernando Meirelles's direction truly captures the harsh reality of the Favelas in Brasil, where the gun reigns supreme and safety is a luxury no one can really afford. Without holding back, we get to see a dirty, bloody and authentic portrayal ""da Cidade de Deus""This film has it all, action, suspense, thriller, drama, and romance. Its vast storytelling and interconnected narratives remind me of a Guy Ritchie film, complete with a multitude of characters and clever plotlines. Besides that, what truly distinguishes this film is its protagonist, who, much like the audience, serves as a simple observer within the unfolding chaos. Boscapé, the protagonist, embodies a relatable figure that deeply connects with every member of the audience.To conclude I like to point out the amazing work of every single actor present in ""Cidade de Deus"", for their outstanding performance, especially the kid that gets shot in the foot.

A Study in Brutality,"City of God was a study in brutality.  Offending all of the senses, the movie proceded in using a multisensory approach to capture the very essence of violence, in every sense of the word.

Not nearly as good as advertised...,"I saw this movie with a couple of friends, and none of us had any prior knowledge of the film. Interestingly enough, none of us where overly impressed... I only realized afterwards, when I went on to IMDb to write my review, that this is considered by many to be one of the best motion pictures ever made! I was shocked. Not to say that it is a bad movie, because it isn't, but it is nowhere near being very good, let alone a masterpiece.What is it missing? Well, in my opinion, a lot. For starters, the script is very weak. We hardly get to know any of the characters well enough, and consequently do not care what happens to them. This is a major flaw, a 'conditio sine qua non', I cannot imagine a good movie that does not transmit emotions. The same is with the cinematography... The camera is too hectic, the cuts too frequent, the movie looks too much like a video spot or a commercial. I know it is modern, but I find it unfit for a full length motion pictures.So why then all the hype? In my opinion, most people living in the developed world nowadays are so far removed from the harsh realities of life, so used to living their comfortable, politically correct, protected, cuddly lifestyles that seeing something like this is so far from their understanding that it 'shocks' them and they believe they are experiencing something metaphysical, highly artistic... Consequently, they praise these movies in the belief that by doing so, it also makes them more 'artistic', because they can 'understand'. How sad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not worth the hype,"Nowadays some consider a movie to be phenomenal as long as it shows tragical poverty and violence. It is so distinct from their lives that they unconsciously feel ""educated"" by seeing the film; praising the film therefore becomes a way of self-elevation.City of God's fancy cinematography did not appeal to me. Unnecessary stylization in this case offends the serious topic, in my opinion. Feels more like a showcase than a honest presentation.If one wants to dig deep into tragic elements in order to make a teary, ""shocking"" film, he can always go as far as his claws can take him. But there's a stopping point by which the whole thing becomes a sham too pretentious to be appreciated. A 10 year-old running around killing everyone and then enjoys himself a couple of evil laughs (that are made to echo to achieve ""epic"" cinematic effects)? ""Cliche"" would be an understatement...I haven no objection to the theme of the movie. By all means such horrifying situations do exist in reality.

Of course the society always shapes people and it's not the linchpin for your destiny. The movie is such a story.

"Excellent, but overrated by the IMDb-users","""Cidade de Deus"" is the breakthrough of Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (""The Constant Gardener""). It tells the unbelievable but true story of the gang life in a poor neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro. The neighbourhood is mostly ruled by kids and young adults, who doesn't play cowboy and Indian like most kids of their age do. No, most of the time they are busy dealing drugs, robbing local stores or killing other young adults in order to extend their territory.The story is told by Rocket, a young guy who tries to live an honest life and not to be involved in the gang life. Fernando Meirelles made an amazing movie of an exceptional story. The story is disturbing and chocking. If it wasn't based on true events, this movie wouldn't have been such a big hit either. It's the combination of an objective style, fast filming, a great soundtrack and the chocking story that made ""Cidade de Deus"" a revolutionary movie.Although the events are tragic, don't expect a melodramatic story. I don't think the purpose of the director was to move us. I think he wants as to be chocked after seeing this movie. Although we are confronted with violence on TV every day when we watch the news, the fact that kids are involved in this kind of gang life is really chocking.Although I really liked this movie, I think it's highly overrated. Personnaly, I don't think it deserves such a high ranking in the Top 250. Nevertheless an excellent movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Explores a world or violence and moral ambiguity rarely depicted on film,"The most moving moment in a trip I made to Brasil occurred when I visited a community school in the slums (favelas). These children were desperately trying to better themselves  the school (paid for from community and rotararian funds with no government help) was their *only* chance to get out of the cycle of hopelessness and crime. The awful dilemma was that the community and its inhabitants were protected and supported (with no strings attached) by the local drugs and gun running infrastructure. I was safer there than on the streets of Copacabana  no-one would harm a tourist as that might attract police attention (bad for business). One infraction to law and order would mean a warning  the second, death.City of God looks at the slum area (a slightly less criminalised one than the one I visited) some years not to long ago as it evolved towards this position. The honest struggles of a teenager to break the mould, and the enormous pressures on his less intelligent peers to enter the short lived occupation of  gangster. There are many moral challenges the audience is forced to confront, including the many shades of villains that accept a certain degree of criminality in order, at least in part, to do some good in an environment where the worst are very bad indeed and even the police are generally known to be more corrupt than some of the drug-runners.This is a monumental film ,bravely told and skilfully put together. It opens a world that is largely unseen by the developed West, telling a nail-biting story that accurately reflects generations of children and adults lost to a world we wouldn't wish on anyone. Queasiness at an opening scene where live chickens are beheaded for the cooking pot is soon put into insignificance as we realise the horrific cheapness of human life. This rollercoaster ride of a movie leaves you with very uncomfortable questions about the nature of goodness. Even thinking back to it now brings tears to the corners of my eyes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Stunning gangster movie,"If I had written this review as soon as I came out of the cinema I think I would have given it 9/10. However, having had a week or so to reflect on the movie I don't think I will be quite so generous.CITY OF GOD has many good points: the directing, the acting, the locations, the interesting storyline. But I can't help thinking that it's all a little hollow. The central theme of the movie is that violence breeds violence -true but trite. Perhaps the worst thing about it is that, despite the violence, the slums in which the film is set don't seem like such a terrible place to live. The people there have a strong sense of community and, as long as they don't step out of line, all seem to be fairly happy. As a piece of social commentary, I don't think the movie really pulls it off.Regardless of these flaws, CITY OF GOD is stunning to look at and a joy to watch. If you like action or gangster movies then this is the film to see.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Just... fantastic.,"City of God is set in poverty-stricken and corrupt Rio de Janeiro and bravely zooms in on its young citizens in their extremely violent day-to-day circumstances. Some of them are really only just kids. I don't mean kids like ""rowdy teens"", but actual little children with guns and blood on their hands. It is quite heartbreaking to watch, but very compelling at the same time.As it follows the life of two childhood friends who take very different paths in life, it is an excellent portrayal of erasthe 60s, 70s and 80scapturing the style, music and way of life of each. Between the two story lines, the director introduces a multitude of violent characters and their lives in Rio through titled segments. Unlike Tarantino's violent segments, they are cohesive.It is also stunning to see how well the actors performed in their individual parts, especially when I come back here on IMDb and read that they were not even professional actors, but locals recruited specifically for the film. Wow! More praise: I think City of God possibly has the best cinematography I have ever seen in a movie. It had such a unique mix of shotssometimes choppy editing (but not Tony Scott seizure-inducing), 70s TV style images, quick camera movements and other times more drawn out and more ""epic"" shots. All the while it truly felt as though you were there, but desperately wanted to get away from the madness.However, it may feel, at times, somewhat like an orgy of drugs and guns or mindless glorification of street violence to appeal to teen audiences.But then I realised the violence is not gratuitous because City of God is about violence (duh, I know) and it condemns it in many ways, such as making out the protagonist non-violent and aspiring to a better life, and getting us to sympathise with him more than anyone else.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A great addition to the gangster genre,"City of God is based on the true events of a young man growing up watching everything around him is destroyed. Families are changed and friendships are destroyed so that each character can escape the ghetto that consumes his life.City of God captures innocence lost at an early age and spans two decades in Rio de Janerio. The movie tackles the hardships of living in poverty, a situation in which the only way out for many is to fight and steal. City of God has two main characters: Rocket and Lil Ze; the movie uses these characters to show that there are different ways to escape the ghetto. Rocket uses his brain and an eye for a great photograph. Lil Ze takes a completely different approach to escape, using muscle and weaponry to take over the drug trade in Rio.Bráulio Mantovani does an amazing job of making each character three-dimensional. Each character is built with personality and attitude. There is black and white, good and evil. The movie shows the events that each character has gone through to come to a decision point that could change his life from that day on.City of God borrows a lot of the ideas and techniques from American films. The gangster motif is something that has been done in the United States for over eighty years. Drawing from modern American hits like Goodfellas and Casino, City of God takes over-the-top characters and puts them in adverse situations. A common theme in these movies is the obsession with money and what to do with it when you have it. A big difference between City of God and its American counterparts is how real the violence seems. There is nothing to glorify the killings that take place in City of God.Another American movie that City of God pulls from is Citizen Kane. Just as in Citizen Kane, flashbacks are used to reveal the story and develop characters. In Citizen Kane, the technique is used to show what kind of man Mr. Kane was. In City of God it is used by the screenwriter and director to develop characters in a limited amount of time.City of God has it all: a great story line that fosters the development of all the characters, the struggle to overcome one's past, and the battle between good and evil.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

What can make human beings inhuman to this extent?,"This is a literally terrific movie. I was drawn as soon as the opening scene started. The barbecue party on the roof in a crowded houses. The scene they edge a knife and open the chickens with sense of exhilaration gives you feeling of a mixed atmosphere of festivity and cruelty of the whole movie. Then a chicken runs away, and the scene the lead character is flanked by a group of gang and the police immediately turns to another scene of 20 years ago. A breathtaking opening.This movie is based on the story written by a man who is the model of the movie. Though the original story is 550 pages long, the resulting movie looks flawless, with masterful screenplay and camera work. I read that most of casts are not professional actors but chosen from the modeled slum, but it is hard to believe. Take Li'le Ze for example, both in his boy age and youth age, their act of countenance is so impressive. The acting of the boy who is hit his shoe is so vivid that you can hardly watch straight. Anyhow, from the viewpoint of movie making, this is a masterpiece.This is based on real story, and they say such situation still exists in Rio de Janeiro. Then, what is the society that makes human being inhuman to this extent? Poverty could be one of the background. But, in the countries like the Philippines for example this neat town is not even called a slum. It can be said that guns can change human mind. What happens if a brat has a tool to kill a man with a finger? Then how come such tools are handed to the brats that easily?

The camera work helps the film to be so gratifying especially for someone who does not understand the language the film is made in. Every angle tells a different story so you never draw your eyes away for a split second as the film captivates you that much you do not want to a miss a single shot. The director has admirably captured the idea of the poverty, crime, drugs and violence and throughout that you follow Rocket (the one ounce of hope of escapism from the favelas).

Told through the eyes of one of the inhabitants who witnesses the growth of crime amongst the young men and boys of the area, the story is supposed to be true and unhappily it looks an honest enough assessment of any rundown poverty stricken urban neighbourhood no body cares about. the cycle of crime sounds familiar, using kids as couriers for drugs, random killings, turf wars, addiction, hopelessness, squalor and filth. told at a fast pace in a episodic story character by character, the place soundslike one step up from a concentration camp [see the work of Primo Levi about what thats like] Oddly the storyteller goes on to leave the ghetto by becoming a photojournalist, a similar story was told here on Irish TV by a young man who was in trouble from age 8 till his early 20's when he learnt to write and became a journalist so he could break the cycle of damaging behaviour he had. the truth is to get an education seriously as characters in the film are constantly telling the storyteller but he gets out by luck mainly and having a strong character. not a brilliant film, a relentlessly told story, violent and depressing, though honest 10 out of 10 for that; it should be labelled a docudrama rather than a film  but then less people would see it, but I wonder if I or anyone really know what it means?

Somewhat Flawed Film,"I recently re-watched ""City of God"" for the first time in 15 years, and it was worse than I remembered. I had held this film in high esteem, but now, perhaps being older, I see more issues. First the positives: this film treads ground rarely done -- exploring the Brazilian favelas and the social issues endemic there. I think it is good to raise awareness about the plight of the less fortunate -- those whom by birth have less resources and opportunities afforded to them. However, there is a fine line to walk between raising awareness and just glorifying violence. I'm not saying that was the intent, but when all you see for two hours is violence, it is hard to think beyond that.The negatives for this film include: the choppy filming/editing/cutting, the long length, the excessive violence (especially the graphic violence toward and by children), and the unnecessary and sometimes ridiculous inclusion of sex. I've finally come to realize that these problems pervade most Miramax releases, and perhaps as a youth I found these traits impressive, but now as an older adult they become tiresome.If only the director had give us a little more beauty and hope in this film -- like the beautiful beach scene featured on the cover. Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful place, and like life, has both good and bad aspects. This film is too one-sided, showing only negativity. Perhaps that is the director's intent, to foster a sense of being trapped, being stuck in an ugly place and situation. However, it makes for a tough watch. Thus 5.0/10.0.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Heavy Cloud Over Heaven.,"A popular surge swept the land just prior to the 2003 Oscars and ""City of God"" became a critical success with the Academy. The popularity is somewhat misleading though as this production has tons of problems with its Oscar-nominated script and uneven performances across the board. The setting early is 1960s Rio de Janeiro. A ghetto just outside the city limits is the breeding ground for dangerous gangs of thugs who are little more than adolescents who go around and create chaotic violence. One of these youngsters grows to become Leandro Firmino, a heartless miscreant who toes the line between just being cruel and being down-right psychotic. He is kept somewhat under control by his top assistant Phellipe Haagensen, but in their world both are in as much danger as those that come into contact with them. As all this goes on another youngster (who grows to become Alexandre Rodrigues) from the same neighborhood looks to take a different route completely by trying to become a photographer. Rodrigues, like his contemporaries, also has a life that seems to be on a tight time table. The picture advances to the 1980s and the ultimate fates of the primary characters come shining through in vivid and ironic fashions. Directors Fernando Meirelles (Oscar-nominated in the category) and Katia Lund develop a technologically interesting picture that benefits greatly from landmark cinematography by Oscar-nominee Cesar Charlone and highly difficult editing techniques by Daniel Rezende (also Oscar-nominated). The camera-work is enough to give this film a high mark, but once again the performers are not as good as advertised and the script by Oscar-nominee Braulio Mantovani is unsteady and a bit pretentious. The fact that the tale is based on fact does not really give the picture any more credibility than it would have if it had been from the mind of a foreign screenwriter. The characters are not always believable and are usually not worth caring about. Many problems, but still a noble and overall intriguing product. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Awesome movie, deserves to be top 5!","This movie is amazing! The plot is strong and very thick without ever becoming pretentious or slow. The action scenes are very gritty and real and not full of Hollywood overindulgence and the violence is framed more for poignancy than shock value. It is obviously very influenced by scorscese but has a modern twist. It seems like a blend of Scorscese's camera work and storytelling with the backdrop of urban ghetto dramas like New Jack City or Boyz N the Hood. Even though the movie is subtitled you never feel like you have to watch the bottom of the screen to stay in the movie. You could almost watch the movie on mute and still soak up ninety percent of the film.I hope that everyone that thinks of themselves as a movie buff sees this movie. As far as I'm concerned it rivals anything in IMDb's top ten.As a sidenote: I heard about this film when I worked with some Brazilians for a short time. Seu Jorge (knockout ned) is a huge star in South America. He is an actor and musician, and Brazilians worship the guy like a god. I ripped some of his songs from one of the guy's Ipods and have been a huge fan ever since. Seu also has a role in The Life Aquatic, he is the black guy who plays all the music throughout the movie. All the songs are David Bowie songs sang in Portuguese. If anyone wants to try out his music, download ""Mangueira"", it's my personal favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
MUST SEE,"One sentence to describe this movie best, in my opinion, is difficult to watch, but extremely hard to look away from. City of God is full of chaos, violence, and killing but has a good underlying story of a kid who pushed through his childhood and became a photographer. Anyone who watches this should recognize their privilege. This movie not only makes you think, but make you change your perspective on the world and your part in it. The writer and director take this disturbing content and change it into something intriguing. The performance, the direction, the cinematography, the music, all laced together to create a wonderful film documenting the painful truth of living in a Brazilian slum. Everyone should give this film a chance, you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliant but tough to watch,"There are exactly two characters in this movie -- Rocket and Knockout Ned -- who are in any way sympathetic. Everyone else is a villain or victim, usually both. The film does not contain a single frame that relieves the brutality, violence, poverty and degradation which are its themes. See it but understand what you'll be seeing: drug trafficking and casual murder (mostly done for ""business"" reasons but also for the sheer pleasure of killing) by young people and even by children in a terrible, terror-ridden Rio de Janeiro slum. In its way it is harder to watch even than Hotel Rwanda because of its apparent ""artlessness."" You have more of a feeling in City of God that you are actually there, witnessing unbelievably awful events without the small distance that Hotel Rwanda afforded because it was scripted and acted and ""directed,"" because it was art. This movie, on the other hand, feels like you are watching it happen in front of your eyes without a scriptwriter's story telling or a director's mediation. Those illusions are helped along by the fact that there's not a single actor that I recognized from any other movie. The actors ARE the drug dealers, the killers and the victims -- not, as in ""Traffic,"" well-known actors ""playing"" at being drug dealers, killers and victims. ""Traffic"" was very well done. This movie is harrowing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Kids With Guns,"'City Of God' is not an easy film to watch, nor is it an easy film to like. Were it not for the stark reality that permeates most of the production, this could have been a modern zombie flick. None of the characters in this movie are really alive anyway. They're the walking dead, living each moment with the threat of death knocking holes in their front door. The actors do the best they can with powerful material that offers them no real hope. As I said, zombie flick.After 2002's searing documentary, 'Bowling For Columbine', it seems a little ghoulish to see a movie filled to the brim with shots of kids with guns. And they use their guns oh so casually, killing at will. It's not easy to make a viewer immune to the sight of a child brandishing a gun, let alone firing it, let alone shooting it at people. Repeatedly. After a while, I wasn't appalled anymore. 'City Of God' is relentless in its offhand violence, proving once again that ghetto conditions breed desperation and murder. Perhaps that's truthful. In fact, I have no doubt that this movie is bang-on.That's the rub. For every moment of authenticity, there's one of over-the-top brutality. Is it over the top, however, if it's trying to be factual? I'm not sure. See, I can't say I liked this film, but the energy and raw power brought forth is admirable. Certain audiences should see it (not children, not the weak-stomached), but they need to be forewarned of how rough things get. Director Fernando Meirelles puts the camera literally into the action (think 'Saving Private Ryan' in Brazil) and doesn't allow you to view the horrors from a safe distance.So why am I reserved about this film? Violence in movies doesn't usually bother me. Maybe it's that I found it difficult to relate to the characters. I have never experienced the squalor or pain they experience on a daily basis. And---I have to be honest---I had a hard time keeping everybody straight. Once the film gets going and it settles into the '70s time frame after jumping around a lot, that problem goes away. Still, I was supposed to be engaged from minute one and it took a little longer for me to get warmed up.The young, unknown cast is solid. They're not good enough to be etched in my memory, although Alice Braga (as Angelica) is one of the most beautiful girls I've seen in years. Since the actors are portraying biographical characters, they're already limited in what they can do. Meirelles rings genuine emotions from the legions of kids in this picture, who probably had a blast pretending to be a kill-crazy street gang.I think I'd get into the story and the characters more with a second viewing. But is it worth seeing again? Perhaps. I'd probably never enjoy it, though. There's something cynical going on here, a gloomier resolution than what's in similar subject matter (such as 'Boyz N The Hood'). That film is a tragedy, this one is a tragedy of such extreme proportions that you know nothing can save the people---especially the innocent---in the city of God. Judging by how popular the movie is with audiences worldwide, I'm in the minority here. All I can hope for is that this film illuminates this gangland mentality that we see in all downtrodden cities. If the film helps to correct that issue, it will indeed have served a valuable purpose. I recommend 'City Of God', just not very strongly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Well acted and well shot, but not as emotive as it claims","I knew this was a powerful tale of despair in amongst violence, and that it was a very well received piece.It's the tale of Rocket, a young boy who grows up in the slums in the City of God, and who witnesses at first hand the full extent of conflict.In the City of God, violence is a cancer which spreads and engulfs its host, and no one can escape from it unless they are very, very lucky.Rocket's love of photography may just be his passport out, but with the city under the iron fist of Li'l Ze, a gang leader with a totalitarian control of the city, realising his dreams may not be easy, or indeed possible at all.There are many, many characters in City of God, and each of them get a significant amount of screentime which gives the movie a depth few others can achieve due to the effective grittiness of how their respective stories are told.The main problem I have with this story is that somehow it fails to really suck you in. A movie like this relies on drawing emotion from the viewer, and having a genuine view of each character be it hate, love, empathy, or sympathy.In City of God, too few characters achieve this.I found myself having feelings only about Li'l Ze and Knockout Ned. The likes of Benny, Shaggy, Carrot and the main protagonist Rocket drew very little from me.It took until about an hour and a half in before I felt truly part of the story which, for me, is too long.Putting this flaw aside, City of God is a very well told movie, which uses effective direction.

A violent cartoon,"I was really disappointed with this film. It is sold as a sort of triumph of the human spirit film, but it is more like a typical mafia gangster film transplanted to Brazil and the seventies. I was waiting for the Godfather to come out any minute and say ""He takes out a knife, yah take out a gun."" Scene after scene is of someone getting killed and the deaths have all the depth and meaning of a pixel creature getting shot in a video game. This film entertains on the most base level and has no depth whatsoever.I can't say that I cared about anyone in this film, except for maybe Knockout Ned. The main character doesn't really do anything to improve his life. It is more like he just wanders out of the neighborhood. Where is the triumph in that? He also never seems to pass judgement on anyone or anything that happens around him. Its like stuff just happens. This dude died, and then that dude died, and yawn.... Great, he has the moral character of a robot, real inspiring.I also noticed that its one of those ""based on a true story"" films, like that is supposed to make us think. ""Wow, I just saw a part of life that I never understood before. Its hard to believe that life is so cheap and that no one cares about anything in this neighborhood."" Well, I don't buy it. Its just too cartoonish to be real. Maybe the basic story line happened but that is about it.By the way, my wife walked out on this film. I guess she thought going to the meat packing plant and watching cows being slaughtered would probably be entertainment at the same level. But at least it wouldn't be set to Samba music!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A really slick and impressive gangster movie,"In the slums of Rio de Janeiro is an area called the city of God.  In this area children often do not make it to adulthood.  Rocket is a young man looking to use photography to get himself out of the slums and away from crime.  We follow his story from a child through the 60's and 70's in the slums where he is witness as children Lil' Dice and Bene grow up to become the heads of the gangs, using violence and murder to increase their power.I had missed this in the ONE art cinema in the city I live in and had to wait for the DVD to come out.  It was very much worth the wait.  I wanted to resist the urge to call this film `the Brazilian Goodfellas' simply because everyone else has said it - but it is a fitting description.  Like that film, this is a sprawling story of crime and violence across several decades.  And like Goodfellas it is violent, stylish and a great story that is engaging.  The overall plot focuses on the rise of Lil' Ze and the violence around him, as seen through the eyes of Rocket.Opening with a stylishly shot standoff, the film jumps back over twenty years and begins to introduce a range of characters who come and go throughout the film to give a back story of violence and crime.  The film jumps around quite a bit but it serves to build up a picture of the area and the characters involved.  The violence is not gory but it is sudden and shocking - children killing children, bloody sudden deaths and so on; but it is not sensationalised but rather very depressing and down to earth.The direction is very slick and the overall production and feel of the film is one of style and imagination.  The opening of a 360 pan around Rocket is an indication of the style than runs through the whole film.  It even manages to have a mix of styles - fast cutting edits work best in moderation, which is exactly what this film does.  The soundtrack is great and the film definitely owes a debt to Scorsese.The cast are very talented and very natural considering that few of them have any experience acting.  Alexandre Rodrigues is great as Rocket even if he gets overshadowed by Leandro Limrino attention grabbing Ze (in the same way as we all remember Joe Pesci over Ray Liotta).  The rest of the cast is almost perfect to a boy.  Even the young children are convincing and powerful and there are no bum notes in the performances - it is very impressive but the sad thing is that I suspect that for many of them, this was not a stretch as this is really their life.Overall this is a tremendous film - easily the best of the year.  It is slick and stylish but not at the expense of the story, which is a dizzy collection of characters and action.  If you like Goodfellas then you will simply love this film.  Hell, if you like cinema - you will like this film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I have heard only good things about this movie so i was prepared for a excellent movie, and let me tell you i was not disappointed at all. The movie shows how little a human life is worth in some people eyes. The scariest part is to see the young kids, probably not more than 7-10 years old, carrying guns, thinking it is cool to kill others. The thing i remember best is when one of the young kids says: I smoke and snort. I have robbed and killed. I am a man! What kind of life do you live when you can say that sentence and believe it?

The format in which the story is told is unique through the eyes of Rocket.

Amazing - I've never seen anything like it,"The City of God (2002) executes every aspect of an Oscar-worthy film. Cinematographer Cesar Charlone does an exceptional job of conveying real-life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro during the 1960s through the use of color, lighting, music, sound, camera angles, and moving camera shots. Most of the film's shots consists of handheld shots which create a documentary-like film and feels very life-like. In other words, it's almost as if you yourself are living in the City of God.The film is set in the 1960s in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and revolves around a boy named Rocket who refuses to follow the destiny that his life has set for him - working for a drug dealer. The second main character in the film, Lil Ze, is a relentless sociopath - the complete opposite from Rocket. While Rocket has had his mind set on becoming a professional photographer ever since he was a little boy, Lil Ze's goal has always been to be the respected kingpin. Rocket's dream is what keeps him away from Lil Ze but at the same time, it's also what brings him closer to Lil Ze.One of the many scenes that I found cinematically appealing was when Rocket was narrating ""the story of the apartment."" I thought that the use of color and the editing effects helped enhance the story. For example, at the beginning of the scene, the color was warm, signifying that the story of the apartment had started off with innocent intentions since Doa Zelia, the woman who started selling drugs in the apartment, was simply trying to provide for her family. The degradation effect is used effectively to show the progression of the story. As we see the story progress, the color slowly transitions from warm to cold and blue as there is an increasing amount of violence with each stage.Overall, this film gets a 10/10 from me. I highly recommend it, even if you are sensitive to violence. These are real life occurrences that I think everyone needs to be exposed to so that more people are aware of what happens in other parts of the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great film that deserved to be recognized,"One thing is for certain, City of God didn't back down on the shock value. From the random killing of children to the more organized gang violence, City of God is more of a testament to the failures of capitalism rather than a failure of law and order. Either way, the film was a stunning depiction of a world no one really gets to see. This is a world you don't see in the tourist guides or in the movies.What was especially incredible about this film was the dirtiness and authenticity. Instead of making this film on some back lot or recreated set, this film was actually made in the slums of Rio. In fact, the slums themselves become a major character in the film, illustrating how disgusting this world truly was. Adding even more authenticity was the use of non-professional actors. While many critics have panned films that have used this paradigm for acting, the lack of false reality made for a rather well acted film.Years from now, this will be considered one of he best foreign films to hail from anywhere, and it is time to take some notice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Slick and Annoying MTV Favela movie,"This movie proves that foreign directors are perfectly capable of putting out soulless Hollywood crap too. This movie has nothing to say about Brazil, nothing to say about the rise of crime in Rio's shantytowns, and ultimately nothing to say about any of its characters. And to make things even worse, it ruins almost every dramatic scene by applying utterly pointless fastmo/stop sequences, the should-be-banned-forever shakycam, and the super-annoying fastcut MTV style edits that not only suck, but are hopelessly dated. The only people this movie will impress are film-critics and Tarantino-wannabes.I won't waste your time with the story since you've seen it in about 100 movies before this one. Nothing intrinsically wrong with telling a boys from the hood gangster story, but its just not in and of itself strong enough to carry the movie. Lil'Dice grows up to be a big boss then gets killed. Yawn. Rocket escapes poverty (I guess) by becoming a reporter. Snore. A bunch of other guys get killed before we have any chance to figure out who they are. Zzzzzz.The music is buried in the background for the most part, and when it takes center stage, it's often stuff like ""Kung Fu Fighting"" which sounds more like Hollywood shorthand for ""the 70s"" than any real attempt to capture what favela kids were listening to back then. I swear it feels like this movie was scored by an American right down to the rustic types playing their little guitars on the street.The acting is fine but can't escape the one-dimensional writing. The Tender Trio are amiable thugs whose roles in this movie are completely superfluous. Lil Dice is 100% bad, Rocket is 100% good, and Benny is so underwritten that we don't really care what, if anything, motivates him. The one character who might have acquired some depth (and around whom the entire movie should have been built) is Knockout Ned, a bus driver who turns into a murderous gangster. He, more than anyone else in this movie, embodies everything that went wrong in the favelas in the 80s--a deadly combination of ex-military and drug gangsters, with the military guys supplying the connections for heavy firearms, the organization to mold the drug warlords armies, and the training to shoot to kill rather than simply spray bullets around. Knockout Ned is portrayed as a ""hero"" of course, even though so many of his kind were anything but heros, taking advantage (and often creating) the total anarchy of the favelas in order to grow rich and powerful.The cinematography often makes this film all but unwatchable. Fast cuts, speedups, filter shots, the abysmal strobe-light sequence on the dancefloor. All of this is crap and totally kills every scene where its employed. The one great scene in this movie (where Lil Dice shoots one of the ""runts"" in the foot, then forces another young kid to decide which of the two ""runts"" to kill) is devastatingly effective because it doesn't use any crap film tricks at all. It's a tense, realistically portrayed scene shot at medium distance which manages in a few minutes to show just how the mindlessly violent generation of the 90s came into being. If the whole movie had been like this, it would have earned all the critical praise heaped on it.But of course, the whole movie isn't like this because the director is too busy showing off his technique to worry much about how the scenes connect. Copying Tarantino's style of putting little titles up for each segment, he seems to utterly forget what story he's telling, jumping around from character to character, and even short flashback loops like the whole ""apartment"" sequence that he seems to think build dramatic tension whereas all they really do is shout ""hey, look at how cool this narrative technique is!"" It might be cooler if we hadn't seen the same ""Lil Dice takes over another dealer's turf"" sequences so many other places. And all the praise about how ""realistic"" this is must be coming from critics who think Quentin's films are realistic because almost all the violence is as perfunctory and fake as any movie coming out of Hollywood these days. In the end, this feels as plastic and stylized as any gangster rock video, and carries the same emotional weight.In short, a real disappointment. Essentially a tired American gangsters from the hood movie shot with a Brazilian setting.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of violence,"Perhaps expected too much before entering the cinema. Did not turn out as well as I thought it would.The story is told through the mouth of Rocket, a future photographer who grew up with the hoods in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The narrative style is excellent, the best thing about the film. It throws several stories at the audience one at a time, all linked chronologically and eventually leading back to the opening scene of the show. It's pretty clever and well executed. The acting's top notch too, the hoods feels extremely real, right down to the little 'runt' who cried so painfully when he was shot in the foot.Without doubt, violence is the integral theme in this film. It shocks initially, but numbs you into submission as the film moves along. A friend commented that the only reason why the City of God is named as such is because the people living there get to see God very quickly. It seems inevitable for the boys to succumb to the world of drugs and crime. Admist all these violence it is really a miracle for the narrator to be able to live and tell his story and not get hit by a stray bullet in the frequent gang shootouts. Perhaps this is the fairytale aspect of the movie. The only person who escapes death is the one who has managed not to subscribe to the seemingly unavoidable world of crime.The film should have left a deeper impression in me, but yet it doesn't. I don't know why, but somehow my emotions are not stirred. Are we living in such comfort and are so remote from real violence that there is nothing for us to associate with?",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A Moving, Powerful, and Compelling Story","The basic story, a boy who is raised in the real world, from the beginning of his life. I believe this is one of the most powerful, and truly realistic stories, that can truly show the hardships of reality, and the decisions given to people, and how they choose to accept different opportunities. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was all those things: powerful,moving, beautiful and all that, but I realized this is a story that should be heard. This story reminds me of Lord of the Flies, with realism in it. This movie deserves all the credit it gets and some, and I hope that the situation that this story follows, one day, will no longer exist: life of violence, drugs, and death.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Citt of God is Fabulous,"Easily one of the best movies of the year, perhaps the decade. I have not seen a gangster movie with the level of nuance and attitude as City of God. All the of the characters are wonderfully developed and all have their own identity to add to the message of the film. The locations in which the film was shot are almost a character unto themselves and I left wanting to see more of this slum of Rio de Janiero. There is nothing that I can say about this movie other than it is a masterpiece of storytelling and setting... This is the movie that will put Latin American cinema back to it levels of a couple of years ago. Yet City of God moves beyond what Perros Del Amor and Y Tu Mama Tambien ever dreamed of achieving.

Ultimately Pointless Drivel,"Well you're in for a 2 hour shootout here. It's not entertaining in any way. From the history of the characters growing up to how they ultimately met their decline, it was just redundant and amateur film making. The dialogue must surely have been written by 10 year olds trying out their first swear words, and man oh man do they continually repeat them. It's threats then violence then threats then killing, and people falling dead when they're hit by gunfire in laughably absurd and unrealistic ways. Extremely childish. Childish writing and directing, and all the so-called adults in this mess act childish too. It ultimately just became rather humorous it was so bad, and faded into the background as I started getting distracted by other things. It's a case of a point being hammered home so many times it loses it's power and eventually all anthenticity. It could have been a gritty portrayal of that part of the world and that type of life, but ended up failing in every aspect for me. Very poor choice of soundtrack also detracted from any possible enjoyment. I've seen exemplary films from Brazil. Funny how they never reached the level of acclaim this film did. Sadly the real talent in this business never floats to the top because what's wanted is overdone nonsense like this. I gave it a star because the squalor of the city is showed realistically, but that was purely by accident.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pulp'ish Goodfellas,"I thought Godfather,Goodfellas were the best gangster movies ever made.This movie was comparable and at places even better than Goodfellas.But considering Goodfellas was released 13 years before Cidade de deus puts Goodfellas in a different league altogether.Cidade de deus has awesome cinematography ( Cesar Charlone - Oscar nominated ),totally offbeat editing ( Daniel Rezende - Oscar nominated ),scintillating screenplay (Braulio Montavani - Oscar nominated ) and some good direction.The audio was in Portuguese but the subtitles were pretty good to follow the movie.The movie is styled similar to pulp fiction since the answers are given first and questions asked later in almost all the anachronous sub-plots ( like chapters in pulp).The movie is narrated by Rocket,a journalist who takes just a minor role in the movie ( btw. this is a true story).The story is set in 60's Rio de Janiero and revolves around a ghetto.Its very powerful and disturbing with kids carrying guns and robbing motels, shooting to kill,sniffing n selling drugs.Its somewhat reminded me of Black Hawk Down but this is a war amidst drug lords unlike the war in BHD. ""I sniff,I steam,I kill.I'm man"" uttered by a 12 year old speaks of the way the kids of the ghetto use their pistols as toys. Overall, a beautiful masterpiece that will take you on a time travel to the 60's Rio.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Amazing, Take-Your-Breath-Away Work of Art!","Just finished watching this great film - 5/4/05. Wow! This was so amazingly great.You can believe all of the 10-star reviews - and look, there are a lot.. Can a movie BE this good?! Yes. THIS is the reason why I watch movies. Think Pulp Fiction meets Amores Perros meets Snatch meets New Jack City - WOW! What a great film! Also note: The only thing mentioned in the bad reviews seems to be the violence, and granted, violence is not for everyone, and the subtitles. Well, the Godfather I and II, widely held as some of the greatest movies of all time, are subtitled throughout quite a bit of the movie. So is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and so is Seven Samurai. But you know what? This movie is better than all of them. I'm not saying the best of all time, but I am saying this movie took my breath away. I was on the edge of my seat, never wanting it to end.

What's the big deal?,"I have seen some documentaries on how Brazilian police can storm homes with no warrants. And Brazilian shop-owners will pay to murder homeless children because they steal from them. The movie has an 8.7 of 10 rating on IMDb.com. This is an incredible rating, needless to say. I found the camera work far above the norm. The direction was good, but I felt they stole a bit from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Also, the story has been done before...poor community, drug dealing, corrupt cops, etc. I think the movie could have rocked if it was 25 minutes shorter, the characters more descriptive and understanding. After viewing the movie, it's difficult for me to understand how it received such high ratings. I found this movie no where near the top 100. It has no place among the best. The photography alone should not justify an 8.7. The story was full of holes, and again, it had been told before in hundreds if not thousands of other cultures.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"a powerhouse crime saga, with a fierce, daunting fusion of style","City of God played for months on end at an the Angelika theater in New York City back in 2003, and I was hesitant whether or not I should go there to spend ten dollars and to sit in a little theater with a packed audience, or to wait in video. I gave in to my temptations to see the film, from what I heard from various reviewers, and by the end, I knew it was truly worth the admission, and then some. Director Fernando Meirelles, along with co-director Katia Lund, crafts a film that steams so much with a passion to tell this story, to reveal all these characters (most of which who wear their flaws right on their sleeves like badges of honor), and to be honest with how their tales unfold, that even the most die-hard of action film or gangster connoisseur will feel the visceral, hardcore nature of the City of God long after the lights come up, subtitles and all.This true story (from a novel by Paulo Lins, former resident in the slums) is told, much like Scorsese's master-work Goodfellas, in a kind of flashback format where the narrator takes us back to the City of God when the lower class were shuffled into the slums of Rio De Janeiro without much hope. Our narrator, who only calls himself Rocket until the end, lives amongst the Tender Trio, friends of his whom start out robbing oil trucks and whatever they can get their hands on to stay alive. An impromptu heist at a motel gets the cops swarming, and the trio becomes scattered, though not dissolved. As it proceeds into the seventies, we find out that some members of the group died, a few went to jail, and Rocket stays on the sidelines, hoping to become a professional photographer with little or no assets to become one in and outside of the City of God.Then there's Li'l Dice (played through most of the film by the equally terrifying and gleeful Firmino Da Hora), who in the first act of the film is a kid who's the smallest among the bunch of older teens who make more or less successful robberies, though as Rocket says ""You need more than guts to be a good gangster, you need ideas."" In flashback (not to spoil) we discover what went down at the motel that night, and from there in a brilliant stroke of editing we see how Li'l Dice became Li'l Ze, who rises up little by little in the drug dealing schematics of the slum and soon takes over a supplier to sell cocaine. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) may be the protagonist viewers can identify with, but Li'l Ze is as fascinating an antagonist as any I have seen in a long time, who masks his insecurities with boyish joy in all of the mayhem he creates. Otherwise without hope, Li'l Ze becomes the dominant supplier in the slums, something of a tyrannical businessman, and as his story unfolds as does Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who becomes Ze's rival in the eighties.The only way a movie like this could work is if we feel for the characters plights and heights and such, even if they're evil in nature like Li'l Ze, Carrot, and Knockout Ned. That's why the filmmakers plunge us right into the City of God, and the nature of the city, and while the narrator may pass judgment on people he's known his whole life, he like us know why they're up to no good. The thieves and dealers and killers became such by looking up to their role models, the older hoods of the region, and with each younger group of kids who want to smoke dope and vandalize is another and another. As long as you don't get caught with your pants down by the cops, or get raided by chance, the odds for anarchy are in your favor in such a place. We understand equally why Rocket wants to get out of the city his own way as much as we understand the wars between the gangs, and this crucial facet makes the film work extraordinarily well to its advantage. Indeed, we understand the tragedies of such minor roles as the Runts- the orphans of the streets- much as we would understand the importance of such roles as in a Dickens novel.Along with this technique of storytelling, is the way it's filmed that's eye grabbing. The first scene shows in fast action a chicken chase, and then our hero between the gang and the cops viewed in a tailspin fashion as we are sent back to the beginning. Then, we get all the energy of even the simplest of scenes, and the hidden passion (Rocket on the beach with Angelica, for example) all by the mostly hand-held photography by Cesar Charlone, and the break-neck editing (i.e. the montage of how Li'l Ze makes a name for himself, or the disco dance sequence) by Daniel Rezende.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This is it. The Top. Cannot Get Better. Nothing Surpasses,"This is my first time reviewing a film in IMDb or any site. This seemed liked the perfect title for me to start with. The reason is because no other film has ever effected me like City Of God.To start off I want to say that like anyone that uses this site on a regular basis,,,,I've seen a TON of movies. From American classics all the way to disturbing Japanese gorefests.City Of God takes every single aspect of modern cinema and storytelling to the peak of what a film can be. A lot of ""normal"" people will immediately stop watching once they realize they will have to read through subtitles. This is one of the most unfortunate mistakes a human can make because of all the amazing foreign films that people miss out on.Fernando Meirelles needs to be recognized as an elite director for making this masterpiece. The film's opening scene with the kids chasing the chicken and shooting at it to catch is perfect. I think the important point of the films shows the innocence of all the characters mixed with the brutality of the environment they are raised in. The violence of it is powerful in certain parts showing how there is no shame or feeling in the outcome of their actions. The scene where Lil Ze catches up with the runts is still one of the most disturbing scene I can think of.The cinematography is in every way what you want. A distinguished look. The colors of every room and street mixed with the time lapse scene in the drug apartment is fantastic.The sound editing and score are perfect for everything you are seeing on the screen.This is really a movie I would and do recommend to anyone that wants to take a change on a foreign film. I have a lot of fanboy movies i love like certain big budget scifi movies from Cameron and Lucas of course,,,but for some reason when someone asks me what my favorite movie is I always come back to City Of God and say its the best. It's not necessarily my ""favorite"" movie because that would be too hard to generalize.So if you come across this online or see it at a video store and your wondering what this is,,,,please give it a chance so your not missing out on a true masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the most realistic & powerful movies ever!,"Coming from being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings series because of its epic and powerful impact, I watched City of God that was set in a closer to modern time and a poverty-stricken location. Even knowing that, the realism and powerful impact that City of God had upon me was at the same epic level as Lord of the Rings. The acting was not the best I have ever seen, although it still was excellent and didn't hurt the movie at all. The emotions that it brought out and the realism that I felt while watching every moment of it was incomparable to any other movie I have watched. It really brought me fully into the action and to the story, and I felt like I was truly experiencing it. It drew me in fully through the end with its Tarantino style story-telling and captivating recollections through the eyes of Rocket the photographer. In all honesty, I almost can't believe it was a movie. It was so realistic and so well done, that it felt like a documentary capturing the true occurrences of every scary and powerful moment of this story. It was that realistic and that powerful, that I couldn't believe behind each scene there was a director coordinating every moment; as it all just flowed so smoothly together from start to finish. Every scene was perfectly detailed and constructed and the director's brilliance emanated from the screen during every minute that passed by. All in all a brilliant creation worthy of the recognition and appreciation it has received from those who have been privileged enough to see and enjoy what is City of God.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Have you lost your mind? You are just a kid!""","Brutally honest and crude, Fernando Meirielles movie, born and filmed in the Brazil slums, raises above pure cliché and inevitability. You can either be a hood, a policeman or a worker, routinely victimized and barely able to scrap a living. The experience is hard to watch at times and at others artful and fun. This is brilliant storytelling through the combination of editing, vision and narrative. The result is how personal the story becomes through the eyes of young Rocket, our protagonist photographer, whose simple desires seem to be cruelly thwarted as if this is what all kids in the favelas experience. Following the decades' trends, we see the rise and fall of the angry and insecure gangster, Ze Pequena, possibly the scariest of gangsters ever to make the big screen. Gritty and a real as it gets, City of God translates as a cool gangster film as well as a very well told universal story of survival.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Authentic and indelible,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This Brazilian Portuguese language film set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ""City of God,"" is a mesmerizing coming of age gangsta drama second to none you'll ever see. At the same time it is a tale of redemption and the triumph of relative good over relative evil.Representing evil is the psychopathic L'il Dice/L'il Zé (Douglas Silva/Leandro Firmino da Hora), who kills people just for the joy it gives him. Representing the good is the story's narrator, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who will grow out of the slum to become a newspaper photographer. And representing something in between is the charismatic Benny (Phellipe Haagensen). The acting is excellent, including that by the ""runts,"" actual kids from the City of God; but what carries the film is sharp direction by Fernando Meirelles from an outstanding script by Braulio Mantovani from a novel by Paulos Lins.I think Hollywood directors ought to note well that it is the authentic realism of the film as seen from within the City of God by one of its own that makes this such a compelling experience for the audience. None of this can be faked. True, the story is a bit romanticized as a (very talented) kid might tell it to his friends, but that is all the better because the world view of those kids is part of what makes this film so effective. Additionally, all the little side stories: the woman at the newspaper who takes Rocket home with her for, shall we say, personal reasons; the story of the girl Rocket loves; the desire of the ""runts' to be men, etc., add layers of genuineness that also can not be faked or dreamed up by any filmland script writer. These things have to be lived.Last time I looked Cidade de Deus was rated #17 at IMDb, ahead of hundreds of great films. There's not much I can add to that. Is the film over-rated? I think so, and I think it will fall in the standings as time goes by. Good recent films tend to get a lot of attention, and then reach their level after some years have passed and they can be evaluated more objectively. Regardless, this is a watermark film for the Brazilian cinema and especially for director Fernando Meirelles who because of it rocketed from obscurity to world-wide fame almost overnight.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Life & Death on the mean streets in ""The City of God""","****SPOILERS**** The movie ""The City of God"" starts where it ends with a bloody showdown between the Li'lZe mob and their very young allies ""The Young Runts"" having it out with the Carrot and Ned Knockout gang. Sandwiched between those two scenes are a number of brutal killings that dull your senses and condition you for the movies ferocious and climactic bloodbath. Savage and surrealistic movie about life and death in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and how great the odds are for anybody surviving in that ""Hell on Earth"".The movie starts out with eight young men growing up in ""The City of God"" with only one of them remaining alive by the time the movie is over. Rocket is by far the most sympathetic of those in the movie as he tries all throughout the film, and in the end succeeds, in overcoming the odds against him to become a productive and law-abiding citizen but also a top Brazilian newspaper photographer. I felt that it was Ned Knockout who was the best example of how those mean and deadly ""City of God"" streets drive both young and old alike into a life of crime and violence even, unlike Rcket, if they do their best to avoid it.Ned a quiet and peaceful young man was publicly humiliated by the brutal and vicious thug in the movie Li'lZe. Not having tortured Ned enough Li'lZe and his gang came to Ned's home where they murdered his brother Gelson when he tried to defend and protect Ned. This tragedy was compounded when Ned in a rage killed a number of the Li'lze mob and then joined up with the Carrot gang to battle the Li'lZe mob and their Young Runt allies.During a bank robbery by the Carrot mob Ned shot and killed a bank guard who's son Max later joined the Carrot mob to avenge his fathers death. In the final street battle in the movie Ned is shot and killed by the son of the man that he murdered Max as he was trying to save his, Max's, life. All this after Ned was shot and badly wounded by the Li'lZe mob .Both Ned and Max were at first innocent bystanders who turned to crime because of circumstances beyond their control and ended up both killing and getting killed in the whirlpool of violence that engulfed the ""City of God"".The movie plays like one of those 1930's and 40's Warner Brothers crime movies where neighborhood crime becomes a part of the lives of those who live there and the theater audience can only accept the violence on the screen since there's no way for those in the movie to get out of that brutal environment. The acting in the film by mostly a cast of unknowns is surprisingly good with a very skillful directing effort by L. Mireiles. Mireiles keeps the story flowing smoothly and keeps the violence in check and at the same time makes it very effective and realistic. The ending of the movie with Li'lZe getting blasted to pieces by a group of the members of ""The Young Runts"" his allies who turned on him, many of them then under 12 year old, showed how the cycle of death and violence continues. A none ending cycle of death and destruction that effects those living on the mean streets and knowing nothing else. Even at a very young and impressionable age in the pitiless and merciless horror called ""The City of God"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the greatest movies ever made,"In my opinion, a good movie is one that tells an important and entertaining story, makes you feel a range of emotions and makes you believe and feel for the events that are happening on screen. It should be able to do this by harmonising acting, writing, directing, post production and sound. And when I think about movies that have been able to exceed these expectations, often City of God is one of the first titles that pops up in my head.City of god takes a look at the lives of various kids and teenagers involved in a turf war in the slums of Brazil that spans over 2 decades. Life in the slums, corruption, gang violence and growing up in a dangerous place are some of the themes addressed in the film. It has a unique storytelling structure, transitions from one story of a 'hood rat' (or gangster) to another, before they intertwine in the climax.The characters of the film are amazingly likable and relatable. The slightly psychotic tyrant 'Lil'ze', Peace loving Ned, charming Benny and lovelorn Shaggy are some of the more prominent characters in the movie. My favourite would be Rocket, the narrator. He aims to be uninvolved in the turf war and become a successful photographer. All he wants to do is mind his own business, stay alive and get laid. That's about as relatable character a movie character will ever be. The raw and emotional acting of the cast makes the movie all the more memorable and authentic.One of the main filmmaking achievement of City of god is the way that it immerses the audience in its unfamiliar setting through brilliant editing and music. The famous opening, the 'chicken chase' sequence, is a perfect example of this. The actors, played mostly by residents of the slums itself, provide great authenticity. They manage to provide great, believable acting performances as well, despite having no prior experience in the craft.Despite being an emotionally impactful story, this movie still has several scenes that ooze coolness, without straying away too much from the actual grittiness of the subject material. Also, there are several witty dialogue scenes that help to prevent the film from getting too gloomy. Without scenes like Ned on the bus, Rocket taking photos of the gang and Benny's party, these characters would be mere participants in the harrowing events of the area. These scenes are crucial in highlighting one of the film's main theme: That these hood rats and gangsters are, at the heart of it all, still humans like the rest of us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of Brilliance,"This saga about kids growing up in a violent and drug-infested neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro is fresh and vibrant from its droll opening scene to its riveting finale.

The tension is palpable throughout, specially in a heart-wrenching scene where one child is prodded to shoot another as a gang initiation ritual. Although the subject matter is violence, the film never dwells on it, focusing instead on characters and circumstances. There is fine ensemble acting from a cast of non-stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A stunningly good film,"""City of God"" is a quite brilliant film that portrays three decades - the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s - of child and adult drugs gang warfare in the slums (favelas) outside Rio de Janeiro. Its quality is all the more astonishing given that many of its stars are non-professional actors who seemingly act out their own personal experiences for the camera.The film is set in a crime-ridden housing project known as Cidade de Deus (City of God). It focuses on two young boys - Li'l Dice (who becomes known as Li'l Ze, when an adult) and Rocket - whose lives develop in opposite directions. Rocket attempts to escape the crime, violence, drug-dealing and killing that is the norm for young men and adults who live in Cidade de Deus. He is fascinated by photography and attempts to pursue that as a career. Li'l Dice opts to go with the flow, and with his determination and ambition for power and control becomes a ruthless drugs dealer and eventually the head of one of the gangs that control life in the favela. The plot highlights the turf war that is waged with ruthless violence between the different gangs in Cidade de Deus over drugs, money and (to them, perhaps most important of all) influence, control and power.""City of God"" is absorbing and extremely thought-provoking. Living as I do in the relative comfort of middle class London, I can only imagine what life must be like for the people portrayed in the film. ""City of God"", which seems from this relatively safe distance to be infused with a gritty realism that few feature films possess, makes one realise in no uncertain terms the extent to which all our lives are governed by an accident of birth. How would any of us cope if we were born and brought up in circumstances like those of the characters in the film that are almost impossible to escape from?The narrative structure of the film is excellent. The principal characters are introduced to the viewer one by one and at a particular point in their lives, usually when they are relatively young. The film then returns to their story later on in their lives when they have become more adult and have been exposed more fully to the difficult circumstances which they have to confront head on. There is a judicious use of narration and of flashback, both of which help to explain what motivates each character's actions. The acting, the cinematography and the direction are superb. What is more, the film does not romanticise the violent lives on display. And, (how can I put this without giving too much away?), it does not - as many films of this sort probably would - opt for a wholly redemptive and hopeful ending. Indeed, one of the many messages of the film is how difficult it is to escape from a life of poverty and violence, on a generational as well as an individual basis.""City of God"" is a brilliant, almost faultless film. It's a masterpiece of modern cinema. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"With an array of resonating performances and flawless direction, it is sure to be one of the greatest films one will ever see.","One of the most powerful dramas of the decade is 'City of God.' Fernando Meirelles proves that he can run with the most acclaimed directors in modern cinema with this film. His disciplined style is vigorously enchanting as much as it is appealing. For his furious and violent tale, 'City of God,' he portrays, with shocking realism, the slums of Rio de Janeiro from the late 60's to the mid 80's, where crime was the way out and those not involved were the suckers. But among these criminals and suckers is a minority of those dedicated the goodness that is often overlooked in cities as torn as Rio, and Meirelles exemplifies that notion through a young photographer and the story he comes to tell.The film follows a boy named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), whose dream is to become an accomplished photographer. Growing up, Rocket was raised in a lower-class quarter of Rio's Ciudad de Deus (City of God), in which most of his peers had aspirations of becoming the City of God's next big thing  whether the path they led was bright or familiar. Among them was Lil' Dice, a young boy who ran with a gang of hoodlums whose main intention was stealing, though had killed before.As years progressed, both Rocket and Lil' Dice meandered down very different corridors; Rocket found fulfillment in honesty and kindness, whereas Lil' Dice eventually found himself the city's most infamous drug-runner, Ze Pequeno, or Lil' Ze. Soon before long, the City of God is ravaged by unseen violence, led by Lil' Ze, and Rocket is capturing the horrific footage via his hand-held camera. While Rocket's intentions focus on keeping down an honest, clean path, he finds that he can make amends with both Lil' Ze and the local police, by submitting photos of Ze and his entourage to the tabloids. Win-win for both, eh? Not quite. Even those who find success, struggle in the City of God, and by film's end that fact is recognized by all  and it's not soon forgotten either.The screenplay, adapted by Braulio Mantovani from Paulo Lins' novel of the same name, allows viewers to relate and reside with its characters and surrender their absolute emotion to a film that exhausts each and every emotion imaginable. Retrospectively, Meirelles' demand for the viewer's attention, through unwavering brutality and almost dizzying camera-work, makes for intense movie-viewing and enthralling entertainment. Additionally, the film carries a surrealistic beauty  and is shot with an overexposed lens that brightens the photography and implies perfectly the authenticity of the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro  that elevates the heart when the movie reaches burrowing depths. All in all, 'City of God' is flawless; and with an array of resonating performances and flawless direction, it is sure to be one of the greatest films one will ever see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tough movie,"Very tough movie portraying the lives of kids/teenagers in one of Rio's favelas. What I liked most about the movie is the way in which it is told, through the eyes of one of the kids who manages to escape the harsh reality of the favela. I also like the flashback following the opening scene in which a group of kids tries to catch an escaped rooster. The freeze-frame shots are very nice as well. It is a very fast paced movie and sometimes it is hard to keep track of all that is happening especially because the movie covers a couple of decades. I saw this movie after visiting Rocinha in Rio the week before. I did not realize until after having seen the movie that Seu Jorge plays the role of Mane Galinha. He makes beautiful music these days and one of his quotes is really frightening ""The other actors were ... curious. They wanted to know if the favelas are really like that. I said unfortunately they're much worse.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An ironic title for an artistic movie about crime,"City of God refers to a crime-ridden slum suburb in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This movie follows the lives of several children and teenagers living there from the end of the sixties to the start of the eighties. I found this crime drama more shocking and disturbing than many traditional horror movies. Why? Because most of the characters in there are totally amoral and compassion-less, even enjoying their foul deeds. Worst, some of the offenders are children. There's not much gore but it's very violent and feels very realistic.Most of the actors are unknown and their acting is not noticeable as acting, feels very natural. It's like you're a voyeur of something you wouldn't want to be stuck in. All the characters except perhaps a couple are not likable at all yet they're fascinating to watch. The story based on a book based on true events is gripping and really well told with separated titled chapters (such as the Story of Knockout Ned). The directing is top-notch with some dynamic camera work and sharp editing (already visible in the chicken chase introduction). If you're interested in organized crime movies a la Goodfellas mixed in with some Tarantino style (not the dialog though) in a poor Brazilian hood, this powerful movie is for you. I always find it ironic how gangsters are so religious yet commit atrocities. It's even more ironic in this seemingly god-forsaken ill-named city of god.Rating: 8 1/2 stars out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A great movie,"This is maybe one of my favorite movies. It can kick the big ass of the most films of Hollywood. It's a shame that it didn't win an Oscar.Very well-appreciated if you really know the Rio de Janeiro's situation. I should advice that I'm a huge fan of Brazilian movies and maybe I'm not being honest but seeing the average rate of that movie I think I'm not wrong.The story is very well-told.

"""What should have been swift revenge turned into an all out war. The City of God was divided.""","Planned and executed by the state government of Guanabara, the quarter of Cicade de Deus (City of God) was built in 1960 as part of a policy to remove all favelas (shanty towns; slums) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ""We came to the City of God hoping to find paradise,"" reminisces Rocket, our narrator. ""Many families were homeless due to flooding and acts of arson in the slums the big wigs in government didn't joke around. Homeless? Off to City of God!"" Nowadays, Cicade de Deus is infamous as a high crime quarter, rife with social problems. ""There was no electricity, paved streets or transportation. But for the powerful, our problems didn't matter. We were far too removed from the picture postcard image of Rio de Janeiro."" Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund's acclaimed Brazilian film ""City of God"" dares to veer from this ""postcard image"" of Brazilian life, creating an intense and uncompromising glimpse at life in the violent and drug-infested slums at the heart of the city.The story, which spans the 1960s and 1970s, follows two parallel lives in the Cicade de Deus. Rocket is a quiet, honest boy who dreams of becoming a photographer. Whilst nobody in this city is truly innocent, Rocket perhaps comes closest. His father was a fishmonger, and the older brother he respects, Clipper, is a hood (short for hoodlum) who  with two other close friends, Goose and Shaggy - forms the Tender Trio, who acquire their money through theft.The second child is Li'l Dice, who will later rise to be known as Li'l Zé. An ambitious young boy who often trails the Tender Trio, Li'l Dice attains his first experience of murder via a shockingly revelational flashback. Li'l Dice subsequently grows to become the dominant drug dealer in Cicade de Deus, after successfully eliminating most of his competition and taking over their businesses.Perhaps the first thing you'll notice about this film is that it is visually stunning. César Charlone's beautiful hand-held camera-work perfectly captures the beauty and horror of Cicade de Deus' chaotic everyday occurrences. Whilst sometimes you feel that the camera darts all over the place unnecessarily, this also offers the film a documentary-like feel, brutally reminding you that this is based on a true story.'City of God' is an unapologetically intense film, and it certainly is not for the faint of heart. The overwhelming combination of violence, drugs and rape (and the very idea that children as young as ten or so were taking part in all of this) made me nauseous at times, and I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was a rewarding experience, and I'm glad that I did watch it, but I can't say it was fun. In fact, I felt quite depressed afterwards. Yes, I suppose this just isn't my sort of movie. For what it's worth, I much preferred watching Fernando Meirelles' follow-up film, 'The Constant Gardener' (2005).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masterpiece,"City of God is a Masterpiece. With all the rubbish that is coming out of Hollywood these days, this Brazilian movie shows that plot and substance will smash CGI special effects any day of the week. Not for the weak of heart, COG is shocking, confronting, and also fascinating. It depicts real life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, where the horror of drug warfare is juxtaposed with spectacular scenery and beauty. Unlike the privileged few, the favelados are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and violence, which is almost impossible to escape from. Hollywood could learn more than a thing or two from this movie, it far surpasses any other action movie of the past decade. Simply a must see. 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Just one of those films with furious and intense energy.,"City of God falls under the pile of unflinching movies, movies that aren't afraid to be brutally realistic. If you are going to tell a story about gang wars, corrupt police, and hardship, you can't make it PG-13 and turn your camera every time someone gets shot. That just feels so fake. It is fake! This film tells it like it is. It is true to the story and to life. That is one reason I think City of God is great - its upsetting and powerful because it is furiously real.The other reason is simply because the story telling is excellent. Very excellent. Fernando Meirelles does an excellent job weaving the plot between the many different characters, and time periods. Not to mention the great acting, cinematography, and pretty much every other technical aspect.City of God is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliant,"You know, a classmate of mine told me for years I had to see this movie, and since we like the same kind of movies, I just knew it had to be great. Still, it lasted for about 3 years 'til I actually saw the movie.Well, I was totally blown away! I watched it with my boyfriend, and nothing could prepare me for the realistic feeling this movie gives you. Normally, I really don't feel like watching a movie for 130 minutes, (I really think movies shouldn't be any longer than 90 minutes tops, but that aside) but by this movie I didn't want it to end. And that's rather crazy, because it's horrible what you see. And it makes it even more horrible to know that this is what's happening out there. You just know it by watching this movie.I'll never forget a certain scene, involving two little kids and a couple of older kids, where one of the little kids starts to cry so intensely, it breaks your heart. I almost started to belief that this was no longer acting, but that this was what was happening at that moment, but then I thought: no way the director would do such a thing to this little boy, especially when you think about the reason why he even bothered to make this movie.Well anyway, the thing is, you've got to be kind of prepared for this movie. It's no happy ending like we all see in those Hollywood-blockbusters, it's no horror like we see in the same movies, it's no thrill like we see in the same movies and it's even no humor like we see in those movies. Yes, even though the topic of this film is horrible, there's still a sense of humor in it too. And why? Because the director didn't direct this movie from one side of the story, but from both sides. You get to see the reason why those kids do what they do, what happened to them, why they choose to be with this man rather than with the other, why their lives are so bad, they really don't have another choice than this one. And all this time the director stays close with his people; he's not overdoing it. He knows why he's filming this and he knows how he wants to film this and he stays with that. You'll never get the feeling that this is such a Hollywood movie about a terrible topic, that in the end wants you to confess your sins and say: 'Yeah, you're right, we should do something about this, I should give my own life to do something about this.' None of that crap in Cidade De Deus: yeah, sure, he wants you to know what's going on and he's so straightforward that you'll feel like he's slapping you in the face, but nowhere you will find that thing Hollywood-movies do to you; he lets you think what you want to think. Just see and undergo this. Be one of their neighborhood for once. And he did a damn well job!Go and see, really, you'll be blown away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Then we see films like these, that they show another reality to us and we were scared, and we are thankful to have the sufficient thing to live and to be able to give our pleasures us.

I didn't get the connection to GoodFellasbecause while those guys grew up together, they are older whenwe meet them, and their economic environment is very middle-class as opposed to the flavelas of Rio where the grindingpoverty is soul-destroying.The corruption that infects all levels of Rio society is sickeningfrom the drug and gun dealers to the crooked police and even thecynical media.  The scene about the violence in the City of God hasbecome so bad, that the media is now reporting on it, thereforeforcing the police to do something, left me slack-jawed.  This kindof insane lawlessness has to be answered.In the end, this is a movie with a message of  grim hope,astonishing as Rocket has begun to fulfill his dream of becominga photographer.  No such luck falls to Ned whose dreams arecompletely destroyed by the horrible violence of the flavelas withtheir drugs and their indifference to violence.  Any movie thatshows children  wielding guns as though they are toys should bea wake-up call.

"A thoroughly absorbing, powerful and unforgettable movie experience","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA film set in Rio De Janeiro's infamous City of God, an area in which combat photographer's fear to tread, police rarely go and residents are lucky if they live to the age of twenty. The film opens in the 1960s, where a young Rocket, who is too scared of being killed or hurt to become a gang member, dreams of becoming a photographer later in life. In the meantime, a street gang which includes his older brother, rules the streets, holding up gas trucks and stores. But this doesn't provide enough money, so his gang, along with a young boy named L'il Dice, engineer a raid on a fancy hotel, planning to make off with a good deal of cash but not to kill any one. This plan, of course, goes pear shaped and in the aftermath, the police launch a major sweep on the slum to catch the culprits. But things really heat up when Rocket's older brother has an affair with the wife of a local man and, when it is discovered, is forced to flee the slum and, unfortunately, he doesn't make it out alive.A decade later, Rocket is now older and a bit more guided. But the terror of the street gangs continues, with one drug dealing (where the real money is) gang lead by the irredeemable L'il Ze, who used to be the boy L'il Dice, and his best friend from childhood Benny, and another, ruthless but more rounded gang of drug dealers lead by Carrot. But when L'il Ze gang rapes the girlfriend and kills the brother of a local pacifist, everything culminates into a brutal final confrontation between all the gangs dominating Rio de Janeiro before the cycle of violence starts up all over again.Brazil's Rio De Janeiro is probably one of the first places that springs to mind whenever anyone mentions the subject of gangs and gang violence. And with good reason since it is certainly one of the worst, with such shocking statistics as mentioned above. And, in spanning three decades of trouble and strife in the area, film maker Fernando Meirelles has crafted one of the most extremely thorough, unbelievably engrossing and totally satisfying films you are likely to see, a searing, powerful and at times very disturbing examination of characters caught up in the violence. We have a character, warped and twisted from a young age (who may well have become as bad as he does if he was raised in Swindon instead of Rio) and who grows up to show no signs of changing down his road of evil (managing one or two distressing scenes along with it.) Another character part of the cycle of death and violence but who still manages to come off as a nice, affable guy all the same but who's fate is sealed when he tries to find a way out. Another character who, even on the path of retribution, tries to stay ethical and remain a good person but who circumstances dictate ends up becoming as bad as those he's going after. And one last character whose own weariness of violence and single ambition is probably what keeps him on the straight and narrow till the end and produces probably the only happy ending in the film. Other than that, we finish on a scene of a group of young street orphans roaming the war-torn streets, talking about how the money's not in robberies but drugs, and that the mostly tragic events we've just seen are about to repeat themselves in a film that could be exactly the same.IMDb users generally know what they're talking about, and they've voted a most satisfying film in at #16, a mostly downbeat and disturbing but still sweeping, soaring and utterly absorbing account of a place where misery and bloodshed is doomed to continue, which sweeps by at just over two hours (even quicker on second viewing) and also boasts a fine soundtrack to boot (including the ultimate one hit wonder Kung Fu Fighting.) What film-making is all about. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
violence begets violence,"the abundance of handguns says it all.they are very deadly, and the scene where the young hood kills all the people at the hotel and smiles in a flashback is typical of the motivations of far too many hoodlums. they kill not in the course of committing a crime out of necessity to carry out the deed, like shooting an armed security guard, no, they kill for fun and because no one can stop them in the moment.I have fired handguns but not recently, and only at a target range, so I understand the dangers of the bullets flying out at a thousand feet per second. once it leaves the barrel anyone in front is doomed. and the finger pressure to make that happen can be done by a child.city of god should be a warning to us all on the costs of crime and violence. building a city, educating the young and creating conditions that give them job opportunities takes a long time and a lot of work; this is why so many choose the 'easy' way of crime.it is also telling that at one point you start to lose track of who is in what gang and what they have done, and then all the even younger hoodlums get guns and start shooting up the place. and then subtly the action moves into the big city, they are no longer in the shanty town.a depressing film but one that should be seen at least once.I definitely wouldn't rank it so high up in the top 250.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"It doesn't suffice to call ""City of God"" a Brazilian ""Mean Streets"".","""Cidade de Deus"" (called ""City of God"" in English) knocks the breath out of you. This story of life in Brazilian slums makes you feel like you're in the slums with the characters. It follows Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) as he grows up in these places, and then joins a gang. You see, in these slums, either you join a gang or nothing ever becomes of you. So, Rocket is pulled through a world of drugs, violence, and every ugly thing that you can imagine; it's his only ticket out of complete isolation.I figure that some people would jump to call ""City of God"" a Brazilian ""Mean Streets"". Methinks that such a description doesn't suffice. This movie is far more profane, far more graphic than ""Mean Streets"" (although they both treat the same kind of subject). Of course, it's extreme, no-holds-barred portrayal of the desperation and violence of this existence is what makes this movie so good. I think that Brazilian Pres.

A real shot to the heart,"City of God (2002, ***1/2) is a brutal look at the drug wars fought in Rio de Janeiro's slums over a period of several decades. It's not always an easy film to watch, but it's utterly gripping and (improbably) humorous at turns.The movie centers on a boy/young man named Rocket (Buscapé in Portuguese, the spoken language in this movie) in the titular slum, the wrong side of the tracks in Rio. Rocket's older brother is in a gang called the Tender Three; this trio commits armed robbery but gives at least some of the proceeds to their impoverished brothers and sisters. The gang's not for long in this story, as one of their sidekick Little Rascals, Li'l Dice (Douglas Silva) has higher aspirations; soon he – under a new moniker, Li'l Ze' – is the top kingpin in the City of God. Ze's chief rival, as time goes by, is a ginger-top named Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele). As Carrot and Ze' fight each other for control of, well, everything, Rocket tries hard to stay above and out of the fray. He's not entirely successful.The movie is quickly paced. If you don't pay attention you may lose track of who's who, if only because there are plenty of supporting characters. Alice Braga, niece to one Sonia Braga, plays a one-time love interest for Rocket. Hers was the only familiar face for me, but many of the fine young actors (or nonactors, as the case may be) offered compelling standout performances.And this was all based on a true story, as they say. During the closing credits news footage, including interviews with gang members, is shown. The real Rocket appears, as well. Most striking? Might be the group of little kids known as the Runts; this cohort robs, maims, and kills everyone they can – ostensibly under the control of Carrot, but truthfully subservient to none.

Astonishing in its matter-of-fact violent bluntness that sends a shock to the senses to see pre-adolescents brandishing all sorts of weapons and killing for the fun of it; rampant anarchy peppered with moments of innocence.

"Believable and welcome South American life-in-the-ghetto diary, but ultimately too character cluttered, repeating and limited.","The violent, and often shambolic, life and times of the Rio de Janeiro favela (or slum) told from the point of view of two contrasting former schoolboy friends. Filmed in the modern ""shaky hand-held camera"" fashion to give it a documentary look-and-feel.(Something we will return to later.)The great problem with the English speaking mass cinema audience is that they rarely go anywhere abroad outside of tourist traps and have little interest in the Third World. Well outside of outrageous disasters - whether man-made or natural - which quickly slip from our TV screens or newspapers within days of their conclusion.Therefore when cinema takes a stroll down these new avenues it comes as a complete surprise to the virgin audience who get the full head trip. So Brazil is not all long beaches, endless samba beat and sexy girls in dental floss thongs? Well I didn't know that! Shock! Horror! Something must be done!(IMDb always seems to give a bonus mark for a new and different location - Cidade de Deus being only the latest recipient.)For most this product will be the only education about the Brazilian favela (slum) that they will ever get - but at least it is a believable portrait. Nevertheless it is not the last word on the subject and covers only limited ground. Indeed it is a classic example of a film that starts well - loses its way in the middle section - before it arrives at the only climax (and closing impression) which is conceivable.A bit more social context about Brazilian class society would have been welcome - but maybe the budget didn't run to it. Not travelling back in time. This film's idea of background detail is a lone period car! We needed the ""other Brazil"" - but, baring a few voice-over references all we get is a few token scenes in a supermarket or in a newspaper office.(The media types are shown as friendly, warm and caring in perfect contrast to the police who are shown as being totally corrupt. Almost on a parallel to the gangsters. I wonder which camp the writer comes from?)This film has been compared to Goodfellers, and I can see why, but it isn't really in its league. If anything it is a home movie version of the Scorsese classic and needs constant voice-over and subtitles in order for it to make sense. Even with it I was lost several times, but that may have been trying to keep track of too many characters that looked - because of the passing of time - nothing like they did when first introduced!The plot is curiously male orientated when sex is not involved. Do these gangsters not have mothers, sisters, social workers, teachers or sensible relatives? The types that crop up in 40's Warner Brothers gangster pictures to give balance to the criminals and their life views. Overall the script spends too long in the gang hut with the venom-spitting hoods who alternate only between loading weapons and smoking dope.There is no real conventional acting in this movie, there is no need for it. Ducking, diving, shooting guns and looking scared is not that hard. Yes it convinces, but stupid/reckless/desperate Third World people are hard to pin down, how can you say anything is wrong? They march to a different drum.Here leadership seems awarded for recklessness as much as brains, but they have nowhere to go and little to say. Why should they? They have no education. There is only one business (drugs) and there is only one punishment for those that go against the interests of that business.(Once you establish life is cheap and taken on a whim, you don't need to go there again unless it is essential or part of the grand climax.)I am not all that fond of hand-held camera work. It allows you run around and this only results in lots of scenes of people running around. This establishes it as a real location, but doesn't really add any sense of composure. There are times when I feel I was running with the gang as part of it - while I really wanted to be a cold and distant condemning witness.Yes there is lots of questions, quibbles and short comings, but it is a powerful and thought provoking film. But it rather suffers from the Holocaust syndrome: It is hard to criticise the film without seeming to attack the honourable subject. Maybe director Fernando Meirelles has something - he certainly includes some masterful scenes here - but the limited characters overstay their welcome. I wouldn't want to watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Extremely somber and violent, but overall incredibly riveting","Not many crime films come as dark, gritty, or even violent as this one. And unlike most crime stories set in America, this film paints a brutally honest picture of the harrowing lifestyle that dictates the third-world country of Brazil. With the visceral direction by Fernando Merielles and Katia Lund, viewers are dragged into a grueling but significantly honest experience of the difficulties in growing up in a world where violence and crime is practically a way of life than an obstacle in society. Set in the 1960s and 1970s, the film takes place in Rio De Janeiro which most people refer to as City of God, a poverty-ridden city in Brazil where employment is very low, the crime rate is devastatingly high and just about everyone from young elementary-school age children to adults carry a gun. Those are not employed resort to robbery and murder for financial support. Enter Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues), a young boy growing up in the violent slums of Rio De Janeiro with the dreams of becoming of a photographer but finds his future obscured by the everyday crime including the robbery and homicide by his brother Goose (played by Renato De Souza) and his gang. Competing with his gang is Lil Ze (played by Leandro Firmino), a young boy with a thirst of violence who grows up to work his up the crime ladder to become the leader of the most dangerous gang in Rio De Janeiro. As these two gangs cross paths, the result is a war that spirals gravely out of control.This film is in no means fun to watch, it is extremely violent, brutally somber, and at times incredibly difficult to sit through. But the most earnest quality here is: it's authentic. While most crime films deal with characters getting involved outside the law to achieve something of their desires, this film tackles crime as a natural societal lifestyle simply because it takes place in a town in Brazil where violent crime is a composition of their society. And it doesn't try to glorify violence but to show the inhuman consequences that result in such heinous activity. Whenever a character, major and minor, is killed you can't help but feel deeply for the character, and the emotional resonance delivered in these scenes never feel forced. As the story moves, you watch as the main character develop from a boy struggling from moral ambiguity and the overwhelming influence of his fellow friends who rely on firearms to squeeze their way out of unwanted situations, to a young man who begins to realize the damage it causes him and roots for a better future. The outcome is one powerful character granted by an ingenious performance by Alexandre Rodrigues. The most compelling feature of this character however, comes from his conflict with Lil Ze and his gang. Leandro Firmino gives a intriguing performance as Lil Ze, a sociopathic young man wrapped in his own bloodlust since childhood and with no desire other than to be the most feared man in town. If you are not disturbed by flashbacks of him as a little boy shooting a man and woman while laughing like a child watching a clown at birthday party or a youngster forced to shoot a little kid in the foot, I don't know what will. The conflict that embroils between him and the main character Rocket provides a visceral tension that moves the story very well while paying plenty of emotional investment.City of God is a deeply riveting drama that leaves a powerful impact very few can deny. This is a film punctuated with astounding performances, solid writing, and an ultimately uncompromising direction. It is disappointing that this film was overlooked for an Oscar for Best Picture nomination, though it is likely due to the grim material. The film is worth watching but perhaps not one you'll want again after first viewing due to the dark atmosphere and overall brutality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My favourite movie of all time!,"For almost 4 years now, Die Hard had been the greatest film I had ever seen. It was top of my list of films, and it always shone as the top film, I never questioned it's position. I still do not question it's position today, simply because it is most definitely the second greatest film I have ever seen. City Of God is sensational, a masterpiece emanating from the slums of Brazil.The film starts off in a newly built City Of God, a favela in seemingly pretty good nick. The narrator, Rocket, is introduced. Rocket is a Nick Carraway from Great Gatsby sort of person. He does his best to stay honest, even talking to the audience in a way Nick Carraway does. He also tries his best not to be involved in anything, yet finds himself having a weak connection with every character in the film or book. In fact, Rocket's story is so close to that of Li'l Zé (legendary antagonist) that it becomes a plot point how far apart their lifestyles dictate them to be. Never has a film spoken so much to me about so many things. The physical and emotional power of drugs, crime and murder. The gang of Li'l Zé could be a band of misfits, composed of ginger haired cocaine addicts and aggressive 9 nine year olds, but more sinister gangs are we unlikely to come across in real lifeI often seem to have problems with the way death is treated in Western films. I remember the copious amounts of deaths, and it feels so dehumanised that I never fully enjoy western films. Clint Eastwood just shoots bandit after bandit, and never gets anything coming to him. In City Of God, every act, every murder of a person has a family behind it. A family that will seek revenge, and no matter how primary the antagonist or protagonist is, it will not make them any harder to kill. Clint Eastwood has Chuck Norris like abilities of invincibility if any of his Westerns are to be believed. These acts of retribution come as a shock to every character, as it does to the audience. It is so well made and true to life, that one cannot pick out who has what agenda. The film also uses flashbacks to now important dialogue, to enhance the facepalm at your own stupidity effect.Finally, the film making. This is what nails the film as being head and shoulders above the rest. Even Matrix-style bullet time shots are used, but they finish by being melted into a shot of the same character, but 20 years previously. Magic. We also get many scenes shown together in real time from different perspectives, and it never seems to be too much for the human eye. It beats 3D images any day of the year as well.The list can go on, but not without spoilers. If you are OK with themes such as drugs, murder, rape and heartless 8 year old psychopaths, then watch this film as soon as possible! Actually, even earlier if you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"First Half Is Bland, but The Final Half... (:Q______) Just STUNNING!","I don't know how to begin. It's one of those films you can't explain easily to anyone else but yourself.

Sure it doesn't offer that kind of vibe at first. But if you see through the whole movie, you won't regret it, just have to stay focused on the on screen stuffs.If I ever learn Portuguese, it would be to watch this movie again. It's kind of shame that I had to keep reading the subtitles, when the real deal was not in it.

Tarantino Lovers...,"I give City of God a brilliant 10 stars.I rented this DVD solely based on seeing the high score it received here on IMDb. It currently ranks in the Top 20 movies on here of all time and rightfully so.If you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino, then without question, you definitely need to check this film out. While Quentin did not direct this, the style is very similar to most of his flicks. In fact, ""City of God"" far surpasses anything done by QT.This movie has it all... action, suspense, comedy, gangs, mystery, drugs, violence and even a little romance thrown in here and there.The entire movie is subtitled, but the film is so good that you will be forgetting that the subtitles are there after 5 minutes or so.Finally, the film is completely original and there is nothing out there that closely resembles it. The characters and the acting are superb. These are seriously some of the best characters to ever appear on the Silver Screen. You'll love some of the characters, hate some of the characters, but you will be emotionally involved with all of them due to the superb writing that went into the script. It's a great movie and I highly recommend renting it ASAP.Happy Viewing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dissenting Opinion,"With nothing but rousing praise leading me into the theater, I should have expected such a disappointingly inauthentic and stylistically inappropriate film.  City of God is not half as depressing as others suggest, or as it should be, and the dialogue throughout is embarrassingly generic.  It had a glossy texture with doses of disturbing violence mixed into a mostly nostalgic and derivative coming of age story.  While I was never bored - there's certainly no lack of action or story telling energy - I never felt connected to these one-dimensional characters (except sometimes Benny).  People are introduced and killed off before we could ever feel emotionally connected to them (in this way the comparison to Pulp Fiction is valid, though Pulp Fiction was PULP, and this is supposed to be a meaningful film about the plight of street kids in Rio).  Overall, it's a big budget after school special. For a real film on the subject check out Bunuel's Los Olvidados.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Dazzling, dizzying, but ultimately just another shoot-em-up","Being based on a true story, having lots of non-actors, making some very imaginative choices in cinematography, and so forth, this film really throws a lot of stuff at you, and it is impressive in its ability to keep a great many plates spinning in the air (although to tell the truth, if the narrator had said ""but it's not time to tell So-and-so's story yet"" just one more time, I would have screamed).Unfortunately, the next day when you look back on the experience, you realize that all you really got was a couple of hours worth of just another gangland storyline with a little too much Guy-Ritchie-influenced camera work and more than a few this-will-get-them-talking shock cinema moments.Original grade: 6 out of 10. Worth seeing, probably not worth recommending.Revised grade (3/7/2012): 1 out of 10. Abysmal. Horribly bad in a way that makes me think less of people who think it's good.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece for the ages,"Set in the slums of 1960s and 70s Rio De Janeiro, this masterpiece somehow manages to be both a romantic coming-of-age tale, a brutal drama, and an action-packed gangster movie all in one.The cinematography is a visual feast and the palates used for the different eras of the film help define the climate and mood of the neighborhood at that particular time. Very well done. The visual style of the film is both exciting and innovative. Not the controlled camera movements of a slick American mafia flick but instead seems to be inspired by the rhythm of neighborhood in which the film takes place- very frenetic, raw, and loose camera-work that feels like a documentary at times while seamlessly sneaking in extremely stylish homages to gangster films of the past.The cast- which seems to be full of mostly non-actors and unknowns outside of Brazil- seems to be expertly chosen. There isn't a single second of the film that isn't believable.If you haven't seen this film yet it should be at the top of your list. Easily one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good Story; Good Acting; Good Backdrop,"This movie is a story about some people living in a Rio de Janeiro favela called A Cidade de Deus. It's an actual place built about 50 years ago that's one of the most well known favelas in Brasil.It's more than a story about gangsters. It explores the feelings and motivations behind the characters from the guy who seemed to be born to kill to a guy who worked hard at a job, had a girlfriend and nice family but joined a gang for revenge after becoming a victim of crime. It explores the different people living in the neighborhood from the kids to the gang members to the parents working hard at menial jobs trying to make ends meet. It's an interesting introduction to the culture.The movie is in Brazilian Portuguese but is available with English subtitles which is why I wanted to see it as I am trying to learn the language.An interesting fact is that a resident of this favela just won the world judo championship in her weight class. A decade ago while living in a Cidade de Deus, Rafaela Silva and her sister Raquel were discovered by some guys interested in developing the sport in Brasil. Over ten years later she becomes the first Brazilian woman world judo champion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Hell is Raised, in the City of God","Set in Brazil in the 1970s, the film tells the story of Rocket (Alexandre Rorigues in an excellent, understated performance), a teenage boy living in an extremely violent area of Rio de Janeiro called The City of God. Like most boys his age, all Rocket wants is to get laid, smoke a little blow and chill with his friends. However, the violence around him not only complicates this it throws him smack dab in the middle of it. When he loses his low paying job, he watches with envy the carefree life of the drug lords Lil Zee and Benny (Leandro Firmino and Phellipe Haagensen respectively) who run the ghetto. They flash money and ride brand new motor scooters through the streets of the hood. When he loses his girl to the more enigmatic gangster Benny, Rocket declares in frustration, ""It was like a message from God: Honesty doesn't pay, sucker."" Seeing delinquency as the only way to prosper, Rocket decides to pursue criminal ventures of his own. Fortunately, Rocket and his equally square buddy, prove to be the most inept of criminals. They don't even have the heart to rob a lost drunk who has unwittingly gotten lost in the slums. Rocket soon resigns himself to the fact he's no criminal. He's one of the nobodies. One of the thousands whose fate is in the hands of a few crazy fools with guns. Luckily for Rocket, fate was waiting around the corner with a better hand for him to play.Thanks to his love and expertise in photography, Rocket is given a brand new camera by the violent Li'l Zee. For Rocket, the camera is a life changer. It doesn't matter that the camera was bestowed upon him simply because none of Lil Zee's lunkhead bangers knew how it worked. He's been given an identity, something to separate him from the masses. A possible way out of the slums of the city. When Lil Zee ""commissions"" Rocket to produce a series of photographs of his gang, the pictures mistakenly fall into the hands of the local newspaper. When the pictures of Lil Zee and his gang make the front page, Rocket fears that his life is over. Instead, Lil Zee glories in the publicity and sanctions Rocket to take even more photos of his criminal inner circle. Soon, Rocket has becomes the City of God's chief correspondent.City of God is filled with a hefty supply of violence, including some pretty cruel things done to children and women. However, the film still manages to leave the viewer mesmerized by, or despite, the chaos and anarchy. Along with the grand performances of Rorigues, Firmino and Haagensen, City of God is filled with memorable characters and performances, such as Seu Jorge as Knockout Ned, who becomes Lil Zee's nemesis for control of the ghetto. Young Douglas Silva, who plays Lil Zee as a boy is spellbinding as well as a little scary. Performances such as his and the others is what makes this film a casting masterpiece. Due to the lack of black actors in Brazil, Directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund decided to use untrained youths and kids from the actual City of God. This obviously adds to the sense of realism that is the film's strength. Credit must also go to screenwriter Braulio Mantovani, who paints a vivid and honest picture of a violent, desperate world very few outside the slums, would ever see or know existed. Telling the story through the eyes of a young dreamer, who's day-to-day existence was never a guarantee is a stroke of genius. The story doesn't attempt to pull on the viewer's heartstrings with melodramatic scenes or narration. The audience is simply allows to flow with the story, as one would in real life. The viewer is transformed into an unseen companion to the hero Rocket's actions, vision, and emotions as he navigates us through violent menagerie of the City of God.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Could Be Considered Modern Mythology if it weren't True!,"This is quite possible the best foreign I've ever seen. I'm a fan of Fellini, of Bergman, they were artist and insightful philosophers, but the gritty reality of City of God is fascinating and unparalleled.The arch of the story and the complex interweaving of the lives we follow resembles mythology, yet this is true and it's modern. Modern Non-Fiction Mythology (which I do see is a contradiction of terms, but I don't know how else to verbalize what how I feel about it).The direction was masterful. Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund are equal to a Brazilian Sergio Leone. This is what Leone tried to accomplish with 'Once Upon A Time In America.' He failed. Meirelles and Lund succeeded.This movie will satisfy almost any film lover.

The gritty reality of city of god can be summed up with the shooting of the young child in the foot. with that it becomes very clear that this war extended to everyone, and that moment captivated the crowd into this reality. Then you have the constant hits to the style of the time within the seventies. where it was a time to be ""groovy"", and that is portrayed within Benny, as it gets you captivated into this culture. And yet the conflict with Benny and Lil ze is not mainly what resulted into his death.

It's a great realistic film that tells the truth.,"I'm an American living in Brazil for 5yrs now. I watched the movie on TV the other night and was very impressed with it. The quality was very good and gives you the feeling of actually being there and viewing it first hand. The movie depicts life as it was and still is. The people here are generally extremely poor and desperate. The corruption within this country can be found in ever level of Government and under the table payoffs are a way of life for many. Life is cheap and large numbers of people across the country die a violent death every day. Drugs are prevalent and a big money maker for the drug lords. Every kind of drug can be found being sold on the streets. The poorest of the drug users use a cheap drug by-product which make them easy to identify as their front teeth are missing or black and rotting away. Others walk around sniffing glue. Certain areas of Rio de Janeiro are controlled by the drug lords and their followers just like it's depicted in the movie. They have a small army of very young children working as runners taking orders and delivering the drugs to the waiting customer. In those areas it's not uncommon to see even the children walking openly brandishing a firearm. Even the military and police hesitate to enter these areas as it closely resembles a war zone. What you will see in the movie, believe it, because it is NOT an exaggerated fictional movie. These things are happening in cities all across Brazil every day. On the flip side the majority of people here are very kind generous loving families. They are very religious are honest hard working people. The students work extremely hard to get good grades so they will be able to win a full scholarship to attend the best universities in the nation. Just because someone lives and grows up in a favela (slum) it doesn't mean they condone the lawlessness. Some do become great leaders in every walk of life. I can honestly say I know some of them and am very proud to be able to call them my friends. Watch the movie and I can guarantee you'll be stunned and left thinking about it for day with a sad heart that this exists in our world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best new film to premiere in Cannes 2002.,"My first reaction to this engrossing, thrilling, gutsy AND witty drama about ghetto life in Rio de Janeiro was: WOW! What a movie. It takes you for an unrivaled trip to the youth ghetto of Rio, the so-called ""City of God"". We follow the lives of some kids, who grow up in the late 60's - most of them don't live to experience the 80's. The only, or let's say: the fastest way to get out of these dumps are violence and drugs. Using violence and pushing drugs. You better not mess that order up, or you're done. While debutant Fernando Meirelles shows the incidents in ultra-realistic (and therefore mind-numbingly brutal) fashion, he nevertheless achieves great art by splicing up the story, going from the present to the past, using newest technology wisely, speeding up the tempo with great ease, but also slowing down whenever he has to and showing the ability to be tender. He teases the audience with hints about things to come, and when he gets back to those things, he always delivers in a big way. The film has about a dozen important characters, and it's amazing how Meirelles not only manages to introduce them with style, but also keeps track of them so that we always know who we are dealing with.Since there is nothing I could compare this film to, I'd like to say that it comes close to Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"". Ok, that is a totally different world, but it's just that Meirelles uses a similar approach: He doesn't feel superior to the people he's showing, and he doesn't judge them. He shows them and their actions, counting on the intelligence of the audience to understand the motifs, the short-comings and the needs of the characters on its own. Most importantly: He shows us violence in a way that is not cool. It hurts seeing those kids throw away their lives by falling to the way of the gun.So far, this is the biggest, most welcome surprise of the year. Let's just hope that the sometimes over-anxious marketing department of Miramax, which bought the film in Cannes, will be sensible enough not to over-hype ""City of God"".9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The backdrop, the images, the directing, the acting...all incredible! Watching the acting, I thought to myself ""this is amazing how well they are acting."" I suspected that most if not all the people they used in the film really did grow up in that environment. They just acted too good. They were just too natural with it.One thing I kept thinking while watching this film was ""I thank God I wasn't born and raised in this environment."" The movie makes you realize how good you've got it. How would you like to live in a housing project where gangs of thugs walk around carrying ""Rambolike"" machine guns, with ammo belts hanging off them, openly without fear, ready to shoot and kill anybody just for the fun of it, having no remorse? How about kids 12, 13 and younger running around with real pistols out in the open, ready to blow you away for kicks? This is a housing project that truly is and looks like a war zone.The culture of these people just jumps right out at you. It's exciting, depressing, thrilling, chilling all mixed up well.

Brazilian Gangster movie lacks humanity,"Once again an entrepreneur has managed to turn the misery ofthe Brazilian slums into an exportable commodity.Slickly packaged within the ultra violent veneer of the postTarantino gangster genre City of God is replete with bullets,bodies, and just enough flesh to keep the international distributorshappy.It's an epic covering decades and including a good portion of theBrazilian population.  It's also aggressively aware of the latestvogue of digital effects and story telling digressions (ala GuyRitchie's Snatch).  Everywhere the camera and narratorbackpeddle through the third world carnage.  At one level, the rollercoaster pretense is intriguing.  However, given the reality of thesocial catastrophe lying at City of God's core the movie issurprisingly trite.

outstanding low budget masterpiece,"This is a great movie. Made with a very low budget. A movie that made Tom Hanks say he was in awe of. Outstanding. Touching. A movie also about hope. But I'd like first to address the two bad comments out of the over 300 in the board. One gentleman complains about the subtitles. Well, it really is frustrating to see in this day and age this kind of comment. It is so revolting to hear this sort of statement. Everybody else in the world when they watch American movies watch them with subtitles. But there is an anti intellectual bent in America (quite ethnocentric) in which movies made in other languages have to be dubbed to obtain any kind of box office success. To this gentleman I'd like to say that the Iliad, The Odyssey, the Bible, Crime and Punishment, 7th Seal, and many other works of art were not done by Americans. Yet we all enjoy them. So I'd encourage him to expand his mind and enroll in a Spanish 101 class in the local community college. Specially considering that the idea behind the global market of ideas is if we want to be heard we must hear others. This sort of dumb a** bs I read on these boards just p** me off. If you are an idiot without any kind of appreciation of what's good and beautiful stick to War Bus and Beach Babes from Beyond.

I understand that for each person each movie feels subjective and one person will like something that the other person will not.
But in such case as this people that think that movie is ok or even good would give the lowest grade to drop the number of the movie on the list of 250 bests.
I currently is on the marathon of IMDB's best movies, and ""City of God"" is in top 20, so I couldn't miss it. And before watching I couldn't resist temptation of reading some reviews. Oh man, so many people hate this movie. Yet it is here in the top list. That actually made it more interesting to me. Why is so?
And here is my opinion: the movie is not bad. If you don't pay attention from the start you might dislike the movie. Otherwise it is nice criminal story with no romantizing of bandit life. Do I think it deserves to be in top of all time? Probably not. But that is solely my opinion.
In conclusion, it is decent gangster movie about simple kids. And that is all. No more no less. Not a masterpiece, yet not a piece of you know what. Just watch it and make up your own opinion, as did I.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Disappointing,"""City of God"" is an old story. So old, in fact, it begins in the 60's as it tells of gangsters in a Rio de Janeiro slum who do what gangsters do and have done everywhere for all the same reasons. Poverty breeds ignorance which breeds hopelessness which breeds desperation which breeds crime...etc. This film shows us nothing new, save the location and its paper thin characters, as it takes the audience into a slew of favela-dwelling punks with guns (so many it's hard to keep track of who's who and who killed who for what reason) as it attempts to impart a sense of warring in the Rio ghetto. You'll see such a convoluted mess of gang bangers there's no time for the film to provide character depth or a sense of the gangster ethos or the mechanics of the drug trade or a reason to care who lives or dies, etc. Just a whole lot of killing with numbing excess and only a hint of a human story. For reasons I am unable to deduce, ""City of God"" received raves from all corners and countless awards and noms. Go freakin' figure! Personally, I found the documentary piggy-backed into the DVD more interesting than the film and the one scene from the film I remember most (it was shown twice) was that of a chicken which was run over by a truck but escaped unscathed. If you like your street punk killing flicks with subtitles, go for it. (C+)",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
a bit of the old ultra violence,"it's been a while since anything with the violent intensity of ""city of god"" has come out in the united states. this film definitely marks a good start for the director Fernando Meirelles and his use of film technique that is very similar to David Fincher, David o Russell, and Guy Ritchie. lots of frantic energy and cinged colors. one of the movie's main antagonists Lil Ze runs around like a miniature rabid Samuel l Jackson circa pulp fiction. the story centers on the criminal lives of children and young adults in Rio de Janeiro. i think that the movie while never making a political point of it lends a good amount support about just what type of anarchy results from the failed international war on drugs, including but not limited to: the creation of a black market, that gets increasingly violent as it is cracked down on, corrupt police tactics, an excess of wealth and desire for firearms for criminal purposes, international civil unrest, and a broad tool that the have-not in society may use to fore-go education in favor of black market profits. all that nonsense aside, this film is powerful in several ways.the young actors really really manage a tremendous job of translating raw emotion directly to the screen. i'm not sure to many young American actors could have pulled off such a feet of acting. is it even acting? the wonderful pacing and extensive use of flashback to move the movie through a great narrative direction. the setting itself, much like the french setting in ronin, adds a lot of detail and quirkiness to the way the film looks and the overall feel. all these things come together quite wonderfully for one of the best movies i've seen in a while. the only thing i missed is the fate of the lovely angelica is never revealed or mentioned, she simply disappears from the narrator's life and from the film. with the exception of that i i think the film was nearly flawless. this in comparison with the recent viewing of the french movie ""those who love me can take the train"",and it looks like France's future as a leader in good cinema is uncertain at best and unimaginable at worst.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pleasantly Surprised,"I hadn't heard that much about this movie before I saw it. But I think that was a good thing. When I saw it I didn't have any expectations, which is rare when you are in to movies. Usually I look up a lot of information about the movie, watch the trailer a multiple times.I'm gonna say that I was pleasantly surprised. It was really captivating and I'm gonna say it's one of the best movies I have seen. Because it's in Portuguese it feels so much more authentic. Foreign movies can be a little bit more difficult to understand, because they make movies differently in different countries. But this movie was one of a kind. It feels so real and it shows how life in a different part of the world can be. Even if you come from the same place you take different paths and that leads you to totally different places. As long as you want to do something you can do it.Because it's in Portuguese it make the movie as good as it is. I strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""City of God""","""City of God"" was stunning and powerful feature, and it's the film that changed the way that I watch film. Everything about it was stirring and emotional, and it taught me about the realities that other people experience in other nations. The vibrancy of the film is only matched by sharp acting on behalf of the child actors, who deal in violence, survival and power in Brazil. The movie is truly unlike any other I've ever seem, and it's almost insane that the movie, based on the book by Paulo Lins, is based on the writer's life...and his experiences amid the slums of Brazil. This film most certainly deserved to win bigger award than it did because it's a movie that someone can walk away from feeling disturbed, but educated. And that's powerful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the greatest films of our time,"'City of God' is hands down, one of the best films ever made. The script is brilliant, the story brutal, and the acting first class. Its stylish, sharp, and hard hitting telling a story of what life is like in one of the world's most notorious slums. It reminds me of 'Goodfellas' in many ways, only it's a whole lot better. Fernando Meirelles has an awesome style, his directing is fast paced and stylish from beginning to end I especially love the way he skips back and forth through time in order to tell every aspect of the story. It is a very stylish film but it also has a heart, it has a story to tell, a story worth watching. 'City of God' is unlike any film I have ever seen, it is so rich is visual beauty, and is flooded with bold originality. You will struggle to find any better, it's a one of a kind movie, that doesn't cease to impress.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Epic Storytelling,"City of God stands above many other movies.Above all, I think the storytelling is done in such a way that keeps the viewer engaged and on their toes. It's like Reservoir Dogs with flashbacks that seamlessly integrate into the story; in fact the editing strengthens the experience.City of God does have child actors but man, they don't feel like it. The acting is so natural and so organic. The entire movie has got a different vibe than your typical Hollywood product.Use City of God as a gateway to other international movies. There's a whole world out there - see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One Of The Best Movies Ever,"Few films I have ever seen have managed to capture the essence of society's oft-lamented yet never-resolved problems of illegal drug trafficking and the rampant street crime as depicted in the City Of God in Brazil, as shown to us through the remarkably unskewed viewpoint of its many colorful real-life street characters. Of course the street-urchins recruited to play the roles of certain individuals now scattered in time have become first-time actors as a result of this astounding motion picture, and the characters they portray are brought to vivid, realistic life on the big screen in a manner that will captivate audiences from beginning to end, despite its rather long running time. (__-?) The process of sitting through this depiction of inner-slum street gangs and how one generation picks up the business of the older one that leaves it behind for them, is nothing short of revelatory. I thoroughly enjoyed Scorcese's Gangs Of New York, but I will say this: City Of God makes GONY look out to be but child's play. For one thing, Fernando Meirelles utilizes a nonfiction canvas with which to illustrate certain points that Scorcese utilized fictional conventions to get across. In Scorcese's depiction of violence, we are nearly saturated with violence almost for the sake of violence, a sort of hyped-up ultra violence that drives these kinds of gangster-pics, and which might very well repel a certain demographic of viewers who just don't care for that sort of aesthetic. In Meirelles stark and up-close depiction of the real-life dangerous goings-on of certain groups of street gangs, the violence carries with it the reflection of truth, and despite even being possibly more extreme, it can be accepted more as a fact of life or somehow manages to become easier to digest, if not flinch away from. CoG makes GoNY look like child's play, and that's ironic seeing as how it is children which take up the mantle and carry on the business which the older generation leaves for them. I walked out of City Of God a changed man - a refreshed man, that is, because it reminds you just how stark and real this whole business of the natural order of things is. And conversely, just how real the whole nature of the order of business is. Sit down behind the camera lens and allow yourself to be transformed as our young true hero guides you through this City Of God and shows you just how comfortably you sit there in the theatre contemplating it. Do not miss this transcendental film. Open your eyes and see through the lens of a child. Watch how this child grows up and passes through the necessary rituals to become a man. Ask yourself what it is this man has shown you through his eyes. And do not close your eyes to what is going on around you ever again.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of God,"Some people have complained of the ""Hollywood treatment"" this story (inspired by real events) received, and it can't be denied that most of its stylistic flourishes resembles senseless action films. Somehow, though, the violence depicted in the movie has no ultimate sense, no other purpose than to follow the flow of daily life in the slums of Brazil, even more when it has been decided to disconnect the events from the social and economic structures of the Brazilian society. (Compare this movie with Héctor Babenco's ""Pixote"", and you'll see the difference.) It is obvious that some persons who are not aware of those conditions may find the images too raw or blame them on the characters' psychopath behavior. But then (I hope) neither we find reasons for the behavior of Quentin Tarantino's or John Woo's characters only on individual psychological terms. In the end, it's such a harsh reality that the cynicism of the filmmakers and all their flashy and effectist resources (like the change of music and the introduction of a strobe light in a party, just before one of the less repulsive young criminals is killed) end buried below the piles of dead bodies of Brazilian children and adolescents.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Extremely violent movie,"If you like blood, violence, death, seeing people being rapped and murdered, then this is the perfect movie for you. I could not finish watching this movie because it is so graphic. What a disgusting movie! I regret watching 1/2 of it. It makes me embarrassed to be Brazilian, because it makes it look like we are all criminals. I would NOT recommend this movie to any normal person, avoid it like you would avoid the plague. You can show violence without being so graphic, they showed a really bad rape scene. What is going on with some Brazilian film makers? There's no need to so something like that. I cannot understand why there are so many people who love this movie, maybe they are nutty!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masterful Execution,"Exhilarating on the first viewing and constantly rewarding there after. City of God epitomizes bold and invigorating storytelling both in its cinematic style and its narrative. The film expertly depicts the chaotic favelas of Rio De Janeiro, a place otherwise referred to as the 'City of God' — ironically so due to its complete lack of justice, laws or sanctity.An epic story of crime, drama and passion unravels through the eyes, ears and camera lens of protagonist Rocket — an adolescent man in his appearance, equipped with the innocence and moral fibre of a young child. Fuelled by his own desire to survive and chasing his dream of becoming a photographer, we follow his journey on the brink of life and death as he is caught smack-bang the middle of relentless and violent gang discord.Technically, the film is second to none, displaying a flawless combination of cinematography, editing and sound. Its cuts are rapid but sleek — possessing some of the most innovative and exemplary transitions in contemporary cinema. City of God's filmic style puts our eyes deep within the perspectives of the favela, entrenching us with the climactic and high-strung nature of the surrounding characters.Overwhelming is the film's ability to so rawly portray the brutal nature of the world and setting, but even more astonishing is its capacity to harmoniously intertwine these elements with the feel good nature of Rocket's coming of age story. Our heartstrings are toyed with time after time, never knowing what to expect; danger, hilarity or sweetness? Our expectations are in a constant flux of surprise. If any analogy were to accurately fit such a feeling, it would be alike to the two directors Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund placing us in the front seat of a rally car with no seat belt and GPS — leaving us to guess in an anticipation as we're helplessly thrown about by the momentum of the narrative, never knowing quite where the bumps and falls will appear.This stands as a recommendation to anyone who wants to be blown away by a compelling story, set in a unfamiliar and hostile world. Or alternatively, individuals who are yet to be wowed by the magic that foreign films can possess.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the very few must-see movies from the 21st century,"There are awesome movies and then there's City of God. Whenever you think this brutal and devastating drama about crime in a violent neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro and 2 boys and the paths they take is dropping the pace, becoming unrealistic and going into cliché, it delivers another one of its many brilliantly directed, heart- stoppingly tense set pieces. Or another one of its quiet, beautifully written and acted character scenes. Or another one of its raw, blisteringly intense emotional beats each of which knock you out with the force of an onslaught of ballistic missiles. The actors here put many far more well-known actors to shame with their convincing, brilliant performances, while the visuals are endlessly inventive and compelling. This is a drama which doesn't hold back on any level and is filled to the brim with thought-provoking moments and compelling characters. It's a tough watch, but it's not completely depressing. It has many moments of warmth and humour, and thanks to all that tension even works as an enjoyable action movie. A fantastic film which demands to be seen. There's a good reason why this is so high on IMDb Top 250, and I hugely recommend seeing this instant classic.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An ambitious and impressive must see,"City of God is a movie that tells a fictional story inspired by the non-fictional book by journalist Paulo Lins, portrayed as the central character, ""Buscapé"" Rocket, and former resident between the 60's and the 70's of the ghetto that shares its name. It develops in a flashback with alternate points of view that disassembles and exposes the parts of the cycle of violence which hasn't yet passed, at least not until the year 2015 when I write this critic. Foreign viewers can compare it to a documentary. For the Brazilian, it offers a production comparable to a great American action movie with good plot, but in a universe with which we can identify. The most shocking scenes can haunt some people for some time, but do not overlap in the movie, being well dosed with funny and uplifting moments. The pace is frenetic. The camera movement is agile and spontaneous, though it seems precisely planned. The soundtrack is a compilation of popular music that must be subtitled in foreign versions to fully justify its part in the movie.It's undoubtedly one of the best movies of this generation in Latin America.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

To all of you who are nervous to watch films with subtitles, unless you can't read quickly at all, don't be afraid to check a movie like this out. If you have any sense, you'll be so entranced that you forget you're reading the subtitles altogether.I wish there was a way to rate this in between a 9 and a 10.

"'City of God' is A Place Where Life is Cheap, But Humanity is Richly Vibrant!","Brazillian director Fernando Meirelles' splashy feature debut is a dynamically exciting portrait of Rio de Janeiro's violent gangs - a blood-spattered, non-stop ride as much into the life of a 'favela' (squatter settlement) as it is into the lives of the youths who inhabit it.The methodically constructed screenplay is narrated with subjective clarity by Rocket, a young aspiring photographer caught between his deadly surroundings and his treasured sense of ambition. The movie's principal characters, growing up in the Brazilian slum 'Cidade de Deus' in the 60's, are a bunch of drug-peddling, gun-toting hoods hell-bent on revenge - with the notable exception of Rocket, who would rather aim a camera than a shotgun. But Rocket's tale is only one of the dozens of stories 'City of God' juggles with equal aplomb. From the breakneck opening involving a chicken on the lam, the film throbs with several stories: two and a half hours fly by fast and bloody. There's Knockout Ned, a quiet ex-soldier who believes that education and honest work will get him out of the slum. There's Li'l Ze, a vicious drug kingpin with a frozen heart, who erases the Tender Trio's early thug-life template with a psychotically itchy trigger finger. There's Benny, the grooviest hood in the slum, who attempts to retire from Ze's drug game and then there's the hood with my favorite moniker, Steak'nFries, all locked into a headlong dance of sex, drugs, and violence.City of God is an unmissable cinematic triumph, peopled with affecting characters that avoid cliché, and a familiar story signposted with brutally shocking punctuation. Basing the story on real events and people, the makers employ a host of young non-professional actors residing in the slums where the story takes place, who perform a spectacular job under Fernando Meirelles' brilliant direction. Meirelles illuminates every frame of this fresh, ferocious and indelibly moving film that moves at whiplash velocity thanks to a terse script. He endows each chapter with powerful, uncompromising, beguiling and, sometimes, deceptive momentum. In a film of battering audacity, no shock hits harder than the way Meirelles choreographs murder to a dance beat, an exuberant form of kiddie recreation.But for all of the story's violent subject matter, there is also much natural beauty to savor thanks to the dynamic cinematography that captures Brazil's magnificent landscape. Every aspect of the filmmaking exists as a virtuosic symphony of theme, character, context, and style. The style is all dazzle and in-your-face pizazz, quick titles, cuts, and digressions, split screens and smash zooms, while a remarkably complex story unfolds and the funky soundtrack grooves along - all that dazzle serves a purpose.To watch 'City of God' is to become submersed in a hidden culture where life is cheap but the humanity is vibrant. It is a devastating epic about the roots of criminality and the ironic cruelties of life that also works as an intimate personal drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Effectively brutal,"Based on a novel by Paulo Lins who based the plot on real events having taken place in a favela, Brazilian slum, called City of God. The story is one of lost, unforgiving odds, bleak chances, little to no chance of escaping and of friends turned enemies.City of God is a unique experience and a unique film. Only a couple of the actors had had any prior acting experience, all of them in relatively minor roles. All of the rest, including all the main actors, were picked from actual favelas, many of them from the actual City of God. And yet, if I hadn't been told this, I couldn't have told. They're that good, that deep into their characters, and they bring this manic energy into everything they do on screen. You can sense the raw emotions churning under their skin, because they've been there. They know what it's like.The film doesn't pull any punches either. It tells the story about young street punks, looking their slice of heaven and riches through robbery, drug dealing, racketing, murder and mayhem. It doesn't shy away from the harsh realities, it doesn't try to sugarcoat it, nor does it offer any excuses.Aside from the unprofessional actors, the rest of the film is very professional. The cinematography is brilliant, as is the whole style, the whole vibrant yet muddy feel they give to the City. The story spans about a decade of time, yet it feels cohesive, like we never lose anything because of a jump in time.City of God is unforgiving. It's brutal, bloody, unpleasant and showcases that we still have a long way to go as a species. But we need films like it exactly for that last part. We need to be shown what's still wrong with the world. And I admire this film for having to guts to do just that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The life of trash,"The movie is basically the story of a bunch of criminal trash who grow up robbing and murdering in a makeshift ghetto for the homeless (in which the government has tossed them) at the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Predictably, they grow up to become only more sociopathic and parasitical on society. Some might call them ""gangsters,"" but really people like these are merely low class, low IQ garbage that deserve death.The one good thing about this movie is the beginning. For once, you see dangerous sociopathic scum get what they deserve from the cops. One of them gets shot down in the street running like a dog while his psychopathic girlfriend ""cries.""The rest of the film develops in predictable ways: the glory days and the requisite downfall. You can kind of think of this movie as the ""Good Fellas"" version for the kind of subhuman garbage they must deal with in Brazil.

Yes, probably.Many people told me that this movie was a MASTERPIECE (agree), others said it was too exaggerated (shut up), well, here's what I think! This movie is EXCELLENT, period. Shows what life is like in one of several favelas of Rio de Janeiro for these children and young people growing up in a world of violence.Buscapé (main character) is a boy like any other that has dreams to realize: be a reporter; having a girlfriend; cash in his wallet. Dreams difficult to achieve in this slum standing gang war between Zé Pequeno (also main character) and Mané Galinha, for reasons both territory and personal revenge. Where we see also the lives of many people in this slum, his experiences and his thoughts on life as they have. And the most impressive in this film is the casting.In the film we can only see a maximum of 2 actors, because all other characters including the main character, are even people who live in the favela City of God, and they make everything real (the film is based on true events if you do not know).

A Latin Masterpiece That Is As Hard To Watch As It Is Hard To Look Away From!,"Superb editing, and Fernando Meirelles splashy direction made this movie visually stunning, and this was necessary. Because without being so, City of God wouldn't have been the easiest hard-to-watch movie to be watched! I know that sounds weird, but I'm not kidding this movie is so disturbing and shocking, but its vibrant visual style made it impossible to look away from.Like the visuals and colors, the soundtrack is so vivid and dynamic to mirror the vicious cycle of violence in the eponymous city, and the slums of Rio de Janiero.That being said, City of God's exhilarating visuals and soundtrack aren't the only, nor even the main two reasons that made it unbelievably engrossing. As what really dazzled me the most this masterpiece is its narrative control. Considering the fact that this movie has this abundance of characters, which all of them are almost equally important, and a non-linear storytelling, it's beyond belief that I haven't felt lost even for a moment. Instead, I found myself caring for each of the main characters for equal measure. Every time our protagonist, Rocket mentions one of the new important characters while narrating the story, I start getting worried a bit because I think this would harm the narrative thread of the story, and make it lose its balance a bit. But every time I ended up being totally wrong till I eventually said to myself: ""More characters, please!"" By the way, the use of voice-over narration in this movie is exceptional!Every single character is as grounded as its compelling and throughly interesting. And they are brought to life by some of the most authentic, honest, and uncompromising performances I've ever seen in film. All the non-pros actors delivered downright terrific performances that I really can't single hand one of them.The only issue I've with City of God is its first fast-paced 20 minutes. Putting aside the magnificent opening scene, everything in the rest of the first fifty to twenty minutes happens very quickly that kept me from being engaged from the start.Powerful, visceral, uncompromising, yet honest, Cidade de Deus is a Latin masterpiece, and easily one of the this century's best movies, so far.

One of the Best Moves of All Time,"Much of my own sentiments have already been echoed by other posted reviews here. As my rating indicates, I consider this one of the finest movies of all time. It's something of a Brazilian ""Goodfellahs."" A coming of age story, a mafia story. An urban ""Lord of the Flies."" There are a myriad of virtues to single out in such an epic triumph such as this, but I'd like to simply draw attention to one of the most gripping pieces of acting I've ever seen in film -- and it's that of the young boy who faces the drawn gun of another young boy. The scene comes in the middle of the movie and it is mesmerizing and horrific. It's a representation of the intensity of the film as a whole.That the events of this story aren't stretches from the reality of the slums of South America is a simultaneous testament to colossal film-making and blemish upon the history of civilization.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the best crime movies,"Inspired by true events, this is one of the best crime movies that I have come across. The beauty of it is in the impeccable subtlety with which shocking series of events are presented. They seem totally digestible.City of Gods is a narrative movie based in the slums of Brazil. It is about children. Children who get guns in their hands at a tender age. They run around in groups looting and killing commoners and each other. Many of them die early and others die a bit later. Out of an array of brilliantly characterized people, 3 stand out. These are Little Ze(Leandro Firmino) who is main 'gangster', Benny(Phellipe Haagensen) his right hand, adviser, best friend, style guru and Rocket(Alexandre Rodrigues) the boy who narrates the story. All 3 do their best to survive through the unbelievably chaotic rush of wannabe gangsters all around them.Not much is to be told about the story, cause it unfolds time and again with twists that add to the interest. The overall aura, locations that are used not only are very authentic, but blended with the colors and lighting, lend a very realistic and unpredictable touch to the story.This is very distinct from the typical American crime movies.

A splendid movie,"This is a movie about young people who live in the guts of Rio de Jeneiro. It starts with a scene where a gang of children chase a running chicken and suddenly flashbacks to 60s to set up the background for the main theme. After that, more than 90% of the movie are dedicated to laying the ground work for the opening scene, which is indeed the overture of the finale and a substantial amount of mental effort is needed to piece together the events which unfold at a very fast pace and involve a lot of characters. Despite its patchy storytelling style with full of flashbacks, the movie is coherent without any plot holes. Although a good deal of the actors are recruited amateurs from the favela the acting is pretty good and director's portrayal of the gang leader Ze Pequeno is uncompromising. The movie's fast tempo and action packed scenes doesn't leave any room for character development but this doesn't really stick out. Viewing more than once will probably be needed to grasp the whole story with its details.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Mind Blowing,"When i was recommended this movie, i didn't know that i was about to witness a masterpiece. Every scene fit in the puzzle, every mystery unraveled as the movie progressed. And i could not find any incoherence, such was the perfection of the director. The portrayal of Lil Dice was chilling to say the least. The fact that a child at such a young age chose a life of crime and enjoyed murders the most was something that reminded me of The Interpreter and sent a shiver down my spine. Especially the scene where he kills the people in the motel and laughs off after that. The deep rooted corruption increases my disgust for all such acts. And despite the fact that i would like the conditions in the City of God to become better, the final scene made me sad that everything would be repeated again. And that gives me little hope. Nevertheless, everything in this movie deserved a 10/10 and i doubt if a movie of the same genre can be made better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good film with subtitles,Have watched this film 4 or 5 times now and still doesn't get boring. Shows you how life is lived on the streets of Rio and is pretty real life from the way the camera tells the story. From what i have read a lot of the actors and actresses were not know as the director wanted to tell the story of real life people from the ghettos. The story has some great twists and turns and a lot of great action scenes. The gang of children that stick together as a family and the way the robbed and stole together brought to life what they must have to go through in real life.My review is 9 out of 10 for this film,,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Roller coaster ride through life in the favilas of Rio and its gang culture,"This is so far the only movie in a foreign language that I have seen, but I understood this film perfectly. City of God is excellent, mesmerising and in a lot of cases sad, sad because the only way these kids are going to make a living is through gangs and violence. However this is the story of a boy who leaves the gang culture and becomes a photographer by leaving the gang culture that killed his older brother.

Technically brilliant though brutal and Shocking,"The movie pulls you in within a few minutes thanks to the realistic writing, locations and a fantastic cinematography. The runtime which is around 2 hours flies just like that. So many sequences, for instance the story of the apartment, stay in the mind mainly because of the cinematography and a unique style of editing. Some of the scenes are violent and disturbing to watch, especially when there are kids involved. Even more difficult to fathom is when the end credits rolled as based on a true story.Watching the movie 20 years after its release makes one realise how many other movies it had inspired in the past two decades.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

amazing!,"What an amazing movie! Everything just seems to fall into place, the directing, the story, the editing, the cinematography. At first, I was a bit peeved at all the shots but realized it was a movie of parallelism. All those dark shots reflected what life was in Brazil for these boys, how dark it is for them, like there was no way out and that other people did not see them or refused to make an effort to see them and their situation.Fernando Meirelles is a genius.

Excellent piece of filmmaking,"The film is based out of a slum in Rio de Janero, and it does an excellent job of capturing the life in the area. The way the film is edited, the camera motion makes it feel all so real. The cinematography here is thus excellent, though it's not exactly my taste. Poverty, drugs, rampant violence in the area are well captured and we get to witness how little kids are sucked into notorious culture that surrounds them. It is disheartening to see this but well, it's true and represents the story of a lesser known side of Rio and many similar places all across the world.The cast can't be praised enough, considering they were all amateur actors who managed to put in an amazing performance to deliver a a maybe not so heartfelt story and I think forgot to mention the director's approach to storytelling in this one was great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Fernando Meirelles did a very good job into turning non-actors into actors. It makes the story that much real. Plus that's what I admired about the story, the fact that it's so real. So brutally truthful. It's of something that you can see happening even from you own home-city, if you live in a city known for gang-violence.

Is there anyone who remembers that the story of one, only one, victimized character is more powerful than watching millions of people slaughtered.It was like watching 2,000 St. Valentines Day massacres in 2 hours. Horrific but not touching.  We need to care.  This film had too many stories.

Amazing Storyline,"In the Film City of God, Directors, Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, do an excellent job conveying the story of a young boy who lives in a favela known as the City of God. They show his story growing up in poverty and the pursuit of his dream of being a photographer. With use of excellent motifs and stunning order of events this Film earns two thumbs up in my book.
 One motif that stood out to me during the screening of the film was the relation of Good and Evil. Many times, throughout the film, characters reference the idea of ""Love and peace"". In reality, this idea was stretched most times to being evil. Even many Characters who lived peacefully, found their downfall by facing evil head on. 
 Another thing I found spectacular in the Film was the order the story was shown in. The opening scene of the movie was the most important and actually serves as the climax of the film. The opening scene also conveys a series of flashbacks (or even flashbacks inside of flashbacks) in which story is described and narrated. Throughout this description, we learn about all the characters and their importance to that final scene. It was an interesting and powerful way to convey the story nonetheless.
 In short, the Film City of God is a must see for anyone who enjoys strong storyline where little is left to the imagination. In the Span of a couple hours, you will laugh, be sad, and even be heartbroken. I Recommend the film to everyone to see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Stunning,"City of God! I've watched this movie several times. One of my favorite all time movies. Just to let you know it is a very long movie. I believe it is also only in Portuguese. I speak Spanish so I kind of understand some of the stuff but I always watch it with subtitles anyway. It is a very emotional, intense, violent movie. I do believe the cinematography could be better in the sense of just quality. However the story line and the details within the movie are extraordinary. If you are into suspenseful, story telling, crime, triumphant, action movies I recommend it. It is definitely a classic. It is however not family friendly.

Best True Story I've Ever Seen,"Although it is based on a true story a lot of the elements are truthful. This amazing film gives you an insight into the slums of Rio De Jineiro. This was my first movie I have seen with subtitles all the way through, however after 5 minutes I forgot about it as I was lost in the power of the movie. Although the film is graphic in many ways the movie has a comical side to it that adds another dimension to the picture. The film has an excellent storyline with great acting and intense power.

It is just another example of the fact you can make an astonishing film with a low budget and unproven actors.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A whirlwind window to a violent world of gun-toting kids,"""City of God (Cidade de Deus)"" may be the most violent movie I've ever seen.And just when I thought I was inured to the shooting and the murders, such that I couldn't even keep track of them anymore or who was getting killed by whom for what reason or carelessness, it topped itself and got more violent and made me start caring again.It's not just the socially conscious Brazilian true story line of abject poverty creating an army of desperate children with guns that makes this so captivating and meaningful beyond the endless bloodshed.Directors Kátia Lund and Fernando Meirelles have a relentless, in-your-face camera style that circles around somewhat similarly to ""Amos Perros."" The story, based on a novel based on true facts, if I could figure out the non-translated credits correctly, whips around in time to show us how each mini-gangster in the huge, differentiated ensemble of extraordinary amateur actors got to be the way he is.The voice-over narrator, and what happens to him as a budding photo-journalist, is a bit precious and is virtually the only bordering on cliche element, but he is a convenient window into a world of children who literally cannot separate fantasy from reality, (who have no access to violent TV, movies, or video games as a scapegoat) and have no impulse control whatsoever.The pulsating samba, funk, and Brazilian R & B music helps push the pace even faster; the action mostly takes place in the '60's and '70's so there's no hip hop though it's like illustrations of gangsta rap's most extreme tendencies.Props to the distributor for black outlining the white subtitles, as much of the visuals are a bleached-out landscape of hopelessness.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Another foreign tragedy,"The hype surrounding City of God has become enormous. It has obtained rave reviews here in America. Especially among the college professors and students that I frequently converse with. Unfortunately, this movie did not live up to the hopes I had for it.  Having already seen ""Harder They Come"" and ""All the Forgotten Ones,"" I assumed that this film was garnering so much praise because of a message that would go above what those other films portrayed. The cover of the DVD even has a quote mentioning how this would change my life. It did not. I personally feel both of the other films just mentioned did what ""City of God"" does, and with more originality.  This film takes a lot of modern movie concepts, especially those made famous by Guy Ritchie, such as interweaving plots and jumping to different points of time as the film progresses.  I highly recommend seeing those other two films before this one, and it should change how impressive it really seems.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Too slick for its own good,"Though a lot of people and critics have praised this Brazilian movie, I have to say that I did not like it at all. The story is bleak & serious and yet it's filmed like a GAP commercial, with a lot of stylish editing, camera movements (like the annoying 360 degrees one) and direction, which totally belies the story's tragic intent.The film is more of a showcase of the director's repertoire of movie tricks than of actual characters going through a hellish life. In the end, the effect is jarring and at times really off putting. There are a lot of gratuitous moments in it that serve no purpose but to shock or titillate the audience (the housewife and the banana bit, for example).OUR LADY OF THE ASSASSINS was much better than this and created an unforgettable experience without all the flashy razzle dazzle.CITY OF GOD is just another overpraised foreign movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cruel and Gripping,"City of God is one of those movies that has been on my watchlist for years now. I would always see pictures of it and reviews of people praising it, but up until the past year or so I had no real drive to watch foreign films. Thankfully, I finally got around to watching it because this movie is extremely impressive in many ways. Almost too impressive. There are few films that are difficult for me to watch, but there are several points during this movie where I felt like I was seeing something illegal. Nothing in the movie seems like it's fake or acted out. In the best way possible the film feels like a documentary. The cherry on top, is that at the end they tell you it's based on true events which makes all of the brutal events of the movie so much worse. I can't even imagine all of the effort that all of the staff and actors put into this movie. Touching on the acting, it's superb all around. I think the child actors are some of the best I have ever seen and their older versions are just as good. The cinematography/directing is very creative and almost like a Tarantino movie in some ways. Anyone who is even halfway interested in checking out this movie, definitely give it a shot because you may never see another movie like it again.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of God - looks like it was made by Him Himself.,"Many people say this is a fantastic film for its striking visual achievements, however I personally feel that they alone would never carry a film, especially a film as epic and grand as this. Of course, every time you see Lil' Ze's rampages or Rocket caught in the middle of the shootout in the streets (literally) it startles you with its sense of grandeur and bravado, but really the achievement is carrying such a brilliant story, where the hero does not actually do much but look on and try to survive. Fernando Meirelles pushes the boat out and, in fact, you get surprised in your own personal emotional involvement with the story. Just for example, the scene where a young boy has to choose between being shot in the hand or the foot is particularly poignant.I certainly would recommend it any discerning film lover or, in fact, anybody looking for an emotional roller-coaster. Take a deep breath and put the DVD on, enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A ravaging and compelling insight into Rio's mean streets,"Fernando Meirelles has orchestrated a fascinating piece of movie making to establish not only himself as a fine director, but also to establish a film that surely deserves its place among the best of its kind. The story and characters seem to revel in the distinct Brazilian surroundings and every character relishes their roles; Leandro Firmino flourishes as Li'l Zé, as he shows a menacing and devilish streak to his psychotic character. Alexandre Rodrigues (Rocket) tells the story how it is and before we know it the sun is scorching down on us while gunfights of gang warfare smother the streets in broad daylight. Violence is present only when necessary, and when it surfaces it is quite extreme. Don't let this deter you from viewing this flawless film - even if you happen to feel uncomfortable at the sight of blood - because the film has quality in abundance; the camera work vividly captures the intensity of the script, and the raw dialect of Portuguese adds an extra punch (if you speak the language). The story revolves around a young man whom dreams of becoming a photographer. His struggle to contend with everyday violence - which seems to be a recurring theme throughout the film - sets up a tense and intriguing atmosphere. We are brought to the streets so we have an idea of how the drug situation works and what it takes for gangs to protect their business. With a beautiful view of a landscape,sadly bearing the vast and derelict Favalas, we are intentionally made to explore just how poverty stricken these people are. This film defines just about every emotion possible and with fluid skill. I don't need to recommend this film as you have probably seen it advertised everywhere, but I will say don't avoid it because you would certainly be missing out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Behind the doors of hell,"Fernando Meirelles portrait of gang life, 'City of God', has been likened to Martin Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', but it's far more visceral, and less stylised, than that film, and underpinned by a portrait of the appalling poverty of the Brazillian slums. Fast-paced, superbly acted, uncompromising and without a whiff of glamour, it's a movie that re-invents the tired old gangster genre by actually telling it as it is, and not as the clichés tell us to expect, and a serious piece of social and political history on the side. This is a very fine film, one in which shreds of tattered humanity gleam through the cracks of the doors of hell.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Extremely honest portrayal of one of the worst crime led places in the world, this has to be one of the best creation of world cinema. No wonder why it gets so much praises.

An educational and stunning film that has tons of action,"City of God is a one of a kind movie that not only is educational but a masterpiece in the form of sound, editing, and filming. The movie did a great job of starting in the present and then jumping back into the past in order for the audience to understand the story and how that specific scene came about. The use of different camera angles as well as movement played a huge role in the making of the film as well. By using a handheld camera as well as a dolly gave different feelings and almost made the audience feel like they were in the Rio favela. The use of sound as well played a role into this great movie. The music that was used in specific scenes played gave a great feeling as well. When there was action or tension, the music played was at a quicker tempo which made the audience feel that action and or tension. Lighting as well was used terrifically in the movie because as the audience gets more into the film the lighting gets darker and darker to show the bad that is going on. The directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund did a fantastic job finding amateur actors who were from favelas to play the roles of the characters like Rocket who actually live in the Cidade de Deus. By finding actors who have actually been in these scenarios they can pull actual emotion on how it feels and what is going on. Lastly, the fact that this movie is based on a real story is where this movie is educational. To see the problem with drugs not only with marijuana but cocaine and how it affected everyone around them really opens the eyes of the audience. This movie is a must see not only for entertainment but for education as I said before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
nice,"The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children.The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pace and Violence,"If you looking for roughly sketched characters then this is your film. Like the film itself the central protagonists survive only on pace and violence.

Two boys grow up in the City of God and teach you a lesson in life and film-making.,"After watching this movie, not only was I stunned at the events that took place, but struck by a much more superficial thought. People like editors and cinematographers don't get enough credit. People always laud the director for his great accomplishments, but the average person doesn't realize how much of what they call direction is actually edition and cinematography, two things this movie is near perfect in. The shots are so perfectly composed and angled. They put you in a perfect perspective from which to view the movie, be it the eyes of the narrator or some omnicient bystander between a killer and his victim in an alleyway. The editing takes advantage of every moment, strobing during a tense fight or slowing the film just a bit, pausing movement and panning around so that you can see an entire scene. The control of situation is excellent. While much of that is owed to direction, I think that the cinematography and editing, aside from the great writing, acting and content, are what makes this movie for me. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's a fast pace movie with subtitles, but worth the watch. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It showcases the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a twist of lifestyle differences. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Whether you are a top scholar or someone just wanting to watch a film this movie is for both. The continuity of editing helped the movie flow. Also, the vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with cringing accuracy. The many close up of characters help you sympathize with people you thought you wouldn't be able to. All in all, City of God is a very well done film which you can find yourself relating to a whole different lifestyle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

City of God,"The City of God (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund tells the story of a group of neighborhood boys that grew up in the ghetto in Rio de Janeiro, which is based on true story. The film is directed a way that contains multiple stories or chapters, to explain how their neighborhood evolved the way it did. Each of the main characters has their own chapter to show their evolution throughout the film. It contains acts of drugs, sex, violence throughout this the story, and the actors did a brilliant job recreating the storyline. This film applies different lighting, camera angles/elements and music play an important role when creating this film. The film utilizes a handheld camera to capture certain moments that allowed the audience to view events as how the charters would have. Due to the main character Rocket main desire to become a photographer, the directors utilize this plot story fact to show much of the film through his eyes. The music indicates what is building up in the film, such as upbeat and fast music playing when violence is on the horizon. Although this film contains such a strong presence of violence that leads you turn your head at moments, this element demonstrates the disgusting reality of the lively hood of people who live in slums such as this. I rate this film a 10/10 due to the accurate representation of gangs, poverty and crime. There is such a heavy presence of suspense, that it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and constantly eager for what is to come. Overall an unforgettable film and a cinematic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"easily one of the best movies of the year, period.","Co-Directors Fernado Meirelles and Kátia Lund have crafted a stylish and engrossing film about the exploits of children in the poverty stricken ghettos of Rio de Janeiro. The story centers around the story of two young men, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who has taken the path of becoming a newspaper photographer and the psychotic Li'l Zé (Leandro Firmino) who rises to the head of the drug trade in the City of God.While the story is certainly well written and engrossing, what really stands out in this film is the style with which it is told. It was quite simply a joy to watch. Most directors would give anything to be able to tell a story with the kind of style that Meirelles and Lund exhibit here. It is easily one of the best movies of the year, period. Not one of the best American movies, not one of the best foreign films, but simply one of the best of the year, no matter its origin.When watching this film one of the first things I thought was that the director(s) will be making films in America soon. Sure enough Meirelles is now directing a movie starring Ralph Feinnes. Since Lund is not included on this project it will be interesting to see just how much of the style of City of God came from Meirelles and how much came from Lund. We should have the answer to that question once The Constant Gardner comes out. Lund is now working on a short film that will be included in the anthology All the Invisible Children. After having viewed both these films, we should have the answer to just how much of the visual style of Children of God came from Meirelles and how much came from Lund. I know I will definitely be checking out both as soon as I can. Definitely two hours very well spent!  Deanna Carmichael (www.2-hours.com)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It is a crime film and the story about the ""favela"" (ghetto in Brazil), shows little kids who in the real world are not so little. Forced to live in a community where they have no escape and are forced to fight their way out. Violence and language in the film only add to show the realism of the film since it was based on events in the area. Brilliantly filmed and well deserving of academy awards.

Definitely Worthy Of All The Praise It's Gotten Over The Years.,"I would call CITY OF GOD the best gangster film I've ever seen. Miles ahead, & better, than overrated gang films such as Goodfellas (i found that film ridiculously overrated & boring) better than Casino (again boring & overrated) & City of God is better than Menace To Society & Boys N the Hood, in my opinion.Also this movie is better than any Tarantino crime film, yep beats his Fiction & Dogs.City of God is fantastically & ferociously directed for maximum impact, excitement & power. The cinematography is outstanding-all-time & the music is just awesome, with it's 70's funk flavour.The cast of unknowns was a masterful move & to get powerhouse performances from non professionals was lightning in a bottle greatness.Such memorable characters like ""Knockout Ned"" & Rocket & Lil' Z & Benny & The Tender Three & The Runts, i remember all these & I've only seen it once!!! That's how great the characters were & what an impact the story has on a viewer.Yeah the story is the basic good kid growing up in the tough ghetto & trying to break free, but few have done it this mesmerising before.I can't wait to watch it again!!!The movie is full of very colourful characters that often you can't help but like. Yes there's still some that you hate (Lil, Z) but most are just innocent kids with no way out of their desperate situation & so turn to selling or using drugs. It ain't pretty but the film shows it how it is, with the good times & the bad times like in real life.The City of God is the ghetto slum city & that place is a constant dark entity of a character too.The film discovered a fantastic actress in Alice Braga, she went to be in I AM LEGEND with Will Smith & PREDATORS.A Brazilian Masterworks of a Gang land drama/ thriller. The opening chicken chase is a superb sequence into a movie that is drenched in clever camera work, editing & back stories galore that all create a single full story structure of the city & its people.The movie is extremely gritty, grimy & brutal, but with purpose & a pure cinematic visual style.A coming of age story set in the darkest slum city of Rio.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"As it says on the case, ""one of the best films you'll ever see.""","This film is a brilliant depiction of the life of ""Rocket.""

The documentary that came with the movie was also great ""News from a personal war"". I can't believe that the director followed this up with ""the constant gardener"", which I thought sucked in comparison. It was a decent movie, but next to City Of God, it failed to even compare. Brutal reality brilliantly shot and acted would probably be the best way to describe this movie. The Soundrack is also incredible.

"This movie lacks sensibility? Unfortunately, so does reality.","I read many comments complaining that this movie doesn't do much to make you care about the characters and therefore doesn't connect you emotionally with the plot. I just want to point out that this lack of sensibility doesn't represent a flaw from the director or the script. Do you really think that people who grow up trying to be constantly high on drugs to escape reality, struggling to survive and numbed down by the omnipresent violence manage to become very sensitive or deeply caring? Unfortunately not. As a Brazilian who had his share of experience with violence, it's clear to me that the state of mind in which these ""gangsters"" live don't leave much space for meaningful emotional development. I am sure the director wanted to show us how does it feel to be there and how small is the presence of sanity and hope (portrayed mostly by Rocket) amidst the chaos; and the fundamental importance to nurture them.If you can't feel connected to the raw emotions that drive the characters in this movie, that might just mean that you don't understand it because your life isn't so chaotic or hopeless. It doesn't mean that these emotions are any less powerful or that they are not present to some extent in each one of us.In my opinion this is one of Brazil's most important achievements. It's a powerful portrait of society that should be watched by anyone who wants to broaden its view on the world and then learn to care more about it. Our society needs movies like this to shake us off our numbness and indifference. And as a movie it's incredibly well-done, entertaining and clever. I am very proud that this movie has been made and I try to show it to everyone I care about. I would also like to praise the German synchronization of the movie. While I mostly prefer subtitles, due to the frantic nature of City of God, a good synchronization allows those who don't understand Portuguese to focus on the acting and cinematography. And the German voices really captured the spirit of the characters. I was really impressed.Don't miss out on the chance to watch it, and if it disturbs you, that's a good thing. It means that you care. And that's the first step towards change.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazing story further enhanced by the fact that it happened,"My first milestone at IMDb occurs (50th review) with this amazing movie. The plot of City of God revolves around Rocket (an aspiring photographer) as he grows up in the slums of Rio De Janeiro and the events that occur there. The cinematography is simply amazing, from the various ""action shots"", to the way the story is broken up into anachronous mini stories. It is also amazing how intertwined all the stories are. You get an idea of the cinematography from the opening scene where a chicken escapes from a restaurant and a whole gang of people go chasing after it. The scene is comical at first and then turns serious very quickly as the chicken ends up in front of Rocket with a gang of approximately 30 members armed with guns on one side and the police on the other side (Rocket and the chicken caught in the middle). This movie is very intense, but feels realistic. The violence does not seem over the top but indicative of a plausible situation. The movie is also wrought with social critique : from the drugs use, to the crime (murder,theft), to the poverty and the widespread corruption of the slums in Brazil (and the similarity to slums everywhere). There are similarities to other movies including Scarface (1983), Boyz in the Hood and Menace II Society. This movie seems more gritty, more real than those movies. This might be due to the fact that those movies dealt with adults and young adults (16-35 year old), while this movie deals primarily with children. The ending is a mixed bag of optimism and pessimism (good things do happen, but also history does repeat itself). This movie MUST be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Especially since I knew very well it actually does exist.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"a shallow story, all be it a well told one","This is the Brazilian version of `Boyz N the Hood'  but City of God is two notches better, yet with a few shortcomings.The initial scene of a chicken running away is masterful.  If one has had the experience of running after chickens, then one must admire how the cameraman managed to keep up the pursuit until the poor thing disappeared under a police van.  Surely, the Humane Animal Society was present ensuring the humane treatment of the bird  although the miraculous escape from underneath the wheel could not have been planned.Now is the film depicting reality and is it providing some incisive criticism?  Not quite.  The favelas surrounding Rio and always perilously close to sliding off the sides of the hills after a rainstorm contain masses of people.  Increasingly, it is the favelas or the outlying quasi-cities/slums -- built to remove the pressure off Rio from the migration from the Northeast -- that cast ominous shadows over the rest of the city.  They are cities because their populations are huge; they are part of the bigger city, yet a city apart.  The same repeats itself in the rest of Brazil.  The crime rate is legendary, and it paints a rather bleak future for the country unless something is done on the double.City of God is about the internal dynamics of a quasi-city/slum.  The city is portrayed as devouring itself  suggesting the bitterly ironic name of the city.  Gang vs. gang with the occasional corrupt opportunistic intervention by the police.  Crucially the spillover effects of this criminal culture don't envelop the posh areas of Rio.  Any well-to-do Brazilian watching this film won't sweat too much  the violence is happening elsewhere.  Here is where the film is a bit weak  it is hardly a political statement or an indictment of the Brazilian model.  It is just internecine warfare, not a crime wave descending on the middle classes by the beach, and the film doesn't make a political statement by suggesting that the inequality has anything to do with the problems depicted in the film.  Unfortunately City of God is a shallow story, all be it a well told one.One more thing is evident in this film and it is a problem affecting all of cinema.  All films must fall within the commercially imposed time limits, i.e., the absurd two-hour mark.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to weave a rich story in such a limited time slot.  Several characters are developed early on, although one can hardly empathize with them or understand them. The first five characters are introduced, but soon afterwards, several are bumped off.  Then right smack in the middle of the film another important character is introduced  errr isn't this a bit late?  Whoa!  Mr. Meirelles man, you only have two hours to tell a story!  This would have been acceptable if the film were a wee bit longer, but suddenly it is difficult to discern who is who and what makes them tic.  The way this film handles this is by having `chapter headings'.  The story is compressed and explained by these subtitles.  It may be borderline-effective, but what this film needed was another half hour developing the `smell' of the place.  This was wonderfully achieved and portrayed in the initial football (aka soccer) scene in a barren field.  A few more scenes of the open sewers or the fermenting garbage and Meirelles would have had a masterpiece  (although another hour to make a political statement would also have been necessary!).My score = 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A Harrowing Examination of Violence, Fate, and Society","City of God (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles and co-directed by Kátia Lund, stands as a seminal exploration of urban violence, class disparity, and the cyclical nature of poverty in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. Adapted from Paulo Lins' semi-autobiographical novel, the film offers a sobering portrayal of life in the favelas, where violence is not merely a symptom but an inescapable, systemic force shaping the lives of its inhabitants.The film's most compelling strength lies in its complex narrative structure, which mirrors the chaotic environment it depicts. Told through the eyes of Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), an aspiring photographer, City of God masterfully intertwines multiple storylines, illustrating the inescapable interconnectedness of crime, poverty, and survival in the slums. Meirelles' use of nonlinear storytelling not only reinforces the sense of entrapment but also reflects the randomness of fate within the favela-violence erupts without warning, and no character is ever truly safe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A wonderful film that opens up a window to the gang violence in favela outside of Rio de Janeiro,"The movie is very well put together and it offers viewers (especially for international audience) a close look to the daily challenges that favela residents (mostly displaced people) have to face outside of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.The storyline revolves around 2 main characters growing up in the 60's and 70's in favela (the Brazilian equivalent of a shanty town, which are generally found on the edge of the city) and how one becomes a professional photographer and the other one becomes the most infamous drug dealer.The documentary ""News From A Personal War"" comes with the DVD of the movie and it definitely worths the time to see.

A fantastic film with an otherwise depressing theme,"I would say City of God is one of the better films I've watched in recent years.The film follows two kids from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro growing up in two completely different paths, one is a blooming photographer and the other is a sociopathic crime lord, leading the drug traffic that's gone rampant in Rio's poorest neighborhoods. The films characters come to life with the contrasting emotions the two characters have, one is completely shocked by the amount of crime and corruption going on and the other has a joyous smile on his face as his thirst for blood, money, and power grows over the course of the film.The film can be unsettling and uncomfortable at times with the amount of gore and lack of human decency that the characters in the film have as a result of the systemic oppression and corruption that was and still is prevalent in Brazil that will have you on the edge of your seat.The film can have a fast pace at times that almost makes it hard to follow what's going on, but following the narration and overall subject of the character dialogue helps understand the films overarching story. The cinematography and sound design really engages the audience, especially during some of the night club scenes that use more recognizable music for international audiences as well as the usage of more traditionally-styled Brazilian music also ties in the setting of the film very well.I highly recommend anyone interested in this film to experience it firsthand to get the best sense of judgement, but overall this films mix of fantastic visuals and cinematography with its fast pacing sound design creates an engaging viewing experience for an otherwise depressing subject matter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

City of God is the brutal realisation of Rio's uncontrollable gang crime.,"Set in the infamous slum known simply as ""City of God"", a young man's ambition to become a photographer leads him to the dangerous world of urban warfare. There is so much to take in that one viewing just wouldn't create a clear reflection of the film. It plays out like a typical gangster narrative, two opposing rivalries attempt to own businesses and so bullets rain down upon the streets of Rio. What differentiates this from, let's say Goodfellas, is the sheer brutality and realistic imagery that is conveyed. Murder, rape, drugs...it's all here. But the residents raised in the City of God know no different, it's their way of life. A turf war might happen to one generation, only for the next generation to look up to them and aspire the same desire for power and authority. And so the cycle repeats. It's uncontrollable. The theme of vengeance is prominent as well. How being consumed by revenge can not just lose yourself, but the innocent lives around you. Those who segregate themselves from the violence of gang culture. It's a bold statement but an important one to tell. The favelas and slums of Rio and how the government manage the overgrowing population is what contributes to this lifestyle these people are forced into. Jobs are scarce, the standard of living is low...what else can they resort to? It's a harsh reality, but a reality nonetheless. Plenty of memorable characters, especially their nicknames, that make them human. The natural performances and raw emotion that is portrayed clearly indicates to us that there is a sense of innocence to these gang members. With many of them wanting to remove themselves from the gang culture. Meirelles' direction was frantic and fast paced with a hint of grittiness. That's my only criticism, it's too rapid. Need time to let the raw emotional impact simmer and affect you. I adored the narrative though, embedding character origins within the main plot was refreshing. City of God is one of those rare films that depicts the harsh reality of gang culture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
great movie made with a low budget,"Why can't Hollywood get it right with all these big budget movies, when a small film like this does it the right way. First, the script was great as well as the cinematography. It's no wonder those things as well as the director got nominated for so many awards. It's a wonder it didn't win for best foreign film. The movie was based on real events about a boy named Rocket who lives in the slums of Rio. Many kids there turn to a life a crime and he witnesses all of it. Two warring gangs take over the streets. He gets the opportunity to take pictures of it and gets them in the newspaper. At the end it tells us he won awards for the pictures he took, including a death picture of the boss of the City of God.Just the way the story was told and how we are introduced to the characters is what really makes this film great. It could have easily been confusing, but all the flashbacks as to how some of the kids became hoodlums was well written and made sense. And it was something to learn how Rocket's older brother, Goose, was killed, but still Rocket managed to stay out of the gangs.FINAL VERDICT: The subtitles are easy to follow and don't hinder the enjoyment of this movie. I highly recommend it. It reminded me a lot of Blackhawk Down.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Powerful, this movie represents harsh realities.","Normally Brazilian cinema is strong in good comedy but rather unhappy with respect to dramatic films. However, this film is quite different. Most of the action takes place in one of the largest and most dangerous areas of Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ""favela"" Cidade de Deus (favela is the name that Brazilians give to the slums, where the poorest live, in the midst of total misery). There, people live alongside with crime, knowing that it may be the last day of their lives and having few opportunities to rise in life. In fact, this is not a movie thing, this is reality. The film merely uses reality to stage a story in which two young people take different life paths: one ends up becoming a photographer and the other becomes a drug dealer. These stories are fiction but they are very similar to the lives of immense young people who live in that place. And that's the great advantage of this deeply shocking movie: we know it's all fiction but it could be true.Most of the actors have no stage experience and were unknown to the audience, but they ended up being known in Brazil, having worked convincingly and credibly. The film has many scenes of violence, but its a kind of violence without the American style, very similar to what we can see in the streets of Brazil. The way the film was shot and edited reminded me a little of the film ""Goodfellas"" and a style inspired by Scorcese, and there are many critics who immediately established the link between these two films quite obviously. Its a powerful and somewhat shocking movie about a painful social reality that Brazilians should think about solving.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Okay movie, but not a masterpiece like the reviews make it out to be.","City of God is one of the highest rated movies here on IMDb, which has me ask the question: why? Yes, it has some intense scenes, endearing acting, and interesting usage of camera angles, but other than that, City of God is unremarkable.My first and main complaint about City of God is the high number of characters. There were so many different characters (who all looked very similar) that it became hard to follow what was going on in the story. With so many different characters, it was also difficult to make a connection with any one of them.I am on the fence when it comes to the cinematography of City of God. I think during some of the scenes the camera angles and filters were very clever in conveying a certain mood. On the other hand, sometimes these aspects felt unnecessary and almost seemed as though the filmmakers were just experimenting around.Overall, I don't think City of God is as great as I was lead to believe. In some instances, it feels like a cheaply made movie. Plus, the run time was much too long. The filmmakers probably should have cut some characters and subplots out of the film to focus more on the main character.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

film craftsmanship!,"This isn't an easy subject matter to make a masterpiece out of it, but Meirelles has done it! This story is told in the most skilful of ways! All its bits and pieces are carefully placed and events are uncovered with flashbacks then when they really matter most! Innovating filmmaking molds the scenes and the acting is flawless. Yes, it is perhaps one of the most violent films I've seen but I don't think it is for the sake of spectacle or that it is a cold portrayal of gangs in Rio.  This is a film with a striking social commentary. It exposes all levels and aspects of poverty and social inequalities in Rio and strikes us with the sheer magnitude of a problem that is real and ongoing! We see the fatalism of the ghetto, the corruption of the police, a society that never rewards good faith, the indifference of the system to intervene (""let them kill themselves"" says the policeman), a system that supports the erosion and the self destruction of the masses. The protagonist is too human. He is the link between us and the jungle. The whole story is about a deep helplessness! Even ""bad"" Ze is really a helpless figure.  Allow me to say that I think that movies like ""The Lord of the Rings"" is more violent in essence. 9/10 No doubt the best movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Modern Masterpiece,"Picture this: You are slowly walking towards a boy no more than 10 years of age  someone you have played soccer games with and joked around with. The boy reaches down with his hand, brings a gun back up, and pumps you full of bullets. In the multiple Academy Award nominee City of God, not only does this happen, but it does not even come as a surprise. This Brazilian epic takes the iconic movies of the '90s and creates an intense blend that utilizes the fractured structure from Pulp Fiction, the hard-hitting style of Requiem for a Dream, and the ambitious storytelling of Goodfellas. The oddity here is not that director Fernando Meirelles mixes parts from these films together, but rather that in doing so, he has created a modern masterpiece that will surely be remembered as one of the defining films for the millennium decade. Taking place during the 1960s and into the 1970s, City of God is set in the Brazilian city of the same name. Located close to Rio de Janeiro, the two places could not be more different. Rio de Janeiro, virtually a tropical paradise, contrasts starkly with the seedy slums of the City of God. The structure of the film is almost like a tangled skein  following a loosely chronological order, the movie often doubles back on itself to retell a story from a different perspective and it often takes detours to tell stories of the varied and fascinating individuals in the city. The result is a sprawling tour-de-force with a massive cast of characters  some who triumph over their enemies but more who fail. The film makes use of one of its many characters as the narrator, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), but he is not so much the protagonist as he is a center for all the stories to meet. As an aspiring photographer that is always on the sidelines, he is the perfect character to take the audience on the journey through the decades. In fact, the main character of City of God is arguably not a person but rather the city itself, portrayed as cruel, relentless, and endlessly bloodthirsty. The closest thing the film has to a main character is Li'l Zé, the brutal and power-hungry man who quickly rises through the ranks (generally by shooting down the competition) to become the czar of the drug underworld. Brilliantly portrayed with wild abandon by Leandro Firmino, Li'l Zé's unpredictable and chaotic nature is counterbalanced by his closest friend, Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), who is like the yang to Li'l Zé's ying. Less temperamental and more relaxed, Benny is considered the coolest gangster alive by residents of the city and can save the lives of many people with a word to Li'l Zé. Stylistically, the film exhausts just about every film-making trick one can think of on the spot: split-screen (used sparsely but effectively); 360-degree camera turns; slam cuts; slow-motion shots  all of these and many more are present in the film. In one instance, the absence of sound during a key scene helps to heighten the impact. In another, a flashing strobe light enhances the haunting quality and atmosphere of the empty nightclub to a startlingly memorable result. City of God is most successful however not because of its stylistic choices, or its many interesting characters, or its score (which is also impressive). All of these contribute to the making of a great film, but what elevates City of God to the level of artistry that only a handful of films such as Schindler's List and The Shawshank Redemption achieve is its uncompromising screenplay. Not only is the structure brilliantly conceived and not only are the characters extraordinary well developed, but the screenplay is also able to bring in a sense of the never-ending and continuous cycles of war without ever trying to moralize. Simply put, the film is a window into a world, not a path, and it simply views rather than changes. In this way, what the audience sees in that small window shakes them to the core without any feelings of manipulation whatsoever. In a film in which despair and brutality are so common, the irony of the title is not lost. City of God is a masterpiece in every sense of the word  a stunning and merciless film that portrays the era, the people, and the sense of hopelessness honestly and without compromise. I would not have it any other way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great film!,"Fernando Meirelles & Kátia Lund's film City of God is a truly fascinating film that deeply & poignantly displays the cycle of poverty & crime in the impoverished slums near Rio de Janeiro from the 60's to 80's. Displaying large volumes of emotional turmoil, this film speaks to the entrapment of people in a repetitive cycle of violence and despair by showing us the brutality and violence of what they experience on a daily basis. Primarily through the storytelling of the lead character Rocket we are invited to witness how the shameless drug lords running his city, along with the help of a corrupt police department that sustains the turning of the cycle, destroys the lives of many innocent people. 
 After watching, it felt as though one cannot help but feel their helplessness. And as for the frequent and disturbing acts of violence perpetuated by male dominance in this film, they are perhaps too much to watch more than once. In terms of the film's perspective lens its structure of an interconnected narrative shared between many different characters really allows the viewer to see all the differing aspects of the burden that poverty & crime inflicts on people. They all experience it in some way or another, and it positions us to confront the ugly side of human nature by forcing us to empathize with loss in profoundly penetrating ways. Overall, this film is incredibly compelling and could be described as achieving a great deal of realism especially in terms of its ending. I recommend watching this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Great Story with an Excellent Color Pallet,"I usually don't read reviews with a 10/10 so I didn't want to put a 10/10, but honestly I can't find anything wrong with this film. The story is well written, the locations look authentic, the acting is brilliant, and the cinematography and mise-en-scene portrays the emotions of the scenes well.This film is a good example of a good use of narration, it is used sparingly and does not tell us everything we should be able to work out from the film itself. What I mean by this is that the narration doesn't tell us what is happening in the scene, or what different character's opinions are. Instead the narration is used to tell us who this next part is about, it reminds us that the film is taking place in the memories or Rocket (the main character/narrator) and that eventually we will return to the scene which the movie opened in, all while not distracting us from the story.I mentioned the color pallet of this film in my title. The color pallet is something which usually goes overlooked in films, but in this it plays an important part. The main character is an aspiring photographer and having a good use of color is important in photography so it is important the shots should look photogenic so the main character is constantly being inspired to be a photographer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I liked it and Walter Salles(Central Station) too...,"Brazilian reality has surpassed the majority of attempts to portrait it in fiction. The acceleration of social decomposition has transformed violence into a banality.Few books have captured so completely this state of affairs (the Brazilian apartheid  and the outlawing of the favelas), as does Cidade de Deus, by Paulo Lins. Written by a son of the favela, Cidade de Deus reveals, for the first time, how this ever increasing process of incrimination has ended by overflowing into drug dealing enterprises and the struggle for power in the hillside shantytowns.Cidade de Deus, the film by Fernando Meirelles, is an extremely powerful transposition of Paulo Lins's book. With a tremendous impact, modern and visceral, the film counts almost exclusively on the acting abilities of youngsters coming from the favelas around Rio de Janeiro.Meirelles and co-director Katia Lund worked with these kids for over six months, in a laboratory process comparable only to that undertaken by Hector Babenco while filming Pixote.Orchestrated by a director with profound knowledge of cinematographic grammar, Cidade de Deus renews Brazilian filmmaking, and offers the spectators the possibility of understanding the roots of social chaos which characterize our country today a little better.WALTER SALLES",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The most incredible film,"I was very sceptical when I first put this DVD in my player and began the film, not because I hadn't heard that the film was brilliant but because i had heard the film was all in sub titles. Now the idea of a fantastic film for me is one where u get totally drawn in and so immersed in the film yet I believed that i wouldn't be able to do this if i was having to read to understand the plot. I couldn't of been any further incorrect. This film is amazing. The plot, the shots, the camera, the direction, the script, the acting absolutely everything about this film is very very impressive and from a media student point of view the editing was of such a high standard that i personally hadn't witnessed before. I agree totally that the film is shocking violent and brutal yet i think anything less and this wouldn't of been the film that it is. The shock factor is only a shock to us as we don't experience situations like this, yet in the setting from which the film is shot from it is common everyday practise. I think one of the most successful aspects of this film is the fact that it sticks true fully to what life really is like in the Brazilian slums, the temptation is clearly there for over exaggerated crimes and police chases yet the temptation is not pursued. All in all i think that this is a truly fantastic movie and one which en captures its audience and forces you to take notice.

More Movies Should Be Like This One,"City of God was made to be remembered, it was made to rivet its audience with every frame, it was made to evoke all emotions, and it was made to be an epic. It succeeds in all of these areas, because it avoids any point where there could be a dull moment. Most films allow gaps in pace with the confidence that they can be made up for with other fantastic points. City of God has you so wound up in it that it leaves you wanting more.It's made in the vein of Scorsese's crime dramas, with lots of jump-cutting, a jukebox soundtrack, flashy camera and editing styles, wildly entertaining yet ardently realistic violence, and a large amount of characters that are all strangely balanced, some fading in and out and showing up at surprising times when we've forgotten all about them, some driving the story. The film was revered by scores of critics, but also panned by many of them, surprisingly, for its tinsel style and flashy visuals. I say that it's ridiculous to look down your nose at such a grandiose and spectacular film such as City of God for what is the focal point of the art of film. Films are initially something to look at. They're designed for you like what you see.City of God is not only one of the finest films to come out recently. It's a milestone.

It is an amazing true story of a young Brazilian man living in the slums of the City of God and who dreams of becoming a photographer. The camera not only keeps him in the slums but also serves as a way out. The story is told through his eyes and in the process we're introduced to some of the most interesting and complex heroes and villains to ever appear on screen. It is a tour-de-force production that has merit in many areas. From the vast array of amateur actors who did a splendid job realizing each character with raw energy to the ultra-kinetic editing and camera movement. This type of frantic editing actually contributed greatly to the effectiveness of the film.

The title is from Augustine,"Great film. It is named after the Rio de Janeiro neighborhood where it is set. But there is a second meaning. The neighborhood was named City of God after a concept in Catholic and early Christian thinking.City of God was originally the name of a book written in Latin in 410 AD by St. Augustine of Hippo, a Roman Christian philosopher. The book was written at a time when the then-Christian Roman Empire was in decline and in threat of destruction. Many Romans believed that the original Roman gods were punishing Rome for abandoning them in favor of Christianity. Augustine did not agree.In the book, Augustine states that the fate of the City of Man, the earthly city, is insignificant. The City of God is built in the afterlife by people who are dedicated only to serving God. God's servants will not mind the destruction of the earthly society since they will live forever in heaven.How this applies to the movie, I am not quite sure. The events seem a bit reminiscent of the fall of Rome what with the corruption, violence and drug use. It might be an ironic or sarcastic sense, or perhaps a reference to the fact that many in the film do not seem to fear death. I am sure there is some connection beyond the neighborhood name.As an aside, the concept of the City of God was referenced by both Reagan in his ""City on a hill"" speech and Mario Cuomo in his ""Two Cities"" speech.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great Cinema Ahead Of Its Time,"Cidade De Deus is an excellent 'Docudrama' on the lives of the victimised and self victimising street children in the City of God  Rio De Janeiro.The screenplay is unique, despite the rapid shifts between the past and the present, and the stories of so many characters told together; it does not leave you confused to stop and think. Everything falls into place so well, that you can immediately catch up with the 'exceedingly fast pace' of the film.The script doesn't spend much time establishing facts or characters, although it gives glimpses of each character's life to establish them. Yet, the entire procedure is not at all contrived. It simply flows. But, the pace of the movie is a little fast keeping in mind even today's cinema. ""Cidade de Deus is probably five years ahead of its time"".The performances are so naturalistic that nobody is 'acting', despite the profound intensity of so many exacting scenes. Small children have acted so realistically, it makes you believe that you are actually watching a documentary shot on the streets. One scene I wish to highlight is the scene in which Ze shoots a small boy in his foot and the way the boy cries. That was EXCELLENT! Director Fernando Meirelles simply proclaims to the universe his directorial prowess.The drug use and the shootings' scenes are very realistically executed. The sound department has done a commendable job to embellish the visuals.The cinematography is exquisitely executed giving a feel of a European location with regards to the light and density of colours. Most of the day scenes have been shot during the Golden Hours to avoid the harshness of midday sunlight. They have very intelligently tried to avoid exposing shadows on the ground wherever possible.But, some shots are taken with so many camera jerks (for cinematic effect), that it tends to irritate the eye at a point. This is something I want to emphatically mention: Cinematography is the showcase of a film. Bad costumes, bad locations, bad acting can often be cleverly manipulated by using good angles and dramatic lighting. But, such jerky camera work actually creates even more disturbing visuals in an already disturbing subject/movie. It does add to the effect, but it also gets confusing at times; more so, irritating. I do not advocate the use of traditional film making with fixed camera angles and trolley movements, but there has to be some consideration for the viewer, for whom the movie is being made.All in all, it is almost a modern day classic. The Director, Actors, DP, Sound Department, Editor, all deserve a standing ovation, but it is the Script that Rules!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The City of God is a very good film about a God-forsaken place!,"This film recounts the story of a young Brazilian boy named Rocket who grows up in and around the 'City of God'.   We follow his life, from a very young age though adulthood, as he narrates all the crazy adventures of his life and describes all the various characters he encounters along the way.  His life is a tough one, filled with horrific violence, incessant theft and rampant drug abuse, which seems commonplace in his world.  More than anything, this is a story of survival in a vicious community that chews people up and only spits them out if they are lucky.  This existence is a vicious circle that seem to inevitably lead to short life or a life spent in jail or absolute poverty.  The only way out seems to be to risk your life in the drug trade where things become assuredly more dangerous.  Avoiding trouble completely is a very tricky accomplishment and we watch as Rocket does his best to make it in this God-forsaken world.  But will he make it without giving in to the temptations of a criminal life?  After all, honesty doesn't pay in the 'City of God'. The film is marvelously directed and edited.  There is a kinetic feel that rivals Scorsese's work in 'Goodfellas'.  That the material is also similar is not surprising.  This film was clearly inspired by the 1990 gangster epic.  'City of God' definitely deserved its Oscar nominations. I am clearly recommending the film despite the brutality and the overwhelming sense of despair that the film conveys.  I usually don't like films that refuse to feature even a glimmer of hope, but this film avoids that pitfall in the final twenty minutes.  I won't reveal what happens, but the film offers a sliver of hope without selling out the reality and tone of the earlier scenes. Based on true events, 'City of God' is a visceral and shocking peek into a living hell that, by all accounts, still exists to this day.  Poverty will always make crime a viable option... a natural human instinct.  This film highlights that fact with brilliant direction and Oscar worthy editing.  I am not sure anyone would want to watch this film multiple times, it's just not that kind of movie.

City of God - The Endless Cycle,"Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund's City of God is a terrific film about living in the slums and the cycle of violence that accompanies it. Many continue to be stuck in the cycle of drugs and violence, while some try to free themselves from it to make a better life. Meirelles and Lund employ fast-paced action right from the beginning. When it starts out, you are left with a lot more questions than answers. After a few scenes, you start adjusting to the quick pace and you start getting your answers. You become invested in the characters that you couldn't keep up with at the beginning. Throughout City of God, you follow Rocket, who also narrates the film, in his attempt to make it out of the seemingly endless cycle.City of God can be difficult to watch during some parts because of the constant violence, but it gives the film a sense of realism. The use of a handheld camera in parts of this film, first seen in the opening scene, also adds to the feel of realism by giving it the impression of a documentary. The ambient sounds such as background conversations, constant sirens in the distance, and dogs barking also add to this effect. Music also plays a large role in this film as it is set in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.The film's cinematography and editing are outstanding. Even though it starts out as off-putting and chaotic, you get used to it and, in my case, it became one of my favorite aspects of this film. City of God is unlike any other film I've seen and is definitely worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Why?,"Powerful. Exciting. A fantastic storyline. Impressive dialogue.All quotes that have no relevance to the film whatsoever. This film was nothing more than a director trying to sponge off real life events, to play on peoples emotional side with regard to children. ""Oh no a child holding a gun!"". Honestly who cares; if this film can't be bothered to create unique or remotely interesting dialogue, create more of a story than people who chase chickens and deal drugs, and won't do more to create meaning except using handheld shots to make the film seem ""realistic"", then he doesn't deserve to call himself a director.To put this in perspective, who can't say to themselves ""I know! If I make a film about kids who deal drugs and use guns, then it's bound to be considered powerful"". That is a complete cop-out. To follow on from that, anyone could actually shoot the film the same way this director has done; just random handheld shots with the defence of saying it makes it seem realistic - with that theory, any person is actually more than capable of shooting a film, providing they are aware of the single rule of not going beyond the 'magic line' in a two shot. Anyone, and i mean ANYONE could have shot this film and wrote a screenplay for it - had there at least been a script of some interest, then I could believe somebody had taken time to come up with this idea, but it appears even that was overlooked.To its credit, the film does have good acting (though im not overly sure that is certain as I can't speak any dialect of Spanish), and has accomplished a very clear form of characterisation (not really unique characters, but you can tell effort has been put in to identify them as individuals).But unfortunately, I gotta say I find it somewhat of a disgrace that people could see this as #34 on the top 250 Greatest movies. A film should have the ability to entertain; suspension of disbelief, classic quotes, lovable characters, intriguing/interesting/fun storylines, and a display of uniqueness all can accomplish this.

(BAD) BOYS FROM BRAZIL,"This is an awesome film, that has really set the standards for 2003. The samba score sets a tremendous pace, and the film moves at breath-neck speed. The nod to ""Goodfellas"" is all too obvious. It's witty, well-written, well-acted, and perhaps not as violent as you'd expect. Two scenes stick in the mind, the decision as to which child to kill and the slow-motion strobe-light execution at the party. Are these kids or gangsters?

A movie that was born classic,"I saw Cidade de Deus in a movie theater, just the week of the premiere. Although there were long queues, and there was almost no place to sit in the room (I only got a seat in the front row where no one usually sits), I was not prepared for the impact the play produced on me. In a clear language, and with direct images, but without being appealing, the film showed how the period when the favelas were idealized by the middle class occurred - after all, because they were in the hills, it was said that they lived there from the sky '- to communities where gun-to-mouth drug-trafficking shootings are a constant. Combining bluntness and good humor, Cidade de Deus is a movie that was born classic, and that only improves every time you review it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Raw and Gripping Portrait of Life in the Favelas,"The story is based on real events and spans several decades, primarily focusing on the rise of two characters, Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues) and Li'l Zé (played by Leandro Firmino). Rocket is an aspiring photographer who witnesses the brutalities of life in the favela and navigates the treacherous paths of survival. Li'l Zé, a ruthless and psychopathic gang leader, reigns over the chaotic underworld with an iron fist. The film explores their intertwined lives and the consequences of their choices.Fernando Meirelles' direction is electrifying, capturing the frenetic energy of the favelas through a stylized blend of gritty realism and vibrant cinematography. The film's non-linear narrative, rapid editing, and kinetic camerawork create a sense of urgency and authenticity that immerses the audience in the heart of the story. Meirelles skillfully balances moments of intense violence with quiet introspection, allowing the characters to breathe and their humanity to shine through.The performances in ""City of God"" are exceptional, particularly considering that most of the actors were non-professionals from the favelas themselves. Alexandre Rodrigues delivers a compelling portrayal of Rocket, bringing a sense of innocence and hope to the character. Leandro Firmino's chilling performance as Li'l Zé is both magnetic and terrifying, showcasing the character's unpredictable nature and lust for power. The entire ensemble cast contributes to the authenticity of the film, capturing the essence of life in the favelas with remarkable realism.""City of God"" delves into the complex themes of poverty, violence, and the cycle of crime that entraps the residents of the favelas. It offers a searing critique of social inequality and systemic neglect, shedding light on the harsh realities faced by those living in marginalized communities. The film's exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, as well as the consequences of one's choices, adds layers of depth to the narrative, making it more than just a tale of crime and violence.The film's technical aspects are noteworthy, with César Charlone's cinematography capturing the vibrant and gritty visual palette of the favelas. The editing by Daniel Rezende seamlessly weaves together multiple storylines, creating a cohesive and immersive viewing experience. The film's pulsating soundtrack, featuring a mix of Brazilian music genres, enhances the atmosphere and complements the story's rhythm.""City of God"" is a powerful and unflinching portrayal of life in the favelas, delving into the complexities of poverty, violence, and survival. Fernando Meirelles' direction, coupled with stellar performances and technical brilliance, makes the film a tour de force in Brazilian cinema. It serves as both a social commentary and a compelling character-driven story, leaving a lasting impact on its viewers. ""City of God"" is a must-watch for those seeking an immersive and thought-provoking cinematic experience that sheds light on the human condition in all its rawness and complexity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Mesmerizing and Sad,"A few years ago I read a book titled ""Never Stop Walking"" by Christina Rickardsson. It was an autobiography about her life in the favelas of Brazil before being adopted by a Swedish family and moving to Sweden. I remember being shocked to read that children killed and were killed regularly in the favelas. And even with that knowledge that still didn't quite prepare me for ""City of God.""""City of God"" is based upon a true story as narrated by Wilson ""Rocket"" Rodrigues (Alexandre Rodrigues) who grew up in the City of God. In the 70's the City of God came under the rule of a sociopathic gangster named Ze ""Lil' Ze"" Pequeno (Leandro Firmino). He was a vicious hood with a voracious appetite for power. The only way to get power in the underworld was by taking it. He and his right hand man, Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), took over by killing all of the bosses of the City of God save one: Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele). Eventually, Lil Z would go after Carrot's territory and that's when things got out of hand.Rocket grew up in this environment; an environment of poverty, drugs, and violence where crime pays and honest work doesn't. Kids who should've been in elementary school were enlisting in gangs, carrying weapons, and committing robberies like we play tag.The whole of it is sad, yet you want to watch. It is a strange thing in our DNA; we crave excitement and intrigue no matter what form it takes. Even if something perturbs us, we'd rather read, watch, or listen and be perturbed than not knowing at all. ""City of God"" satisfies that itching curiosity of ours. I was watching, stunned by the conditions of the ""City of God,"" hopeful that it could turn around for them, and expectant that it wouldn't. It's a terrific movie for all the reasons I've mentioned, even if to only stir up those of us who like to think such a world doesn't exist.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Harrowing Masterpiece of Urban Realism,"City of God (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund, is a visceral and unflinching portrait of life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Based on Paulo Lins' semi-autobiographical novel, the film chronicles the intersecting lives of young people growing up amidst violence, poverty, and crime. It's a raw and powerful exploration of survival and morality, told with remarkable cinematic flair.The film's narrative structure is both innovative and gripping, weaving together multiple storylines with precision. The non-linear storytelling keeps the audience on edge, revealing the harsh realities of favela life through the eyes of Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), an aspiring photographer who dreams of escaping the chaos around him.Cinematographer César Charlone's work is exceptional, capturing the vibrant yet oppressive atmosphere of the slums with a dynamic, kinetic style. The handheld camera work immerses the viewer in the frenetic energy of the streets, while the vibrant colors and lighting contrast with the grim subject matter.The performances, many by non-professional actors, are authentic and deeply affecting. Leandro Firmino's portrayal of the ruthless Lil Zé is chilling, while the ensemble cast brings an unparalleled realism to their roles.With its pulsating soundtrack, unflinching storytelling, and poignant social commentary, City of God transcends the crime genre. It's a haunting and unforgettable film that sheds light on systemic inequality and the human spirit's resilience. A must-watch for those seeking cinema that challenges and moves them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fantastic style in such a heart-breaking story,"The film-making technique is incredible in every regard. Fernando Meirelles combines unique camera movements, authentic production design, real performances, an energizing soundtrack, and absolutely top tier editing for this beautiful movie. It feels like Scarface mixed with Once Upon a Time in America. After being nominated for four Oscars, not winning any is a crime.Alexandre Rodrigues is very convincing as Buscapé. His sincerity is a good foil for the larger than life personality of Phellipe Haagensen and extreme psychosis of Leandro Firmino.The kids are the real gut punch of this story. The motel robbery means so much more once the reveal is made. The scene with the 'runts' is one of the darkest moments I have ever witnessed. Still in shock. I love the way the story of the apartment is told. The strobe light party is also interesting. All of the combat is intense. The ending is very powerful...

hyperviolence stylized and glorified,"I live in one of the top 10 most violent cities in the world. After Living just a few miles away from one of the thousands of Latin America ghettos, i find that the story portrayed in this film is nothing new, shocking or amazing.. it has been going on, over and over again for decades...Teenage gangsters and hit men, pregnant teens, drug cartels, turf killings, high unemployment, corruption, YAWN... tell me another story.Having also lived most of my life in the US suburbs, I can also see why first world inhabitants were fascinated with this movie, as it presents a sanitized version of reality, where we don't see the aftermath of the violence presented in this movie, and it glorifies third world poverty in a slick and glamorous Tarantino-like way. Countless of dead people are just an afterthought presented in this masterfully edited and photographed film. To the casual viewer in Europe or the US, it all seems so wild and cool, so detached, and exotic, but so far away... and of course the effect this film has, would not not quite be the same if all of its audience actually lived in or near any slum like the one displayed in this film. We see a never-ending stream of dead people, but we never see the grief of those who are still left alive to mourn them, etc etc.It is no wonder that the exporters of glorified capitalist propaganda (Hollywood) were quick to nominate this movie to the Oscars, as it is one of the most cleverly packaged turds (storywise) ever made, complete with the usual neoliberal propaganda of multiculturalism, race mixing and white women throwing themselves to black men and boys.In the decade+ after this movie was made, countless movies and slick TV series have been made depicting Latin America gangsters and ghettos, and it is getting old and tired.If you take away the sheen, the music and the quick editing from this movie, and you are left with another boring third world ghetto story, full of clichéd kiddie characters, devoid of any humanity; killing each other for no good reason and a pathetic story that goes nowhere.Of course the movie has a few good moments where humanity seems to come through, but they get quickly railroaded behind the director's obsession with making another pointlessly violent Tarantino ripoff movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Absolutely Brilliant,"Best gangster film ever made.So to start I can't really put myself in the characters shoes because it is alien to me. I am not familiar with Brazilian culture, favella gangs, or Rio, that doesn't stop it from being captivating though.The characters are fantastic. Very extreme but not crossing in to stupidly unbelievable territory. It is quite consistent with reality where the kids in the film depict reality quite well, where the nutters are souless people with nothing to their personalities other than violence, then you have the fun, cool tier that form the mutual friends of the nerds and the gangsters, then there are the nerds that hate being caught in the middle but have hobbies and ambition.The story follows the life of residents in a poor area and their experiences growing up young, then as teens and the way their friendships, enemies and aquaintances develop over the years.The film ties in everyone's stories in an understandable way but there is a lot to keep track of. I recommend trying to remember the names as much as possible when watching.Overall it is just an incredibly well made portrayal of the village kids and the different paths they take in life and how their paths keep crossing. Starting as some normal kids and some pretty criminal kids, developing to some of them becoming high profile favella drug dealing, gun toting gangster and others just trying to better themselves and chase the dream.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Best Cinematography ever,"Released in 2002, City of God was a true phenomenon of national cinema. To this day, the film is acclaimed as one of the greatest works that the seventh Tupiniquim art has ever produced. The film, based on the book of the same name by Paulo Lins, tells the story of several characters from the Cidade de Deus favela, especially Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues), who is also the narrator of the film. From this premise, we are introduced to the different stories whose intersections culminate in the work of Fernando Meirelles.In technical terms, City of God is a film that does well. The first point to highlight is how photography works precisely to set the various scenarios with their respective historical moments. Proof of this is the more yellowish tone of the film when the childhood of Buscapé and Dadinho (Douglas Silva) is narrated and the change to a more contrasting color tone when they reach adulthood. The portrayal of the favela when the scenery changes is well done, fulfilling the role of immersing the viewer. The soundtrack, the variation of angles, the quick cuts in certain scenes and the costumes contribute in a positive way to represent the turbulence that is life in the favela.The biggest highlight of Cidade de Deus is, without a doubt, its characters. Most of them have their own charisma, are interesting, have a relevant background, play an important role in the plot and are supported by good performances. Buscapé is the point of serenity in the film, always used to remove the viewer from tense moments, he is the narrator of the film and the one who, even created in that chaotic environment, remained firm in the search for a straight life. Despite being malleable, he is built as a coherent character, has a past that connects well with the present moments, develops harmoniously with the story and demonstrates great personality.Zé Pequeno (Leandro Firmino da Hora), or Dadinho in childhood, is the drug dealer who dominates most of Cidade de Deus. Cruel, cold and power-hungry, he is the most impactful character throughout the entire film. Leandro Firmino's interpretation stands out, creating a threatening and at the same time charismatic Zé Pequeno. His development is the most interesting part of the work, since we can see all his rebelliousness since childhood. Her meteoric rise to the head of the favela is believable, even more so after her bloodthirsty participation in the motel robbery was revealed, which demonstrated her inclination towards the world of crime from an early age. All other characters are also well built and their actions, motivations and resolutions are fully justifiable throughout the work. A major highlight is Mané Galinha (Seu Jorge), who faces difficult dilemmas and decisions and grows as a character in the plot.The script of the film is also, in general, well constructed. The choice in the development of the story, starting with the scene that would be the last and then going back to conclude it is different, although far from original, and well executed. The feature is effective in entertaining during most of its projection, demonstrates good planning and maintains an adequate atmosphere of tension during practically the entire work. The film's dialogues also demonstrate the savagery of the environment portrayed there and the script is effective in the setting and impact that it aims to present. The purpose of the film seems to be to show the cruelty of life in the favela and, on this point, the script does very well, however there is also a visible attempt to attack the Military Police institution, since it is portrayed at all times as corrupt and corrupt. /or inefficient, even though the money used to corrupt the police comes from the traffickers themselves. I'm not saying that there is no corruption in the PM, we know that it does happen and, as shown in the film, often because of the money coming from organized crime itself; but the film tries to subvert the order of things by making the exception the rule. It would be more correct to show both sides. The film fails at this point. Otherwise, there are minor inconsistencies at occasional points, but nothing that comes to be worthy of major notice. Its ending is surprising and shows the corruption present in the police and the media.City of God is not the epitome of intelligence and cinematographic production, but it addresses the cruelty of life in the favela in a bloody and insane way, which is worth an extra highlight. It brings interesting concepts, mainly when showing characters who, even created in this environment, managed, by their own merit, to build a different and honorable life. It also shows that, for criminality, unfortunately, there is no age or size and the fight against it must be done seriously, with severe punishments for individuals and with changes in the entire social, urban and, mainly, cultural structure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
not as good as many say,"I am always surprised at how much extreme violence in a movie can take the place of good dialogue and character development.  Granted, I did just read the subtitles, so maybe the original text was better.  But aside from that, I thought that City of God was a horrible waste of my time.  It is good that movies like that are made, but I do not think they should be seen as the only type of movie to see and thus the best.  I saw no real point to the story other than how terrible the life on the streets in Brazil is and how wonderful it was that the narrator survived it.  Some of the scenes made me sick and if that's what it takes to be a good film these days, then I'd rather watch the usual rubbish that comes out these days.I'm also a little worried since I am a writer and like to write complex and interesting stories, but i will not add extreme violence to them.  I want an educated audience to be able to enjoy them without being hit over the head with filth.  Is that possible?",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Movie Refer To Brilliance Of Cinema,"""Cidade de Deus"" is a different kind of movie in almost every aspect than Hollywood movies. Firstly I want to specify that this was the first movie which I've watched out of Hollywood, it shocked me unexpectedly. As a difference, there are pure good and evil character, on the contrary Hollywood, Although one of them(Lil'Ze) trys to be agreeable and easy-going person, he doesn't achieve it. However, Rocket achieve to be a criminal or a guilty like Lil'Ze. The two main character can not change themself even if they want to. In the movie, Every character behave their nature that they've had since their childhood. Another difference is that there are some scenes that Hollywood doesn't dare to make with full of reality. For instance, the scene between Lil'Ze and robber kids. This scene astonished me deeply, while I was watching I thought probably they would cut the scene short but they didn't. I felt the horror as the kid did. The scene was exterminity for even me.Messages that was given by the movie is not spoken compared to its story and its cinematography. Necessity of this kind of life in a place like ""City of God"" or favelas is told even in the first scene. Emnity and rage of pushing out of center of Rio de Jenerio is felt every scene in ""City of God"". And in last scene of the movie, director says, nothing will ever change in these streets. Lives will go on how they do at the present. This is upset all of us but what are we doing to contribute to change it? This movie makes me think this idea. Anyway.

Required Viewing for any Film Enthusiast,"""City of God"" is clearly one of the most aesthetically complex and viscerally charged motion pictures ever made. There are many scenes here for students of film to take great joy in simply in terms of aesthetics. The cinematography, editing, and pacing is inventive, mind-blowing and lovingly inspired by the best work of Scorsese. I could go on and on about the opening ""chicken run"" sequence, ""Shaggy's"" death scene, the disco shoot-out, or any number of other ""WOW"" scenes of pure cinematic adrenaline.It's this kind of movie magic that breathes life into the myth of the ""greatest film of all time.""But be warned, as much as this film can be ""enjoyed"", it is clearly far from the myth it jolts to life with its ""look, mom, no hands"" style of film-making. It's also highly disturbing, more so than anything Scorsese has done. One sequence involving a child who couldn't be older than ten having to shoot another child who looks to be half his age as some sort of gang initiation is so slickly done I felt like I was watching a snuff film. Based on a true story about Brazilian slum dwellers and the crime waves overtaking the town, ""City of God"" is an extremely hard pill to swallow as it wallows in violence, offers up a hearty dose of moral ambiguity, an almost pornographic take on the criminals it depicts, and leaves the viewer with no real solution or any sign of hope that this cycle can ever conceivably come to an end. The film seems to be saying that the only way to over-come such poverty and crime is to document it (witness our supposed hero who becomes a photographer). With its ultra-slick and highly addictive presentation, the film dupes unsuspecting viewers into witnessing all the depravity as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The way in which the lead character's everyday struggles are expertly and fluidly intertwined with the rise and fall of the neighborhood gangs is astounding as he brushes shoulders with various characters on both sides of the law. And the narration, which I don't normally enjoy in films, is some of the best I've come across. Very well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An Unexpected Great,"With pseudo elements of The Godfather, this motion picture is one of those movies that will hold on to you from beginning to end. In this tale of poverty, corruption, and death in the seedy underworld of one of the most beautiful countries on earth: Brazil. This tale is of a young man by the name of Rocket, and as the narrator he is reluctant to tell you every bit of this story. Tracing from his days as a young boy in the sixties to his days as a freelance photographer in the disco era of the 1970's all in the City Of God. But do not let the name fool you because in the City Of God you only find devils and demons. The story follows the tales of the most notorious gangsters, hoodlums, and family all somehow linked to each other.

Such a raw and insightful film,"The use of sound in this movie is very different from the typical movies being released at this time. I would say overall this movie is very different, I think it is more real than what I've seen lately. When I say real I mean there is not a lot of advanced effects or serious CGI going on. There was the use of the split-screen and some other minor effects but nothing too grand to make the movie seem like a made-up story. The limit of these effects makes the movie real to me, almost as if the audience is right there with them. I also think the sound helps bring the realness to life because the background noises of washing dishes or the gravel on the ground are loud enough to be noticed. They are at the volume they would be as if you were right there, or pretty close to it. I think that the ambient sounds are the most used sound effect and it helps give a perspective of the location and even time period. I would say that the diegetic music also helps illuminate the time period with the party music they listen to and the overlapping of the voices adds to this raw, realness vibe I keep mentioning. The narration helps the timeline flow and easier to follow. It takes us along and gives us what we need to know to put the pieces together and understand the characters. Overall, I like this film because it gives an insight into what it was like to live in the slums and the film was portrayed very well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A well-made, honest character study that takes its time; a rewarding and refreshing experience.","Prior to seeing ""City of God"" I kept hearing it was like a Brazilian ""GoodFellas,"" and Total Film Magazine said it was one of the best films of the year. Then Roger Ebert said it was one of the best films he'd ever seen and it got intense praise from critics everywhere. I kept wondering why critics continued comparing its style to ""GoodFellas."" Now I know why.Like ""GoodFellas,"" this is an extremely visceral movie with a very hard edge; it kept me glued to my seat in a way that few movies do, and in fact - yep, you guessed it - the last time I remember being so enthralled by movie-making and a story was when I saw ""GoodFellas"" the first time.""City of God"" is about a group of youths growing up in Rio de Janeiros, where you're lucky to live past 20.It follows one character in particular - a young boy who wants to be a photographer, and abandon his brother's path of violence and bloodshed; he wants to be a respectable journalist, but only if he can survive the mean streets.""City of God"" is a complex film with many different narratives going on at the same time. This non-chronological, refreshing way of telling a story is something I've longed for in cinema recently; formulas are becoming so repetitive I know what's going to happen in a movie just by looking at the poster. Action movies: Stallone or Arnie take on bad guys like it's going out of style. Romantic comedies: Guy gets girl or vice versa. It's routine to the point of nausea.I don't know if ""City of God"" is the absolute best film in years, but it ranks pretty high up there. It's a refreshing experience and the only problem I see here is that based on its popularity, we're going to see a lot of American directors trying to ape the style; we all know how that works.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the Saddest Movies you will ever see,"City of God about life in the slums of Rio De Janiero may be one of the saddest movies I have ever seen.  The movie shows an endless cycle of kids becoming criminals before they are even 12 years old.  It seems that when these children are 18 years old, they will either be dead or in prison. This movie tells the story of one of the few who managed to get out of the slums alive.  It is heartbreaking to watch children who are 8, 9, or 10 years old becoming criminals because it is the only way they can money for food.  When they get older, they eventually start helping out with the drug dealers.  The police only show up every once in a while and don't do much. The drug dealers pays the cops to look the other way.  So long as no rich people get killed, nobody cares.  This is simply one of the most poignant films I have ever seen.  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good, not great.","Well I've finally seen the much hyped City of God, and while it is not a masterpiece, it is an exciting and well directed film.The story is very unoriginal, ""the rise and fall of a criminal"" may possibly be the most clichéd plot in movie history, right after ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back"". Nevertheless it's done with panache in COG. The slums of Rio lends the film a faux originality; it seems fresh because of the exoticness of the locale, but the same plot set in the slums of Harlem would not have garnered nearly as much fanfare as this film receives. also, the gangstas are just children. this is what makes the film so powerful: its yawnworthy to see a grown man shoot another grown man, but a young boy shooting another young boy is immensely disturbing. Do these elements make a masterpiece? not for me they don't.The plot revolved too much around violence i think. yes, I'm sure life in the slums does revolve around violence, but that doesn't mean a movie where we just witness violent act after violent act is brilliant. it got a little boring after a while, as we wait for the inevitable fall of Little Ze, as he just kills and rapes and snorts coke and makes money for about 90 minutes. The brilliance of the direction kept the interest there for me though. Fernando Meirelles is an assured confident director: some of the shots in COG are pure bravado ie. they look cool as hell. I cant wait to see his next film ""The Constant Gardener"".So yeah, City of God is good, perhaps great, but no masterpiece. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Incredible World and Story of City of God,"City of God is a story of a young man seeking refuge in a world that is full of violence and hatred through the lens of a camera.

But it is all based on a true story, which totally amazed me when i found it out at the end of the movie. The only down side was that the plot caught a hold of me and kept me hooked, reeling me in for a great climactic ending. But when i got to the ending, I was sort of let down because it didn't seem satisfying or to be what I had hoped and expected for. But that was before I realized it was all based on true accounts, and that was when i was completely shocked.

One of the best films ever made...may change your life,"This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Fernando Meirelles gets credit for bringing this amazing story to life, after reading the novel written by Paulo Lins.This movie is amazing for several reasons. Many of which have nothing to do with directing. First, the music supervision is amazing. The score features some of the best classics, from Brazilian music. If you aren't a fan of this music, then this movie may make you one.The cinematography is breathtaking. César Charlone is rarely mentioned when this film is discussed, but he should and often. I've never seen a movie that has been shot like this.Bráulio Mantovani did the amazing job of creating a screenplay from the book. The book includes many characters which are not mentioned in the movie.

A dark descent into Brazilian ghetto struggles...,"Wow, what a darkly profound film. Really gets down into the nitty-gritty details of the street gangster life (at least as it was in decades past) in Brazilian slums. The subtle storyline shifts involving various characters throughout the film may be slightly confusing for some viewers, but the general focus is on Rocket (Buscapé), who wraps up the entire plot of the film nicely at the end. The plentiful violence is never gratuitous; it's always believable. Even when casual cruelty is depicted, it makes sense in the world of the story. In spite of the constant drug dealing shown throughout, it really makes your heart go out to the ghetto denizens of South America, and hope that things ultimately will change for the better there.I am compelled to strongly congratulate the entire cast, and particularly the directors (Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund) for creating such a masterful work, and truly capturing the needed atmosphere of fear and tension to make this movie believable, while also sprinkling in a (very) few lighter scenes to offer a sort of 'let up' to the relentless rush of the storyline forward to the jarring conclusion. Just enough of a surprise twist at the end to (almost) nudge this black gem of a film into the 'thriller' category. But not completely, because this is essentially a street gangster tale, though with a different plot than most, and a somewhat different execution.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Riveting Docudrama on youth crime in South America,"I had never heard of ""City of God' until two years after it's release. It's a masterpiece. This is definitely excellent film making. The story is very well told and explained about youth gang wars in Brazil. This movie is based entirely on fact and doesn't sugar coat any of the grisly or horrific details. It's fascinating to see that this was seen and filmed through the eyes of one who wanted to go straight laced and avoid being drawn by the gang wars lair. These kids are practically all teenagers from 16 to 19 years of age. They are armed, street wise, crime savvy and drug addicts. The narrative is quite clear without ever getting abundant. Some scenes are done in the hyper fast forward motion to illustrate a typical day for these kids whether discussing drugs in the slums, having sex, or getting shot and beaten.

Me so not worthy...,"I'll be damned!Last week, in the Singapore International Film Festival, I had a revelation.I experienced a movie like nothing I've seen before.This movie was ambitiously inventive and viscerally beautiful. This movie packed so much kinetic energy; it literally rocked me from my seat. On top of that, it completely incapacitated my senses with its explosively awe-inspiring sights and sounds.Most surprising of all, amidst its kaleidoscopic brilliance, this unbelievable film was still able to firmly hold on to an unexpected avalanche of universal truths & sincere, profound honesty. Such an amalgam of integrity and virtuosity is beyond priceless. Which was why I was beyond speechless.Most importantly, said film incited in me, a normally staid personality, a never before seen passion and a deliriously unknown height of adulation. Thus, imagine my feeling of impurity and unworthiness in its revered presence.To encapsulate all that's been said prior to this, based on that night alone, I am very much prepared to herald this movie as one of the very best film unleashed upon us film lovers, in this young new millennium of ours.And ladies and germs, with enough(or too much) suspense, that film which I will henceforth so revere, is City of God aka ""Cidade de Deus""On a rational front, my beliefs in the greatness of this film stems not from mere prepubescent infatuation (though in jest, I may sound like it). It resides in the most basic of below decision criterias --I have seen CITY OF GOD with my very own eyes.-I have decided on its greatness with my very own mind, and-I know what I am championing for, and why I doing so.Truth be told, exhilarating discoveries for something so kick-ass spectacular, comes only that many times in one's life. It's thus understandable how I can hardly contain my excitement from sharing with the world this serendipitiously rejuvenating find of mine.Which is all the more important that I chose the hard, hard decision to hold for one whole week, before I write this piece. I do think I need to cool down enough in order not to regretfully launch into an uncontrollable torrent of incoherent (unbleeped) expletives, albeit swear words of sheer joys and jubilation in my unwavering praise for this magnificent, superlative film.(phew...)But one week has since passed, and that moment of high is still as sustained as ever, I am infact now suffering from withdrawal syndrome for not being able to immediately see ""CITY OF GOD"" again (and again and again).....It is thus with the highest regard I have for IMDB, that I shall stop right here and now and hopefully revisit this thread with some other of my fawning posts on this fantastic movie, in future. Well, it'll have to be at least long enough for me to sufficiently composed myself (again) and touch on the other positive goodness of City of God.For if I am to continued unchecked right now, afraid I'm gonna turn into a stark raving canine crusading against detractors big and small of this great, great film.(I am so not worthy as I bow before you.)Anyhoo, while Poor Ole Sinny wonders off to one corner to ingest some prescription elephant tranquilizers, my kind fellow posters, watch this space.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
National Geographic meets Goodfellas?,"""City of God"" is a really awesome film. I enjoyed it. I have not, however, watched it since viewing it for the first time about 6 months ago. I haven't felt the need.I suppose it's the kind of movie you only need to see once. The acting is outstanding and the story is amazing too. The child growing up in the slums in a third world country who somehow manages to escape a life of crime and goes on to achieve greatness through photography. It really is a moving film, you can't argue that. Here is where I get annoyed...This film is NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING like ""Goodfellas"" or ""Scarface."" Why it is always compared to films like that, I cannot even begin to understand. A large part of the plot surrounds gangs in Brazil, but it is also very political and extremely human. It is not about organized crime. It is, however, pretty violent though.In short, I dig this movie but if I hear one more person compare it to ""Goodfellas"" I think I'll feed them a few copies of each DVD for good measure.8 out of 10, kids.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pulp Fiction Style Documentary,"First off, there are a few grievances I have with this film. It's sort of made in a way where it's kind of spread into chapters. Sort of like pulp fictions is made into chapters, depicting the story of several different people and events, so too is this film. I don't think this adds anything to the film, since you'll probably end up confused by the number of people anyway. There are a bit of characters, and trying to follow the story of each one may be bit confusing. The film is also narrated by the main character. In essence he gives you a tour of the ongoings of the City of God. In a way, it sort of feels like you are being shown a documentary about a city, rather than being given a movie to view. The documentary style, though informative, seems to be a bit over used, and removes the no-documentary movie feeling. That being said however, the film is good for the story, and depiction of the struggles of both the city and the many characters of the film. The corruption, sorrow, anger, greed, love, and joy are all expressed very clearly, and the film allows you to fully understand these feelings in the characters (once you get them all straightened out). I realize that following only the main characters story line would have drastically crippled the film, and would not have been able to illustrate every other characters story. Because of this it is essential that there are very many characters in the film. Understanding this, it is difficult to lower the movies rating based on there being too many characters to distinguish, as it is necessary for the story line. All in all, this film is above average, however an 8 out of ten may be a little bit generous. A 7.6 would be more accurate. Watch it if you have an opportunity to, but don't go out of your way to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Easily One of the Best Films of All-Time,"They would never make this film in America.I don't mean that it's too sexual or too violent for American filmmakers and filmgoers, though it would be unusual to see an American filmmaking, which fetishizes both topics, be so frank about them.I mean that it's too real to be an American film.I don't mean it's real like Boyhood. That's a different kind of real. American films are, by their nature, full of posture and preening. That's not inherently negative, but it prevents the kinds of conditions that created this film, a steady, unflinching, inward-pointed look at Rio's worst favela, Cidade de Deus, the City of God.American films' desire to take themselves so seriously often gets in their own way. They are often boring and monotonous. This film, while showcasing some of the most serious and dark themes out there, is tremendously entertaining. It can be fun. It can be energetic. It can be delightful. It knows when to go dark and when to explode into color.More than anything, it is captivating. Nothing is predictable, thanks in large part to the film's structure, which alongside Casino is proof that great films can be structured around narration. Actually, Casino is a great film to compare this to. Both films take place over relatively the same amount of time. Both films are about cesspools of corruption and violence, though one cesspool is obviously richer than the other. Both films feature a lot of cursing and explicit violence. Both films feature betrayal and paranoia. Both films feature astonishing grasp of cinematic wizardry. Both films end on relatively quiet final notes.One's about rich Vegas mobsters, and the other's about poor Rio gangsters, but they have a lot in common, not that you would notice that while you're watching either film. They feel fundamentally different, not least because the Scorsese flick is intoxicatingly introverted and psychological, while this film is punishingly vast and open. It reminds me of Slumdog Millionaire in a way, though with all due respect to the incredibly talented Danny Boyle, this is the better film by far. More than that, though, it reminds me of a classic adventure movie mashed up with a 90's- early 00's action movie, like a perverse, distorted Lord of the Rings/ The Fast and the Furious crossover.MM:FR contrasted its frenetic action and pace with a linear story. It's a grand antithesis that is a big reason why that film works so well. This film, with its propelling but non-frenetic action, is free to zip around the entire narrative space. Casino did not take advantage of the fact that its structure allowed it to double back and go on tangents. Scorsese, despite or perhaps because of his detailed background in film, stuck close to the playbook. I like to think of it as a limo driving crosscountry down the highway.City of God, meanwhile, is more like a truck swiveling and swerving down back roads. The opening scene is not the only occasion where the filmmakers take liberties with the timeline of the film. In fact, these liberties form the majority of the first two acts. The film sets up the framework for this right after the first scene, where it essentially argues 'If you want to understand X, you have to understand Y, and if you want to understand Y, you have to understand Z, so we're starting at Z.' But it does not proceed from Z to Y to X. During the Z storyline, the narrator, our protagonist, Rocket, might point out that W is important and come back to it after the film finished storyline Z.Conventionally speaking, this sounds like a recipe for disaster, but it turns out brilliant. The narrative structure is far better assembled and more interesting than almost any other film, proving that often, the unconventional way is the best way. The same can be said for the film's masterful editing and cinematography.The early 2000's were a gold mine for visual craft, producing the most beautiful-looking movies of all time, including the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Amelie, which not coincidentally are the only two films I would say look better than City of God. But in a way, it's even more beautiful than those movies, which are often pretty in the same way a painting is pretty. This is pretty in a way that only a film can be, in a way that cannot be fully scene from just looking at screenshots.This film has a wide variety of showstopper scenes, scenes where plot, character, and craft come together to create a spectacle the likes of which I have never seen before. The greatest of these comes at the end of the second act, at a crazy party that is extremely 70's, extremely Brazilian, and extremely entertaining. As a film critic, I knew something was going to go wrong, but I was shocked and awed by what happened. The visual craft during this sequence is haunting. Thanks to the strobe lights, it is like reality itself is blinking in and out of existence.After that scene, the film's structure changes, and it settles into its final act. It stops jumping around so frequently. The color fades away, and it becomes an urban war film akin to The Hurt Locker and Mockingjay- Part 2. Bombs go off. Good intentions are squandered. Lives are lost by the bucketload.There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.There is only darkness.There is only war.There is only the City of God.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
War on drugs depicted in Masterpiece!,"City of God is a masterpiece, taking a true story of the war on drugs in the slums of Brazil, combining it with local actors, a couple shoot-outs, and an outstanding soundtrack, this film stands up as one of the most influential foreign films of the 21st century. It's quite difficult to create a foreign film directed so brilliantly that the audience forgets they are reading subtitles from beginning to end.     The use of tilted shots creates the chaotic environment the characters are living in, for the audiences in the theaters, and also creates a sense of distortion, as if the character's portrayed are unstable, specifically when Lil' Ze is in frame. This allows them to feel as if there are with these kids: running away, selling drugs, taking a bullet, or smoking pot. The extensive use of color and quick cuts instead of fading from shot to shot, allows the audience to see an intensity in the film, vibration from story-to-story and character-to-character. The similar clothing colors of those in the slums, compared to the drastically different ones of the bigger city, show the relationship the slum characters have in common with each other, even though they are not the same people, they come from the same place. The one character who changes the most is Benny, who also most drastically changes his clothes the most drastically, coincidence? I think not!  The soundtrack is not one you'd listen to in your car, but the specific use of silence and sounds are noticeable. The explosions of guns during the shoot-outs from one end of the city to another is portrayed beautifully with the on-going action in the scene. The dramatic music played at the club Benny gets shot at is played to create suspense, as well as the strobe light continuously blinking, until we hear the gun go off.  The character's are so well-developed that anyone watching this film for the first time could easily give a summary of each named character, as well as identify with one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Absolute Best Crime Film Ever,"When I saw this film I felt it was almost too real. I couldn't separate the fact that this was cinema from how it affects me so realistically.

The film is spectacular, every performance feels completely authentic the characters emotions are completely palpable. It's a disturbingly blunt and stylish view at a world we don't know but can't deny. A world we hate that exists yet are totally drawn towards. This film is better than any film made in America in the past 10 years, it belongs on the top #20 where it's at here, but it truthfully deserves a higher post. It's not only a great film, but it's has a conscience that is lacking from other crime films.

Goodfellas of Brazil!,"City of God is by far the best film about the underdeveloped areas of Brazil and the fact many of the actors, producers and crew were from the district of the same name gives to the flick much more faithfulness to its source. In summary go watch for it is amazing, brutally honest and it doesn't fear to be funny, make the characters likable and to show the more day to day problems of life, like as the narrator say"" find a girl"".This is important because a lot of people believe that ,in areas with high crime rate life is 24 /7 miserable ,well it has its dark moments yes, but humans are adaptable and can find happiness anywhere they live and this film shows that in an excellent way. The performances from even the little kids are great and you almost think that you saw a documentary with the realism in the scenes. That's because is partially true for the film is based on the accounts of the real life inhabitants of the City of God in Brazilia Brasil.Here we see the story of this area from its foundation in the sixties to the urban and dirty environment of the eighties as we follow our narrator Rocket who lives in the area and we learn through him the history, the habits ,the inhabitants and status quot at any given moment in the story. For a film made with only 3,3 million dollars it is amazing directed and thank God ,dispite the low budget no sake camera! The people we meet in the City have their flaws and redeeming qualities, which is awesome, for it makes them totally human.The only sad part isn't that the film isn't known or praised or even didn't make money ( it make 30,6 millions). The tragedy lays to the fact that thirty years after the events of the movie took place, the urban centers of Brazil and in general South America haven't ,with the exception of Chile and Ecuador, got better and crime, drugs ,police brutality and corruption still ruled these areas and unfortunately the problem doesn't show and sign of recovering.I really liked it and I am total to my title ""The Goodfellas of Brazil"" for this historic gangster flick has influenced it and the writers have said that took inspiration from ""Funny how?"", but they didn't copied it, they studied its best parts and applied them to the story while being faithful to their own vision of how to make a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Or maybe I not fan of this genre. :/",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best movies,"This is an amazing movie.After you watch it it lets you think a lot about things that never came across your mind.Basically this movie describes a city that you THOUGHT it was very rare and you wouldn't expect it to exist.However many poor cities are like this one .This city has poverty and most children have guns , and teenagers that rob shops and trade or use drugs while police cannot do anything.It shows two kind of people , one who wants to be a photographer and wants to leave this city and have a career while the other one wants to be the biggest drug dealer in that city and obviously wants to stay and not leave the city.Except from this awesome plot and story ( that is true) this movie is filmed and in an excellent way where the scenes fit perfectly and you enjoy watching every second of it. I gave it a 10 because it deserves it and because it is a unique movie which shows people in poverty which try to earn money to live.Also this movie has a lot of violence and also shows in some parts children doing drugs.This can affect some under aged audiences ( they will think that you can smoke weed / do cocaine and nothing will happen to you).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I recommend watching City of God,"I think that the City of God was a great film to watch. The story line was good and very interesting because there were a few things in the plot where you don't know what was going to happen. Not to be very specific but some parts of the film were mysterious. There were a couple of different slow motion scenes in this film which also gives mystery and makes you wonder what's going to happen to this person that's being filmed in slow-motion. The film puts into perspective of how gang-related wars are around the world and how dangerous it is to be in the city that these gangs have taken over. The majority of the movie was filmed during daylight and in my opinion that is good because you as a viewer are able to see more things in daylight than the dark of course. The acting was done very well and it all seemed so real rather than formal. A lot of the camera shots were either close-up or medium shots which is good in my opinion because it helps the audience get a little more personal with the characters and really see the sadness and greediness of some of these characters. Even though the film is not in English it sets the movie's plot and story much better because, as i mentioned before, it gives a better perspective of life outside of the U.S. which can be really interesting as it was in this film. There was a lot of betrayal and drug dealing as well as killings of enemy gangs over territory, money, and guns. I would've liked to see more wealth in this film because wealth shows power especially when it is gang related. I recommend that you watch this movie. Overall I think this movie was great and I would watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Honest, unbelievable, impossible to turn away from.","A film based on facts. A story of crime in the City of God outside of Rio de Janeiro. Drug-related crime in which young people and children are heavily involved. To show it in a film format is not easy, especially since the book is very complex. And making that film truly fantastic is even harder. But it has been done.The film is not one in which you can gaze at the CGI, or go all 'awww' over a romance, or laugh at the silly slapstick. Here, it is the characters and their stories that make the movie. Nothing to distract you from any flaws or ridiculous or absurd moments. But there needn't be any distractions-the film hits you right in the face with the facts. Because even though it's unbelievable-it is based on a true story/ies. It's brutal, it's honest, it's unbelievable, it's impossible to turn away from and it doesn't stop until the end. And after the credits you are left thinking about what you had just seen, still trying to get your head around the fact that 7 year old boys received guns and were parts of gangs, dying for them. You think about the decisions those people made. Not just Rocket, but every one of them. The answers are not thrown at you-you are required to think.It's strong. It's thought provoking. It's one of the greatest films of the decade, if not of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Great film, very funny in parts and not a 'liberal' sermon","Really loved this film, telling the story of the housing projects of Rio from their inception in the 60s to the end of the 70s through the eyes of a few of its major characters.I avoided this film for ages because I thought it would be a worthy lecture about third world suffering, but it really isn't. My one qualm keeping it from a 10 out of 10 is that with so much history and so many characters in the mix, there are a lot of loose ends and unresolved stories, despite it being about as long as you can sit still for.It's shot and directed beautifully, based on real events and people, and it doesn't condescend to the locals or make them out to be noble saints or any such rubbish. This is just about young people trying to survive - getting high, having fun, making money where they can, etc. The action is exciting and realistic but never glamorous. In the final part of the film we see where the cycle of poverty, zero education and violence ends up - it's like a tragic opera.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

...,"In City of God, the brilliance in movie making is rivaled only by the brutality.It seems every technique known to man has been utilised in making film, which makes it feel like a masterpiece in the original medieval sense of that word. In particular, there is a lot of hand held camera and quite close up shots, which make sense and make the film really tangible and personal.The writing is brilliant. A kid asks another kid what his name is during a brawl and the narrator uses that opportunity to tell the audience his name. A lot of smart little things like that, but the story itself also has a good structure and smart turns.I watched a whole lot of Oscar-winning Hollywood movies and they have just been dwarfed by this Brazilian one, but this crime drama is a really heavy movie to sit through. There is some really really messed up stuff here. Be warned. And in that regard, I have been a little bit sceptical about how believable the extreme villainy of some of the kids in this movie is (and characters in general), but after reading and seeing some of the recent events in the world, I guess I have to adjust my views of reality.This film puts me in a strange position. On the one hand I cannot deny the brilliance of the film. One the other hand, from the entertainment perspective, the film left me feeling kind of uncomfortable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""City of God"" tells yet another story of violence in a unique way","The cycle of violence is not a subject filmmakers have ever shied away from. There are plenty of films like ""City of God"" that try and show such gratuitous violence that we almost become desensitized to it, we expect it. However, there is no film like ""City of God"" that tells this kind of story in rich, visual detail using some very compelling visual storytelling techniques.The film follows a narration and chapters structure, often going back in time to explain the events of the present via the film's narrator, the main character named Rocket, a boy from Cidade de Deus, a slum project in Rio de Janeiro. Rocket has many friends and acquaintances tied to the drug trade and/or people who steal and sometimes kill. While he doesn't do it himself, he's close enough to give us the story of those who do and explain how it has affected his life.The film starts off showing how in the 60s it all began with petty crime to make money and how that escalated into some bigger crimes that had serious consequences. It shows us specifically how one character, Lil Dice, changed everything with his violent ways. Director Fernando Meirelles gives us these little explanatory stories in chapter form with actually text titles to make it clear. With so many names and characters to remember, doing this with Rocket's narration is key to making this an accessible film.In the 70s, it's now Lil Ze (Dice's new name) that rules the streets. Where the only option to making money is to work your way up Ze's chain as he owns every drug ring in the area. It's a life of incredible violence in which all of Cidade De Deus' children believe that crime and dealing is the only way to make money.But while we see all these corrupted characters, we lose sight of how Rocket, an aspiring photographer, has managed to stay out of it, proof that it doesn't have to be that way, although the prospects for change look grim.What really makes this film different is Meirelles' work visually with lighting, color, a variety of non-traditional camera techniques. There is no element of traditional drama. All the scenes are particularly short or time passes rapidly in them. They are snapshot images meant to show us as many characters and lives as possible. While violence, drug-dealing and life in a poor area are not new subject matters, its Meirelles' work that makes this film stand out as one of the best ways of doing such a film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of God,"City of God is, in my opinion, a complete masterpiece. Director Fernando Meirelles' use of a predominantly amateur cast (with some actors, including Leandro Firmino, the actor who played the role of adult Lil Ze, formerly living in the real-life City of God) allows the film to have a very real, candid showing of life within a dangerous slum. In a world where the most promising way of life is to rob, steal, and deal drugs, our main character Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) must try to remain honest and steer clear of the life of crime ahead of him. The film is a fast-paced brutal thriller that unapologetically depicts the real struggles of a life of poverty in one of Rio de Jainero's most dangerous slums. One of the film's greatest achievements is the complete submersion of the audience in the unforgiving world of the City of God, in order to establish a feeling of isolation and desperation, where danger lurks around every corner only to be completely contrasted with shots depicting the more stable metropolitan areas of Rio. This submersion is accomplished using many techniques. First, depicting the origin of the slum in the 1960's as more bright and containing only few criminals only to slowly descend into more violence and criminals, and more killing for the sake of killing in the 1980's. The intensity of the slum is shown with darker lighting, a funky soundtrack, faster cuts, and more firefights. For me, the reason this film succeeds so well is due to the fact that instead of the audience viewing the favela from a safe distance and experiencing feelings of horror because of how different it is from our comfortable lives, we are forced to live it as the real inhabitants do, to be completely submerged in the city with seemingly no way out, and that is terrifying in a completely different way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of God or City of Evil?,"The City of a God is a very ironic name for this movie as well as the city that the film takes place in. When people think of God they picture happiness and well being. In this film however, the City of God is full of thieves and murderers. This movie tells the story of how a group of children grow up with very little parental guidance and gives you a chance to see some of their challenges when they are younger as well as when they are older. The down goes down hill through out the movie and you get the chance to see a boy and his dream to become a photographer come in to play as he uses the power of his photographs to create his own affect on the situation.
Personally, I really enjoyed the movie. It was full of action and kept you on your toes multiple times in anticipation for what was to come. What really drew me to this film was that circumstances similar to these have happened around the world through history and for someone looking from the outside in, it really gives you a sense of how lucky you really are.
As far as the quality of the film goes, it was many action shots showing the perspective of many different characters. The lighting also brought a lot of character to the movie as well, because a lot of the dirty work was done at night time behind the safely of darkness. I believe the makers of this film did a very good job at depicting many of the details of this movie. From the movement of drugs and movie, to the handling of guns and the brittleness of life, they directors captured all of it very well to the point that you could feel what the characters were feeling
 Overall I felt that this was a very well directed movie with a lot of very well captured moments. I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who interested in historical and action filled movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Regardless of being a well made movie, this is an unpleasant watch.","'City of God' might be regarded by many critics as one of the greatest films of all time, but with all the violence, drugs, gangsterism, and sadistic killings, this made for a very unpleasant watch.The film is being narrated by Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues). He lives in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, far away from the glamour you see on postcards. He lives in a neighbourhood called 'City of God' - a lawless place where criminals rule. Apart from gangsters, there are kids with guns, killing in cold blood without conscience. And then there's the drugs. Lots of it.Rocket's brother Goose is part of the Tender Trio, together with Shaggy and Clipper. Shaggy's younger brother, Benny, and Benny's friend L'il Dice hang out with the Tender Trio despite them being much younger. From this young age L'il Dice came up with ideas on how to pull off crime, thus becoming an asset to the Tender Trio.The acting from the entire cast was very natural, so much so that it almost felt like I was watching a documentary and not an actual movie. The photography and editing are also excellent. It was inspiring to see Rocket wanting to rise above his milieu. With little hope for the future for the residents of City of God, he had dreams of becoming a photographer, and followed his passion.Regardless of 'City of God' being a top rated movie, well scripted, and well acted, I was becoming bored with the film and actually couldn't wait for it to end. There was just too much violence reminding me of real life. This is a very depressing movie, and I don't mean sad; I just mean depressing to watch - mainly due to it's unpleasant subject matter.My rating for this top rated movie therefore is low, because I simply did not find it entertaining.

One word: Powerful,"City of god is the most powerful movie I've seen. Period. Is it the best one?. No, but it should be considered as one of the best.Seldom we the viewers have the chance to experience something like this film. From the beginning to the end, this masterpiece allows no time to breathing. The storytelling is restless, the descriptions of the favela and its inhabitants are ruthless, and the hope of a better future is scattered after the sound of a bullet (from the thugs' guns or the police's guns)The story starts in the 60's and right away we see the city of god as forgotten and desolate place, with its inhabitants debating of which way would be useful to earn some money: by working hard or robbing. Here we find our two main characters: one is Rocket (buscape)and the other is Lil' Dice (dadinho).Rocket is a well intentioned boy who tries to carry on a normal childhood (and he is the narrator of the story). On the other hand, Lil Dice is a wannabe gangster who hangs out with Rocket's brother gang. Lil Dice is merciless, psychotic and has a strong ambition to become a well known criminal.Ten years later, we find this two characters in the same place but in different situations. Rocket works as a photographer in a local newspaper and hates Lil Dice for having killed Pato in the past. Lil Dice (now Lil'Ze) has become the greatest drug-lord in the City of God by erasing his opponents. The only opponents left is Carrot, who albeit being a smaller scale drug-lord, he threatens to displace Lil 'ZeFrom then on, the story becomes bloodier as a series of related events between major and secondary characters (Knockout Ned, Carrot, Steak with Fries)leads to a gang war.To sum up, City of God is powerful in both of its side: the human and the brutal. Its depicts the reality of a forgotten place where its people try (in their own way)to not be left behind.

An Inspiration,"What I taught from this movie is that you need to believe in yourself and your success whatever the circumstances are. You may be surrounded by criminals and killers in a village where few got out, you may be called a loser and weak but as soon as you know it, you are an overall winner because you followed your dreams and actually made something of your life. Karma is unforgiving for the bad but it rewards the good in any which way. It's something everybody underestimates. As a European, I find it completely incomprehensible that people live this way. I judged them the complete movie and it's really hard to watch all of those lives get wasted for actually nothing but I guess it's something me and my culture (in general) can't realize. I found a connection with Rocket. He was a guy which was aside most of the time, has some friends but no enemies. I believe many innocent people like him get killed in favelas, which is frustrating, but surely you have much more chance in succeeding than gangsters and drug dealers. Anyway, an inspiring story, it was easy to watch as well even though a lot of people were involved in it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"In the heart of sunny Rio de Janeiro lies a dark world of poverty, violence, and the crumbled lives of young children.","""If you raise a snake, expect to get bitten."" Unfortunately, those who raised Lil Dice never received his own words of wisdom. The 2002 film City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, is anything but what the title might suggest. The viewer is taken on an unforgettable childhood journey that is narrated by Rocket, a young boy who grew up in Ciudad De Deus (City of God), one of the deadliest slums in all of Rio de Janeiro. From the very beginning, City of God is the type of film that captivates an audience with its unique visual style, letting the viewers know they are in for a true cinematic treat. In 2004 the film was nominated for four Academy awards, including Best Cinematography and Best Director. In spite of the severe hardship and the gut-wrenching violence, the cinematographic effects of the film leave the viewer glued to the screen, immersed with intrigue, and begging to hear more about the story of each character, who, at one point or another, fell prey to the evil world around them. The visual appeal of the film cannot be overemphasized. All aspects of editing, from lighting and camera angles, to moving camera shots and mechanical distortions of movement, are pieced together in the most brilliant and fascinating forms. Visual effects are not the sole appeal of the film, as the film takes the viewer on a nose dive into the life stories of several characters, allowing the viewer to understand the characters on a personal level and, in some cases, even form strong emotional attachments. In fact, many of the characters in the movie were recruited from the slums of Rio, including Alexandre Rodriques, who plays Rocket and had grown up in the actual City of God itself. In the City of God, the ""hoods"", or gangsters, are the role models for little kids playing in the streets. They are the ones the little kids look up to and grow up wishing to be. However, these hoods are nothing but kids themselves, young boys, who are given a gun at a young age and made to believe that poverty can be escaped through the short lived treasures of crime. As much as one would love to see Goose, Benny, or any of the other hoods put down their guns, it is important to remember that ""a hood doesn't stop, a hood takes a break.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Horny on main,"Bit of a nostalgia trip here, this was the first film I ever watched in an academic context, when I was 16. It's been five years.Bloody hell.But I have always loved it since then, so I figured it should be added to the record I've been building on here someday...and that day is today. Because of reasons. Reasons including the fact that, while it certainly isn't the film I'd give the most credit to for my love of film today, I think it must be up there. Because if nothing else, it was the first film I was ever forced to watch with a critical eye, and I guess it must have been somewhat responsible for me realising that I liked doing that.It was also one of the first films that I ever really had to think about the editing in, and I remember coming to the conclusion back then that the common phrase about the best editing being invisible isn't true. The best editing is completely visible and mooning you, but also making you love it. And surprisingly, I think 16 year old me kind of knew what he was talking about, because watching this again, I was immediately smacked in the face with how perfectly this is edited.It's often frantic, can be cutting more than once per second in the most intense scenes, but also has such memorable edits that aren't like that, like the apartment scene, the disco, and to such an extent that I think this might just be one of the best edited films I've ever seen.It's directed and shot amazingly too, everything in this looks so gross and in a state of disrepair, there's so many memorable looking moments, and it being filmed on 16mm film to make it look like crap actually helps with this feeling massively.It helps because it makes it feel authentic, which is the key word here: everything about this feels so real. It was shot in an actual favela, it's somewhat based on a true story, the dialogue strikes me as incredibly realistic too, nearly all of the actors were actual residents of the City of God, and so on. And you'd never know that almost none of them were professional actors, every one of them is just that damn good.But as for issues...unfortunately it comes down to the story. I don't think it's bad, it's just a little...been done before. I can't say I was ever particularly surprised by anything that happened, even if the characters do make it stand out a little more than it otherwise would...well, except for a few.One of the Tender Trio in the beginning has a resolution so out of nowhere it's laughable, a certain young character has a twist towards the end that was also out of left field, but unfortunately I think the worst offender is Rocket, the main character.He can disappear from the film for so long at a time that you start to forget he even is the main character, and he's frankly just boring. He barely does anything other than narrate, talk about how much he wants to be a photographer, and be horny, and on that note, his sort of relationship with Angelica never goes anywhere. You'd think the fact that she ends up getting together with another major character might lead to some tension between the three of them, but nope, he just has to stay exactly the same for the whole runtime.So while that's unfortunate, I still have to admire a lot about this film, and you certainly could have chosen a much, much worse first film for me to look at critically, so thanks Mr. Lower.

City of god is nothing you will never forget,"City of god has everything From the fear of the inevitable to the seemingly unending violence in the film.

Meirelles does not prepare his audience for the cyclic violence and unending tragedy within the film.Meirelles attempts to make his audience uncomfortable. This film does an excellent job of highlighting the extreme poverty within Brazil with the diegetic sounds of traffic and clashing knives used to represent violence.

Godless City!,"City Of God (Cidade de Deus) (2002) -It was difficult to hear the vocal track of this film over all the shooting, although I was reading the subtitles, because I don't speak Brazilian/French/Portuguese, it was still a bit distracting.I could though appreciate the story itself and I did manage to stick with the film all the way through. Mostly because I wouldn't have been able to scratch it from my 100 Films To See Poster otherwise, but it really wasn't the sort of film that I would generally want to watch at all. I'm more in to romance, comedy and science fiction and tend to steer clear of things that are a bit too real and this was definitely very real.In a lot of ways the storyline bore similarities to 'Moonlight' (2016) for the way that two young lads went down two very different paths as they moved forwards in their lives and 'Monos' (2019) in the same way that I had no idea what they were talking about and hated all the anger and violence in that film too, mostly because I just can't understand how people can get like that.I did like the way that this one was filmed. The director clearly had a plan for their vision that they were following with precision, thought and care. I liked the flashbacks and the recaps of people's lives that weren't necessarily chronological, but the narrator explained would be covered later, so I knew that I didn't have to understand everything or everybody all at once.Also, as far as I could tell, the whole cast delivered superbly, the locations were apt and the costumes, props and everything else were all appropriate too.The lighting and so on all seemed correct, with a look to them that helped to express how hot the country would be and the tensity of the situations.I don't like gangs or shooting or drugs or violence or crimes, large or small, so this plot was never really aimed at me, but I did understand the message it was sending and how it might have been an important piece of filmic history. I could see that it was something to be taken notice of and that the director was making his mark in the world. However it was all just too horrible for me, all the indiscriminate shooting and idiocy of senseless murder and their general behaviour angered me, because the world and by that I mean the whole world should be a better place by now. We should be intelligent enough to know right from wrong and to love thy neighbour, do unto others and so on.It won't be a film that I will revisit personally, but I might recommend it to others looking to broaden their knowledge of the flicks and how to make them, because I could see that it had it would have value in that respect.556.75/1000.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Among the 5 best movies of all time,"This movie is sure amazing. If it was a American movie, probably would receive higher rater here in IMDb. I fact, I am surprise the a foreign language movie receive so good reviews, because watch this movie in original language (I am Brazilian) is so much more involving than the dubbed version. The language itself plays a role, because there are a peculiar way of expression that the characters uses. Is sad to say that the power of words is lost in translation.Anyway, this movie is among the 5 best movies of all time. I live in Brazil, I know what I talking: it's is not fiction. Rio de Janeiro has a real problem of poverty, crime and drugs, as showed in the movie (the movie real history happened some 30 years ago.Fernando Meirelles, the director, is very nice guy, very humble e gifted.This is not a exploitation movie as some haters say. Unfortunately, it is real. If not, I would agree that there's a lot of violence on screen, but wait... there's a huge distance between the fetishism of violence and the exposure of a real problem.But above all the violence exposed, there's a felling of hope carried by the main character. Besides all the context of poverty that surrounds him, he not engaged to crime. Well, watch the movie...A courageous, strong e very well done movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Life of children amid-st violence and drug-abuse,"Movie Review: City of God (2002) -Ayush Tulsyan Director: Fernando MeirelleBased on real events, City of God is the story of children who grew up in a violent neighborhood of Rio De Jenerio, a ghetto by the name ""Cidade De Deus"" which is Portuguese for ""City of God"". Told from the viewpoint of a boy named Rocket, this movie which spans over more than two decades of violence, depicts a lot of drug-abuse, mafia war, crime led by the motive of revenge, and amid-st all these, the desperation of our narrator to become a photographer. Though the movie is in Portuguese, and you might not identify any of the actors, it is real fun to watch, especially for those people who enjoyed watching Gangs of Wasseypur.The movies begins somewhere around the late 1960s where our narrator is 8 or 9 year old kid who idolizes his elder brother but isn't brave enough to follow him into his hood-lump activities. During one such activity, because of another kid named Lil' Dice, Rocket's brother and his gang end up in trouble. Around mid 70s, This kid Lil'Dice changes his name to Lil'Z, grows into power and takes over all the Drug lords of the town. What follows is Lil'Z regime in the City. The movie revolves around Lil'Z, his friend Benny, Rocket and a former army-man Knockout Ned.There are a lot of indigenous sound tracks in the movie. The opening track aptly does the job of engaging the audience. The expressions, the enthusiasm in dialogue delivery and the music aptly conveys all the emotions.The Cinematography is amazing. A lot of wide frame shots have been taken stunningly. The color scheme has been maintained throughout which ensures continuity and absorbs the viewer in the movie, which is further supported by camera movements. They areas intuitive and thought out as they could be. The direction and the set design also have a constant taste throughout the movie.City of God is something which gives you an insight in the lives of people living in violence affected regions and the effect of this violence on the local children. If you're comfortable with cuss words, then this movie is a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
amazing! Brilliant! Realistic! Stylish!,"A surprising find! One of the greatest films I have ever seen. Can be brutally real and shocking at times. Wonderfully stylized film in the stringing together of several stories that revolve around the main character. The fact that it is a true story is absolutely mind-blowing. Great writing, great cinematography, great stylistic directing, but not so stylistic that it seems not real or plastic. Still maintains its integrity. Great acting.

An amazing story telling experience,"The City of God is an amazing film that portrays the lives of those living in Brazilian slums. The film focuses on a boy nicknamed Rocket and his struggle of trying to live an honest life in a dishonest world. City of God is told as a culmination of stories that focuses on different characters throughout the film. Multiple times it introduces a character as someone who isn't the main focus of the story, but later plays a big part in a different story. This style of storytelling made the characters interesting because the viewer has already met the character and is excited to hear their story in depth. City of God also has really solid framing with the story ending in the same place it started. The use of flashbacks also help tell the story concisely and reminds the viewer of important details that might have been forgotten. The camera work in the film is a thing of beauty. An abundant use of hand-held shots makes it seem like you're actually there. The opening tracking shot was particularly impressive as it followed a wild chicken through the streets. Whenever a new place is introduced, there is a nice exposition shot so the viewer has a good understanding of where the scene is taking place because a lot of the slums can look very similar. The acting in the film is pretty good considering many of the minor characters were local children in the area with no acting experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Magnificent Movie Experience,"I had been trying to watch this for a while and when I finally was able to see it I was blown away!It is one of the most exciting, original and interesting films I have very seen.It has a great style of directing. Upon introducing a main character it would give you a whole back story of the person.It is very fast paced and action packed which is great.The acting is fabulous considering a lot of the actors were children.Interesting to see that it is based on a true story.The violence can be quite brutal and graphic at points but but nothing that will make you vomit.Overall I thought it was a magnificent movie experience and a must see for all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You can neither hide nor run and you eventually end up getting caught,"Another movie with one of the characters narrating the story.In this case a real life story. The direction is just perfect. If he had just shown it as a single long story it wouldn't have been that effective. Breaking up the whole story and connecting them from one to an other was a perfect idea which worked out perfectly well. About the movie , city of god as i cud perceive it was mainly a city of blacks where violence is at its peak. Gangsters,Drugs,Deaths,Gunshots are pretty common for the people living in the city of god. Maybe this sounds common as we see this in many movies, but what is uncommon is that a person burying his alive wife, a young boy killing all the people in a motel, small boys who can hardly speak roaming around with guns etc. Part of the story is based on revenge. Everything for just the desire of a person to become the boss of hoodlums. An excellent movie with a strong story and perfect depiction of reality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A gritty and compelling portrayal of life in the favelas,"""Cidade de Deus"" or ""City of God"" is a masterful exploration of the harsh realities faced by residents of Rio de Janeiro's favelas.

Through their experiences, ""City of God"" delves deep into the complex dynamics of power, survival, and redemption.The film is renowned for its kinetic energy, stunning cinematography, and visceral storytelling. The frenetic pace and non-linear narrative draw viewers into the chaotic and dangerous world of the favelas, where every choice has life-altering consequences.With its authentic performances and gritty realism, ""City of God"" offers a poignant commentary on social inequality and urban decay. It challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about the systemic issues that plague marginalized communities, making it a thought-provoking and unforgettable cinematic experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Review of Cidade de Desus,"City of Gods, directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, tells a story of life in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the area known as the City of God. This is an area of high crime and where drug dealers are running the streets, and where children are more interested in playing with guns rather than playing with balls. This movie shows how children killing other children is something normal. The movie does a fascinating demonstration of mise-en-scene, especially in the opening scene of a knife being sharpened on a rock to depict the danger of the area. This becomes significant because its a representation of how anything is used as a weapon in the City of Gods.The headless chickens are another mise-en-scene to signify the children running around causing chaos with their guns while the chicken that escapes is a representation of Rocket, who is looking for a better life outside the City of Gods.Throughout the movie there are fascinating shots utilized. An example, low angle shots are used to present the children stomping through the streets causing chaos. In these low angle shots their bodies are seen as silhouettes which shows faceless children who lives mean nothing. Another low angle shot is the children shooting the chicken to indicate power. There are many close up shots, one is the close up of Rocket and Lil Ze to display Rockets hatred towards him. Slow motion is utilized to Represent Rockets fear of Lil Ze when he is standing in the middle of the street between the cops and Lil Ze. There is also significance of color tones from going to a dark blue color which indicates fear and hard time to a yellow color which indicates calmness and happiness.The movie overall does a fascinating job with the use of different angles and lighting and the contrast of colors to help build the story of the children in the City of Gods, however I didn't enjoy seeing children finding joy killing each-other. I rate this movie 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Hell on Earth,"It's a measure of how untouchable Quentin Tarantino was once considered that City Of God director Walter Salles was compared favourably to him on the film's original release: pre-Slumdog, world cinema wasn't usually associated with breathless, hyper-kinetic camera-work.Set among the gun-happy gangs of Rio De Janeiro, this explosive drama grabs viewers by the scruff and tips them into the middle of the Brazilian favelas, aka 'Hell on Earth.' This writer also recalls (almost literally) dragging his unwilling ex into the cinema to see this, after catching it a day before. Afterwards, she was extremely grateful. That's how good City Of God is: a film you'll happily see twice in two days. But more impressively, a movie to win your girlfriend over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

With great characters, absolutely convincing acting and a story that is told incredibly well by at the same time being so interesting that it drags you in and brutally shocking.

10 stars for this masterpiece!,"Some people shy away from foreign films because they:1) remember the (often) boring foreign films of the 1970s-1980s. 2) don't like reading subtitles 3) want some fluffy Hollwood escapist movie (forgetting that nine out of ten times they are disappointed)When I rented ""JFK"", there was so much rapid-fire, complicated dialogue that I finally decided to turn on the English subtitles so I wouldn't miss any important detail. Ever since then, I realized that subtitles can actually enhance a movie. After a few minutes, you don't even realize you're reading anymore.Over the years, I have taken a dozen trips to Brazil, and in my estimation, this movie is an amazingly realistic depiction of life in the favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro. Some parts of that life seem really quite pleasant. It's not a depiction of abysmal poverty. Being poor in Rio doesn't necessarily mean sadness and despair. After all, these people do live in Rio de Janeiro, one of the most spectacularly beautiful and lively places on earth. You may not have much, but you can always go to the beach.That said, it still is heartbreaking to see how a clean, safe public housing site in Rio, so full of promise, degenerated into a chaotic nightmare of crime and death due to drug trafficking.However, don't think this movie is ""a downer"". It's a frequently riveting and intense film full of action, drama, and a bit of humor here and there. Other times, it is as laidback and carefree as the Carnival-loving, beach-going residents of Rio typically are.The story is narrated by a young boy, Buscape (whose nickname means ""Rocket""). His ticket out of slum life is by pursuing photography. From his perspective, we see how a once idyllic neighborhood is destroyed by gang violence, mainly due to fighting over the control of illegal drug sales.Even very young children, some only 7 or 8 years old are involved in horrific crimes, and others are the victims of crime. Some of these children seem to have no qualms about just killing anyone they dislike. They shoot someone dead, and laugh about it.If I wanted to convince someone to start watching foreign films, I would choose City of God as the best way to change their minds. It is not only one of the three best foreign films I've ever seen, but one of the most remarkable movies you'll ever see.I gave this movie 10 stars, and I don't think I've ever gone that high before!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Lives up to the hype and so much more,"This is the story of one guy, who lived in some poor slum.but it also the story of the slum itself... how the slums destroy people and turn them into animals.the main character is not the main character- he is just a passive observer as we are.the other characters are equally just observers.the main character is poverty and the slums it creates, the lives it creates and destroys. the main character is greed and how it corrupts and destroys friendship and love. the main character is how the soul copes with constant pain, and how fragile life and death truly is.the main character is our very nature...City of God- captures a moment and a place, but it could be any moment and any other place, it captures the circle of life and death... mans worst emotions and desires, his very nature being brought forward... and in all that darkness we see one light trying to make sense of it all *SPOILER* i added a spoiler because i want to talk about the ending.The end may seem like a ""good"" ending- our ""main"" character goes on to become one of Brazil's best newspaper reporters. however, that isn't the end of the film at all...thw real end is watching the main antagonist die and watching children take his place.... no, not children killing him, but the slums themselves killing him, devouring first his soul and then his body... and watching the circle repeat with a new generation. the end is simply the truth- the poor will always suffer, the rich will always prosper, and the only way to become like the rich is to be more ready to tred over others on your way to the top.This film isn't about a slum in Brazil, its about human nature",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Fully touching, and completely gripping","Every scene, character, and word in this film is near-perfect. the plot line presents something very rare in common cinema; something we have lost with everyday rom-coms and ugly punchlines.With all the drugs and weapons that are so readily available to everybody in this film, including children, it is hard not to feel for the constant aroma of careless killing and accidental suicide. and this feeling is what brings us to the depth of a most compelling idea that, though we catch glimpses of it every day, we are from the pressurizing people that have grown up killing and dealing drugs.Only movies such as Kids and City of God are able to explain through graphic images and intriguing characters that people need help. the end of City of God is a rarity that presents hope, and gifts your heart with the feeling that causes you to exert a breath of joy and general wonder.To anybody that may be doubting the idea of a life worth living, see this film, and see it again. it is more than my wish that people will more often recognize the brilliance of cinema, and the seldom seen masterpieces such as City of God.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Very disturbing scenes for any decent human beings,"I would like to share my opinion with those interested in watching this violent film. If MIRAMAX films aims to draw attention to the crime and drug problems of the poor neighborhoods of Brazil, they should not use these kind of shocking portrayals of violence against children, total disregard of taste, and association of sex with violence, drugs, and criminal activity. If one was really interested in solving Brazil's desperately poor and criminal gangs, government-sponsored media should be used, (the raising of) television commercial adverts, political action, and the use of Red Cross Society and Amnesty International. The awful aspects about this movie are that young children are shown being frightened and subsequently shot by gang-members, black children owning guns, and the association of sex and lust with crime. After that, the (general) public is appalled at the number of incidents of child violence and child pornography being distributed on the world wide web. Films like these should be reviewed by a special committee for their quality and their degree of taste of delivering the message they sought to deliver. In my personal opinion, there should be no room for such sort of films that contain raw and barbaric portrayals of violence, bullying, and humiliation in civilized society, in order to prevent the very idea of turning to violence among the desperate poorest of the poor.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cidade de Deus,"Many movies try to recreate the real world, giving us a ""true"" story that's supposed to be gripping, gritty, and scary but never completely accomplishing the goal. Other times we get movies that would appear to give us what we were expecting if it weren't for the fact that they've been done over and over again. In 2002, though, Fernando Meirelles gave us a new story that showed us a new world. Focusing on the true story of Rocket as he grows up around the gangs in Cidade de Deus, a neighborhood in Rio de Janiero where gangs of children ran free to rob, loot, and deal drugs, City of God feels more like a documentary than a dramatic theatrical film.Narrated by Rocket (Alexandre Rodriguez), City of God begins with the story of the Tender Trio. The Tender Trio, a teenage gang that pretty much ran Cidade de Deus in the 60's which also included Rocket's brother Goose, robbed gas trucks at gun point, stealing the money and giving the propane to the people around them. They never made much off the money, so a young hanger on named Li'l Dice gave them the idea to rob the rich in a local hotel. Things don't go quite as planned and everyone in the hotel ends up dead, with the Tender Trio hunted by the police. Fast forward to the 70's and Li'l Dice, now Li'l Ze, is the most respected hood in Cidade de Deus. Having killed all the members of the hotel in the 60's robbery, and Goose, Rocket's brother after that, he got a taste of blood. As Rocket tries to avoid him, Li'l Ze kills off all the drug dealers in Cidade de Deus making way for him to be the only hookup in the slums. But, as he gains control of the slums, he kills the family of one man who is going to try his damnedest to take him down.City of God is a gangster movie through and through, but while you might see some things that remind you of other gangster movies you never feel that this movie is being derivative. The director does borrow things from, say, Martin Scorsese (e.g.: the talk of how drug dealing works in the slums reminded me of Casino), Meirelles always makes it his own. And while the movie is a gangster movie and does deal with a gangster making his way up the chain and ruling the crime world in a neighborhood, the movie never feels like it's taking the usual route, giving equal time to the rise of the Li'l Ze and to Rocket's venture in becoming a photojournalist and staying out of the crime world.The film looks absolutely amazing. The cinematography gives everything the feel of being in the sun drenched City in Rio de Janeiro. On top of that, the camera moves gives the film a sense of urgency and a certain freshness that makes everything feel that much more real. The writing reminds me a bit of Quentin Tarantino, it's a bit all over the place, but in a good way. As you meet a character that's important to the story your whisked away into the world of who they were before they entered into the story. It works in much the same way as Tarantino's ADD addled films, but never takes away from the story as it has in other films that have tried to copy the ""Tarantino Method"" so to speak.While all of that works to make an amazingly gripping film, there would be nothing without the actors. Typically, in my reviews, I would prefer to point out great performances, but in this movie that's nigh impossible. From the Runts (young groups of children who loot and rob people and businesses in the slums) to the main characters, everyone works as a team player. The point is that they're performances are so genuine, so unique, that everyone feels like the live and breathe in this world. When watching this movie you feel like you are visiting Cidade de Deus, and that's what you really want from this type of movie.In this movie I can see no bad, but there are things that you should know before you watch the movie. The majority of the violence is dealing with children and teens, which makes the violence more frightening and disturbing. Meirelles doesn't shy away from anything, even murdering a six to eight year old child. One of the great things about the way the violence is handled though, is that you never want the violence to happen, you always feel disturbed by the violence that does happen and prefer to stay away from it as the movie goes on (the way it really should be in movies). The movie is in Portuguese so you will have to read subtitles, but I have to say, if you choose to do so, you'll be rewarded by the story you receive. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best Brazilain movie and one the world best movies ever,"""Cidade de Deus"" is a emblematic masterpiece!.
In the first Scene (the running chicken) we can see that what we´re gonna watch is not a ""more of the same"" movie.We follow the city of god history back in the day, in the 60's, when it was a little organized and not so bad community, with simple and convy houses. However, the community was forggotten by the gorvement and thrown to the moths since its origins.
Ten years after in mids 70´s and most proeminent in the 80´s we see how destructed, ugly, dirty that place came to be.
Its a shock!
could it all been different?The story itself and simple and well paced and told.We see the comunitty from ""buscape"" Eyes.Tells a history of two rival drug dealers, but its almost the backgroud story. The movie represents a historical, political and social history of every ""favela/guetto"" and how the become what they were, a sad life that are a reality in poor countries such as Brazil and Colombia
The acting is suberb, we really think that the actors did not acted, plus is the first movie of the star Alice Braga!
The Directing reminds of many Tarantino movies (such as the meaniful dialogues) and the Godfellas, but i think the essence of this movie is even deeper.
A truly masterpiece

My all-time favourite film... and I mean it!,"I think I have watched this film several times by now and I'll probably watch it several times more in my lifetime. I'm not the kind of person who watches films more than once. If I remember what happens I don't need to see it again.There are only a small number of films I can watch over and over: - The Shining; Warriors; Leon the Professional; Golgo 13; Ninja Scroll; Jungle Book; Southern Comfort and of course, City of God.The film is so engrossing. I remember when I first watched it I was sucked into the storyline and forgot everything happening around me. The way it's been directed really feels like you're watching real life. The slums feel like slums. The cast all look like they belong in their environment (the director apparently cast a lot of people who weren't actors and actually came from the city of God). The dramatic movements are genuinely moving. I can't put any spoilers here, so all I'll say is the moment at the end gave me goosebumps.

A genuine masterpiece! ... A must see!,"Never yet had I seen such a movie with all of the elements that I want in a movie, until I had seen this one. Who would've thought that it would come in a foreign film, or in a true story? ""City of God"" ( ""Cidade de Deus"" ) is the story of a teenage boy living in one of Rio de Janeiro's slums, and he dreams of becoming a photographer. The boy's name is Rocket ( Buscape, in Portuguese ), and little does he know that his passion for photography would allow him to take his camera and look at his world through the eyes of a journalist who is able to capture on film what so many reporters had been craving for so long but were not able to capture. ... It's interesting that Rocket also is the narrator of his story throughout the movie.But, even though Rocket is the main focus, it is not only his story. It's also the story of two other main characters: Little Ze, who is a ruthless kid who grows up to become the boss of the slum. And Knockout Ned, who is the very opposite of everything that Little Ze stands for. The two eventually butt heads, and all hell breaks loose.The fates of the characters in this movie prove to be never what you would expect, and their stories will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end! Shot in the actual slums not far from where the story really happened, using mostly local amateur actors whom had never been in front of a camera ( also from these slums ), this movie is directed so brilliantly that it makes you feel like you are right in the thick of the story. ..... It's tastefully done; not over the top with gore, while at the same time effective enough to get its point across.The movie always has you guessing, because just when you think you know what is going to happen next, usually it's something very different. ..... Also, the strategic use of flashback scenes to fill in the gaps of the story is a very nice touch.Along with an original soundtrack album which I feel is just as fantastic as the movie, the ""City of God"" movie will keep you on the edge of your seat from the get-go. In a setting of the period from the late 1960's to the late 1970's, the performances of this mostly under-21 cast is simply amazing, and very convincing ( especially considering the the majority of them are not professionals ).Also, one nice thing about the movie, is that you seem to notice one more thing in the movie with each additional viewing that you didn't notice in the previous viewing. Whether that was purposely done that way, or strictly a coincidence, either way it was a nice bi-product of an already great movie. ... To notice something new each time you watch the same movie is always a nice thing! To say anymore, I would have to spoil some of it. So, I'll just say ____ If you want to see a movie that really makes you feel, a movie that you want to tell your friends about, a movie that will leave you wondering what has become of the characters in the present day, and a movie that you will definitely not forget, ""City of God"" is definitely a movie for you!

"A visceral, dark, but tremendously compelling film","This film is truly incredible. It's basically a picture of the lives of a group of boys as they move from pre-teens to young adults and it's startling yet simultaneously exciting to watch.The acting in the film is superb, both the older actors and the child actors turn in memorable performances, especially those playing the three leads. Character development is crucial to this film's success and this is down to a great script and some nuanced acting - which in turn creates some very likable characters, although my favourite performance was probably that of the 'villain' Lil' Z, who I feel was able to make us even empathise with him occasionally despite some of the cruelest behaviour possible. The storytelling is quirky and almost fun (shining through the darkness, I guess) - with the narrator, Rocket, guiding us through the events in his life in an unconventional, practically omniscient way. Twists and turns are not overused - on the contrary they are used to great effect at just the right points. Nothing really feels out of place as everything is pretty logical.The direction and cinematography also deserve high praise. There are some great shots (which I shan't spoil for you) and the dark, green/blue tinted colour of the film is equally noticeable.All in all, the film is exciting and is one of the best gangster flicks you're likely ever to see - so buy the DVD/Blu-Ray and get watching!

"Nice , Great","Adapting the novel by Paulo Lins, who grew up in the Cidade De Deus fa vela and based the story on actual events and characters, screenwriter Braulio Mantovani has condensed the mammoth 600-page tome into key chapters, titles of which appear on screen, and split the action into three specific periods: the late 1960s, the 1970s and the early '80s.Despite comparable use of gangland kids stepping before cameras for the first time, Meirelles' film (co-directed by Katia Lund) has far less in common with fellow Brazilian Hector Babenco's crime saga ""Pixote"" than with ""Goodfellas"" thanks to factors such as its use of music and voice-over, distinct feel for each period and frequent narrative digressions and backtracking.However, ""City"" is no cynical, hipster account of criminal bravado, instead spinning its bruising tale around a tenderhearted center in aspiring photographer Buscape (Alexandre Rodrigues). Clearly representing author Lins, Buscape exists in the thick of the action but is the one significant figure to maintain some purity, providing the sprawling, multi-character story with a unifying voice.Bracing opening places Buscape face to face with the gang led by Ze Pequeno or Little Ze (Leandro Firmino DA Hora) as the group chases a runaway chicken intended for supper before they take on members of a rival band. Action then rewinds to the '60s, when the city was a shantytown of low-cost housing without electricity, paved streets or transport. The 11-year-old Buscape recounts the rule of the so-called Tender Trio. These adolescent amateur robbers were looked upon as the toughest hoods imaginable but were angels compared with the more ruthless criminal corps that would later evolve, to be led by then Pr- teen Ze, known at the time as Little Dice (Douglas Silva), who quickly exhibits an appetite for power and killing.In the '70s, Ze consolidates his empire, flanked by trusted buddy Bene (Phelipe Haagensen), progressing from robbery to coke-dealing and wiping out all the competition save for rival dealer Sandro Cenoura (Matheus Nachtergaele), who's protected by his friendship with Bene. This central section is perhaps the film's most enjoyable, with a richly colorful character in Bene, who transforms himself into a bleach-blond playboy and whose mellow nature provides a useful counterweight to Ze's hard, cold ambition. Planning to bow out of crime to grow weed on a farm with his girlfriend, Bene throws a farewell disco party but is killed in a skirmish before making his exit.His departure leaves Cenoura suddenly vulnerable. But before Ze can eliminate him, he makes another formidable enemy in Manu Galinha (Seu Jorge), whose girlfriend is raped and brother is killed by the now 18- year-old gang leader. Teaming with Cenoura, Manu goes up against Ze in an escalating war, as Buscape's photographs contribute to spread their notoriety in national media.Creating a complex, non-linear narrative construction while maintaining a clear through line, the eventful mosaic is given a lively dynamic by its constant shifts in focus to foreground different characters, often fleetingly introduced with a promise to expand on their stories later. That liveliness is further enhanced by d.p. Cesar Charlone's knockout visuals and Daniel Rezende's machine-gun editing, both of which make stylistic transitions to differentiate between the three periods.In addition to shooting style, color is used keenly. Early section when the fa vela is an undeveloped series of box houses divided by open, sandy stretches is bathed in golden light that gradually intensifies into richer, darker tones as the area becomes more built up, overpopulated and dominated by crime.Devices such as split screen, slow-mo, jump cuts and whiplash pans add to the visual texture, with all the technical prowess bordering on show- offs at times, particularly early on. But the film's pulsating rhythms, narrative heart and the intense faces and itself-conscious work of the non-pro cast — who went through an extensive workshop process before shooting — make this a hard-edged, taut and compelling crime odyssey, all the more powerful because its protagonists rarely reach the age of 20.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best Movie,I can watch this movie non stop on going it is the best movie. it has entertainment and also a dark side to the movie.

Cidade de Deus,"Told by way of an occasionally narrated retrospective, ""Rocket"" (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells us a story of his childhood in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Growing up in a community of newly built boxes, without power or plumbing, that reminded me of a row of concrete beach huts, the community is pretty lawless. The crime is largely to confined to pettier crimes, but as aspirations grow so does the scale of the criminality. A raid on a motel-cum-brothel is supposed to make everyone extra cash, but their inventive young watchman ""Li'l Dice"" (Douglas Silva) hates being left out and so does a little augmenting of his own. Brutal and attention grabbing. Next the cops crack down, bodies pile up and the societal order starts to change. It's this young man who grows up into the leading drug-peddling hoodlum amongst a now much more developed township where, tempered only by his more diplomatic childhood friend ""Bené"" (Phellipe Haagensen), the newly named ""Li'l Zé"" (Leandro Firmino) is ruling the roost. Curiously, his own form of government proves more stable for the residents, and although many are addicts there is a certain degree of law-and-order. Then the runts start to intervene. These are the young children with no hope, no families and only the dream of becoming their own version of ""Li'l Zé"" one day too. Gradually, the empire expands until it's only ""Carrot"" (Matheus Nachtergaele) who stands against him. When tragedy strikes very close to home for the kingpin, though, the easy peace between the two sections breaks out into an open warfare that drags in the sharpshooting army vet ""Knockout Ned"" (Seu Jorge), arms all the enthusiastic children and creates an environment that isn't safe for anyone and where the police keep their distance in the hope that they will just all just slaughter each other. It's lucky that ""Rocket"" can use a camera. His boss wants publicity to illustrate how dominant and powerful he is. The newspapers want the photographs too. If the young man can walk the tightrope carefully, he might find himself well placed to capitalise on his unique access to a story that by now is gripping their nation. This is a fascinatingly well put together depiction of the worst of human nature; a dog eat dog world, where traditional humanity is scarce and the virtues of a not so benign dictatorship are exposed for all to see. The characterisations are mostly brutal and exploitative, yet there is a place for love and loyalty too amidst a poverty stricken population that craves basics like food and running water and is oblivious to death in the streets. The story is well supplemented by some engaging supporting characters like ""Steak n' Fries"", ""Goose"", ""Shaggy"" and ""Thiago"" (Daniel Zettel or is it really Timothée Chalamet?). The writing delivers powerfully but sparingly. We don't have loads of waffling dialogue, and there's also quite a bit of dark humour contained to not so much lighten the mood as to enhance the perception amongst most of the population that kill or be killed was a perfectly reasonable mama. Firmino, Haagensen and Rodrigues deliver extremely well here in this most impressively photographed and intense look at a society where the top dog was only top by feeding and starving his followers. It's not especially graphic, I found, just a poignant look at survival of the fittest, the shrewdest and the luckiest. There's also a distinct lack of religiosity throughout, too! If you can see this at a cinema, then do - it's based on a true story and isn't an easy watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The most grotesquely violent movie I've ever seen!!!,"If the director's aim in making this movie was to make the most grotesquely violent and repellent movie in the history of cinema, then I think he's probably cracked it. This is a train wreck of a movie, one that at the same repels and engages the audience; well, that's what it did for me anyway. Certainly, there's a Hell of a film-making talent here and the end result is truly, and sadly, unforgettable. I can't say I enjoyed seeing this movie but technically it does have great merit. And, having sat through this movie, now I know that the very last place in the whole world that I would like to see at first hand is this slum outside Rio. I've never had any great desire to go to Brazil or to any of its major cities despite having traveled widely. Now I know for sure that I can give Rio a miss, especially after hearing from a good friend that he was robbed at knife-point on Copacabana beach some years ago.

City Of God,"CITY OF GOD – 9.8/10Director: Fernando Meirelles & Kátia Lund(co-director)Writer: Bráulio MantovaniI can get into the technical aspects of the film and destroy it or I can just leave you to do the hard work. I think I'll go with the latter. An ensemble cast with only one trained professional actor, the film is the finest I have scene when it comes to depicting lives of those living in situations so unfortunate, that most of us forget to be remotely thankful or remorseful. The screenplay though, needs special mention; we constantly but seamlessly cut back and forth in time throughout the film – a special thanks to Daniel Rezende for the razor sharp editing – but never is the viewer lost, so refined is the choice of sequences and finessed the flow of the film. There is also a reason why the film is cyclical, the point of which I am hoping to get across by the end of review (enough of technicality).The story progresses from the point of view of Alexandre Rodrigues (Buscape – Rocket), the only individual to escape the violence but not the favela. Through his camera and narration, we see the lives of several children/individuals, who grow up in the City of God, a housing project in Rio de Janeiro quite notorious for its criminal activity. The film casually depicts how children get absorbed into mindless violence and are perpetually condemned to it, their lives spiraling towards an endless state of human tragedy. The plot is too lengthy to narrate and it wouldn't serve a purpose to serve up spoilers either. There is something this film evokes within me, which I feel is worthy of a mention.There is a prevalent belief that if a film is nominated for Oscars, it must be good. That is a dangerous belief. What is even more dangerous is the belief that if a film did not win an Oscar, it must have not been ""that"" good. To understand the complexities of a film like City of God, there is no given formula; but if you are from a third world country and have had first hand knowledge or even worst, experience of such a life, there is a good chance you might not relegate such films to award ceremonies.Social structures are complex. We take what we get (at birth) as a given and live with it for the rest of our lives. The marginalization, is a given. Wealth disparities, cultural and behavioral differences across strata are all a given; it is what we use to separate ""us"" from ""them"". The ""them"" & ""us"" & ""us"" & ""them"" perpetuates. We never imagine what our lives would be if we were not born to the fortunes we were. Instead of our parents, if our guides were our peers who were gun wielding, drug churning maniacs, whose lust for power leads to failed societies and absolute chaos, the very same power the civilized societies so tacitly condones.The director wants us to ruminate, to ponder, to reflect. Take the directors intent too seriously and all coffee table discussions about poverty, crime, brutality and the children who are victims and perpetrators of such intent, might seize into oblivion. The ""us"" & ""them"" might fade and disappear, the same ""us"" & ""them"" which gives us our superior identity and allows us to take pride and reason in what we do. Well if you dare to fathom the film City of God, all the superiority complexes, the fragile mirages and concocted illusions might just get shattered and the unreal reality – debunked. You have been warned. That is the power of City of God.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's in my Top 10 Favorite Movies,"Firstly, this is a violent movie, it's about gang war, if you don't like or can't stand films like Tarantino's don't waste your time here.If you like movies like that, City of God is a must-watch, especially if you are looking for the best Brazilian movies.The film doesn't just tell one story, but multiple stories that are interconnected, which are based on real stories that happened between the 60s and 80s in Cidade de Deus (City of God), a real favela in Rio de Janeiro.The acting is pretty realistic and the cinematography is very well done, a true masterpiece!If you like this crime genre I also recommend watching Elite Squad, another Brazilian classic that you'll probably like it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A great movie with well-written characters and powerful scenes of violence,"City of God is a very violent, moving, and heartbreaking movie about gangs in the slums of Rio De Janeiro.This movie details how crime affects the people who live in the slums of Rio De Janeiro. Rocket has witnessed violence by both gangs and he wants out of it but he finds that he can't escape.This movie does a great job with making itself look violent. I think that the main reason why this movie is so hard to watch is because most of the violence is happening to kids. It can be hard to watch so many kids brutally die off so young in their lives. Slumdog Millionaire did this too but I think that this movie did it better because it displayed violence more brutally with greater buildup involved.The different backstories are all entertaining. They are violent, well-written, heartbreaking, and even a bit funny every now and then. They show us how all the tales are all connected to each other. This movie is non-linear because of that.Nowadays, it's hard to find a good child actor but many of the actors in this movie carried the movie with expertise. Most of them were unknown too which made their acting performances even more unexpectedly good.This movie gives nods to Quentin Tarantino by featuring techniques such as time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts. It drew inspiration from Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas but this is original in its own way. It has its own techniques which it featured throughout the film.In conclusion, this is a very well-done film. It's violent and it also has great characters and backstories. This isn't for people who are sensitive but it will appeal to you if you like violence in movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not perfect but certainly close enough!,"For me this was not a perfect movie but it still was a very good one!For some reason this movie really gave me a sort of ""Goodfellas"" type of vibe. Both movies are of course crime movies and both movies pretty much chronicle the life of a young, wannabe(es) gangster(s). I'm not saying that movies are also the same in style and story though, since this really isn't the case. ""Cidade de Deus"" is an original movie on its own and is taking its own approach on the genre.It's a movie that on the one hand is showing how cool the life of a gangster is, while at the same time its throwing in some pretty heavy and dramatic stuff as well. Because of its sort of lighthearted approach, the more heavy scenes make an all the more greater impact. I think this is why the movie and all of emotions and drama work out so well.The movie also really doesn't picks sides or condemns anyone. It just shows things how they are and how much more easy it is to make a living as a criminal, as opposed to by going to school and try to make an honest living, in the Brazilian suburbs. It's also not trying to look for any answers or solutions, it's simply showing the craziness and hopelessness of the whole situations as it was and still mostly is at some places, not only in Brazil of course.It's a pretty raw and straightforward movie, mostly with its violence, starring also mostly young non-professionals in it, which adds to its overall realism. Also the story feels like just a couple of random pages out of the lives of some Brazilian youngsters, each trying to make it in their own way. But this at the same time is also a bit of a complaint I have about this movie. I would had preferred some more focus at times and that the movie featured a better- or at least more clear, main plot line in it. It now feels a bit like a fragmentary movie instead, also because it's following multiple different characters at the same time. Perhaps one main character, which the movie could focus solely on, would had been a better choice.But obviously it didn't bothered me all that much, since I still really 'liked' watching this film. This was also really thanks to the way it got directed. It has a great style to it, which is often fast and adds both to the craziness and realism of the movie at times. It besides also makes the movie unique and 'pleasant' to watch, since it's also giving the movie a lot of pace.So while not perfect, it still is a really great and quite effective movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of God,"Fernando Meirelles' City of God (2002), is a remarkable representation of the slums in Rio de Janeiro during the 1960s through the 1970s. This film walks you through the life of Rocket, an aspiring photographer, who lives in the City of God and faces danger every day of his life. Throughout this film, Rocket tells the stories of the many different people who lived in the City of God and their journey which lead to their ultimate death or survival. This film captures the violence occurring not only through the presentation of deaths caught on camera, but by the fearful screaming, crying, and begging of lives. Where hearing the loud and painful sounds of guns being fired off and seeing bloody, mutilated bodies lying on the street is just another ordinary day. The setting of this film and the mise-en-scene allows the viewer to understand the struggles that the townsman live through, the rundown town, and the fight to stay alive. This film starts with the ending by utilizing a freeze frame then flashes back to how it all began leading up to the current situation.The film utilizes dolly shots, tilts, and panoramic shots in order to capture the hoodlum's journey during situations which they are attacking or escaping and allows the viewer the opportunity to visualize what the city looks like and the conditions which they are imprisoned within.As this film progresses the cycle never ends. As young kids grow up in the City of God, they learn that in order to survive and potentially get out of the slums, criminal behavior is their only saving grace. Selling drugs, causing hold ups in local businesses, and killing rival gang members and innocent people. But who can you trust? Can you trust the police? Can you trust your closest friends? Can you even trust your family? This film portrays that even though the people around you may seem harmless, the only person you can count on is yourself. But do you really know yourself and your capabilities? What will tomorrow bring? Will you even live to see tomorrow?",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Yes, the music and soundtrack are not secondary but help drive the film in its relentless pace. Yes, the ensemble cast, many of whom are amateurs from the favelas where the film is set, bring each character to life with compelling definition.Yes, the film exemplifies the classic three-act structure with hook, plot points, Shakespearian-style midpoint, climax and denouement.

PERFECT FILM,"City of God or much more known as Cidade de Deus in Portuguese, have often featured on most people's best films of all time list. So as per usual me being myself, I was curious to see why the film is so popular.The film is an adaptation of the book with the same title, inspired by the true events around author Paulo Lins. Basically, it tells the story of a child growing up in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.Interestingly, the film is lined up with child actors who mostly have no acting experience beforehand. If I had to sum up this movie briefly for people who haven't seen it, it's like Guy Ritchie's earlier films, only with a younger average age between the actors.Why did I say that? Well, the film is littered with tons of colourful characters, and the storyline is presented in a more cheerful and upbeat tone, when in reality it probably should be the other way around: more grim and sombre. Meanwhile the gangster theme used is a lot closer to Scorsese's and Francis Ford Coppola's gangster films.The film is edited in a very interesting way. The juxtaposition of the main character Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) who is in the middle of all these gangs makes the storyline organically connected and interwoven.The pacing of this film also moves quite fast, so you won't feel that the film is too long (even if the duration of the film is over 2 hours). So, I think it can be watched by anyone. In addition, the arrangement of the film score is also good.Writing very mature arcs in young characters is perhaps the most forefront specialty that the film represents, when compared with other films on the market. These characters have to grow up faster than they should, because too late in doing so will only benefit others around them except themselves.Overall, the film for me is almost as perfect as it can be without any obvious flaws. It's a coming of age film that teaches us a lot about life and trust, that should be watched by a young audience, even though it is not appropriate and the context may probably be misunderstood by them if it is only examined literally but not thoroughly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Rocket, has a story to tell and glorious one at that, almost everyone in the film gets their own mini-biography with different main characters being woven in and out each others stories.Obviously this isn't a lighted hearted or jolly 130 minutes, it's cruel, intense and doesn't let the minute details of the plot become insignificant - as the end proves.

"I smoke, I snort. I've killed and robbed. I'm a man.","Films about violence there are aplenty. Many of them are purely fictional and are glamorized bloodbaths made for special audiences. Necessary are only a few. For your consideration: Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles' ""Cidade de Deus"" dealing with the eponymous ""City of God"". Initially the name of a housing project created by the Brazilian government in the 1960s, the result was abandoned by the authorities after its creation and turned out to be anything but what its name suggests. Taken over by drug lords crime is the way to get by in these favelas. Killings are everyday business, and they happen on the side of the police, on the side of the drug dealers, or among the people in the slums themselves by exchanging their arguments with weapons. Since its creation, children growing up in these areas have learned to be part of the violence - they are on the receiving end and they practice it without questioning. They live to survive.Meirelles's film is basically a documentary cloaked as film, based on Paulo Lins' real life accounts of what he witnessed himself, shot with actors who were picked from the slums. Unashamedly it covers full 20 years and shows all facets of violence that advance the spiral of death and destruction in the favelas. Meirelles uses state of the art cinematography combined with intentionally changing directorial styles in order to follow the various stages of despair and hopelessness. From the days of petty delinquents starting out where anything goes to gangs who commit mass murders, but are inevitably trapped in their doomed existence, Meirelles portrays the vicious circle with brutal honesty. ""City of God"" is best appreciated in conjunction with the documentary ""News from a Personal War"" (Lund/Salles) on the subject showing 10 year olds carrying AK-47s and police men who admit that they work in a war zone.

A gut-wrenching look at Brazilian street crime,"City of God shows the evolution (and de-evolution) of Brazilian favelas from the sixties to the eighties. It follows Rocket's turbulent life, and Ze's descent, as well as showing a few other characters and places stories.A big part of City of God's success is it's style and atmosphere. Actors pulled from the streets, Portuguese dialogue and nearly- on- location filming make City of God a sickening look at urban violence.The story is incredible. Starting with the main character's older brother's shenanigans in the 60's, we see life around Rocket change with the times. While America thought of Vietnam, Brazil thought of partying and drugs. It's interesting to see a different perspective of the world, and that's certainly a reason this film is so high on the 250. If this was the same film, but about LA gangs, it probably wouldn't be so high.Technically, the film is great. Swooshing camera-work looks awesome, and the entire apartment scene is amazing. The cinematography of the opening scene is really something.City of God is a great foreign film that should be seen for its exposition of slum life. It's well paced, perfectly told, and has a satisfying ending. And it's true. 8.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Contain my opinion about the movie.,"In Brazil in the 1960's there was a place called the City of God. In the movie the Trio robs motels and gas trucks for something to do and a quick way to make some cash. Younger kids watch them because they want to be apart of the Trio but the older kids wouldn't let them. Lil Ze went in and killed everybody in there thus getting his taste of the bad seed. In the 1970's, Lil Ze has grown up and took over his former comrades and now he owns the city. He causes violence and fear as he wipes out rival gangs without mercy. His best friend Bene is the only one to keep him on the good side of sanity. Rocket has grown up in the same settings but has taking a different route. His goal in life and dream is to take pictures and become a big photographer. He seems to always be in the wrong place at the wrong time though. Well in the 1980 there is still the continuing battle that is control and affecting the City of God. From my study in Latin American History, Brazil is the largest country in Latin America. It was one of the Portugal colonies sugar was one of the most important crops in the country. This country was declared independent from Portugal in 1822. ""Brazil's problems -- poverty, crime, environmental recklessness -- can seem larger than life, too. Although it is one of the industrial powerhouses of South America, Brazil has trouble feeding its entire people. And deforestation of the Amazon basin proceeds at an ominous rate. But in fits and starts, the country is taking on some of its seemingly insoluble problems. Most noticeably, improvement is being made in the dangerous crime situation in Rio."" This is the modern day report from a well know International travel agency about some of Brazil's problem's within the country. This movie in my opinion was rather accurate and ties in directly into the history of modern times in Brazil. It gives a real life visual to the actually life of some Brazilian natives. In contrast gives almost an unrealistic feeling about the whole city and everyday life of Brazil so with these to combine you get a distinct feeling of curiosity and wonder from the film. In my opinion if there would have been a brief introduction about the times in a narrative tone it would have help with the suspense of the movie? The movie was enjoyable to watch on the fact that the plot was good and the character where reliable and the quantity of scenes throughout the movie. Yes good for entertainment and great for education and addressee to the problems in Brazil. I rate this Movie 8 and half star on a (1-10) scale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I am just not boring at all when watch this movie. So good Brazilian movie. I think it is the best Brazilian movie I've ever watched, or ever made.The very first thing I love is the action cinematography and the camera. They used ""vibrant-recording"" or maybe I should call it ""pro-amateur- recording"". I call it because almost all cameraman used to record with ""vibrant-recording"". It is not good for such a film like drama. But, what I watched was different. This vibrant makes another sense of film. A chaos but deep sense. It is how they try to make the movie problem become more problematic.

Movie that criticize the government, the police department, and also a deep social problem in every side in the country.It is critical and irony, but in the same time, it is fantastic, very dramatic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of God... Why didn't I watch this thing sooner?,"City of God has been considered by many critics and viewers to be one of the absolute best movies to come from the 2000s; now I see and completely understand why people love this film, and why it's a time capsule that is still relevant and important for today's world; at least for Brazil.I saw this film on Netflix and I finally sat down and watched it all the way through. I'd seen bits and pieces in film school back in 2013, but I never got around to actually seeing the thing completely. Now that I have, I'm incredibly happy that I've seen such a complete, unflinchingly brutal crime film that tells a story that's just right; not over-stuffed, not under-developed, but just right.The film shows the many-sided face of Brazilian life in the 1960s, the 70s and 80s. Everyone in this film has got a story and within the span of its 2-hour-and-9-minute running time, and the arcs, even for some of the supporting characters introduced in the middle of the action, are never wasted.City of God, is a film from God. Please do yourself a favor and watch it. It's right up any crime film lover's alley.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Recommending ""City of God"" to friends","I just thought the movie was very good. It held my attention from beginning to end. I also enjoy movies that make me care about the characters and this one made me care about Rocket, Benny, Carrot and even Lil' Fe (I could not help but feel his pain at Benny's farewell party). I will recommend this movie to several friends who are so-called ""movie buffs"". If you are not a fan of subtitled movies, this is not for you. I feel that if this movie was watched dubbed, it would take away some of the powerful drama that it has. I did not give it a ten because I am not a fan of slow-mo, speed up type of filming, but even that did not take away from the grittiness of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Great acting, story, and cinematography.","Based on a true favela (slum) named 'City of God' in Rio, the film does a great job at creating a realistic looking depiction of the life there. A little trivia: The location in which they filmed at was a neighbouring favela, as the actual favela was too dangerous to film in. Another trivia: Filmmakers actually recruited children from the favela to produce an authentic feel for the movie. Based on this fact, it is deeply disconcerting that these children are able to act out violet scenes so well, as if they already possessed the persona of their characters. The acting overall is very realistic, and the whole cast does a fantastic job, probably because they have been exposed to this reality all their life.The story was set in a unique way, with many flashbacks and initial introductions. That slightly annoyed me, when they would introduce a new character and then say that it wasn't time for his story yet. But it was interesting to have so many characters in the film, as it was used in a way to cover more aspects of the favelas. The introduction of so many characters and how they changed could also be a way to generalize these characters, as a way of saying that these characters can be found in any slum (Felicia Chan, and Valentina Vitali). However because Rocket is the narrator, it does come into question how he gains knowledge of the events that unfold to these characters when he isn't present.The cinematography and editing does well to complement the authenticity of the film. With its fast pace and well planned shots, the film right from the beginning establishes the action, fear and danger of what is to come. The explicit brutality of violence is not hidden and for this film and what they wanted to depict, it is probably necessary. However, I am not sure if is accurate in its representation of violence and the drug circle as it does seem excessive.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Looks like a funeral procession.,"In Paris,France after having met Katia Lund in 2006,it was difficult for me to fathom that this soft spoken charming lady has made a very violent film depicting the rise of violence in Brazilian slums.She told the audience that it is quite normal for Brazilians to live with violence as they have adjusted themselves to it.This is a very serious statement which in some way reflects the honesty on the part of Brazilian filmmakers. They are showing what is happening in their society and by doing so there are being truthful.The violence of City of God is realistic and no makeup has been done to it.The three key elements of the film: melodrama,violence and music compliment each other well.This film also has a procession like quality to it.It is as if the audience is watching some sort of procession going on and willy-nilly,they also decide to be a part of the crowd.On watching this film,I had the impression of a fun activity happening before me. May be others will experience that too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Pristine excellence,"Violence and brutality abound in this passionate story of a city and its crime wave. City of God tells the story of this city, the City of God, which sits just a few miles away from Rio de Janero, but it's no paradise. It's a dangerous and crime ridden world where gangs run the streets and guns and drugs are the things which give a man power and control over everyone else. We learn the story of this city from the eyes of Rocket, a quiet young man with hopes of being a journalist one day, assuming he can survive that long in such dangerous conditions. Through crafty editing, engrossing cinematography, and a plethora of disturbingly real performances we witness a most unsettling yet uniquely fascinating story unfold in City of God.This is one of those films that has one word to describe it. That word is memorable. The film is absolutely memorable above everything else. It has its own incredibly unique style and it tells a story of a world unlike anything the common man lives in. The atrocities committed in this film by adults and children alike are a lot to bare and a lot to take in, especially knowing that this is a true story. The world operates differently in little places like this, and City of God gives us such an unabashed and unrelenting look at just what a brutally different world this is.Everything about this film is some kind of excellent. It's well directed, well written, and well acted. The film comes together to be a truly engaging story with an unforgettable stylistic way of telling that story, one that works extremely well in its own special way. The story is told in a linear fashion while also jumping back in time every once in a while to catch us up on the vast modern history of this city. The city itself becomes a character, morphing and changing through the years, adapting cultural phenomenas here and there while still retaining its violent upbringing. A sort of mythos and lore is built around the city, and this is a tell all tale about it.All in all I was just incredibly impressed with City of God. It's a film of very pristine quality, never missing a beat amidst all its chaos and the vast amount of characters that are all part of the story. It's a story about a part of society many of us don't know about, and the film really boils down to just that. There isn't much hidden metaphor within the film or anything particularly special to look for. It's just for the purpose of telling an immaculate and moving story about a city and it's inhabitants. And that story makes this film a fantastic watch from start to finish and it leaves you with unforgettable memories about what some people are capable of. It really is a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best of Brazil,"The movie is just great! From the plot, the characters and the social context, everything is spotless. The story is well-defined. The director knows his stuff. One hand washes the other. Bart are you awake? YES! Take out the trash! Maradona Starts the left lane, and avoids an English ... But instead simply start your rabbit head Pepito! Hey how you doing'? good rate pa 'enjoy. The house is in order. Lets get it started. See you later alligators! On the bonus DVD, it is revealed that the only professional actor with years of filming experience was Matheus Nachtergaele, who played the supporting role of Carrot.[1] Most of the remaining cast were from real- life navels, and in some cases, even the real-life City of God Havel itself. According to Meirelles, amateur actors were used for two reasons: the lack of available professional black actors, and the desire for authenticity. Meirelles explained: ""Today I can open a casting call and have 500 black actors, but just ten years ago this possibility did not exist. In Brazil there were three or four young black actors and at the same time I felt that actors from the middle class could not make the film. I needed authenticity."" Beginning about 2000, about a hundred children and young people were hand-picked and placed into an ""actors' workshop"" for several months. In contrast to more traditional methods (e.g. studying theater and rehearsing), it focused on simulating authentic street war scenes, such as a hold-up, a scuffle, a shoot-out etc. A lot came from improvisation, as it was thought better to create an authentic, gritty atmosphere. This way, the inexperienced cast soon learned to move and act naturally.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
