"worthy of its subject matter, truthful","Whenever I see so much ""Oscar worthy"" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.But they're right for once.Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don't rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clich√©d bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own ""character"", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have never been a fan of musicals, or even musical performances in a film. They generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. I never felt that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.This film far exceeded my expectations and afforded me the first trip home from a theater with a true feeling of satisfaction in a very, very long time. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great film,"Considering the formula junk coming out of Hollywood these days, I was blown away by how good this movie was. The direction was perfect. Using close ups to get us in under the skin of Johnny Cash. And since it was a period piece, he could have bored us with lots of cgi of Memphis and L.A. to take us back in time. Instead he used the actors and the music to take us there. Biopics naturally have a formula to them, but the director and screenwriter did not take us down the track of overly sentimental scenes. These were real and done with a bit of well placed humor. Just like real life. Afterall you still have to follow the real lives of Johnny and June. You can't make it up, just to be original! The movie was also a movie you can take most of the family to. No nudity and sex to SHOW how in love they are, just real dialog...it's nice to hear REAL dialog and not just another chase scene, or four letter word. Yes, some movies need that to tell the story, this one doesn't. This movie goes onto my short list of great biopics, with ""Ray"". Not much else comes close to Ray or Walk the Line. The true test of any biopics is: can you still understand the plot even if you never heard of the people the movie is about. This movie is a great love story even if you never heard of Johnny and June Cash. Oscars all around I say! Plus I loved the Rockabilly music through out the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
And The Oscar Goes To......,"Wow, what a film. I had been waiting to see this movie since I read that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were cast in the lead roles. I was not sure what to expect when I heard they were going to do their own singing, but was I ever impressed. Their performances in this movie were brilliant, and I had chills down my spine. It was truly amazing how much Phoenix sounded like Johnny Cash-this was a role he was born to play, and he was mesmerizing. Totally sizzling. Witherspoon was positively radiant as June Carter, and talk about chemistry between the two actors. Talk about lightning striking! I only hope they are rewarded for their efforts come Oscar time. This was a truly amazing movie, filled with great music, a top-notch supporting cast and a terrific script which was wonderfully directed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
the best film of 2005,"I've long thought that James Mangold was one of the most underrated American directors; while other acclaimed auteurs like Wes Anderson and David Gordon Green have made names for themselves by essentially repeating themselves with each film, Mangold has attracted considerably less attention for actually having the gall to show some range. Like the great directors of the Hollywood studio system, Mangold shows visual and narrative skill across a wide array of genres: character-driven crime (COPLAND); horror (IDENTITY); issue-oriented drama (GIRL INTERRUPTED), etc. What each of these films shares in common is a stunningly elegant and expressive visual style, an attention to character reminiscent of Renoir, and an economy of storytelling that would make Howard Hawks envious.Now Mangold has delivered his masterpiece, and it's the best studio release I've seen so far this year. WALK THE LINE, Mangold's story of the relationship between Johnny Cash and June Carter, is deliriously romantic, exhiliratingly entertaining (as a musical it invites and earns comparison with the best of Vincente Minelli), and profoundly moving--all set to a spectacular soundtrack. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are both brilliant as Cash and Carter, but not only in the ways you would expect. Their most impressive achievement is to convincingly portray two people falling in love in a manner that's sincere and sweet but never cheaply sentimental. This is the most unabashedly romantic American movie since THE NOTEBOOK, but it's totally authentic and lacking in melodrama; the subtlety with which Mangold and his performers delineate the one step forward, two steps back nature of Cash and Carter's love affair is staggering. Phoenix is particularly brilliant, not only in the romantic scenes but in moments in which Cash discusses his brother's early death; in these scenes the major tragedies of both the character and the performer's lives merge in a way that is heartbreakingly real. And the movie gets across the intoxicating nature of creative collaboration between two people in love better than any film I've ever seen--perhaps no coincidence given that Mangold and his closest collaborator, producer Cathy Konrad, are married. I could (and will) go on about this movie for hours, but let's just say that it's the movie to beat for the rest of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Excellent,"Walk the Line is a great movie. When you watch it, you feel as though you are watching Johny Cash in person. Juaqin Pheonix is amazing as Cash, a man with so many regrets and self doubts. Reese Witherspoon gives an Oscar performance as the love of his life June Carter. The film is long, but worth every minute. But what is great is that T Bone Burnett chose the right songs to play. When I saw it today people in the theater were singing along with the movie. And what is great, is that Pheonix and Witherspoon sand the songs themselves. This movie should win several Oscars this year. Go see it. It is an amazing film, and it perfectly protrays an amazing man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Just saw W.T.L.,"I absolutely loved it. More my dad's music than mine (I was born in 1960-am a rock-n-roller), but tapped my feet the whole way thru. It is funny, I grew up with certain songs of Johnny Cash, and heard about the legend of the ""man in black"" for as long as I remember, but this movie adds a whole new dimension to the man, his music. I think it's great maybe a whole new generation might come to enjoy his contributions too.J.Phoenix and R. Witherspoon were phenomenal and made this film a joy to watch. I have not enjoyed any movie so much in a long time. Judging by the applause and the grins on the movie goers faces on the way out-I was not alone in my whole-hearted enthusiasm for the movie.Gonna order me a J.Cash CD!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great performances make this worth checking out,"I don't know about ""Mangold the Auteur"", and might need a bit more proof that this is really a director worth paying attention to, but this is a pretty watchable film. I found the story and film-making a bit predictable, like the usual bio-pic formula that you might expect if you've seen, say, coal miner's daughter, or any other bio-pic of someone you love. What makes this movie stand out is the two lead performances. Reese is unbelievably convincing as June Carter Cash. She almost disappears into the role. And her singing! Who knew???And Joaquin! We've been waiting for him to deliver a really spectacular performance for some time, and this is finally it. I, for one, resisted the idea that ANYONE could portray the man in black, but he does a pretty fine job. Not just an impersonation, but actually a performance worth watching. Really fine.Watch for the Jackson duet. Really awesome.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Joaquin Phoenix is brutally hot as Johnny Cash!!,"Forget North Country, Walk the Line directed by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) and written by Mangold and Gill Dennis is the better 2005 Oscar contender.This romantic tragedy, which is based on the autobiographies of Johnny Cash The Man in Black and Cash: the Autobiography was actually written and perfected alongside the famous duo Cash and June Carter Cash before their deaths in 2003.The movie begins with a young, music obsessed ""J.R."" Cash growing up in a poor cotton farming family in Arkansas. Shortly afterwards, a family tragedy changes his life forever.Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) leaves for the air force, where he is stationed in Germany, buys an old guitar and proceeds to write one of the most recorded songs in history along with many others.Upon returning, Cash's obsession leads him to a recording studio and into the spotlight with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) as well as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and the comical Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne.) The next emotional hour and 45 minutes is filled with great music, drug dependency, infidelity, and most of all love.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who sang every song themselves, completely shined in this movie. There are no better actors that could have filled the shoes of the Carter-Cash duo. Phoenix and Witherspoon had such great chemistry, by the end of the movie you actually think they might really be in love.However, if you tend to get restless in longer movies, the running time of 136 minutes can start to seem a little long towards the end, but it's well worth it.Overall Walk the Line receives nine out of ten stars. The movie did an excellent job portraying the life of the ""man in black,"" his soul mate and their rocky path on the way to love. If Phoenix and Witherspoon are not nominated for their amazing voices and chilling performances, it will be a great disappointment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A good biopic of the early year of Johnny Cash,"""Walk the Line"" is a good biopic of the early years in the life of singer, songwriter, musician and actor Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phoenix does a good job playing Cash as he breaks into music. The talented Cash, who became much more known as a quiet, withdrawn man for most of his performing life, had some raucous early years. The film covers his first marriage, road trips while struggling to make a name for himself, and his drug use.This also was the time when he met and befriended June Carter who would later become his wife. The film ends before the major part of his career with Carter - their last 35 years together. Reese Witherspoon gives a superb portrayal of Carter. She won the only Academy Award of five nominations for the film. But the movie took the top three Golden Globe honors for the year - best picture, best actress and best actor. Witherspoon also won the BAFTA award for best actress. Ginnifer Goodwin also gives a superb performance as Cash's first wife, Vivian.While Cash was known mostly as a country musician, he had a versatile portfolio of songs and performances. He played and sang blues, rock and roll, gospel and folk music. He is in three music halls of fame - Country, Gospel, and Rock and Roll. He sold more than 90 million records in his lifetime.As so many other musical biopics, ""Walk the Line"" covers mostly the years up until the person makes it big. This is one when I would have enjoyed another 20 minutes or so to see performances of some of the top songs that Cash wrote and played. Cash and Carter died within four months of each other in 2003. He was 71 and she was 73.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Great Performances, Tedious Story...","Some truly great acting, especially from Joaquin Phoenix but it's a tedious and repetitive account of a pill popping alcoholic with serious psychological issues. If you're a fan of the man and his music it may mean a bit more but I just got fed up of watching the same sub-plot continually repeating carousel - hard work, difficult to like and challenging, just like the protagonist.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Performances,"At one level, this is the same old thing: success, booze, redemption, comeback. Nothing new at all here and the history changed to fit the formula.At another level ¬ó the one most moviegoers will see ¬ó is a concert with background intended to make the concert richer. If you had ever seen John and June perform, you will know that this movie version is a whole lot better. And you may also admit that the reason you went to see them wasn't because of their music, but because of the whole story of them and what they symbolized -- and how that colored the music.In other words, their lives were deliberately part of the show. They made it so, even punching up John's ex-con status and other tough guy attributes. The whole Carter family developed this as a marketing strategy long before John appeared, though their lives were artificially made in the mold of wholesome, white Baptists.So, if you follow these things, what we have here is a nice construction: Two stage performers who make their lives part of their performance, portrayed in another performance (the movie) that features the reverse: lives illustrated through stage performances. Managing all those layers as they have makes this mildly interesting.And the surprise of Reese is something too, though it makes sense if you know the type that southern women played as roles in those days.What's missing is all the interesting stuff. John's obsession with the devil, the theories of his brother being murdered or committing suicide, the long-term weaving of paths with Bob Dylan ¬ó holy and otherwise. The debauchery. The deliberate manipulation of religion in the 70s as part of the public relations of his comeback. His phenomenal loss of weight. The rivalry among his touring mates. Deep, deep, rivalry.Now wouldn't all that real stuff have made a better movie than the formula script we have here?As with all big movies these days, you have the movie proper and you have the beginning sequence. Studios (meaning financiers) take these very seriously and bring in a separate creative team, usually uncredited. This opening is far, far better than the movie itself. It has a whole different feel, obviously a different director and cinematographer. Obviously edited by a different crew.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Much Ado Over Not Very Much,"Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts. Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold? Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message). Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice. And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes, drunken bouts, weaning off drugs, spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic. Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given, does the result merit Oscar attention? That is up to the voters. It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy. But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies. Just not that impressed. Grady Harp",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Toe-tappingly good fun.,"Before watching this film, I had my doubts. Johnny Cash is one of my favourite country singers, nay, singers of all time, and I was unsure as whether, as with other mediocre biopics, namely the flashy Ray, could do him enough justice. As it turned out, Johnny gets the film he deserves, and, what's more, Walk the Line got me extremely interested in the work of his wife, June Carter Cash.Covering 20 years of his life, including Cash's rise into fame and delve into near-self-destruction, James Mangold concentrates on the key things in his life ¬ñ his music, the drugs, and his all-consuming, untameable love for the very special June Carter Cash. It is as a romance that Walk the Line truly shines. In real life, Johnny and June didn't get together until 20 years since their first meeting, and that they could wait that long for each other, is quite poignant.Holding the film together are the Oscar-nominated and Oscar-winning figures of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and their chemistry pretty much carries the film. When they're together, they both dazzle, gelling perfectly, whether it's a bout of verbal jesting, they're doing a duet, or just chatting. Phoenix captures the tortured soul of Cash eloquently in one of his finest performances, and one that exudes that dangerous yet enthralling edge of danger present in Cash. His singing voice resembles that of Cash's, yet he never resorts to downright imitation, which only adds to the viewing pleasure.But the shining star of the film is Reese Witherspoon, as June Carter Cash. She plays the singer-songwriter-country music star that grabbed the attentions of Johnny Cash, but proved a hard win, forcing him to quit his narcotic dependence and violent self-destruction before she'd consider him. Although many have disliked Witherspoon's work her, I simply adore it. She makes June a truly memorable, Crouchesque, person. For the audience, she can be goofy and lovable, but alone, with Johnny, she displays a vulnerable side. Witherspoon here radiates a strong, feminist, yet effortlessly lovable vibe, and every scene she appears in, she steals.The look and feel of Johnny's time are captured well in the set design and T-Bone Burnett guitar-led score, and the costumes are nothing short of sublime. The dressing of Cash is inspired, but it is June's clothes ¬ñ floral print, pink, domestic, or snazzy, that, again, steal the show. Each of Reese's costumes captures the mood of her characters.There's also great fun to be had in the musical numbers. Ring of Fire and Jukebox Blues allow the audience to get their toes tapping, but my favourite number is the performance of Jackson, where their unmatched chemistry is showcased in one of my favourite songs of all-time. Like the film, this song is entertaining, sweet, and more intelligent than frequently given credit for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Magical performance by Reese Witherspoon,"""Walk the Line"" is without question the zenith of Reese Witherspoon's acting career thus far. Joaquin Phoenix IS Johnny Cash in this biopic, but Reese as June Carter Cash sets this film on fire. It is one thing to portray a person's life, with feeling and emotion, something which Joaquin pulls off effortlessly. However, it is quite another to make a portrayal bigger than life, and Reese makes June Carter Cash the central character of this film.To say that Reese steals the show is an understatement. Reese becomes a lightning rod for Joaquin's character, in a way that is actually quite scary. After all, Reese is from Nashville, and her Southern affect is flawless and absolutely winning. Suffice it to say that Reese will thankfully be present when the Academy Awards are presented next year. She might want to get a few words ready.This movie will not be everyone's favorite flick, if for no other reason than that it is a biopic of flawed, Southern characters. However, perhaps the very flaws that imbue these characters with vitality and realism can establish the acting of Joaquin and Reese with an almost spiritual meaning, as they live these real people on screen. But in the final analysis, Reese Witherspoon will become the greatest contemporary screen actor upon release of this film. See for yourself. You read it here first.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Johnny would be proud.,"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.I've seen a lot of singer biopics: all the way from the Buddy Holly Story to Coal Miner's Daughter. This one can't quite make it to Coal Miner, but it's light years ahead of Buddy. I read a review today that said that Joaquin was too short and Reese was too pretty to play Johnny and June. The reviewer was right, but what the hell does that have to do with great acting. They got it right and this old hillbilly cried, that's right--cried--at every historical landmark they hit.

Phoenix Mesmerizing in a Raw Portrait of Masculine Power and Vulnerability,"""Walk the Line"" is a good movie, but what makes it well worth going out of your way for, even if you are not a country music or Johnny Cash fan, is Joaquin Phoenix's raw, mesmerizing performance of masculine power and vulnerability. Phoenix deserved the Academy Award for this performance, and more.Early in the film, music producer Sam Phillips, in a wonderful speech encapsulating the power of pop music, demands a great performance out of the then unknown ""J. R. Cash."" Cash, who has not yet sung professionally, and who could have crumpled after Phillips' challenge, slowly emerges out of himself, like a snake emerging out of its skin. Phoenix communicates both the power and the risk of this performance. You heart breaks for what he's going through, and you get goosebumps for what he's about to become. That scene is worth the price of admission.But there's more: success, sex with groupies, drugs, onstage triumphs and embarrassments, near death, and resurrection. Phoenix just knocks every scene right out of the park.Phoenix is unforgettable as a man in love. I've never seen an actor communicate ""in love with"" a woman as profoundly as Phoenix does here.As for the singing -- Phoenix does his own singing. His voice is close enough to Cash's to work, but it's more than that. It's also arresting and beautiful and worth listening to on its own.There are some weaker performances / underwritten parts in ""Walk the Line."" Perhaps the filmmakers did this in order to make Cash, a drug addict and adulterer, more sympathetic to the audience. This was a mistake. Cash's story is compelling enough; we could handle placing Cash in a world populated by real people rather than cardboard cutouts.""Walk the Line""'s Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison are not as hyper and unique onstage as they were in real life. Lewis, onstage, was about five times more electrified than he is depicted here. ""Walk the Line""'s Elvis Presley is about junk food, trash talk, and drugs. The real Elvis was about those things, too, but he was also something more; that's not even hinted at, here.The worst example of making others look like less so Cash would look like more is the film's portrayal of Vivian Cash, Johnny's first wife. She's just an unbearable horror show of a woman: unsupportive, grasping, snappish. She's not given one sympathetic moment. Vivian and Johnny's daughters have protested that Vivian was not well served by the movie. And Cash's mother is played by an actress who is roughly the same age as Phoenix, and that shows.Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for her depiction of June Carter Cash. She is good. The script didn't make as clear her role as Cash's savior as Cash's own comments have.I'm not a huge fan of country music, so I delayed seeing this movie. When I finally saw it what made it worth it, to me, was Phoenix's performance. He's just riveting, in every scene, and well worth seeing this movie for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Not A Personal Favorite, But Definitely Iconic","I always heard of Johnny Cash growing up and I've listened to a couple of his songs before, but I have never really known much about him. Watching this movie, I was able to learn more about him and who he was. I'm not sure why, but this movie is not really my favorite. It was definitely interesting, but it's just not my type of movie. Aside from that, the movie was very well made and had great acting. A great scene from this movie was when June Carter and her family are staying at John's house trying to help him recover from his addiction to drugs and they chase his drug dealer off his property with their rifles.
The plot of this movie is just the timeline of Johnny Cash's life and all that he went through. It starts out when he was a little boy and continues on to when he becomes really famous.
Before I watched this movie, I didn't really know a lot about this time period, or about Johnny Cash and his life. The history part of the movie was interesting to me, because I was able to learn a little more about the time period, but also learn the history of Cash. I have seen a few civil rights movies that were also set around this time period (50's to 60's). There wasn't really anything in this movie that made me question its accuracy, but I didn't know a lot about Johnny Cash before. This movie, even though it was set in the 50's and 60's reminds me of some famous people now who do drugs like Cash did. I hear a lot about certain movie stars who overdose.
The director of this movie is James Mangold. I've only seen one other movie by him, Kate and Leopold. The two main actors in this movie are Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon, who plays June Carter. I have seen Reese Witherspoon in another movie, but I have never seen Joaquin Phoenix in any movies besides this one. They are both great actors. My favorite scene in this movie is the first scene where Johnny Cash performs after he makes his first record. The atmosphere of the scene was really cool and really set the mood for a concert.
This movie was very well made and had great acting. I liked that it had the nitty gritty of Cash's life as well as the good things; that made it more realistic. It's not a movie that I would watch on my free time because it is not a personal favorite. I would recommend it to others who like Johnny Cash or that type of music, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Excellent biopic of a great artist,"Johnny Cash has quite a few things in common with the actor who plays him in this movie.

OK Biopic,"This movie seemed like a remake of ""Ray"" with a touch of ""The Doors."" It seemed to have elements of just about every biopic about a pop musician ever made, including: What's Love Got to Do With it, The Rose, Coal Miner's Daughter, Stardust, Almost Famous, That'll Be the Day and Velvet Goldmine.It starts with Cash's poor tough childhood on a farm and the tragic death of a brother only a year or two older. He doesn't get on with his Dad and later on his first wife doesn't understand him. Both are recurring causes of angst and friction. Cash has talent and success inevitably follows. Cash has a period where he does everything to excess, including drugs, drink and groupies. There are a lot of concerts with time spent on tour buses. He meets June Carter, falls in love and is eventually saved by the love of a good woman. The story was so predictable that I didn't really care about the characters.Reese Witherspoon's June Carter is sweet, perky, sensible and very likable. However, I didn't understand why she deserved an Oscar or why she would like the person portrayed by Joaqin Phoenix. Cash seemed confused and behaved like an irrational little boy lost. I saw Cash on TV in the late 1960s and he was smart, funny, confident and very much in control. Phoenix lacked the charisma and vocal chops the role demanded. Overall the movie was formulaic, and given the hype I was disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Just freakin' awful,"I am dumbfounded as to how this movie got so many rave reviews from people on this board; I can only suppose it has been swamped by studio supporters, since I see only toward the last pages are the real opinions coming out.This is about the worst biopic I've ever seen. Phoenix wasn't that bad, but he reminded me of Johnny Cash not at all. Not his looks, not his voice, not his mannerisms, just nothing. I can't say too much about Witherspoon, as I never saw June to make a comparison.So, the live performances, to which we were treated aplenty, were largely meaningless and, I'm sorry to say, there wasn't much in between them to take our minds off this fact. The story, such as it was, was full of threads that never went anywhere and it otherwise left us alternately either hanging or belaboured by the obvious. The editor must have been on the same pills Johnny was taking, because it made me feel nervous and irritable.This gives me cause to question the value of IMDb reviews as a whole, since I couldn't have previously imagined so many people being so totally wrong. I have many times relied on IMDb to get some idea about a film before I went to the trouble to actually see it. I prefer to believe my theory of the board being flooded by friends of the studio. In this case, I saw the movie first, before the reviews, else I would be in a proper state right now, out for blood.If I have to have an opinion, I would say this film is an insult to Johnny Cash and all his fans. That's all there is to it. If you haven't seen it yet, then take my advice and don't bother. 2 out of 10.freddyzdead at gmail dot com",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Excellent - review by Johnny Cash close friend and minister,"I was delighted when John Carter Cash, invited me to attend the premier showing of ""Walk The Line"".I hope that those who view this movie will see the spiritual connections between John, his family, and those with whom he choose to associate. I am privileged to have been one of those who John called a friend. And to the producers and directors: It would be a blessing if the story of Johnny and June Cash's remarkable lives is continued from the point at which ""Walk The Line"" ended.Johnny Cash and I were close personal friends for over twenty years. I loved him as a brother and miss him dearly. In the early 90's he asked me to call him every day¬Ö and I did so, as much as possible, for the many remaining years of our friendship. I would talk with him daily whether we were traveling the world, with me as the official 'Johnny Cash Show minister (or evangelist)', or while off the road and at home. We would talk about the things that most friends talk about, but always¬Ö always, about God, the Bible, a new or a favorite verse or passage, life's many challenges¬Ö and encourage one another in overcoming them.John was one of the brightest individuals I've ever met¬Ö and, at times, as the film shows, one of the most troubled. John was one of God's sheep. He was, as the movie shows, living proof that redemption knows no limits other than our own refusal to accept it. Just as evening wolves stalk sheep, so the wolves of darkness pursued John. Yet, somehow, I believe he knew that even though a sheep cannot triumph over a wolf¬Ö he can beat it every time by staying close to the shepherd¬Ö and showed up at the feet of God quite often.June Carter Cash was also a treasured friend. She graciously laid aside the opportunities of her own career and gifted talent to become John's life-long soul mate and a fiercely loyal devotee to keeping him happy, and making him 'walk the line'. Reese Witherspoon portrayed June accurately. June was also a faithful gatekeeper for John, and taught all of us (who were allowed through that 'gate') the grit and grace of friendship¬Ö once a friend¬Ö a friend always. The world will never be the same without June¬Ö and, likewise; Heaven will never be the same with her there.I deeply enjoyed this film. Overall, I felt that the story was credible and portrayed accurately.I commend Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon for delivering 'believability'. This was certainly a far from easy task, drawing deeply from their God-given talent, when you consider the extraordinary lives of the complex and unique individuals they portrayed.I was appreciative of the spiritual content that was gracefully present for it was such a vital part of their lives. Joaquin Phoenix's insightful handling of the life-long struggle that John endured regarding his brother Jack's disastrous death, renewed deep emotions within me. John and I each lost an older brother in tragic accidents when we were young. This gave me an even deeper sense of, and identification with the pain he suffered, but rarely talked about.There is much more that I could express about this significant film regarding the unique and remarkable lives portrayed in Walk The Line, and the treasured friendship and fellowship that God allowed John and I to share. If John could, I believe he would ask me to help others understand how he felt about God and how he tried to live his life. Therefore, please allow me to share a letter that he wrote to me in Australia.""Jack Shaw's ministry, in tandem with the Johnny Cash Show, may be a first in the entertainment business. The Idea came to June and me on a tour last summer. Jack has long been a close friend and prayer warrior for our group and family. Before each concert we form a prayer circle in the dressing room with our family and any other members of the group who wish to join in. Jack leads a five-minute service of scripture reading, sharing and prayer. The service is uplifting and has put a positive power-edge on our performances.Recently we took what I felt was a bold step, in that, toward the end of the concert I introduce Jack (who is positioned near the stage in the audience) and mention that he will be there after the concert to offer free counseling and advice on moral and spiritual matters. I tell them that he is a minister of the Gospel, and will talk to them about their personal problems, drug and alcohol addiction or simply about the Bible and what God has to say to them. As well as daily ministering to the needs of my eighteen-member group, many people have come down to talk to Jack after the concert every night.Lives are changed, souls are saved, spirits are lifted and light is brought into the darkness of many hearts.We are being led by inspiration, and I believe that God is guiding Jack in this great work he is now doing. The potential is unlimited and we feel Jack is just beginning in a great work. He gives us strength and peace through the Word and prayer. June and I feel supercharged, especially for the gospel part of our program. Jack's presence and his involvement in our work has given us an extra portion of joy and enthusiasm.Jack is a humble man, and it is obvious that he only wants to serve God. Believers and non-believers alike have come to know that and respect that. Jack Shaw Ministries has cut a new path and the fruit of the harvest from the seeds sown along the way will be bountiful.""

Walking The Line With Johnny (And Ray),"Watching this movie yesterday couldn't help but remind me, in a number of respects. to ""Ray,"" a film out a year earlier. Both were biographies of singers of a similar era, the main difference between the color of their skin, Ray being Ray Charles, of course, and this movie about Johnny Cash.Both singers (and films):1 - had a brother who died early on in their lives which affected them for years and years; 2 - were made to feel guilty about those deaths even though there was no reason for that guilt; 3 - had adulterous affairs as their singing careers began to take off; 4 - became addicted to drugs and beat that addiction; 5 - made bold decisions regarding their careers that went against prevailing thought but turned out to be the right decisions; 6 - movies featured outstanding music and slick photography; 7 - movies were fast-moving and interesting to view all the way through despite being over two hours long; 8 - featured wonderful acting performances.In Walk The Line, Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Cash, goes one up on Jamie Foxx, who played Charles, because Phoenix did his own singing....and he was very good. The same applies to Reese Witherspoon as ""June Carter."" Her singing talent surprised me. It makes the film all the more believable when you know the actors are actually singing.I am not familiar with Ginnifer Goodwin, who played Cash's first wife, but I think she gets unfairly ignored in the publicity of this film. Perhaps the biggest surprise was seeing Robert Patrick as Cash's father. Wasn't this the same young, trim villain in Terminator 2, which wasn't out that long ago? How can this be the same guy?!!I think this was the better of the two films, not just because of the realism but Charles seemed almost cold, no love in him, no commitment to any woman or his own kids, while Cash has a lot of more heart to him, even if it was misplaced at times.That seems to be the major theme of the WTL movie: the romance between Cash and Carter. Unfortunately, that's my only complaint about this film. This movie glamorizes this affair between Cash and Carter just a little too much, manipulating the audience to the point where we all want this couple to live happily ever after forgetting that Cash was married to another nice woman with two kids. Yeah, some of the ugly parts of adultery are shown but not to the degree the sweetness of this illicit romance is portrayed. The movie does not send a strong enough message that the right thing to do is for Cash to be a good father and husband in the first place and for Carter to stay away from him - period. The worst scene in the film might be Cash's two kids crying their eyes out watching their parents fight. Adultery always kills the kids more than anyone, which is one big reason I was sorry to see the Cash & Carter affair so romanticized.I'd have liked to have seen Cash's prison ministry detailed a little more since he was so faithful in that area, and his Christian testimony in general, which was very strong his last few decades, but the film didn't deal with those last three decades. Too bad, but understandable since there is just so much you can show in two hours. The filmmakers took the tried-and-true road of a romance story instead, which makes sense business-wise.With all the goods and bads, the film succeeds on being a great piece of entertainment with fantastic music, acting, visuals and a guarantee to please a lot of people, almost as many as Cash did in his eventful life. He was an amazing man and a four-hour film about ""the rest of the story"" would have been fine with me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great biopic love story,This is biopic of the great Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from him picking cotton growing up in the Great Depression era to his marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and to his romance with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).Joaquin Phoenix puts in an excellent performance. It's not the music development that's put upfront. It's not really about Johnny Cash climbing the chart. This is a love story between Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Reese is also great. Don't get me wrong. The music is great. But it's the amazing love story that will make you fall for this movie.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"AN INVITATION TO TAKE A WALK TO A ¬®DIFFERENT"" COUNTRY!","FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title's Content and Context.....Here is a BIOPIC focused on a real life cultural icon who rose to fame at least a generation before most of You Dear Readers were even BORN!In L. A., California, in the 50s and 60s, my daily habit of listening to TOP 40 Radio exposed me to just about every kind of music genre, pretty much all of the time! Interestingly enough, I acquired, eventually, a taste for just about all of them, to one degree or another! Well, pretty much everything...JAZZ, not so much, really, and definitely NOT at all: COUNTRY music!The ONLY Country album I EVER bought in my ENTIRE life (Well, at least before turning 50!) was ""Johnny Cash: His Greatest Hits""! Upon realizing that they had released a movie about his life, it immediately went to the top of my ""MUST SEE"" List!Here is the central question for ALL of You to ponder BEFORE... DURING ...and AFTER watching: Precisely what was it about his music that gave it such widespread appeal? Exactly what ELEMENTS made Johnny Cash and his Music so very, very special?It would be nice to be able to provide a simple, straightforward answer to both questions, but in the film, WALK the LINE, it is all too clear, that in real life, when it comes to a human being, things sure can get extremely complicated!As a result, here, we end up with a movie that mirrors the life of its lead character: very interesting, entertaining, multifaceted, but at the same time, often dark, brooding and conflicted!I most certainly MUST emphasize ...WALK is a film I can wholeheartedly recommend no matter how you feel about Johnny Cash and/or his music.Quite frankly, for the role of Johnny Cash, Joaquin Phoenix (GLADIATOR) is not someone who would have made my short list, or even my long list, for that matter! WOW!, What a surprise! This actor, who was born in Puerto Rico, demonstrates tremendous versatility, both as an actor as well as a singer... (Yes, that is Joaquin Phoenix's own voice in the movie!) However, I do think that, at times, Mr. Phoenix comes up just a little bit short when it comes to his ability to project his voice firmly, but his performance, in general, was so masterful, that this point is quite easily overlooked.What really drives WALK? What gives it its soul and keeps it focused and centered is the repressed romance between Cash and the love of his life, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon / Legally Blonde, Cruel Intentions) Joaquin Phoenix, despite shining in the title role, is overshadowed by Witherspoon's overwhelming screen presence in the scenes where they appear together.Previously, WITHERSPOON had never really flagged my attention that much, perhaps other than her notable characterization of Tracey Flick in ELECTION. In most of her roles she seemed to be type cast as the syrupy sweet, but at the same time, rather annoying girl next door! WALK is well worth any time and money you invest to see Reese demonstrate her considerable acting talents ... And how clearly she demonstrates just how stunning those abilities are!Surely, WALK the LINE, for a myriad of reasons, invites comparison with another film about the life of another famous musician, RAY. Perhaps, there are many common elements in the life of famous musicians: A tragic childhood, years struggling in anonymity, problems with alcohol and drugs, a great deal of conflict and tension in their affective relationships and great difficulty accepting and managing fame and money. But after all, each story is real and each contains many elements that distinguishes it from others!8******** ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa√±ol, are most welcome!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
The rise of Johnny Cash,"I think the film did a well job showing how Johnny Cash's life played out. Such as his wife leaving him, showing the love he had for June, as well as the drug problems he faced. I would criticize the movie by saying that some scenes were a little cheesy, but it is safe to say that it was on purpose to keep the audience's attention to the love life story of the movie. The film I feel like made it seem as if Johnny Cash's wife was the bad guy. Even though he was cheating on her with June. I'm still wondering what the idea was behind that? If you haven't watched a film like this, I strongly suggest you do so. It serves a lot of knowledge about Johnny Cash's career and his life as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Walk the Line,"Walk the Line was an okay film to watch. In the beginning, the movie was entertaining and it was nice seeing him on tour accompanied by his friends and musicians. When he started to do the drugs and drink it seemed as though the scenes started to repeat over and over again with him doing the same things. I liked seeing how Johnny Cash and June Carter got together and how their relationship developed. Although the movie did show him being on tour and people loving him, I believe that this movie did not really show the good side to his career, only his hard times and rough patches. This movie painted Johnny Cash to be a lying, pill popping, drunk.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Just great,"Joaquin Phoenix deserved an Oscar for his portrayal, but it was just his bad luck. Not only did he have to compete against Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but also against the fact, that one year earlier Jamie Foxx had won an Academy Award for the portrayal of Ray Charles ... two Oscars in a row for playing in a biopic about a musicians life? Not a chance, although it would've been more than appropriate.I didn't know much about Johnny Cash, before I watched the movie, I have to admit, so I'm sure other people can comment on how accurate this depicts the real events. But still I was amazed by the life and struggle of this man. Watch it, if you can (-> have the time).",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"WALK THE LINE (James Mangold, 2005) ***","This is the best of the recent spate of musical biopics - BEYOND THE SEA (2004; about Bobby Darin), DE-LOVELY (2004; Cole Porter) and RAY (2004; Ray Charles) - with excellent leading performances, period detail and individual dramatic sequences. While I'm not all that familiar with Johnny Cash's discography, his music is effectively utilized throughout - and surely one of the most impressive feats of the film is that we're hearing Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon's own voices during the songs! Still, even if the film is based on true events, the plot offers little variety and basically alternates between clashes with Father, touring engagements, the blossoming romance between Cash and June Carter, arguments with the wife (usually over the latter) and drug abuse. Also, Cash's guilt complex over his brother's death as a kid is perhaps given excessive importance (a similar episode in RAY was also milked for all it was worth).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Superb,"I do like biopics a lot, I find them interesting, and not only was Walk the Line interesting, it was also truthful and compelling. The cinematography and editing are top notch, and the costumes/clothes and location work are nigh on perfect with a real sense of elegance about them. The songs and music are absolutely wonderful, the script is of exceptional quality, the story is well paced and easy to get into and the direction is excellent. And to top it all, the characters are portrayed in a truthful and sincere manner, while Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon for my mind give career-best performances.

Johnny Cash...,"""Walk the Line"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the life of legendary country music star Johnny Cash, focusing on his struggles with addiction, his tumultuous relationship with June Carter, and his rise to fame.I liked this movie because it was interesting and it presented very well the complexities of Cash's life, from his humble beginnings to his personal and professional triumphs. The direction which was made by James Mangold was exceptional and along with the interpretations of both Joaquin Phoenix who played as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon who played as June Carter which were outstanding, made this movie remarkable. The music in ""Walk the Line"" was another highlight, with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon performing their own songs, bringing a level of authenticity to the film. The soundtrack, filled with Cash's iconic hits, serves as both a backdrop to his journey and a reflection of his inner turmoil. Lastly, I have to say that ""Walk the Line"" is a solid biographical movie that benefits from strong performances and a memorable soundtrack so, I recommend you to watch it and learn more about Johnny Cash.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Fantastic Biopic,"The story of country legend Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is told through his ongoing romance with fellow singer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and how they get through tough times, from Cash's pill popping addiction to Carter's own marital troubles until finally agreeing to marry Cash.Walk the Line is an excellent look into Johnny Cash's life. It didn't shy away from telling the truth and most of the film was accurate. Before seeing Walk the Line, I didn't really like Johnny Cash's music. By the end of the movie though, I couldn't get enough of it. I still think Johnny Cash was an unlikable person but his music was fantastic. Even if you don't care for his music, the film is still worth checking out. James Mangold did a pretty good job behind the camera but it wasn't Oscar worthy. He moved the movie at a decent pace and it was hardly ever boring.The screenplay was good but it wasn't completely realistic. For example, they portrayed Vivian Cash in such a negative and selfish way. In the film, she didn't really seem to care about Johnny and his music. She also didn't really help him during his drug problem but that was completely untrue. The writing followed a pretty basic biopic formula and it wasn't hard to figure out where things were going. Also, the majority of the movie was depressing yet I still enjoyed the film. At least the ending was a happy one.The acting was fantastic with a couple of Oscar worthy performances. Reese Witherspoon was excellent as June Carter Cash. In some of her previous films, she was clearly just looking for a paycheck and she just phoned in her performance. In Walk the Line though, her singing was strong and her emotions never felt forced. While I think Felicity Huffman did a better job, I don't mind her winning the Oscar. Joaquin Phoenix was just as good as Reese. His singing was good and he had an engaging chemistry with Reese. Unlike Jamie Foxx's performance, they didn't imitate their characters, they became John and June Carter Cash. Ginnifer Goodwin was okay, a bit weak during the emotional scenes. Robert Patrick gave a decent performance, nothing special. In the end, this wonderful film is worth checking out. Rating 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Hard to avoid the comparison with Ray,"Walk the Line is a good film, presenting some of the highlights of the life of the great Johnny Cash and the love of his life June Carter Cash. Reese Witherspoon is INCREDIBLE, and Joaquin Phoenix is as good as he usually is in this well made biopic. For me, the music was a real highlight of the film, and the distracting similarities between the life of Mr Cash (or at least the aspects of it chosen for display in this film) and that of Ray Charles sort of took away from the overall plot.Ray made me a Ray Charles fan, though I had been familiar with Mr. Charles music for about 35 years, until the film, I didn't appreciate him properly. I have been a Johnny Cash fan for about 25 years, but from my perspective, Walk the Line was simply not as powerfully done as Ray.The Parallels between the two men's lives are bizarre, and though I know it really isn't fair to compare two whole lifetimes, I can't help thinking that some of the choices made in the selection of lifetime thresholds for WTL may have been influenced by what worked in Ray.Mangold's direction creates a very polished though somewhat Hollywood film, and the editing, script and pace of the film are all very strong.Nevertheless, this is a solidly entertaining and well made film, worth seeing for Witherspoon's amazing and lovable performance and the music alone. I also very much enjoyed Joaquin's excellent imitation of Cash's stage presence and facial expressions, but felt that his vocal impressions were just a tad over-rated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Love saves the day,"I have always been very fond of his music but in truth knew pretty little about the man, so i learnt a lot about him when watching this movie. I never imagined that behind his tough cowboy image he was so fragile, delicate and weak. This is a story where love saves the day, otherwise God knows. Although even June Carter seemed prepared to have him once he gets a grip on himself alone first, and I don't blame her. From a troubled childhood, we were taken through an unhappy first marriage, the rise to fame, the hits and the heartbreaks. The movie really finds its feet when singer June Carter shows up and the pairs relationship provides the movie with a heart. Some great performance acting I must admit, pretty outstanding. The story is gripping, with Cash's life providing plenty of juicy material, but ultimately what is revealed is much more fascinating. It was not just the hard times but also, if not mostly, his love of an amazing woman that fuelled most of his musical genius.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Heartfelt film is impassioned without being energetic...,"Strangely low-keyed musical-bio on country great Johnny Cash, his humble beginnings in a dysfunctional household to his first, unsuccessful marriage and quick rise to stardom often alongside future wife June Carter, with whom he had a rocky courtship. Based on two separate books by Cash, the film has very fine musical sequences and keen eyes and ears for the nuances of troubled families, but after the first 90 minutes the film seems to get stuck in a rut. Director James Mangold, a careful and talented filmmaker, doesn't utilize the slower-paced scenes to underscore anything meaningful--instead it just feels like sluggish narcissism. Cash's drug dependency and eventual withdrawal is well-wrought without a lot of hysterics, but Mangold's staging of these moments is clich√©d (he's seen too many movies himself). The budding, on-again/off-again romance with June is surprisingly complicated (she wasn't one to give in easily), but it probably wasn't wise to shape the final chapters of the movie on whether or not Carter would say yes or no to Johnny's numerous proposals (and Reese Witherspoon's pouty fierceness tends to make Carter look hard-headed in place of willful). The picture is surely a handsome one, with lots of fine tunes and terrific period atmosphere, but Joaquin Phoenix peaks early in his lead portrayal (at the Sun Records audition) and the other performances are peculiarly uneven. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Johnny Cash and  June Carter  a  wonderful combination!,"The 1950s was an important period for the popular music that was being created in this country. It was the decade that brought forth the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, June Carter, Patsy Cline, Bob Dylan and the rest of those innovators that sent the popular music of that era to the stratosphere. The music was created by poor rural people that grew up hearing the blues and gospel music in church and at home. The white music stars stole shamelessly from the black artists they admired, but because of the racial climate in the land, they had no chance to make it as big as the white performers.Johnny Cash was an important figure that came out of that time. As portrayed in ""Walk the Line"", the biographic picture created by its director, James Mangold, and his collaborator, Gill Dennis, they present us an aspect of the man as he was starting in the music business as he goes from poverty and tragedy, early in life, to become one of the most influential exponents of the music that came out of Memphis in the fifties.The film showcases Johnny Cash and his involvement with June Carter, a figure that was legendary in her own right, and through her family which was involved in music. The film shows a man who had the talent, the charisma and the good looks to make it big in the music world with his own material. The film concentrates in the life of Mr. Cash and Ms. Carter prior to their marriage as their lives interconnected with one another because they traveled in the same circuit and usually paired in a lot of those venues. Theirs was a relationship that started on a friendly basis until Johnny messes his life and his marriage to the patient Vivian because he falls in love with June. On the other hand, June didn't want to get involved with a married man and was battling her own demons.The best excuse for seeing the film is the terrific performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who, as Johnny and June, make this film come alive and make the viewer enter their world. Both actors do some of the best work in the movie. In fact, it was a surprise as how well these two dissimilar actors blend so well together, no mean feat for director Mangold.The film offers some of the best songs associated with Johnny Cash. The best part, and the wisest decision for the movie makers, was to let Mr. Phoenix sing the classic songs in his own way. Joaquin Phoenix, who has a good singing voice, also bears an uncanny resemblance with Mr. Cash. Reese Witherspoon makes a splash playing and singing songs that Ms. Carter made famous, although she was eclipsed by the stronger personality of Mr. Cash.The film will not disappoint thanks to the great treatment James Mangold gave the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
The story of Johnny and June,"I did not expect much of this bio-pic because I think it is almost impossible to make a good movie about an artist which not only shows the events of his life but also lets a viewer to take a peak inside that artist's mind to show the creative process with all its tension, uncertainty, selfishness and self-centering of an artist. In this regard, ""Walk the Line"" is nothing special but as a love story, it is wonderful from the first time young Johnny Cash and June Carter met during the show and she got strapped in his guitar until his proposal many years later on the stage (the only place she allowed him to talk to her). Both Phoenix and Witherspoon deserved the highest praise for their performances that were heartfelt, beautiful, sincere, and emotional. I never been a huge fan of Reese even though I always admitted that she had the acting talent (""Election"") but with her role in ""Walk the Line"" and with her acceptance speech, she has earned my respect and admiration. Phoenix was as good as Reese and the chemistry between them was absolutely real.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
What a Story!,"I have never been a fan of Johnny Cash (Joaquinm Phoenix), therefore I have not followed his career; but the story of his life is really an excellent theme for a movie. There are drama, rejection, music, drugs, romance and love. The screenplay begins when he was a boy, being raised very close to his brother Jack in a cotton farm in Arkansas; the tragic death of Jack in an accident with a saw, generating a process of rejection of his father; the period in the air force in Germany; his wedding with his sweetheart and the financial difficulties of the beginning of his marriage; his success with music, touring with Jerry Lee Lewis, June Carter, Elvis Presley, and Carl Perkins, and becoming addicted in pills; his fall in the world of drugs, causing the end of his marriage; his passion for June Carter (Reese Witherspoon); his raise, with the support of June, with a concert for the inmates at Folsom Prison in California; and his proposal of marriage to June on stage in Ontario. In addition to the wonderful screenplay, the stunning performance of this great actress Reese Witherspoon deserved the Oscar of Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.

Good but Lacks a spark,"This is a good family movie. Good performances, good storytelling, good music ( of course if you like Johny Cash). It looks like many other autobiographic movies, but tells the story of Johny Cash instead of Elvis Presley, John Nash or anyone else. It lacks something that unifies itself from other movies like it. Walk The line follows a common formula of a Rise - Fall - Rise again,but except of the tragic opening, the movie isn't a tear dropping experience, and not too dramatic. Except this, the movie is abundant with good music, some funny moments and never boring.I didn't read the biographies of Johny Nash, so I don't know in which detail he portrayed his life, and what part of it the director did not show us. What the director focused about is the developing love between Johny Cash and June Carter Cash throughout a decade, until they got married. This part done exceptionally well. One can feel the true love between them. So if we don't look at it as a biography, it is a great love story.There are other aspects of Johny Cash's life that were briefly shown but weren't developed. One of those is the relationship he had with his fellow musicians in the Sun Records. We see brief performances of Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, names that everyone know and that the main Character been close to (they toured together) for a while, but we don't see the interaction between them (or lack of interaction). We also see a brief scene with Johny Cash and Walon Jennings, when they shared an apartment together, also without too many words about them.My point in the last paragraph is, that we study people not only by their stories but also by their relationship with others, and how others see them. We also could learn something about Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis from the way Johnny Cash saw them. That part of his biography lacked for me in this movie.The biggest surprise for me was that the main characters did all the performances by themselves. I think that Reese Witherspoon may start a singing career.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Really surprised with this movie.,"I came into watching this movie in a history through film class. I had no idea what this movie was but in the opening scene the directors were clever enough to slip the opening music to ""Ring of Fire"" and an echoing voice saying ""Mr. Cash"". While this is a little on the nose, it certainly helped me out.
The pacing of the movie was very well done and kept my interest throughout the whole movie. This film does a great job of taking you on a emotional ride that will leave you feeling satisfied as well as having a greater respect for Johnny Cash himself. Although the movie makes you hate Cash for most of the movie, I found that by the end you could easily see how he progressed and became a better person.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Really engaging and enjoyable biopic,"Growing up Johnny Cash's ambition was to make it onto the radio with his band but as an adult the reality is different. His wife and family are stuck in poor housing and he is frankly terrible at his door-to-door sales job. Unable to turn down his wife's wish to move towns and for him to take a job her father has offered, Cash turns to a local recording studio in desperation. The band's audition is unimpressive and Cash's delivery uninspiring but, giving them one last chance, the studio manager lets them do another song ¬ñ which they deliver with much more passion and interest than their weak spiritual material. With a record under his belt Cash begins touring with many other rising rock and country stars as he begins a successful but storming personal and professional life.Without a great love for country music or for that matter biopics, Walk The Line took me some time to get round to seeing but when I did I was glad that I had because it is just simple a good film that rises above the genre. The film starts with formative moments from Cash's childhood and very quickly jumps through to adulthood, marriage and a dead-end job with no future or money. From here we know where the story is heading ¬ñ even if some of the viewers may not know the specifics as they apply to Johnny Cash. So we have the career rise of Cash matched with his personal fall ¬ñ much of his own making in regards women, drink and drugs. However this content is presented in a solid and engaging way because we care a lot about the characters and what is happening to them.Style-wise Mangold is relentlessly sturdy but never dull in his portrayal of the characters and he does well with the most important part ¬ñ his actors. I do recall some questions being asked of the casting and for my money anytime Reese Witherspoon is cast I do ask questions myself. However the cast are roundly impressive and make their characters convincing and engaging. Phoenix is really good and he has great chemistry with Witherspoon, who is also excellent throughout. Robert Patrick was one of the few other faces I recognised and it made me realise that, for a ""big"" film, there are hardly any established stars here and yet this never even occurred to me till after I finished watching the film. In terms of the musical numbers I'm not sure who was really singing and who wasn't but they are all really good and well filmed to be engaging and exciting.Walk the Line is a really good biopic and I know this because it engaged me as someone with little interest in Cash or his music. In regards narrative it ticks all the boxes that you know it will but yet still manages to make it interesting and never once was I thinking ""heard it all before"". Of course it also helps that both Phoenix and Witherspoon deliver really effective performances to draw the viewer into the characters from the start and throughout.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

This is a redemption story.,"I have always enjoyed both Johnny and June. But I was not too interested in their lives. And I have to admit that this film was a bit depressing at first. It reminded me too much of Steinbeck. I started to question my purchase when before I could finish the thought, I was sucked into their lives and this movie. This adds a new perspective on classic songs. We see that they were just people and subject to personalities and environments as we all are.You will find these songs going through your head days after viewing this movie.

About as Good of a Cash Biopic as We Can Hope For,"I initially had some concerns about this film. First and foremost, I didn't really understand the casting of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Not that they did bad jobs, but just that I think they weren't the most obvious casting choices. However, when I found out Cash had chosen Phoenix personally to portray him, well, I can't really argue with that.I also think they played down the negatives a bit. The domestic abuse is pretty much nonexistent and the drug abuse shows up, but makes Cash seem more like a lovable loser than an outright problem. I understand that Cash's son was a producer on this film, but the true story would be a bit more rough. (That, and the story cuts off with almost forty years of Cash's life left. One thinks there could have been more to say...)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Johnny Cash,"My favorite scene from the movie was when him and June Carter had their first tour together, and you could see where the movie was going for there. I also liked how they showed their love for each other though music. Its telling Johnny Cash in his past and struggles they had to go though with being famous. Some people treated him poorly because he was addicted to drugs. They also didn't like June Carter because they feel that she was the reason they got divorced. I didn't know about much other then that they had a great music. No I have not seen other movies from this time period. There was nothing in this movie that made me question historical accuracy. No I have not seen other movies by this director. I feel like overall the main actors did a really good job. I liked in this movie how it showed his past and the struggles that he had to go through. I didn't like how everyone judged him and June Carter. I have seen this movie outside of school before so yes this is a movie I would watch outside of school.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Walk the line is neat,Walk the line made me realize the stuff Johnny Cash went through in his life. I enjoyed learning about his ups and downs in fame. It showed the workings of what show business was like back then and how it can and did affect a persons life.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Johnny Cash,I think overall this was one of the best movies that we have watched in this class. I loved that John was willing to do anything it takes for June to be his wife. My favorite scene in this movie was when he asked June to marry him on the tour bus in the middle of the night and she told him to to go back to bed. In this movie I feel like the filmmaker is trying to teach us to forgive and look past the bad parts of people. You could tell June wasn't happy with his choices but she forgave John and looked past the bad things that happened. I knew that in this part of history that they didn't have all the cool lighting for concerts that we have now. I have seen a few movies from this time period before. In this time period and in the 1960's people were all about concerts. I have not seen other movies by this director but I do like his movies. Some of the main actors in this movie are Johnny Cash and June Carter. I have not seen wither of them in other movies but i think they did a good job and I would like to see other movies with them in it. I liked everything about this movie. There wasn't anything that I didn't like. This is a movie I would watch outside of school if I had time. This is a movie I wouldn't recommend to my friends but a movie I would tell my grandpa to watch.

Very well made - but dragged on too much for me,"This is a very hard film to review.The casting and acting is amazing and I was easily sucked in to the life of Jonny Cash.The music is great as is the supporting cast - especially Robert Patrick who is great as Jonny's stoic father.There are two issues I had with this.One is the sound balance - I got this on Blu-ray and the dialogue was often very soft and accented but the music was very loud.I was constantly sliding the volume up and down to hear what was being said before being deafened by a guitar solo.Also this is long.So very, very long.Although it is admirable that this doesn't embellish its source material - nothing really comes to a head.The movie has no kind of climax and just kind of fizzles out.This is a very well made film with great performances but the thought of watching it again fills me with dread.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Love and Music,"""Walk the Line"" is a movie that really explains with detail the story of the life of Johnny Cash, how he struggled getting into the music industry , and still struggling after getting in the music industry. Before watching this movie I did know that Johnny was a big famous artist during the 1950s. The connection this movie has with current events is that many artist to this day fall in the path of drugs, abusing the use of drugs and alcohol. The main characters in this movie are John R. Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). The director of Walk the Line is James Mangold. My favorite part was when June said yes to Johnny because it's a part we all wait for through out the whole movie so then it does finally happen you getting the feeling of relief. What I didn't like about the movie and it kinda got me mad was that he was married with kids and he was trying to marry someone else that was also married! Overall I really liked the movie, I loved the whole romantic drama between June and Johnny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Plot line issues slow the film,"When my mother and father came home from this movie, I asked ""How was it?"", expecting the real deal from people who remember some of the events portrayed in this movie. Besides my dad's opinion of how great Joaquin Phoenix was, they basically didn't tell me too much besides that. On their word, I was thinking that it's probably going to be a great movie.And so when I sat down with a friend to watch this movie, I was entranced by it. The performances of the main actors (Phoenix, Witherspoon), and a great supporting role with Robert Patrick were far and away the highlights of this movie, and merit going to see the film on just this.But the problems with the movie are the timing. There's a whole slew of things that just didn't make sense, was put together in a fast-forward fashion, and some scenes completely pointless. In this, it reminded me of the Doors movie, which also had great acting by the leads and some of the cast, along with a very important childhood event, but overall, the plot was what killed it.Don't get me wrong, Phoenix and Witherspoon save the plot enough because you're so entranced with their performances that most of it doesn't matter, but the fact that some of the other people are looked over (the Tennessee Two - and then Tennessee Three by far here, have no explanation), and some people are added to the movie for no specific reason (Waylon Jennings. Played by his grandson).Basically you're getting the cream (and the dirt) of a five to eight year period in Cash's life (I'm not even discussing the children part) with no real conception of time, and no thorough glance at any specific song.When you leave the theater and actually think about the film, you realize that they're basically just throwing things at you hoping they're going to stick, plot wise. And though a whole lot of it does, the overall feeling of it is not as good as I'd hoped.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Geniuses also cry,"Walk the Line is a 2005 American biographical drama film directed by James Mangold. The screenplay, written by Mangold and Gill Dennis, is based on two autobiographies authored by singer-songwriter Johnny Cash. The film follows Cash's early life, his romance with June Carter, and his ascent to the country music scene. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as Cash, Reese Witherspoon as Carter, Ginnifer Goodwin as Vivian Liberto, and Robert Patrick as Cash's father.
The film was nominated for five Oscars at the 78th Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Phoenix), Best Actress (Witherspoon, which she won), and Best Costume Design (Arianne Phillips). The film grossed more than $186 million worldwide.
I knew a lot about Johnny Cash before watching the movie. It was really helpful. A very famous musician and singer of the second half of the XX century played a key role in the development of music. That is why I was impressed by the Phoenix's acting. For those who knew Johnny Cash before it was the great impersonation. 
Joaquin Phoenix performs songs himself. These songs were like Cash's performance. Manners, gestures, movements, a reprimand, a smile, and even the way he holds the guitar in his hands are like a reflection in the mirror of Cache. But what really surprised me was that he did not get an Oscar for this movie.
As for Reese Witherspoon, I absolutely do not like her as an actress. I cannot understand her absolutely. But nevertheless she looked quite believable. But the reason for what she was given an Oscar does not clear for me.
In generally I saw the film with pleasure. It is simple, but at the same time is quite cute. Music which were played during the movie immersed in the life of that musical era. In addition, I was very pleased with the accuracy of the plot to the very biography of the singer.
It is noteworthy that I watched it on February 26, the birthday of the singer. There was some magic in this fact.
In general, the movie is very good.

Good  Job Reese!,I just saw it on a DVD and I think it was pretty good especially due to the magnificent performance of Reese Whitherspoon. She was really amazing as she managed to prove her role more leading than Phoenix's. Reese was excellent and allow me to say that I enjoyed her acting much more than Joaquin's. Even though he is an excellent actor the film was hers. Even though I haven't seen any of the other ladies in The ''Leading Role'' nominations I dare say that Reese deserved the Oscar given to her. They both sang very good and I also liked the costumes. I didn't like much the performance of the girl playing Johnny's (bitch) wife. My favourite scene is the one when June refuses to get on stage cause she's wearing her slippers and then finally they give a fantastic show.Thank you.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A Walk in the Thin Line,"It seems that there always is a previous praise to those films that are biographical, and the main actor/actress should get lofty credits. Well, ""Walk the Line"" disappointed me. Passing through its slow, boring development, Joaquin Phoenix didn't surprise me. His work was mainly done on rough imitations, but not fonding with the spirit of the character. There is no connection between viewer and spectator, mainly if you are not related nor fan of Johnny Cash. To those like us, the story by Mangold will not deepen us emotionally into his life. Reese Witherspon, on the other side, shines and flows on a river of expos√® charm and blossoming emotions. She is an angel.The other part of the cast fails to guide the public through their emotions, and we are puzzled on the real conflict and the real rooted problems. Life is hard, yes. But Cash's Life is not honored in this film, it's copied. Besides the Love Story rendering between Cash and Carter, and the moment where Johnny sings his ""Folsom Prison"" tune to the agent, there is nothing remarkable within the film.""Walk the Line"" failed to satisfy me. It lacks a lot of strength, basically. It is stuck into a limbo of entertainment, with a disappointing Phoenix that fails to feel but only impersonates, with the shining of Whiterspoon and a mix of nice, bewitching soundtrack, that are curiously performed by the main couple, Joaquin and Reese. I can give it the current rating comparing it to ""Ray"", both movies where I didn't know the singers portrayed. One sucked me in and the other left me indifferent. See ""Ray"" instead, if you're not a die hard of Johnny Cash.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Hats Off To Mr.Mangold,"I didn't know what to expect whilst buying this movie in my local media shop. I made my decision entirely upon the critics making a fuss of this 'movie epic', not knowing what to expect i decided to take a chance not expecting much greatness.However I was blown away by this touching, personal and painful portrait of Johnny Cash's life. He is a musician i know little about and have been recommended by many others but never have been adventurous enough to buy his LPs And CDs. With fantastic performances from both Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon, Walk The Line was brought to life. Telling the tale of his life starting on a cotton farm in Arkansas to worldwide fame. Through love, through pain, through the music Walk The Line is a sure winner for all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Amazing performances,"If you'd told me, oh, a year ago that there would be this big-budget movie about Johnny Cash, and it would star Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, there's no way I would have been looking forward to seeing it. Joaquin Phoenix, the bad guy in Gladiator, as Cash? Reese Witherspoon, the cutie pie in Legally Blonde, as June Carter? It would have sounded like a flop borne of hubris and greed.But Phoenix and Witherspoon turn in incredible performances, surely the best of their short careers and among the very best of the year. Phoenix IS Cash - singing the Man in Black's song in perfect imitation. Witherspoon is smashing in what's hopefully a breakout role for her, after so many fluffy, nondescript comedies.Like most biopics, this is a story of redemption, of rising and falling and finding that those who remain with you in your time of need are the ones that should be kept around, their reluctance to do so be damned. We follow Johnny from his early childhood, including the tragic loss of his brother and the rejection of his father, to his opportune recording for Sam Phillips, and his meeting, courtship of, touring with, and proposal to June Carter. In between, we get a pretty good glimpse, courtesy of Phoenix's stunning performance, of the ghosts that haunted Cash throughout his life.It's no surprise that the music is so good, since they're all old Cash tunes, but the fact that Joaquin Phoenix is singing them does offer up a bit of a curveball. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon so completely immerse themselves in the well-known characters of Johnny and June that one would almost expect some caricature, but there's nary a dishonest, insincere beat to their incredible work here.Director James Mangold, who previously directed Girl, Interrupted, hits no false notes here, where even the slightest misstep might have had rabid Cash fans clamoring for his head on a spike. Vividly shot, the film is highly evocative; you feel at times that you're crawling inside Cash's brain, the atmosphere is so intense.And although this is a movie about a man's rising from his own ashes, one of its core themes is also its most wonderfully realized, that of true love and friendship. June Carter stands by her man through all of the bad times, even when his family, particularly his shrewish wife, abandon him out of selfishness and spite. From the first moment Witherspoon and Phoenix share the screen, you can tell they're made for each other, with dazzling chemistry that ultimately lifts the movie to its greatest heights.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Good!!,"I thought this movie was great. I like Johnny Cash. I think Joaquin Pheonix did a good job portraying Johnny Cash. The acting was great. I didn't know anything about his past and this movie was not only great, but it also lets the audience learn about the past and what drives a musician. What I thought was great was the fact that Johnny had so much love and passion for June. It wasn't just an actor lip-syncing, he actually did his own singing and it amazingly sounded like Johnny. Reese also did a good job portraying June Carter. It is definitely a good movie to own. I usually don't watch these type of movies, but it was a really good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great Film; Great Acting/Chemistry,"Wow this is a great film. So good that I was surprised when I saw Cash's San Quentin performance this week on TV, I was struck by how very much unlike Johnny Cash Joaquin Phoenix's performance seemed to be, whether actually singing and playing, or say simply talking on stage. The real Johnny Cash seemed much more the exuberant extrovert, and, among other things, brighter, sharper, looser. Phoenix's Cash is darker and much quieter, but at the same time does not quite show us the Johnny Cash that wrote ""I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die."" But as to this latter point, it may be that no film is big enough to show the whole of Johnny Cash, a very complicated guy.No doubt that Phoenix truly captures much of essence of Cash. Because of that, and many other things, there is real magic in this film. Witherspoon and Phoenix simply crackle together. Their chemistry lights up the screen. Is this simply acting, or are these two somehow cosmically in synch. No one could doubt that these two as portrayed in the film would be together, and I sense that this is the essence of the Carter/Cash relationship, too. The sense if that if you meet folks that resonated like this in real life, you would know immediately that they quite a couple.Most of the cast provides acting of the very best kind. The director has to get credit for that kind of overall effort.The sense, too, is that the performances and the takes on the creative processes are spot on. This must be what is like to be this kind of celebrity/performer. I have only seen it once, so I can break it down, but I bet things like the lighting, costumes, colors, soundtrack (even apart from the fantastic vocal numbers), camera angles, etc., are a school for how to make a convincing film. I am sure that each contributes to creating an engrossing world on screen.I would say this is a real film, too, in that the narrative is not so important as the creation of a convincing universe, with individuals taking completely understandable actions within that universe. Thus, the movie explores and reveals something of the human condition.This one has Oscar written all over it, certainly for Phoenix and Witherspoon. Their performances are simply not to be missed by anyone that cares about film-making. I would expect Phoenix's efforts to influence lots of other actors. What he does is very effective with an economy of overt speech and movement. Talent by the gallon. Mesmerizinig to watch.I only gave it an 8, because parts of the story-line, the narrative, seem trite, as if playing to the larger audience. Too much bathos in places. Phoenix is utterly convincing as man that has had great sorrow in his life. The narrative is distracting to me by dwelling on specifics. The point is not what happened to Cash, but what man was created.But what is good in this movie, which is most of the movie, is tremendous.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Oscar nominations on the horizon for Phoenix and Witherspoon,"Terrific film, the lead performances are spectacular. Special kudos to the music editors, the sound was one of the best I have heard on film.

A moving story, not your standard bio pic, and clears up all the Johnny Cash myths out there. Technically, quite an achievement for a new director (or is he?) and there is not a false note in this film. A must see, and you don't have to be a country music fan to appreciate the genius of Johnny Cash, and the appeal of June Carter.Too bad Johnny and June cannot see it, they would be so pleased.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great performances...okay movie,"Let me begin by stating that I am a HUGE Johnny Cash fan and was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I read Johnny's autobiography, so I had a lot of outside knowledge about him and his relationship with June Carter, which is one reason why this movie just didn't do it for me as much as I'd hoped it would. Like all Hollywood biopics, WALK THE LINE glosses over a lot of facts, plays around with chronology, and just leaves out a lot of details that fans like me would have enjoyed seeing. That's not to say that the movie is not any good...the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are superb, the set design and costumes were very impressive, and the music, of course, was wonderful...the true flaws lie with the screenplay and the editing. Maybe it's because I'm familiar with the story, but the film seemed a little too hurried to get through all the details of Cash's life in two hours...more time should have been devoted to Cash's outsider status in the country music world and his ""man in black"" persona, which in this movie seems to take a backseat to his drug addiction and recovery with the help of his true love, June. All in all, the film is played as more of a love story and less of a portrait of a legendary artist, which is what I hoping it would be. Perhaps if the film were longer and had a better director, it could have balanced the many aspects of Cash's fascinating life a little better. All in all, the film was very enjoyable, but I'd be more interested in an extended version with more music.P.S.: I still don't understand why this movie wasn't called ""Ring of Fire""...maybe the producers didn't want it to be confused with that dragon movie that came out a few years ago.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Endearing tribute to one of the most beautiful American voices,"Endearing tribute.The music Johnny Cash has made is dark, soulful, magnificent, chilling and uplifting.

The role didn't have an oomph to it. It didn't require a lot of emotions. But she can sing the country well. But her really southern accent was a little too thick and annoying.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are superb as Johnny and June.,"""Walk the Line"" is really the Johnny and June story, told with events of their real lives as the backdrop. Although they grew up in different parts, as a young boy of about 10 little JR would listen to little June sing on the radio with the Carter Family, to the objections of JR's father who valued music and singing as zero. So you can say that for Johnny it was love at first listen. Later when he finally met her, they were both married with families, so all they could do was sing together, and they made quite a good team. But Johnny seemed to live his life to be with June, if he couldn't then nothing else seemed to matter.I am old enough to remember Johnny Cash, and remember his popularity and seeing him on TV. I never was much of a fan of his music, or his singing style, but I respected what he did. This movie to me is a great, almost overwhelming, achievement. He may not win the Oscar, but Phoenix delivered an Oscar-caliber performance as Johnny Cash from the time he went off to Germany in the Air Force in 1952, to his getting sober and off drugs in the late 1960s. That he also did all his own singing is even more amazing. While no one can sound just like Cash's unique singing style, Phoenix captured it so well it was almost like seeing Johnny Cash again, not only the voice, but the facial and body mannerisms while singing. I own the DVD, I will watch it multiple times. (I finally did in March 2024, after 18 years. What took me so long??)Joaquin Phoenix was John R. Cash, Reese Witherspoon was June Carter, Ginnifer Goodwin (of recent 'Ed' fame) was Johnny's wife Vivian, Robert Patrick (of Terminator 1 and 2 fame) was Johnny's father Ray Cash, the fine country singer Shelby Lynne was Johnny's mother Carrie Cash, and various actors played Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Waylon Jennings, and Roy Orbison.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
One of the Best and Most Beautiful Movies of the 2000s- An Unsung Masterpiece,"This movie is just super.

Although this is not an obvious selection to fall into a category of masterpieces, I'm surprised to say that it actually is one, despite it being a genre one wouldn't expect for that label.The performances are just stunning (both Witherspoon and Phoenix actually sang all of those songs), and the story has so much beauty in it. Perhaps the most amazing thing about it is that this is supposed to be a biographical movie, but it catches a modern wave of modern pop culture relation that doesn't make it feel too old or outdated due to its style, yet at the same time you are in awe that this really is Cash and June Carter.In other words, you don't even need to have ever heard of Johnny Cash or June Carter or have been an actual fan of theirs to actually appreciate the fundamental humanity of the story.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are fantastic,"'Walk the Line' feels a little underdeveloped as it gives more biographical highlights instead of insight.

Excellent biopic.,"If you're a Johnny Cash fan or even if you're not, this is one entertaining movie. The movie chronicles the life of Johnny Cash from his early years up to June Carter agreeing to marry him in my home town of London, Ontario. This movie doesn't really take a lot of liberties like some true stories, but instead sticks squarely to the facts. Johnny Cash would be proud of this film. Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon (though they don't really look their parts) do a phenomenal job as Johnny Cash and June Carter. Every actor in the film put their all into the role and it made it great.This movie has just the right amount of balance between Cash's personal life and his professional life, and it keeps the viewer entertained. Joaquin Pheonox did his own signing for the role, and though it wasn't dead on like Johnny's it was eerie how close it was. Reese Witherspoon was also surprisingly good at singing. She really deserved the best actress win at the Golden Globes, and Joaquin deserved his win as well, and I think that they might have a chance at the Oscars. It really is a shame that Walk the Line isn't nominated for Best Picture, because I think it might have won.This is one of the best films of 2005, and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. Definitely see this movie. It's a good time.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Cash!","Johnny Cash gets the big screen treatment a year after Ray Charles. I must admit, though, that initially I had reservations about this film. Honestly now, I feel that it's very much the kind of film we're subjected to every now and then. You know, that based on a true to life story of someone who rose to top after being down that's bound to jerk the tears out of you.So somehow I entered the theater having the wrong expectations but went out getting a different impression. Yes, considering its Hollywood nature, it can be manipulative at times and it still has to follow a certain formula, but director James Mangold (""Girl, Interrupted,"" ""Identity"") manages to make ""Walk the Line"" more than its narrative of a celebrity who stumbles and rises up again. It's a film featuring superb performances and some nice crooning.As I've said, ""Walk the Line"" is the story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix). It follows his childhood days in rural Arkansas, through his early music career, through his obsession with future wife June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and through his inevitable downfall.Of course, the thing with biopics is that if you've seen enough of the genre you'll presume you'll know how the story will unfold up until the credits and then you can figure out the theme of life-affirmation. But that's hardly fair with the point of the movie. The film is about the character of Cash and how his humanity has failed to cope with everything that's happened in his story. Mangold and his co-writer Gill Dennis brilliantly stayed faithful to the story of the man they were paying their respects to.""Walk the Line"" is set in the post-World War II era, with culture in general and music in particular experiencing a great transition. It's underlined with a cinematography that borders on retrospective. There's one gorgeous shot during one of Cash and his band's performance which I think was done somewhat in high contrast, and it added a touch of sophistication and subtlety to the scene. It's this great use of technique that gives the film its emotional impact.Of course, no review of the film is ever complete without saying something about the performances of the leads. Honestly, I think this is Phoenix's best performance to date. His authentic portrayal of the legendary singer is complemented with great crooning and such a delicate tenderness. Witherspoon's performance gives soul to the film, and her understated voice is a joy to listen to. She proves how talented actor she is and that she's more than the roles she usually plays.In the end, I liked it. It's still formulaic, but not in the same vein as most of its predecessors have gone through. Fans of Cash may be glad to know that Mangold has brought them their idol's time of his life with a film filled with nice writing, brilliant direction, and great acting and singing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Joaquin and Reese were absolutely amazing!!!,"I still can't believe they sang every song in the movie. I stayed to watch the credits role to see who the actual vocals were done by and I was awe struck. I thought Joaquin a fine actor (extremely handsome too) before this movie and knew that his star would eventually shine once given the ""right"" script/movie and this is it. He brought Johnny Cash back to life and introduced me to this music for the first time. If Joaquin doesn't WIN the best actor Oscar for this, shame on the Academy!Reese Witherspoon should seriously consider a singing career, along with her acting career. There are so many other actresses out there that are and she has so much more talent. If she hadn't starred in this movie, this would definitely be the case of talent wasted. I wished the movie was longer! It touched my heart because the actors didn't seem like they were ""acting""! I have hope once again that true love does indeed exist!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
More epic and substantial than I expected - a great tribute to Cash that also isn't totally biased in his favor,"Having seen the previews and read the reviews for ""Walk the Line,"" and knowing its director was James Mangold, I expected a light drama with great performances. I'm glad I gave the film a chance, however, because it is actually a strong drama with amazing performances.I wasn't too thrilled by Mangold's directorial decisions on ""Cop Land"" (I thought the acting there was superb also, but let down by amateurish handling). He has matured as a director since then. ""Walk the Line"" doesn't come across as being a formulaic or stale biopic - it opens with Johnny Cash's famous performance at Folsom Prison and flashbacks to his memories of childhood. It also doesn't portray Cash as a perfect hero - he's flawed, and his alcoholism, drug addiction and adultery is all exposed.Being a huge fan of Cash (although not by any means a fan of most country music), I've always thought it was Cash's rock n' roll attitude and blending of musical styles that attracted me. I didn't know so much about his personal life, but knew he had given his blessings to this project. It was refreshing to see Joaquin Phoenix do him justice. 2005 was a year of two great performances (Hoffman in ""Capote"" was also wonderful) and Phoenix really nailed Cash down to the notes he sang.Reese Witherspoon was impressive as June-Carter, Cash's wife. Their relationship was turbulent and the movie handles it tastefully. It never veers into unabashed sentimentality, yet it also doesn't become too bogged down with the negative. It provides a balanced perspective of their marriage.I found some of the co-star roles questionable (Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley was a huge mistake - looks and sounds nothing like him), but that is irrelevant in the long run since this is primarily about Cash and Carter and both actors deliver in their roles.As a recently-converted Cash fan, I see this movie as a touching tribute to his life that doesn't seem artificial, tacky or biased. As a general movie buff, I see it as one of the rare biopics that achieves epic status and doesn't fall victim to excess.Yes, the film has a few flaws - but overall I thought it was one of the best and most surprising films of 2005. Really not at all what I had expected after reading reviews. I would take any critic who tells you it's a movie made ONLY by its performances with a grain of salt. It's a well-rounded achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Walk the Line,"There is a moment in the movie. Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is giving an audition to Sam Philips of Sun Records by singing a gospel song. Philips is bored and tells Cash that he has heard these songs hundreds of times and they don't sell.James Mangold's bopic of the Man in Black is respectful and somewhat spiky. However it is the type I have seen before from Ray (The Ray Charles story) to Bird (The Charlie Bird biopic.)Walk the Line opens with Cash about to sing in Folsom prison in 1968. It goes to a flashback of his brother dying in an accident and his father telling Cash that the wrong brother died.It goes through all the usual signposts, Cash in the army where he learns to play guitar. Once out of the army, he gets married young but it is an unhappy affair as his wife disapproves of his music career.As his music takes off, he gets addicted to drink and drugs. Even doing time in prison.At the centre of it is Cash trying to woo fellow country singer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon.) They have a playful relationship but she is reluctant to marry a man whose demons overwhelm him.The best part of the film is the humorous interplay between Carter and Cash. There is an easy rapport between Witherspoon and Phoenix. Both actors also provide live vocals to the songs.It does suffer from being too vanilla, a bit seen it all before. I expected a little more creativity by Mangold.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
My Dad and Johnny Cash,"My introduction to Johnny Cash's music was when I was eight years old. My father started collecting his albums (8-tracks actually) and whenever we were on the road he'd pop one in and we'd listen to I Walk The Line or Ring Of Fire or Folsom Prison Blues; those were the main ones anyway. My dad wasn't a big music fan back then ¬ñ he was extremely selective ¬ñ but Cash was his exception. Not knowing what Johnny's music was all about, I really didn't give much thought as to why my father should or shouldn't like the singer (""He sings real good, doesn't he Dad?"" ""Yes he does""). This might seem more like a family reminiscence on my part but humor me for just one more minute.My father was pretty conservative: he paid his taxes on time without question, was a Marine, believed in the death penalty, enjoyed any kind of sports, and coached in a Pop-Warner football league.Fast forward to this movie, Walk The Line, and I have to wonder why my father felt so strongly for this man's music. Johnny Cash was anything but conservative. Joaquin Phoenix's excellent portrayal of Mr. Cash ¬ñ from his humble beginnings on an Arkansas farm to his nearly fatal brush with amphetamine addiction ¬ñ shows us all the flaws this incredibly gifted man had balled up inside him. He drank like a fish, womanized while on tour, supported better living standards for prison inmates (something my father would NEVER agree with), and enjoyed the rock-a-billy sounds that were just emerging onto the airwaves. Cash's worldviews were fairly extreme and this spilled over into the lyrics for his songs (just listen to his best-selling At Folsom Prison album and you'll see what I mean).So what was it about Johnny Cash that pulled my dad into his fandom? Well, this movie shows us. Johnny Cash's voice (""Like a freight train coming 'round a bend but sharp as a razor"") is hypnotic, and Mr. Phoenix deserves all of the notoriety he's received for playing this role. It's stunning to learn that Joaquin didn't lip-sync any of the songs, but sung them all himself. And although Johnny Cash's voice was a bit coarser and deeper, Mr. Phoenix should be congratulated for his singing talent. He amazed me.The shining light in the movie, however, was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Who could've guessed that this Legally Blonde comedic talent could act so dramatically? Her singing voice was wonderful, too, doing all of June Carter's songs without lip-syncing ¬Ö just as Joaquin had.But I do have two complaints. First, I didn't much care for the ending. I felt it was abrupt and tried too hard to tie everything up into a nice ""family package"" in just a few minutes. Second (although not really a complaint but more of a comparison) is that there've been some really great character films done in the past few years, and although Walk The Line ranks right up there with the best of them, I felt that Jamie Foxx did a bit better job in Ray (but I think overall Walk The Line was better as entertainment).Still, this is a great movie with excellent filming and information about an American icon of the music industry. I'm sure my dad loved it, too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Reese steals the show,I just watched this movie that I had heard a lot of good things about. It was all I had heard and more. The story itself is interesting and riveting at times and is well worth watching. The music is the main attraction though and Reese Witherspoon's performance is exceptional. I was never a June Carter fan but Reese Witherspoon's performance is nothing short of a show stealer. Her vocals are fantastic and her presence on stage performing looked genuine and real. I have enjoyed Johnny Cash's music for many years and was looking forward to seeing this movie and his story. After watching the movie I was far more impressed with Reese Witherspoon as an actor and singer. Boy can she sing !!,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"They're Going Down, Down, Down in a Burning Ring of Oscars","""Walk the Line"" is every bit as compelling and well made as last year's ""Ray."" Like that film it avoids the typical biopic trappings with straightforward direction and a lead player, in this case Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, who totally immerses himself in the role to give a truly authentic and moving performance. This film also benefits greatly from Reese Witherspoon, who turns in a fiercely real and powerful performance as June Carter. She's even more of a surprise and delight than Phoenix, as the casual movie-goer would've never suspected such a raw and endearing performance like this for Ms. Witherspoon, who's usually regulated to throwaway rom-com roles. These two kids are without a doubt the Oscar front-runners for best actor and actress.The central storyline of this film, which uses flashbacks and stage scenes judiciously, is the slow, long, and genuine love affair that developed between Cash and Carter. The chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon is electric, and they make it easy to see how these two consummate performers were able to make their greatest music together. There's also great fun to be had in the revelation of the real stories that inspired the amazing lyrics and songs that millions of people came to love. Like all good biopics it shows us the good times and the bad, Cash's troubled childhood to his redemption at Folsom prison, and it makes you want to go out and buy every bit of Johnny Cash's and June Carter's recordings. With the great performances and amazing music, you can't really ask for more from a flick like this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Thank you, Joaquin and Reese","The performances, the story, the passion are all consuming. The movie is awe inspiring. Joaquin and Reese have given the performances of their lives. I can't get enough of the movie! Johnny and June Cash's love affair was so powerful and captured brilliantly. Joaquin was meant to play Cash! The fact that he had met him before knowing about the movie proves you never know what you are being prepared for. Every thing was excellent about this movie-the acting, music, editing, hair and make-up...Only one problem-What do you do for an encore?!The Golden Globes recognized the movie, Reese and Joaquin with top honors. The Acadamy Award should also have gone to Joaquin.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"If you had time to sing only one song, what would you sing?","""Walking the line"" - a movie that can be worth watching not only for those who are interested in John Cash's life, but also for those who enjoy stories of ""finding one's own path"". Though, I would think twice before recommending it to a sophisticated film-lover. The following is just my personal opinion.What is great about the movie:1) Always topical themes of love, marriage, creative work, choosing your own path. As the movie shows John Cash's experience in life, the viewers can think about their own life and make their own conclusions from it.2) The development of John Cash's personal tragedy. The movie shows quite plausibly how the main character managed to rise after falling down so meanly and it can be really inspiring for those who want to see someone's good example.3) Music. Music is a central theme in this movie. The performances shown in the movie made the story brighter, of course. And it is always great when the actors perform their music parts by themselves, adding their personal attitude, devotion, passion to this music. And music also contributed really much to the atmosphere of that time.4) Acting. Of course, actors were great, especially the leading ones.5) Dialogues. Sometimes the dialogues contribute very much to the message of the movie, express some ideas without which the movie would lack much.""If you were hit by a truck and you had time to sing only one song. One song that people would remember before you're dirt. One song that would let God know how you felt about your time here on Earth. One song that would sum you up. What would you sing?""Weak points of the movie:1) Shallow plot and message. Despite all the merits of the movie, for me it seems quite superficial. The plot is able to enthrall you while you are watching the movie, but after it you realize there is nothing to be thinking about at least during the rest of the day. For me the characters lack some deep psychological drama that would make the story more unusual, surprising. Maybe this is because of the biographical genre of the movie that makes the story too down-to-earth.2) The style of the movie seems quite neutral. The movie is shot as if just for everybody to find something to like about it, and this makes the movie a bit trivial. It lacks some individuality.3) Trite characters. This comes from all I said above. Especially it seems true about the female characters. The opposition between a loving, inspiring lover and a dissatisfied, disappointed wife was quite predictable and evident.That's why I make a conclusion that this is an interesting biography from which we all can get some lesson, but the genre of the biography makes its impact: sometimes the story seems shallow and trite.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Very interesting movie, I enjoy this","This movie for me is so accurate to portray the real Johnny Cash and June Carter. I like when Reese Whiterspoon and Joaquin Phoenix sang by themselves so I can feel that they really sang that song, it is uncommon since the actor and the actress in many documentary movie usually sing by lip sync, you know that. Honestly, I don't know a lot about who Johnny Cash and June Carter really are because i am just 19 years old now, I just realize that they were two of the most famous stars in the United States at that era when i saw Elvis Presley.

"A Good Sanitized, Choppy Biopic","27 November 2005. This movie could have been so much better. While containing some great scenes, overall this biopic had a rough, uneven, choppy beginning with editing, continuity, and pacing problems that raised more questions about the script/plot than answers, leaving a lot of interesting transition questions lingering. The important relationships between father and son weren't strong. The way June Carter's role was presented in the movie almost screamed for having more emphasis placed on her life story as well (which occurred somewhat and belatedly later in the film). We seen Johnny Cash go from going fishing, suddenly working with his brother. We see Johnny Cash looking at a guitar and then suddenly later with a guitar. We never see how Johnny Cash learned to play, how he developed his music. The first half of the movie is composed of just snap shots of supposedly important events that never really provide a smooth and continuous understanding of Mr. Cash's early life story. We never seen if his tour with June Carter continued or stopped when she threatened to quit. Mr. Carter's dalliances were softened into suggestive affairs.Several great scenes included his fight with his wife that was actually one of the few gritty, graphic cinematographic change ups with photographic camera technique. His scene in at the cafe counter with June Carter, his scene with breaking up the sink are classic dramatic performances.There was good material, the music and singing delightful, but overall, the movie never obtained the greatest that a better script and selective directorial approach could have inspired.

"Not quite ""Ray...with white people"",but...","...the similarities are there. This biopic of another music legend,this time Johnny Cash, uses about the same map of storyline: popular-but-troubled superstar comes from very poor backgrounds(Ray Charles from rural,tenant farming Northern Florida,Johnny from rural,dirt-farming Arkansas),both witness traumatic events involving their brothers(Ray's brother drowns to death in front of him,Johnny's brother is sawed in half and bleeds to death in front of him),both take up music as somewhat of a pipe-dream,both find love with women who are far more straight-laced than they(Ray's wife Della Bea and Johnny's second wife,June Carter,are singers in gospel traditions. Johnny's first wife,Vivian,is a conservative,non-entertainment involved housewife),both endure spiraling drug addictions,both bottom out,both reach ""defining moments"" and both rise above their lowest moments with the help of family and TRUE friends.Director JAmes Mangold's movie is something that frames the man and legend of the Man In Black very nicely,period. Throw in Reese Witherspoon's subtle,pained performance as June Carter(soon-to-be Cash) and nice turns from Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne as Johnny's folks,RAy and Carrie Cash. It,also like Ray,is almost entirely a film built about and around the main character,so it seems to be tough to separate it from its star,so Joaquin Phoenix has a HUGE burden of carrying this film as Cash,and while he isn't quite as indistinguishable from his character as Jamie Fox seemed to be from Ray Charles,he still fills out Cash's shoes more than adequately and gives you some emotional depth that is necessary to make this film feel right.Fans of Cash will especially feel edified by this picture,but even people who may not quite be fans of the legend should get something out of seeing this,too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Sometimes everything you need is to walk the line,"To walk the line means either to choose your own way and to devote yourself to it completely, forgetting about everything, or to lose it and lose yourself at the same time. The problem of choice iis the main idea of this film, the choice between the dream of one's life or family. 
The film isn't really dynamic, but it shows the main character, Johny Cash and his story, as a real person, not idolizing him, because he is first of all an interesting personality. In his childhood he couldn't devote himself to music, but as he grew up and the story follows, we get to know that there're only 2 important things in life for him - music and June Carter, who was performing with him, and with whom he fell in love unrequitedly. So the film is about love as well, as Johny was really happy only with June.
The story was actually written by James Keach (a friend of Johny Cash and his family). It took 4 years to make him agree to sell the author's rights, to shoot the film took also 4 years.
The actors who play the main characters were chosen by Johny Cash and June Carter themselves (Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon) an not without a reason, because these actors are very talented ones, and not only actors but singers as well. All musical pieces in the film were sung by them without any help of professional singers; Joaquin Phoenix learned to play the guitar during the shooting.
This film can be an excellent example of a biographical film, and I highly recommend it to all music lovers, fans of Johny Cash or to all people who like the brilliant actor's play and interesting plots.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

It makes perfect sense that Phoenix and Witherspoon have received Academy Award nominations; I'd say that they deserve to win. This movie is a masterpiece in every way.

"Brilliant movie, overshadowed by moments of stupidity","A simply Phenomenal performance from Joaquin Phoenix is the glue that holds this movie together. He truly becomes ""The Man in Black"" in this Oscar nominated role. Reese Witherspoon is great too! In my opinion it wasn't Oscar worthy, but she is an amazing actress per usual. My main problem with this film is the way they portray his first wife Vivian. I don't know a whole lot about Johnny Cash's actual life, but if his wife acted any way like she does it this movie, he didn't divorce her fast enough. She is simply insufferable. Whiny, entitled, and ignorant. Complaining that Cash was trash for not providing for his family, then ragging on him for not giving enough time for his family when he becomes famous. It was ridiculous, corny and made her look like a selfish mega bitch. I would have left her too if she treated me that way. I just don't believe anyone could be that shallow and entitled.

"an excellent romance, but not so good biopic","Walk The Line is a generic biopic about a great country star, Johnny Cash. The storyline is really predictable due to the fact that the film follows the same formula as other movies of that type. Thus, at the beginning we have traumatic childhood, then difficulties in the road to big career, development of the career, problems with drugs and numerous breakdowns and finally redemption, coming back to glory. Throughout the movie I had a feeling that I'm dealing with 2nd part of Ray. The flick, like most of the films which attempts to present the whole life of the figure, is very episodic and does not show thoroughly real dilemmas of an artist or creation of his work (songs in this case). In this respect Capote visibly surpasses Walk the Line. However, the film undoubtedly works as a touching love story. Not only do Jaquin Pheonix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) play great, but there is also a real chemistry between them on the screen. There are also some marvellous scenes in which they sing together on the scene. Nonetheless, in my opinion Felicity Huffman for her superb performance in Transamerica should won the Oscar instead of Reese to whom I took a liking after this flick. Moreover, Mangold efficiently directs and the pacing is good. To sum up, the reception of Walk The Line depends mainly on your expectations. It's an excellent romance, but not so good biopic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Magic,"This is why movies exist. This is movie magic: It's alchemy, something that cannot come true without something unexplainable, and that something must be love. One other ingredient is story. Best stories, the only stories that matter, come from life. Life of human beings. Life of REAL people, LIVING people. And stories of real people don't get written down or made to any form of art too often. The reason is that real people are not too frequently any kind of artists.Artists themselves are not very often what I would call living human beings. In my experience they are many times more or less mentally ""ill"" people, who run away from their lives rather than people who would confront it and live it. Which is of course totally contrary to the idea, that at least I have, about what an artist should be. Personal therapeutic art is a different case, but that is not meant or made to any other person than the patient.But Johnny Cash is a real human being. And I say IS, because in this movie, he lives. I don't know or even care about who got the Oscars, Oscars are sh*t anyway, same as every other prices: Nothing more than politics, if not even less. But Joaquin Phoenix in this movie is something more than an actor: He IS Johnny Cash. If you squint your eyes just a little bit, there he is. And that's a miracle: I really felt like I went to Johnny Cash's living life. I don't remember ever having that feeling in a movie. At least not in ten years or something. And Reese Witherspoon... It's so beautiful.From Mangold I've seen before the movie ""Girl, Interrupted"", which I love (love, love). On the basis of these two movies, I say that Mangold is one of the three most important movie makers active and ALIVE today. I've seen maybe two thousand movies, but this is one of the few that matters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
John and June,"It's funny how Walk the Line spends a lot of time showing Johnny Cash perform, yet it doesn't focus on his music or Johnny Cash as an artist. Instead, it's about his obsession with June Carter, which goes all the way back to his childhood, when he hears her voice on the radio, sees him hit rock bottom despite his succesful career and somehow ends on a high note.A great thing about this movie is that it keeps it real and doesn't idolise him, as many biopics tend to do. The scenes that show his ugly side in all its glory are the most effective and the most memorable, for example the fight with his wife, his collapse on stage or his outburst in the tractor scene.The other crucial factor that makes Walk the Line a hit is the performance of the two leads, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.

Terrific Musical Biography,"""I Walk the Line"" is a great musical biography of Johnny Cash. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I've read criticism of it saying that it is the standard rock star film of battling drugs, etc, but Johnny Cash is anything but your normal star. He commands a respect to this day that very few (maybe Bob Dylan)do. The acting is outstanding on all counts, as Juaquin Phoenix does an amazing job portraying Johnny Cash. Even better is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter; what a terrific, inspiring performance. And of course, the advantage that a musical biography has over other biographical films is the great music, and there is a lot of it: ""I Walk the Line"", ""Ring of Fire"" and several other of Cash's legendary repertoire. The only reason it didn't get a 10 rating is because they downplayed the religious aspect of Johnny Cash's life, and the importance that his Christian faith had in what happened to him. I get tired of movie producers being almost embarrassed to delve into the subject of faith; his faith was a huge part of his life and it shouldn't be brushed aside like this. Otherwise, this film is terrific and I highly recommend it, especially to those who love great music.

The songs are upbeat and vibrant, making the music performances on stage a pleasure to watch. The only one complaint I have is the accent which the actors speak in. It makes the film a little hard to understand, and it is hard to concentrate fully when the film is over two hours long.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Joaquin Pheonix was believable as Johnny Cash,"This is the first time I have actually seen Joaquin .I am an Aussie and have always been a fan of Johnny Cash.I was surprised by Joaquin's age to begin with because he seemed more mature.I think he did a wonderful portrayal of Johnny ,from the dark brooding attitude to the quirky sense of humor that Johnny had.He also seemed to connect with Reese Witherspoon in a way that the relationship seemed real.I've looked at the goofs,but I wasn't looking at the movie for faults,I was just interested in the basic life of Johnny Cash.There were lots of things in the movie that I was not aware of in Johnny's life and if the movie was real to life I thank the people who made it .I also liked the little cameos of the other performers in Johnny's early years as it was a surprise to see who started out at the same time as he did.I will be looking for more Joaquin Pheonix movies as not only is he a good actor ,he's easy on the eyes!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Great performances from the leads, but not much else going for it.","I watched Walk the Line a couple of evenings ago and thought I'd check out the IMDb response to the film and I just want to ask one thing: Has the world gone mad? 8.1/10? Did you all watch the movie and think ""well I liked the singing in it, so that must mean it's one of the best films of all time""? I mean seriously, if it wasn't for great performances from the two leads, is this film really anything more than a mid-afternoon TV Movie? I thought Reese Witherspoon was fantastic and Joaquim Phoenix, despite not really sounding that much like Johnny Cash, was pretty damn good too - but that's all the film has going for it. Remove them and you've got ""Daydream Believers: The Monkees Story"". Nothing wrong with this film - in fact I seem to remember having quite an amusing time watching it stoned at about 3.30 in the afternoon when I was a student (just after I woke up) - but it's not in the top 100 films of all time and neither is ""Walk the Line: The Johnny Cash Story"" It's a ""Well at least that's another two hours of my life enjoyably wasted"" 6 out of 10 at best.

Disappointing and shallow,"Walk the Line is one of those movies that almost everyone likes. So I get labeled as ""harsh"" and difficult to please. Well, maybe I am but the thing is I do understand why this film was successful and why people enjoyed it. Technically, there's nothing to criticize. Witherspoon as June Carter is riveting, giving the southern twang an endearing quality. The music is definitely entertaining. I have to admit that scene with Cash and Carter singing a duet of ""Time's a-Wasting"" is quite memorable. But for me, that's just not enough.This is a movie about the life of a legendary musician, Johnny Cash, played not-so-brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix. Cash's brother dies in an accident at the beginning, and Mr. Cash senior, who favoured the brother, seemed to blame Johnny for his death. A music lover since childhood, Cash struggles to make a career for himself as a songwriter and performer. He's controversial, messed up and in love with Carter. This is enough to describe the remainder of the movie.Now I don't know much about Johnny Cash and his music, but I can't claim I learned any more after watching Walk the Line. Call me difficult but when I see a biographical film, I expect the makers to put in some effort in trying to understand and portray the different dimensions of the personality in question. All I got was that his brother died, his daddy didn't love him and Carter was the only thing keeping him going. I'm just not convinced that this formed the essence of Johnny Cash and his music.And by the way, I don't know why this is a taboo in Hollywood, but I am brave enough to say it: Joaquin Phoenix is not a good actor.

Life changing experience...,"If I didn't see this movie I would never know who Johnny Cash really was. At first I thought this movie will suck because I don't really biographies. They always make it look boring (except the doors) so I was expecting a 2 hour long drama which I will forget very soon. But... after 10 minutes of watching ""Walk the Line"" I was stunned. I couldn't lay my eyes off TV. Songs were awesome, acting was perfect, story was real and there was no single boring moment. You know... those moments when you just go to the bathroom or take something to eat. When the movie ended I was under a lot of impression. I thought about the movie for weeks and of course, Johnny Cash was my new idol. I saw ""Walk the Line"" 2 years ago and I can still watch it every day if I have to. I think this is my top 50 movies of all time which is weird because, as I said, I normally hate this kind of films. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon actually performed all the songs by themselves and it really sounds good. Is there anything else I should say about this movie? I think not. You gotta see it for yourself. This movie could change your life or at least some aspects of your life. Get off the internet and get ""Walk the Line"" as quickly as possible.

Hollywood Does Cash...Right and Wrong,"Walking the Fine Line between Clever and Stupid By Jayson HarsinFrom ""the Man in Black,"" 1971: Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, But is there because he's a victim of the times.I wear the black for those who never read, Or listened to the words that Jesus said, About the road to happiness through love and charity, Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose, In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes, But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back, Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.Thumbs up and down. I was thoroughly entertained by Walk the Line, James Mangold's attempt to be the first cinematic commentary on the recently deceased Johnny Cash. The acting and singing were superb. T. Bone Burnett's musical production is often mesmerizing. But the narrative arc attracts criticism, particularly the reduction of Cash's life to a quest for June Carter and a kind of Oedipal Complex with his father.Multiple melodramatic devices humanize the legend by making him insecure as a boy and a man. But these devices are captive to a kind of Hollywood love story. The choice to focus on Cash's early life is highly reductive and typical of Hollywood screen formulas. In this story, two major forces seem to propel Cash's early life: a love quest for June Carter, the starlet of royal country ilk, and an Oedipal drive to conquer his father. Both drives are located in his early life. In a sense, this narrative choice makes the film a narrow psychological study.Cash is marked by his humble cotton-picking origins, a harsh father, a close and protective older brother, and his love of early country on the radio, where his love for June Carter begins. The early loss of his brother leaves Cash forever struggling with the trauma of losing his best friend and paternal love. The hardworking but emotionally icy father is resentful that God took his eldest and ""best son."" ""You took the wrong son,"" he cries in a poignant scene that forever marks young Johnny's future. A refrain that runs through the film is ""You look like you're going' to a funeral [,John]."" And Cash's response, ""Maybe I am"" is traced to this original event: his brother's death/funeral. Cash is forever going to his brother's funeral.The other major force propelling Cash's life is his love for June Carter. As children, he and his brother hear the girl's beautiful voice as she sings on the radio with her famous family. There the seed of love is planted. Much of the rest of the film suggests Cash's aimless mistakes in career and marriage are a hapless wandering until he finds his fated soul mate and true love, June Carter. It bears some fairytale trappings, since when Cash gets the girl his problems appear to disappear, few as they are in the film--namely, drugs, insecurity, and oedipal hate towards his father. In Hollywood, apparently, all you need is love.Different viewers will have other things to object to in this portrayal. Historical material of a docu-drama always invites comparisons to ""the real thing"" and accusations of infidelity to the real. While Cash is hardly portrayed as an angel, his first wife is portrayed as a 1950s uni-dimensional housewife, desiring all the dreamy accoutrements of upward mobility, ever wistfully searching for that irrecoverable Tupperware party. After weakly opposing Cash's dream to live by the sweat of his guitar, she figures out that what she really wants is a family man and the attention that any kind of spouse deserves. The story may not encourage complete sympathy with Cash in his family relations, but as hero of the film, Cash's familial misdemeanors are easily overlooked and his wife is potentially transformed into a shrewish, jealous bore. June Carter, on the other hand, is portrayed as a strong woman, caring yet determined, and able to reconcile her own choices with the judgments of others.Reducing Cash's life to these two major forces, father and love, can be seen as the cost of generic constraints on mass-circulated films with big stars and budgets. Here one should return to Cash's ""Man in Black"" lyrics, written in 1971. Cash was not a Lee Greenwood; his was a different kind of country music, not easily appropriated by the Republican noise machine. Though he had only had brief stints in jail, he had drug and other problems and identified with those who had transgressed and been punished or who had the misfortune of growing up in cotton fields and without resources many take for granted. The film ends in 1968, and we get an on-screen script that reduces the final 35 years of Cash's life to a footnote: ""June and Johnny lived happily ever after."" Ah, the pleasure of fairy tale closure. Is that all there was to the Man in Black? No, but that's all this narrative has time for.

Walking A Great Line ****,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a beautiful performance as the late Johnny Cash.

Ms. Witherspoon, though adequate in her acting, really has a supporting performance and why she has been nominated in the best actress category is an enigma to me.The picture belongs to Phoenix all the way.

"Same Old, Same Old","""Walk the Line"" is a warmed over version of ""Ray,"" trotted out just in time for Oscar consideration, shrewd timing since the Academy never saw a biopic it didn't like.The problem is that ""Walk the Line"" is inferior to ""Ray"" in just about every way, and I wasn't even a huge fan of the latter picture. If you don't know anything about Johnny Cash, or what it was about his music that makes him such a legendary figure, you won't learn it here. As played by Joaquin Phoenix in a horribly mannered performance, Cash started out his career barely able to function from one day to the next, and never really improved until the love of a good woman (enter June Carter) turned him around. Phoenix's performance is one-note, all mumbled lines and eye-rolling freak out scenes. There's absolutely nothing interesting about Cash in this version of events, and there's no explanation of what it was about him that June Carter was so drawn to. Reese Witherspoon gives the better performance, but the material she's given limits the impact she can make. Johnny and June's relationship is muddled and ambiguous. I could never tell whether they were involved or not until his final freak out scene when he clumsily gets her to agree to marry him (don't even ask me why she'd want to).The biggest tragedy of this movie is that it doesn't provide any insight into what made Cash a genius, or how the demons he was working through influenced the kind of music he wanted to make. Tepid as I thought ""Ray"" was, it at least accomplished that much.I've heard some people say that the performances in ""Walk the Line"" are better than the movie itself. Revise that to read Reese Witherspoon's performance is better than the movie, and I'll agree.Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Joaquin couldn't draw any pity from me even when his character was at the bottom of the barrel. Even Reese's spark seemed to be out as she just went through the motions of the movie.

These roles took talent, they both dressed, acted, and sung exactly like Johnny and June.The film itself is alright, but in my opinion, it's just the performances that took the film to make it so big.

Best of the best!,"Walk the Line is a fantastic success.The main film of the year 2005 is ¬´ Walk the Line ¬ª by the producer James Mangold.
The movie is not only about the life of Johnny Cash, it's about the love in his life.
 
Walk the Line tells about the life of the singer who had to move past the ravages of addiction, the temptations of stardom and other difficulties , in order to become a legendary person.The script here is simply remarkable, every scene was true to life. This movie is also unpredictable , there wasn't a moment where I thought I could predict what anyone was going to say or do next. 
It is a beautiful love story of two people who support and defend one another, despite all the obstacles on their way.
The lovers are here played by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese WitherspoonJoaquin Phoenix is very charismatic actor, that's perfect for the elusive Cash, a quiet figure with a piercing gaze and a deep voice. She's just incredibly charming and feminine. Their transformation is astounding.""Walk the Line"" follows the story line of many other musical biopics, maybe because many careers are the same: Hard times, obscurity, success, stardom, too much money, romantic adventures, drugs or booze, and then love and reaching a more lasting stardom. This story of Johnny Cash's career was well done.It is well known that Phoenix and Witherspoon perform their own vocals in the movie. Their outstanding performances help make it the strongest country-music film in years , their the songs are so perfect.Walk the Line is as good an explanation about role as a musician and star. By showing his flaws as well as his strengths, the film becomes a stirring example of a peculiarly success story, as well as a vivid reminder of the price of fame. The movie shows the bad consequences of bad behavior and the good consequences of good behavior. That it's all true made it even more touching. It is really an inspiring film!
The story line, acting and directing were all excellent.The film is about his search for happiness. This is a special film, more than a biographic it's an emotional masterpiece and one of the best movies for me.

Perfect duet,"Walk the Line is a delightful and plausible biographical music drama of 2005. This movie reveals the life story of the great musician Johnny Cash.

I really liked this musical drama. I enjoy biographical films and this one is inspiring, and the story of John Cash is shown realistically. Joaquin Phoenix is a talented and good actor, and starring in this drama he looked decent and acted gorgeously. The role of talented Cash is extremely complex and contradictory, but Phoenix coped with it with a bang. Reese Witherspoon fascinated me in this movie. She acted so charmingly and cleanly that she even got an Oscar for this role. I liked the duet of these actors and it was nice to watch them together. Walk the Line is a strong, beautiful, and clean film that revealed to us a bright and realistic life of an excellent musician, and it's definitely worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great job... enjoyed it better than I expected!,"I just saw this movie this afternoon, hoping but only partially expecting to really enjoy it. I had heard that it was good from a friend, which was the only reason I bothered to go and see it. And... my friend was completely right!This movie depicts the life (and love) of Johnny Cash. His start, his music, his tours, his dependency on pills, and his long time friendship with and love of June Carter. The parts were played played and sung by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Did someone, or everyone, else know that Reese had such a good voice?? I admit to being rather impressed by her vocal performance in the role. Her acting matched. Witty, intelligent, and real.Joaquin... was pretty fabulous. He has a great voice, and his acting was superb. I can't imagine that was an easy part to play. He did it sometimes disturbingly well, with respect to the drugs.The story is good. It's filmed pretty well. The beginning was a little boring, I thought, but not bad. The end felt very slightly disappointing to me. Wanting *more* is usually a good thing, but this time I think there could have been a little more. I don't know, that's really open to interpretation.I can't say I have ANY idea if the contents of the movie are what *really* happened. I knew next to nothing about Johnny Cash going in. I'd never listened to his music; I wouldn't have thought it was my *thing*. After watching this movie, I am definitely going to have to get some of his albums.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.

BioDreck,"This is a genuinely dreadful film, overwrought, turgid and shot entirely in close-up, like some tarted-up TV Lifetime biopic. The performances range from the bizarre (Johnny's dad) to the overly moist (the leads). Except for the Folsom scenes that bookend the film, and the scene that has Sam Phillips explaining to Johnny what makes a hit record, the movie rings false. Worse, it makes being Johnny Cash look like, well, no fun at all. It staggers from tragedy to tragedy, pausing on occasion to wipe its nose or trot out another cardboard Legends of Rock cutout (Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis). Why has this mostly played out, waxworks genre suddenly become so fashionable? Am I the only one who experiences a genuine sense of disconnect seeing someone play Katherine Hepburn play Alice Adams? Performances become impersonations, at a time when the David Steinbergs and the Frank Gorshins (RIP) have long since vanished from the scene. Playing a Truman Capote, a Ray Charles or a Johnny Cash, at a time when most of us have a fairly recent, living memory of these celebrities requires a suspension of disbelief that I, frankly, don't find, for the most part, to be worth the candle. We await reassessments of THE GREAT CARUSO or NIGHT AND DAY (sorry- forgot the recent DE-LOVELY).

A must-see biopic for music fans,"I expect that one of the hardest roles for an actor today must be to play a recently deceased legend. There's little room for error since that person's image is still embedded in the public's consciousness.In ""Walk the Line"", Joaquin Phoenix does an admirable job of portraying the incomparable 'Man in Black', Johnny Cash. The film-makers apparently realized that imitation of mannerisms alone would be insufficient so they went with an actor who exudes the same kind of seething intensity. Reese Witherspoon's performance is assured as well and, thankfully, brings her talents to a picture that's actually worth seeing. The supporting cast is mostly unspectacular, though Robert Patrick is memorable as Cash's father.The direction is solid and produces some memorable images but the focus is clearly on the narrative, which is fine with me.

Fine performances in solidly entertaining Johnny Cash biopic,"This is a solidly entertaining biopic of country singer Johnny Cash. The story is slightly predictable but both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are good and even sing their own songs. The film effectively charts Cash's entire career from his (MINOR SPOILERS) youth on a farm, his years in the Air Force, his rise, addiction to prescription medication, and eventual redemption.My favorite segment was Cash's relationship with his father. This could have been expanded. While fans of Cash's music will love this film, even non-fans will enjoy the film.Overall 7/10",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Walks a fine line between success and failure,"Walk The Line is the latest Oscar-baiting biopic, the subject in this case being twenty-five years in the life of Johnny Cash (played as an adult by Joaquin Phoenix). Naturally, his rise to the peak of his success as a recording artist is chronicled, but additionally, his relationships with his father (Robert Patrick), first wife (Ginnifer Goodwin) and fellow band member June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) play a prominent part in this tale, as well as his personal battle against the pills.A really, really good biopic could have been made out of this. And it should have been. So why hasn't it been? After all, the actors play their parts so well (more on them later) and the music in the film is so good (more on that later too). Alas, something is lacking in the script department.An uplifting tour through Johnny Cash's life will certainly satisfy most viewers. But as a Cash novice, I wanted something of more substance. Something that would help us understand Cash's character more, rather than just routinely showing us what he did. Director James Mangold not only fails to develop the characters convincingly enough (yeah, we see the two leads' families, but little else) but also struggles to retain hold of a meandering narrative that sometimes bores. Some emotional scenes don't hit the mark, and Mangold has a tendency to hammer home the few rather banal messages that his script has for us. (When watching the film, I thought ""Alright James, we get it!"" at least twice.) Yes, Cash fans. I do realise that you may not notice most, if not all, of the things I complained about above. But we have to take all viewers into account here.Anyway, onto the positives...Joaquin Phoenix has established himself as one of the decade's most dependable actors. Four films he has starred in (Gladiator, Quills, Buffalo Soldiers, Hotel Rwanda) have been among my favourite films of their respective year of release. It's somehow ironic that Walk The Line will not be one of those, for his portrayal of Johnny Cash is definitely one of his better portrayals. It's especially enjoyable to watch him perform Cash's material on stage (and yes, he did sing the songs himself). Unfortunately, the script doesn't allow him to inhabit Cash's character entirely, and that may well cost him the Oscar.As June Carter, Reese Witherspoon brings her usual charm back to the screen. Thankfully, there are no traces of Elle Woods in this down-to-earth portrayal. She even manages to flesh her character out a little near the end of the film. It's not quite an Oscar-worthy performance, but it is very impressive nonetheless. She and Phoenix help to keep you almost consistently interested in the proceedings, and the supporting cast capably assist them.Finally...I must mention the music. The decision to hire O Brother, Where Art Thou?'s composer, T-Bone Burnett, was inspired. Don't be surprised to find yourself humming some of the songs you hear after you have seen the film.The above elements are enough to make Walk The Line a watchable film, if not a particularly inspired one. One thing it has definitely done is make me interested in finding out more about the life, times and music of Johnny Cash. I'm sure it may do the same for others who are relatively new to Cash's material.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash","This biographical film is devoted to the life story of the legendary country singer Johnny Cash and his second wife, June Carter. The youth of Cash, born in 1932 in Arkansas, was overshadowed by the tragic death of his elder brother and the disdainful attitude towards him by his father, who considered him to be a bad son. The future singer and musician passed military service in Germany in the ranks of the US Air Force. In 1954 he married Vivian, who gave birth to his daughter, and in 1955, at the age of 23, released his first hit ""Cry, Cry, Cry"". Soon Cash went on a tour of the US along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and June Carter, whom he hopelessly dreamed for ten years. Critical moments in the life of Cash were accompanied by his addiction to amphetamine and alcohol. In 1968, Cash and Carter became husband and wife and lived together until the death of June in May 2003. Cash died in September of the same year.
It is interesting that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon perform all the songs in the film. Six months before the shooting began the actors had studied vocal music. They also took lessons on playing musical instruments - guitar and harmonica respectively.
Joaquin Phoenix impressed with his play. I was surprised when I found out that Reese Witherspoon had received an Oscar for this film, but he did not. I certainly love Reese and all that, but even in this tape, it fades in comparison with the heartfelt and accurate game of Joaquin Phoenix! He played brilliantly. He also sang very similar to the original. Reese Witherspoon, sang in a different way, but also very good. I was even surprised that she had such a good voice.
Music! Music and the madness of music!
That's what I saw, heard and felt throughout the 90 minutes of the film. I saw it, and I felt it, because the scenery was penetrated in music. All this story was mixed up on it. The dynamics of rock 'n' roll was replaced by the thoughtfulness of the blues, the rolling of country music. And in all this was the meaning of the told love story, which at that time saved the singer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Good movie, but somewhat hollow","I've seen quite a few of these music bio-pics. In comparison, this one is better than most, but certainly not the best.There is a large 'buzz' around the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. But like the movie itself, it rings a little hollow.It is more like this movie is a good career move for each actor than great performances.Joaquin does a pretty amazing job at capturing Johnny Cash's sound and style. And I was surprised at how good Reese sounded.That might be the problem with the movie. June Carter was not a great singer. The fact that Hollywood decided to remove her very strong country twang, also removed what made her a respected country artist - her honesty.It is true that Nashville has turned it's back on this 'Mountain Folk' country sound, but that was not the case in the 60s. So this June Carter ends up sounding more like Shania than any female country artist from that era.But in the end, go see this movie. It is much better than most of the drivel that Hollywood has been putting out this last year.But if you want to see some great music bio-pics, rent 'Lady Sings The Blues' or 'The Buddy Holly Story'",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Walk The Line,I liked this movie a lot. Before watching this movie i didn't really know who Johnny Cash was.

fun but overlong and simplistic,"Given the lousy films out there this year, this picture is far better than most. It does not, however, stand up to last year's ""Ray"", which is strongly resembles. Nor does the film touch on the particularly interesting thing about Johnny Cash, the spiritual duality of his nature. Cash was was strongly Christian but was open about the fact that he had committed all of the seven deadly sins. His humanity came from his humility about his own shortcomings. His core Christianity is barely touched upon here. Actual incidents from Cash's life are totally fictionalized. A strong story point is made of the fact that Cash's father blamed him for the death of his brother. A reading of Cash's most recent autobiography indicates this was never the case. Cash seems to appreciate and revere the hardships experienced by his poor, hard working father. Yet the film continues to portray Cash's hard scrabble parents, the source of his authentic ""country"" background, as simple- minded, cruel and cold. It is no wonder that June Carter's daughter walked out of a recent screening of the film in anger. The final resolution of the story is weak. The film takes the position that Cash beat his addiction quickly once he won the heart of June. In ""Walk the Line"", she saves him as she triumphantly chases his dealer from the property. The family of any addict can attest that a cure is never that easy. And in reality, Cash continued to struggle with drugs for much of his life. Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which is excellent, gives the film a gravitas it would otherwise lack.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A load of crap on par with The Doors,"Lets take the myth and create a story so shallow and trite that you can't help but think 'Why was this movie made?"" Mr. Phoenix is a mediocre actor and unsuited for such a complex character as Johnny Cash-- First and foremost:I don't care that he didn't sound like Cash-he never got the vocal inflection. He sang as if he never listened to more than a song or two... Johnny Cash was as much about phrasing as the depth of his baritone(neither which Phoenix had). Remember when Kurt Russell played Elvis-his acting skills made you forget that he didn't resemble the king-Mr. Phoenix has just the opposite problem. Just because the physical resemblance is there, doesn't mean you make a convincing Johnny Cash. On the plus side-Reese Witherspoon did a fine, believable job as June Carter-except that towards the end she didn't look old enough (June had three years on Johnny).This movie is on par with Oliver Stones The Doors: All myth and little substance. As a side note I immediately noticed Johnny taking the cigarette out of Luthers mouth (and the irony of his future death)",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
joseph money paces the hash,"Despite what my title may imply, I truly enjoyed this movie, i was aware that Joaquin Phoenix had awesome depth in his performances along with overall great acting abilities, but man this movie caught me off guard. First i think it's awesome that Phoenix did his own covers for all of the music, it helps immerse in the performance, hearing his voice and not a cut in of Mr. Cash's voice. I quite enjoy the depiction of Cash here as someone who has done both good and bad. I think his wife could have been portrayed better though.

I know that biopics usually are glamorised to a certain degree but this was differently one of the best biopics I have seen . With Mr.Phoneix acting out the role with style , you just love it when he comes out on stage and says HELLO - MY NAME IS JOHNNY CASH !!! Hats of to him ! , the film kept me interested all the way the through - well just about it I missed the last few minutes , Reese Witherspoon does another fine job of playing June Crater she really does provide some good laughs . T-1000 Robert Patrick does a fine job of playing Cash's dad and the strained relationship between father and son was something that I found I could relate to .

Makes you want to listen to Johnny Cash all the time,I usually didn't listen to Johnny Cash but after i saw this film i downloaded his album and never regret it. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give not just Oscar worthy performances but cinema history performances. The film's story line is pretty simple but still very interesting. Not only is their very impressive acting but incredible singing especially by Reese Witherspoon. The film only covers a short period of his childhood on when his brother died in an accident and a short period of before he became a big star. Most of the film is covered on when he became addicted to drugs and fell in love with June Carter even though he was married and had two children. It also covers his rivalry with his father Ray Cash(Robert Patrick) when he blamed Johnny for Johnny's brothers death. The film is great one of the best film since 2000 and clearly film you would easily find on a 500 top movies.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Phoenix is Mr. Oscar!,"Walk the Line Let's all sit here for one second and discuss the formula in making a biopic about a legend. First of all, why would anyone want to make a film about someone? Well the obvious reasons would include popularity. For example Ray Charles had a huge fan base that included people from the older generation and even a select few from the newer. Johnny Cash's popularity didn't string some much up to urban areas or any coast cities but pretty much there are a good number of people that heard of the name Johnny Cash. The next part of the formula has to be the actual story of the person; the struggle to the top, the origins of the person, an overcoming such as drug addiction or an abusive relationship, (i.e. ""What's Love Got to Do With It?"") and a settling ending to their story even if they are still living. The film which follows Cash's early childhood up to his engagement to June Carter gives all these elements of a biopic and that's exactly where this film fell short.Director James Mangold whom many people have never heard prior to Walk the Line had a true opportunity to shine and show us all something that had never been seen before. The film starts and ends very strongly but there is a true sense of hollowness in the center of the film. Not too sure yet of what it is, could be the screenplay or even just the story of Cash himself but I was really eager to get the ball rolling again about an hour in. Twenty minutes pass and ball really rolled. It's a bit of a random upset and not too sure if I was just getting distracted but it is what it is.Now!...............the performances! Oh my god, can we give Mr. Joaquin Phoenix an Oscar! This man truly is talented. After being a true supporting player for the past couple of years he has made a great transition into a leading man. This movie is all about Phoenix and how he embodies this man. I have to do it; the comparison of this performance to Jamie Foxx's performance in last year's Oscar winning role in ""Ray."" The difference is that Phoenix really elevated the material and I get he got that from somewhere not on the set or watching a video or any meeting with Cash if there was one. Phoenix takes the performance to a brand new level and at any point do I ever feel like it's a mimic which is what I felt Foxx did. Phoenix gave so much emotion from his speeches to his singing to his rapid eye movements. Phoenix is the true frontrunner at the Oscars as of now.Reese Witherspoon has finally lived up to expectations. For the past four or five years I've heard a lot of comparisons to Julia Roberts. I never believed it because Julia is one of a kind but Witherspoon truly is talented. Her singing is beautiful and gives a jaw-dropping performance as June Carter. As of the rumor going around saying that she will win Oscar, it can happen but due to the lack of contention in the category. But if Joan Allen is nominated which I feel she will be, she will most likely win Oscar. Five nominations and no win along with losing to newbie Witherspoon won't really sit well with voters and fellow Oscar lovers. But she is a lock for nomination. (I hate saying lock because academy does stupid stuff all the time.) The supporting cast is perfect as well ranging from Dallas Roberts to overbearing father Ray Cash played exquisitely by Robert Patrick to the suffering first wife of Cash, Vivian, played by Ginnifer Goodwin who can give you pains in your stomach because she makes you hate her so much. A great ensemble I must say.Walk the Line is a great experience and can get the best picture nomination that people are predicting but it WILL NOT win the top prize. Nothing too spectacular about it and there's so much left to be seen. I'm walking the line in including this in my top five of the year so far.

"A feel-good, entertaining, and likable biopic that chronicles the life of the late Johnny Cash.","Walk the Line is an entertaining and likable film in the tradition of good biopics for the awards season. This time, it is about the late country singer, Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix). The film chronicles the man in black who grew up in a flawed household. His brother died when he was young and his father was an alcoholic. Later, he joined the Air Force and then got married to a woman named Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin). He becomes a salesman but his mind was always on music, because well ¬ñ that was what he was raised on. The music he wrote about during the Air Force gave his success in an audition for a record company. The music was far from the gospel music he was raised on but was inspired by prisoners and inmates, based on a film he watched about Folsom Prison. On tour, he meets the flighty June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) whom he falls in love with even though they are both married to other people.This film is easy to follow, understand, and adore. Even though the characters are flawed, they are likable. For me, likable characters technically make for a likable film and that is what Walk the Line is. Even though there are scenes where it shows the darker sides of Cash through his time in jail cells and drug taking, the film honors him Hollywood style rather than really make him seem like a bad person. His mistakes seem minor to the film's whole and even June, who Cash falls in love with during his tour with her while being married, seems sensible (I swear, if this was any other film I would say, ""You've a family at home!). Walk the Line seems to imply that these are lovebirds that met each other at the wrong place and the wrong time and they belong together ¬ñ and eventually they did get together. The film is almost more about their relationship than Cash's life, but that is really okay because every face of this film is likable ¬ñ from the obvious Elvis impostor (who plays Elvis) to scenes that probably should be brutal ¬ñ we seem to be enjoying ourselves.The performances in this film are pretty good. Phoenix has always been a great actor (see Gladiator) and he portrays the later singer well. Even though I don't find Witherspoon that deserving of an Oscar, she was good here too, not failing to meet expectations. There is also Goodwin, who turns in a respectful performance as Cash's first wife, Vivian. But something didn't really click for me with the performances ¬ñ they seem to be following too much of the script's likable-factor because sometimes the characters seem like they are from some fantasy land from the middle of nowhere. (Yes, I complain that the characters from The Last Picture Show are too shallow and now I'm complaining that the characters in Walk the Line are too likable.) The showy thing about this film is that Phoenix and Witherspoon have great chemistry with each other, and in this story, that is almost all that matters.Nonetheless, it is a likable, entertaining, enjoyable, delightful and good film. Phoenix and Witherspoon both sing quite well considering they are both not professional singers. I have a great fondness for this film even though at times it seem like a very tacky biopic that probably borrowed some ideas from 2004's Ray. I think I liked Walk the Line more than I liked Brokeback Mountain (in other words, I would of rather seen Walk the Line receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination rather than Brokeback Mountain). Good film, good cast, good music ¬ñ what more can I say?",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Well acted but I expected more...,"I was a late blooming Cash fan and did not fully appreciate his talents until his death. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, and both Juaqin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have you believing without a doubt that they are Johnny Cash and June Carter. The mannerisms and their chemistry work well throughout the movie. And even a day later from watching the movie I still am amazed at their singing skills. They nailed it! Where I was slightly disappointed was in either the writer, director, and/or the cinematographer's ability to really capture a moment with heightened intensity or gravity. For example, there is a moment of desperation where Cash is at a bank to cash a check, but there is not a feeling of desperation to the viewer at that moment. I compare this to a similar scene in Cinderella Man when Russell Crowe is requesting government relief and the viewer feels the impact there. It was never effectively communicated why essential elements occurred. What pivotal moment led him into the drugs? There were enough scenes to depict a problem but you never see it evolve. Did June have the same feelings as Cash for marriage? The movie implies she gave in to the proposal to some respect. There should have been an intimate scene between June and a secondary character to affirm her feelings. I guess the movie just has a feeling of going on a nice ride, but it never ratchets the emotional content from one scene to another. And while fiction, it would have been good to see a moment where the 'passing of the heart baton' occurs between his first wife and June. Maybe fictional, but it was effective in Sound of Music. I suspect that the creation team was trying to adhere to fact as much as possible per the family's advisory and may have been limited in taking some license in the story. It is an enjoyable movie regardless, and as much as a Cash fan as I am, I cannot see this winning Movie of the Year. With that all said, I hope they consider a 'sequel' to cover the remainder of their lives together. There is plenty of material, from the television shows, events in Jamaica, the Highwaymen, the lifetime achievement award in country music, the detachment from the industry, the efforts with Ruben, and then the final days together. This would be a totally different movie, but the actors would be perfect to carry on the line...",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Fantastic movie in so many ways!,"There are so many great things about this movie which tells the story of Johnny Cash's career and, more importantly, his poignant decades-long relationship with June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular. He deserves (and has received) much praise for this singing in this movie but once again, he shows what a gifted actor he is, displaying a broad range of emotion from depression and guilt and self-hatred to tenderness and deep love. Reese Witherspoon brings June Carter to life. Like Phoenix, her singing does the role justice but she also capture's June Carter's playfulness and natural showmanship. And she too portrays the complex emotions unfolding in this unusual love story. The secondary characters are excellent as well, especially Johnny's father and his wife. I've watched this movie three times since it came out in 2005 and it still keeps me engaged every minute. A wonderful tribute to two great singers and a beautiful love story. It made me feel sad to think that there are generations who might not ever know their music. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
An entertaining yet often formulaic biopic.,"Although musicals are not my speciality, 'Walk the Line' had a certain allure to it that made me want to witness the rise of one of the worlds most all-time well known musicians through the medium of film. What was odd that it turned out the film didn't really play like a musical and managed to end up like a romance/fairytale story. But this wasn't a bad thing.I really liked the use of diegetic sound in the film. That means the sounds and, more importantly; the music, were actually in the film resulting in the fact we could hear them just as well as the characters could and this played an important part in witnessing Johnny Cash's journey. The music on the radio which plays a big part later on, (or more importantly, the person singing it), the rough sound of the bands making their own records in a store followed by the shutting of a door in Cash's face giving off a sense that he can hear his music on the record but it's just a little out of reach and hard to get to and the way he rehearses his songs whilst in the army are all good, early examples of Cash and his tendency to give music and sound a priority in life.What also adds to this is the early changes of era. We go through a couple of decades in about five year bursts and each time, the setting and the music changes somewhat. This gives a good feeling of travel and suggests Cash's character is on quite a journey.Along with the music, the other thing I mentioned was the romance element. Because this is a life story, a marriage or a relationship is bound to come along at some point and the film deals with these relationships (in fact, with most character's relationships with each other) in an entertaining way. Each relation is pushed to an absolute limit. Cash's constant lust to get married to June and the way he shows her up a few times is pretty awkward viewing and if you don't know how the story ends, it's fascinating watching them all react in the slow, awkward way in which they do. What's also good is that well into the marriage, there are certain cliff-hangers we are left on, leaving doubt as to whether each character will love one another anymore.It's also interesting how the actual musical performances advance the plot. The relationships growing on screen and Cash's problems are two of the things highlighted during these scenes and they work well.Although these good things inject the film after every twenty minutes or so, they're not enough to stop some glaring items that bring the film down. These occur every now and again but the most obvious is when our hero, Johnny, settles down with married life which is, coincidentally, when the film looses a lot of energy as it stops for a breather. There's also a bit of an obvious 'protagonist's failure' when he seems to be loosing his battle with his drink and drug problem. It seemed like a bit of an obvious 'lowest point' before he miraculously came back for his last performances, especially at the jail.Although sometimes frustrating and if you can look past the fact Reece Witherspoon's character doesn't seem to age in the film, there's a good chance you'll like this interesting and sometimes entertaining biopic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Dragging The Line . . . .,"Remembering all the praise this movie received when it came out, I was surprised to see it was actually nothing more than a dull, dragging film about a depressed drug addict with daddy issues. Even worse, Joaquin Phoenix did not remind me of Johnny Cash for one second. Did he not watch any TV shows with Mr. Cash in them? Any interviews? Even the ""Columbo"" episode where he was the guest star? They would have been better off if they got a Johnny Cash impersonator to star in this movie.The film also didn't even touch on the fact that Johnny Cash divorced his first wife possibly because she looked black. (Watch the 2020 documentary ""My Darling Vivian""). He knew his country fans would not accept the idea of him being married to a black or part-black woman. (She was Italian and lived white all her life, but later DNA testing done by one of her daughters revealed African DNA.) No, in this movie, she is as white as white can be.Johnny Cash was an intelligent man with an edge. In this movie, no intelligence whatsoever comes through, and the only time he shows real edge is when he's performing for prisoners. How Hollywood! The glorification of a drug addict with daddy issues, who identifies with those locked up, and who is ""saved"" from self-destruction by a woman who will always rescue him. Only watch this movie if that's the type of pathetic story you like. I'm now going to have to go look at pictures of Johnny Cash so I can get Joaquin Phoenix's face out of my mind!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Portrait of an artist's journey and his great love,"""Walk the Line"" is the story of Johnny Cash, and it's based on two autobiographies of the great singer. Its stars are Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Patrick, Ginnifer Goodwin and Dallas Roberts. The story begins with Cash (Phoenix) contemplating an electric saw at Folsom Prison as he flashes back to what brought him there. The flashback brings the viewer full circle: through Johnny's young life with his family, who are cotton pickers; the horrific death of his brother; the resentment of his father who yells ""The wrong son died."" Cash, absent from the scene when his brother died, carried feelings of guilt around for years afterward. The film continues with Cash's military life, his first guitar, the beginning of his song writing, an early marriage, children, the odd jobs he did while waiting to make it as a singer; his audition with Sam Phillips who tells him, ""I can't sell gospel"" and Cash's singing of his own music; a back-breaking tour schedule and the meeting of his long-time idol, the vivacious, talented June Carter, already well known with her family on the circuit; alcohol, drugs, infidelity, his great love for June who is his rock, and finally, redemption.Thanks to superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who do their own singing and play their own instruments, ""Walk the Line"" soars, keeping the viewer absorbed in the life of this incredibly talented man throughout. Sam Phillips' unique ability to spot a superstar is unparalleled - Cash was his first discovery after Elvis. Early photographs of Cash at Sun Records show a thin man with a shy smile and 5 o'clock shadow at the beginning of his success. That beautiful baritone voice that sounded like it had endured life's tortures, the constant wearing of black, his songs that spoke to America, made him an icon. Predictably, success was hard to handle - there were women, there was exhaustion on the tour - so there were uppers and alcohol. And there was June, the bright light at the end of his black tunnel.This is first and foremost a great love story. It could have been a run of the mill biopic. Instead, it's beautifully directed by James Mangold, who gives great attention to detail and atmosphere and keeps the story going. Reese Witherspoon deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal of June Carter. Tiny, energetic, and strong, she's like a magnet for the viewer. All eyes are on June with her sunny smile. Reese's accent is perfect since she's from New Orleans - it becomes part of her character instead of being a distraction. Though petite, she looms taller than Cash.Joaquin Phoenix is a fantastic Cash. What else can be said - it's nice to have a great June, but there's no movie without a great Johnny. He's very convincing throughout Cash's pain and struggles. One thing that is impressive is Phoenix's use of his energy. He would somewhat underplay and when it came time for Cash to lose his temper - WOW - it really hits the viewer and is a great demonstration of Cash's volatility. The actor actually pulled the sink out of the wall in an unscripted moment in one of the scenes.X-Files star Robert Patrick has a nice role here as Cash's father, and he's excellent as a violent man who shuts down after the death of his child and carries resentment with him wherever he goes. The little scene at the end of the film is a wonderful moment.I had only two complaints about this film. One, it ran just a little too long. The second thing is something I could be wrong about and probably am. One of Elvis' band gives Cash uppers while both he and Presley are on tour in the mid-'50s. It is my understanding from Peter Guarlnick's fantastic book, ""Last Train to Memphis"" that Elvis didn't start on uppers until he was in the army having to do night duty. It was then that he also noticed it helped his weight.Minor complaints about a brilliant film. Highly, highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Good but unfaithful,"Let me get this right out there - I am a Johnny Cash fan. So there are two aspects of this movie that are important to me: 1) Is it a faithful biopic about the man? 2) Is it a good entertaining movie? Look - I can live with this film as a great movie that tells a compelling story. The performances by the two leads are absolutely credible and at times they just blow you away.I really enjoyed this film. It is dark in parts, it does a good job at hinting at the wild man in Johnny Cash without turning him into a villain or anything, and June Carter Cash is portrayed as just a wonderful woman (and I am sure that she was).However - you do have to understand that there is artistic license here to make this stuff fit for cinema.The film is relentlessly unfair to Johnny Cash's first wife. Vivian (his first wife) has been described as devoted to her husband, supportive of his music, and faithful throughout their time together. She was with Johnny throughout all the hard times of financial struggle, they had two kids together, and according to most sources they had a loving happy marriage. Had Cash not become the icon and the star that he did, that marriage probably would've held firm. In the film Vivian is portrayed as a woman who is never happy, who nags her husband for more, as possessive, as jealous and materialistic. It also suggests that Vivian criticised Johnny's music, undermined him, and tore down his dream.In reality Vivian was supportive, hardworking, loyal and celebrated his love of music. I think Johnny Cash would be the first person to say that his own behaviour, his fame, his abuse of drugs, his time on the road, and his infidelity were unfair on Vivian.Johnny Cash and Vivian Cash were married 12 years before they divorced, although it seems that this film trivialises that and just wants to treat her as a mistake that happened before June Carter arrived.Let's be perfectly honest here June Carter really struggled with her conscience when it came to loving Johnny Cash. When they got together he was a very bad man - a drug addict, and a man with a wild and unpredictable temper. He got banned from the Grand Ole' Opry for smashing all the footlights. June herself was a married woman (twice previously) and having a religious background wrote 'Ring of Fire' to express how she felt about Cash - she thought she was going to hell.I'm pretty sure that Johnny Cash would have portrayed either his relationship with Vivian nor his relationship with June in such a lopsided way. Nor do I think that Cash would've portrayed himself as such a victim when it came to the drugs.Other scenes are made to fit the mood and the mojo of the film. For example when Cash saw Sam Phillips for the first time at Sun Records he didn't get signed and they didn't make a record.Phillips did warn Cash off gospel music (saying that he couldn't sell it) but Cash certainly didn't play 'Folsom Prison Blues' to him. The track that caught Sam's attention was the far less incendiary (and more duke box friendly) 'Hey Porter'.When Phillips did hear 'Folsom Prison Blues' he wasn't convinced by it immediately and didn't really look at putting it out until 'Cry Cry Cry' was done.What the film doesn't really reflect is that Cash didn't just write those dark moody tracks - he wrote chart friendly commercial stuff too, like 'Get Rhythm' and so on.You get the idea.Anyway - it's a superb film, even if it isn't a completely sincere telling of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

great!,Walk the line was a great film. In my opinion this movie is more about Johnny Cash's love life rather than his actual life. Regardless it is still a good movie. There wasn't one part that I found boring. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job playing Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon did a great job playing June Carter. They both a good chemistry with each other which made the film more believable. I liked the costume design a lot. A lot of what Johnny Cash was wearing in the movie I would wear. Also I enjoyed the scenes whenever they played on tour. The songs are really good. I didn't know Cash had a pill addiction but thanks to Walk the Line I know that now. I also didn't know Cash had a wife before he got with June Carter. This movie taught me a bit more about Johnny Cash.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
This is how biopics should be made.,"Not only is Johnny Cash's personal and public story a captivating one, but also this biopic wonderfully manages to capture that true essence of a man who was very distinctive in style and voice. Joaquin Phoenix cleverly approached this difficult role in a manner no one but him could have done. The circumstances which surrounded both Johnny and Joaquin dealt with tragic losses of family members, so Joaquin knew a thing or two about how to convey Johnny's tortured soul. But Phoenix is only half of this film, the other is Reese Whiterspoon playing his wife and partner, June Carter Cash, in an incomparable performance, completely worthy of her Oscar win.A very truthful portrait of Johnny Cash's life and her romantic story with June Carter, not only shown through dialogue but also in musical performances where they both do justice to the original interpreters, of course Joaquin and Reese sing with their own voice which is always a huge merit and specially when done right as they did.Definitely one of the best biopics out there, if you haven't seen it's a must.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Better than ""Ray""........and that amounts to SUPERB","When making the inevitable comparison between Johnny Cash and Ray Charles, everybody talks about the obvious things ¬ñ deprived childhood, rise to stardom, roller-coaster career (and life) due largely to drug addiction. The most uncanny similarity, however, is that how many people, musical celebrity or otherwise, have suffered the death of a brother and, what's more, been BLAMED for it?When it comes to the respective movies that depict the lives of these two musical giants, there are some differences, two of which I like to particularly mention. First, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own singing playing Johnny Cash and June Carter while Jamie Foxx lip-synced Ray Charles' sound track. (Kevin Spacey, by the way, also did his own singing in ""Beyond the sea"" instead of using Bobby Darren's sound track). In addition, ""Walk the line"" has something that ""Ray"" does not ¬ñ a love story. Mainly for these two reasons, I give an edge to ""Walk the line"" but will not forget to add that ""Ray"" is also a first-rate movie.I also like ""Walk the line"" better for a third (albeit not as important) reason ¬ñ its straightforward narration. ""Ray"" employs more flashback, as well as a ""fantasy"" sequence. ""Walk the line"", on the other hand, takes a very common (but not necessarily bad) approach - starting from a significant point in the protagonist's life, it utilizes a motif (an electric saw in this case) to move back to the very beginning. Then it's simple, linear narration going forward to where the movie started, and then follow through to the end. If you have a strong enough script and a good story to tell, that's all you need, in fact all that you SHOULD have, lest you distract the viewers' focus and emotional correlation with the protagonists.While we all have our Brokeback Mountain in our heart (quoting Director Ang Lee), Johnny Cash's burden was the ""Boromir/Faramir syndrome"", which a LOTR fanatic will immediately understand. If not, this is about a father who plays favoritism with his children (to the extreme extent of lamenting ""losing the wrong child"", in both cases), and Johnny is caught at the wrong side on the tilted balance. The other inner devil he faced was the frustration in not having his love for June Carter returned (in his perception), not fully appreciating Carter's predicaments. Although they were eventually both divorced from their respective spouses, the social pressure of Deep South Christianity was just too much for Carter to turn a blind eye to.Long repression gave Cash his explosive temperament while unfulfilled love finally drove him to drug addiction. But the moviemaker have not neglected to show us the child in him, as in the scene when going fishing with Carter, he playfully tries to balance the fishing rod on one finger. But in another scene ten minutes later, we see him smashing everything in sight, including a wash basin, plumbing and all.The love story is wonderfully told, balancing Cash's consuming passion against Carter's sensible restraint but steadfast devotion. The story of the rock music giant is just as wonderful, with Phoenix's splendid singing that Cash would have been proud of. Then when we combine the love story and the music together, in the legendary Cash/Carter duets, we begin to understand why these two singers feel the way they do about each other. When they sing together, they are at once in an intimate world all of their own and also a musical universe that they share with the audience, and it's such a joy to behold (and hear).We have the two absolutely best actors taking us into the inner world of Johnny Cash and June Carter. Phoenix brings to life on the giant screen every small nuance of Cash's emotions, be it subtle or explosive. The very first moment she appears, Witherspoon captures the essence of June Carter who has been on stage since 4, with her witty playful public persona springing instantly to life the moment the spotlight is on. But watch for that very brief shot showing Carter, after introducing Cash to the audience, standing behind the curtain watching him tenderly, almost stoically ¬ñ June Carter the real person. Then you'll understand why although this is Johnny Cash's story, she should win the Oscar. He should too, but is, most unluckily, pitched again a guy called Philip Seymour Hoffman, in a movie called ""Capote"".",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
No Orange Blossom Special~no Boy Named Sue??,"How can they possibly make a Johnny Cash song without ""Orange Blossom Special"" the song that had that famous harmonica sequence and Johnny's most famous line, ""I don't care if I do die, do die, do die..."" And then there is no ""A Boy Named Sue"" probably one of his popular hits.I just can't help wonder if they might do a sequel with all the success the movie has received.Both leading actors do a tremendous job playing the characters. I would have never expected Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon to make these characters practically their own while still seeming like the real actual people.Excellent movie except for the things it's missing.I am also stunned at some of the deleted scenes that should have been left in the movie.

"""I am telling you this is the right time....""","Such a great movie.It depicts the life of Johnny Cash.The acting is superb and believable. Excellent performances from Phoenix and Witherspoon. I found that Goodwin's performance was not as good, but I am generally not a fan of hers. And the rest of the performances were excellent, so it makes up for it. The stand-out performances were definitely the 2 main characters plus John's father. Nearly perfect acting in my opinion.As for the cinematography aspect of the film, everything is perfect except the audio, which is not terrible per se, but it goes up and down, sometimes the dialogue is too loud, or too quiet, most of the time it is perfectly fine, but it varies throughout. I love the soundtrack, the visuals were great.As for the entertainment level, this movie was never boring. It gets straight to the point from the very beginning. No hour long opening credits which I appreciate. It was very fun to watch, equally as emotional and important as it was entertaining, similarly to ""Ray"" (2004, I wrote a review for that too (excellent as well)). The movie is 2 hours and 16 minutes and it felt like 90 minutes. And I was genuinely sad when it ended, I just wanted to keep watching it. It is not a movie where you are constantly checking how much time is left. It goes by very quickly. Very entertaining.It is also very emotional. Very sad, very dark, very significant. There are a few tearjerker scenes, and you don't necessarily have to be a wuss to tear up at them (unlike some Liam Neeson action movies), it was emotionally significant.As for the realism, (after research), I found it very accurate. A lot of the events in the film actually happened. Sure there were a few dramatized scenes which a biopic needs. There is no biopic on earth that doesn't even have a single dramatized scene. But it was one of the more accurate biopics I have ever seen. His love for June, his addiction, the whole folsom prison thing. Very accurate.As for the ending, I felt it ended at the perfect time. And it was a damned good ending.In conclusion:

The JC legacy,"I did like Johnny Cash and his music and I did enjoy this bio-pic which focused on JC's divorce, recovery from addiction and second marriage to June Carter. I was disappointed that the JC story omitted a significant part of JC's career: his friendship with Richard Nixon which catapulted JC out of regional country western onto the rock and roll stations and the mainstream pop chart.Politics do blend interesting harmonies.JC's WELFARE CADDALLAC made JC a favorite at the Nixon white House where JC was often invited. Long before the fall of Nixon, Cash and Nixon parted ways when Cash started singing tunes with a more liberal flavor.This aspect of the JC legacy was entirely ignored in the story. Yet I find it the most interesting facet of Cash's career.There is one item I do note. Frankly the alleged controversy over Cash's Huntsville concert. JC is supposedly told by his manager that his church going audience would not approve of a prison concert.Regrettably much of the stories about Christians are written by other who do not understand them. Christianity was founded by a prisoner who walked the line.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Fantastic...,"Based on the life of late country music artist Johnny Cash, 'Walk The Line' is a fantastic film, that easily ranks amongst the finest biopics to have hit the Silver-Screen. Biopics never seemed better.Johnny Cash's life is hard to display on screen. James Mangold handles the biopic with utmost sincerity. The film never loses it's grip, it keeps you at the edge of the seat from start to end. Cash was a legendary figure and this is a legendary film in all respects!The Soundtrack is a pure genius. One of the finest soundtracks, that take you back in time, and make you groove. The songs are simply rocking! Mangold is at his best over-here. The filmmaker makes an outstanding effort! Cinematography by Phedon Papamichael Jr, is appropriate. Michael McCusker's editing is good.Johnny Cash comes alive on Screen with Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix breaths Johnny Cash. He sings & delivers by becoming the late legend. This is one of THE finest performances of all-times. Reese Witherspoon as Cash's lady love, June Carter, is remarkable. She sings beautifully as well. Robert Patrick as Cash's dad is excellent. Ginnifer Goodwin as Viv, leaves a mark. Others are perfect.On the whole, A must watch for each and every cinema lover.

"The depictions are very good, but the vocals are outstanding!","*** out of **** starsIt's difficult for me to refrain from making comparisons between Walk the Line and Ray. Both movies showcase a main character who is an innovative musician, an addict, and a ""what happens on the road, stays on the road"" Lothario. Let's also not forget the vigilant wife left at home with the kids as the consolation prize. One of the best films of 2004, Ray is more successful than Walk the Line on every level. But you have to give Director James Mangold credit for creating a film that has been so widely recognized only one year after Taylor Hackford's masterpiece.Walk the Line stars Joaquin Phoenix as a convincing Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as an even more convincing June Carter. Most of the movie focuses on the years of turbulence in both of their lives until their eventual union. Phoenix does a very good job of playing a sad, broken and numb Cash, a man who is easy to pick apart. He's hooked on speed, driven - sometimes to a fault - because of a castigating father, and in love with a woman who won't have him because her complexities outweigh his, which is why when Witherspoon enters a scene the movie belongs to her more than it does to Phoenix. June's marital problems span several years with several men, it seems, through little fault of her own. She has made bad choices, and lives with enormous internal guilt and embarrassment because of them. Reese portrays a June who's extremely likable because of her ability to bury her emotional grief and unflinchingly dazzle audiences with her exercised talent as a sweet yet smug entertainer. She's instantaneously forgiving to legalistic strangers who criticize her for her ""sins"", and too saintly a soul for the likes of Johnny Cash.But we still want them to hook up anyway.I felt there was a certain amount of conflict and urgency missing in the telling of this love story amidst a lot of meditative tranquility and brightness. The sun seemed like it was up a lot, without a cloud in the sky or a wind to stir the trees. I'm not one to wish for rainstorms or lightning, but it could have made for an appropriate and occasional backdrop to such an angry, desperate and damaged man. Cash wore black for a reason.Like Ray, Walk the Line gravitates toward the musical performances. It is now well known (and I didn't know this when I first saw the movie) that Phoenix and Witherspoon actually sang as Cash and Carter and absolutely nailed it! Their depictions were excellent but their voices were extraordinarily dead-on. After first seeing and hearing them sing together, I was consistently chomping at the bit for them to take the stage again, and again, while the melodrama behind the music unfolded. If Joaquin and Reese ever decide to book gigs as the legendary couple, I'll buy tickets, front row, and enjoy their show even more than I did the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
By-the-Numbers Biopic,"This is a very run of the mill biopic that doesn't provide any significant insight into Cash's character or his music. I was never an admirer of Cash's sound, so this depiction of a tortured drug addict merely came off to me as an annoying and self-centered man instead of a compelling one. The film's great saving grace is the performances of Juaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who provide highly watchable impersonations of their country-western counterparts (although their relationship frequently borders on being more obsessive than romantic, especially as Cash's descent into drug addiction worsens).But the story itself offers no surprises as a formulaic presentation of a troubled artist saved by the love of a good woman. When Cash first attempts to start his career by going into a small-time recording studio and singing a sappy Gospel tune, he is chided by the producer that ""that's something we heard a hundred times before."" The makers of ""Walk the Line"" might have listened to that advice themselves.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Great movie,"A story about redemption with great all around acting, writing, and directing. The music is pretty good, too, making it more enjoyable. Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar for best actress, well deserved, for her portrayal of June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix was nominated, but lost, even though he was definitely deserving for his outstanding performance of Johnny Cash. This is just a solid movie and even a bit underrated. It's easily one of the best films of the second half of the 2000s decade. It's also a great love story and story about friendship and family. It brilliantly brings legend Johnny Cash's humanity, human side to life- what inspired him, his upbringing, struggles, and family life.I wish they still made movies like this in recent years.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Amazing,"Wow.I have just seen this film, and I was completely blown away. Walk the Line is an electrifying love story that draws you in all the way; and by the end leaves you wanting more.Joaquin Phoenix gives a quite outstanding performance, which was perhaps underrated in terms of awards due to other strong male performances. He inhabits the part of Johnny Cash fully, and gives more than just an impression of the man in black. He has an incredibly powerful screen presence, and handles Cash's addiction problems well, creating a convincing portrayal of a man trying to find his place in the world, and trying to convince the love o his life to marry him.For me, Reese Witherspoon was the revelation of the film. I've always admired her expressiveness as an actress, but this film was the first time where that has really translated into creating a realistic screen character. The part of the feisty June Carter suits her perfectly, and she sparkles every moment on screen. Her Oscar was thoroughly deserved.I think that James Mangold made absolutely the right decision in allowing the actors to so their own singing. Reese has a gorgeous, rich voice; and together with Joaquin the singing helps to lift the film off the screen, and the moments that make this film truly special are when the two leads share the stage together. The performance scenes are pure magic, and they help to lift the film from good to great.Phoenix and Witherpoon have incredible chemistry together, and when on screen and especially on stage they sizzle together. The chemistry of the two leads really allows the audience to invest in the characters, and see their love story as something more than just another formulaic story for the screen. We can really believe the fact that it was a true story.Even if you're not the greatest fan of musical films (my mother is notorious for hating them, but she loved this) then this film is sill well worth seeing. You don't even have to know much about Carter and Cash to enjoy the film - although by the end you'll definitely feel compelled to go and find out more about them.Walk the Line is a wonderful, absorbing film that hooks you right in from the moment Phoenix and Witherspoon hit the screen together right until the end of the film. Go and see it for two extraordinary performances.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Take away the Music...Take away Reese Witherspoon.....,"As a 60-something disabled man without transport, living 25 miles from the nearest cinema and a mile-and-a-half from the nearest bus stop, I bought ""WALK THE LINE"" on DVD because I wanted to see the movie. Wish I'd WALKED that Mile-and-a-Half to the bus stop: it would have taken me 30 minutes each way, but saved me the cost of a most disappointing DVD.I have always been a fan of Johnny Cash's music, and am a fast growing fan of Reese Witherspoon. But even with those two attributes in favour of the film (the two reasons I wanted to see it), I think I can honestly count the number of times I shall run this DVD in the future on the fingers of one hand.True to say that the film was very well acted by the two main characters: but if you take away the music, and take away Rees Witherspoon, there is nothing left in this film to either interest or admire. I found vast chunks of the film to be a total disappointment, and nothing to what I had been lead to expect.I have given this movie 7/10 primarily because of the Oscar Winning Skills shown by Reese Witherspoon as both a superb actress, and a great singer. I found her singing voice to be ""Out of This World"" with its wonder and beauty, and her acting in the role of June Carter was fully deserving of the Oscar that came as a result of it. In fact, I feel it would have been an injustice if M/s Witherspoon had not received an Oscar for this role.The Johnny Cash music was also very faithful portrayed; but not enough to hold my interest for very long.The music, and Reese Witherspoon ARE this movie. Take THEM away and there's simply nothing left to get excited about.Reese Witherspoon EARNED her Oscar here, and EARNED ALL of those 7 points out of 10 that I have given this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Walk the line 2005,"Johnny Cash sang like he meant business. He didn't get fancy and he didn't send his voice on missions it could not complete, but there was an urgency in his best songs that pounded them home. When he sang something, it stayed sung. James Mangold's ""Walk the Line,"" with its dead-on performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, helps you understand that quality. Here was a man who was blamed by his hard-drinking father for the death of his older brother, who said God ""took the wrong son,"" who looked at Johnny's big new house and all he could say was, ""Jack Benny's is bigger."" In the movie you sense that the drive behind a Johnny Cash song was defiance. He was going to sing it no matter what anybody thought - especially his old man.
The movie shows John R. Cash inventing himself. He came from a hard-working Arkansas family and grew up listening to country music on the radio, especially the Carter Family. He wrote his first song while he was serving in the Air Force in Germany. When he came back to the States, he got married and got a regular job but dreamed about being a recording artist. When his first wife, Vivian, complained he was spending more time on music than on her, he referred to his ""band"" and she said, ""your band is two mechanics who can't even hardly play.""
""Walk the Line"" follows the story arc of many other musicals, maybe because many core lines are the same: Hard times, obscurity, success, stardom, too much money, romantic adventures, drugs or booze, and then (if they survive) beating the addiction, finding love and reaching a more lasting stardom. 
What adds boundless energy to ""Walk the Line"" is the performance by Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash. We're told in the movie that June learned to be funny onstage because she didn't think she had a good voice; by the time John meets her she's been a pro since the age of 4, and effortlessly moves back and forth between her goofy onstage persona and her real personality, which is sane and thoughtful, despite her knack for hitching up with the wrong men. 
The film's most harrowing scene shows Johnny onstage after an overdose, his face distorted by pain and anger, looking almost satanic before he collapses. What is most fearsome is not even his collapse, but the force of his will, which makes him try to perform when he is clearly unable to. You would not want to get in the way of that determination. When Cash is finally busted and spends some time in jail, his father is dependably laconic: ""Now you won't have to work so hard to make people think you been to jail."" Although Cash's father (played with merciless aim by Robert Patrick) eventually does sober up, the family that saves him is June's. It is by now well known that Phoenix and Witherspoon perform their own vocals in the movie. It was not well known when the movie previewed - at least not by me. 
The problems with this film are minor, two in particular immediately come to mind. The pace of this film is so fast you find yourself wondering at times whether you have missed something. Time flies by in this film and it is sometimes hard to keep track of what state Cash's life is in now, or how famous he is today compared with the last scene. The pace is so speedy that it gets to the point where if there was a caption which read ""one year later"" at the beginning of this scene, you could count on there being the same caption at the beginning of the next one. 
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Walk The Line is how average the film is at it's core. The base elements of the film are a fairly standard re-tread of virtually every rock & roll docu-drama film ever made from The Doors to infinity; drugs are used, people are hurt, lives are in chaos; all this we have seen before. What makes Walk The Line remarkable is how it takes something average and enhances just about every aspect of it to the point where you begin to forget how average the core of the film really is. The performances, the music, the cinematography, the script, all are distinctly sharper and better than any film of this kind than I have ever seen, though they had virtually nothing new to work with. I highly recommend this film. Go for the story, but stay for the outstanding performances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Oscar Worthy?,"Walk the Line was a great bio pic that let's us all see into the life of the mysterious man in black. Joaquin Phoenix gave a great performance, but I'm not convinced it's worthy of an Oscar nomination. I felt, at times that he was trying to hard to act 'mysterious'. Joaquin was never 'lost' in the role, I saw mannerisms and facial expressions that I've seen in his other movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing, but Jamie Foxx played a far more convincing Ray Charles than Joaquin did of Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, stole the show and deserves a nomination for her role as June Carter. She was very convincing as the quick witted country singer. Reese has played many good roles in the past, but none more believable than this.Definitely see the movie if you are even the slightest bit into Johnny Cash.

Oscillating Entertainment With Boffo Performances,"The film opens with a show about to start at Folsom Prison, there just waiting for the performer. It's the Folsom Prison show and the one they're waiting for is, of course, Johnny Cash(Phoenix).
The film then flashes back to briefly cover, Cash as a boy growing up with his brother who was killed in an accident. Then jumping to him as man now played by Joaquin Phoenix. He's a considerable bit shorter than the real Man In Black and doesn't bear to much of a resemblance to him either. But he brings something to the role that is far more valuable than anything a simple look-alike imitator could. Pheonix adds a soul to his performance and truly captures the essence of Johnny Cash. He is widely considered to be a very talented dramatic actor-which he is-and it comes as no surprise how well he handles the more emotionally intense moments. But he does a shockingly good job with the singing and at times sounds very close to the actual Cash himself. It comes as no surprise that Joaquin Phoenix was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in the film as was Reese Witherspoon. Except she happened to win the, well deserved, Oscar.
Many state that Witherspoon outshines Phoenix in this film and they do have a point. She does as fine or an even better imitation with the music and beings an energy on screen that some might call scene stealing.
However, even with the terrific job they did with the music it doesn't change the fact that at times it hurt the film.
Most people know Johnny Cash through his music and that factors a good deal into why they go. Much of this film's appeal is the music.
However, Cash didn't live his life to be made into a movie so it's difficult to make a good story out of it. There are moments which translate well theatrically, perhaps with some added dramatization,but these are few and scattered. In between these there's a lot of empty space. Which the film decides to fill with loads of music. From the period after he gets big to before he hits rock bottom the picture is almost entirely reliant on the music to make it play. This continual session of songs is burdensome,unless your some completely fanatical Johnny Cash fan.Supported by great lead performances Walk The Line is a film that's quality is like Johnny Cash's life. Sometimes up sometimes down and overall probably a success.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

For Kathy Cash,"This is for Kathy Cash, Johnny Cash's daughter who thought the movie portrayed her mother in an unfavorable light. That is not what I saw at all. I saw a woman and mother, trying to hold the family together amidst her husband's addiction and obvious obsession with June Carter. It was like the moment she got tangled into his guitar strap that he couldn't see anything but her. And in real life, I am sure and rightfully so, Vivian Cash had to be upset. She may have come off and being little spoiled by her family at the very beginning but I don't think she ever bargained for what she got in Johnny Cash. As for June Carter, I believe she tried her best to stay out of Johnny's marriage but since that obviously didn't work for him, if we are to believe the movie, she was nearly hogtied into marrying Johnny at all. I am sure she loved him. But sometimes love just doesn't cut it when you have a man in as much trouble as Johnny got into before he married June. And I believe that June knew this and that is why she was so reluctant to marry him. I think the movie was brutally honest if we are to believe it on the portrayals alone. Johnny didn't come off looking like a saint if the Cash sisters are concerned about that. I totally fault him for the break up of his first marriage.On a whole, I gave the movie a 7 because I hate where it finished at. They were never married in the entire movie. And I really thought that was the entire point of the show. To show their story not what happened much before they were married.

The script sucks,"The look is good, The actors try to give a hard effort, the idea is fine but the script kills this movie from being any good. I saw this movie not knowing who the director is, after finding out I'm not surprised. The guy has made other good looking yet completely lame movies, perhaps a better director would have called for a script re-write.The movie is boring, which is due to the script. You are quickly pushed through cash's first 25 years by seeing things like him going off to the air force and then being home from the air force. This helps to underdevelope Cash from the start. The few scenes you see that are supposed to develop the love story are too short and too stiff to produce a sense that these people were in love.The movie starts with the t-1000 being cash's generic, mean spirited,""I wish you had died instead of him"" father. Then we jump to Cash being older. Then we jump through key things lightning fast. Then we see Cash get a real record out without any struggle or ANYTHING that might make us care or feel bad for him. Then he falls in love and has some struggle with his current wife and it all turns out fine and it sucks.During a lot of the movie I thought ""I never noticed Cash had a hair-lip, but that's a great make up job"" well I was wrong. It's not makeup. Joaquin has one, even though cash didn't. WHY DID NO ONE THINK COVERING THAT UP WAS IMPORTANT. playing a singer we constantly see Joaquin's mouth.Why end the movie in the middle of cash's life. Old Johnny Cash isn't worth writing about? nothing about diabetes struggle or the sadness over the death of June? Don't you think that his last single released being 'hurt' would tie in well with the 'what would be the last song you'de want to hear before you die' theme? I'm not all that surprised, They managed to suck the fun out of John's energetic years, a movie about the rest of John's life, written by these writers would probably be unwatchable.The script sucks. boring as hell. It reminded me of how in the movie 'the final cut' they would show someone's whole life only showing the main points but failing to show who they were and there personality. I kept thinking about how if my life were a movie, I would much rather an entertaining film based on any three drama filled hours or crazy times of my life, than a film about all the basic this happened, then this happened stuff.If they wanted to make it about his love for June than why not spend more time on that? If it was supposed to be about everything in the first half of his life why drain him of scenes that show him in a positive light? The movie is a mess. It's not completely awful but It could be such a better film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"""Hi. I'm Johnny Cash! ""","So, Johnny Cash. A man in black, a man with a guitar, a man-legend, a man ...
He is real in any of his hypostases. Speaking at a concert, composing music, loving. A man who has flown to the top, a man fallen from this peak - his life passes before us and it becomes clear that only a special person can fall so low and rise again high.
The love story of Cash and Carter is shown very touchingly.
Joaquin Phoenix did not just perfectly play his part. He lived on the screen, lived the life of Johnny Cash. The same gloomy look, the same half-smile, the same magnetism, the same deeply hidden vulnerability.
But Reese Witherspoon from Joaquin is not far behind. Firstly, she has a great voice, and secondly, the atmosphere of the 50's is surprisingly amazing to the actress. Her June Carter is loving and understanding, but at the same time she knows how to be tough. She became known much earlier than Cache, so the life of the star is uninteresting to her.
Still, some directors and writers have a love for embellishing reality, drawing facts behind their ears and seeking Oscar. But fortunately, there are exceptions. ""Walk the Line"" was just such an exception. Thanks to the film, I recognized Cash. Let not the present, but nevertheless. Acquainted with his life, saw the world 50's-60's.

"Enjoyable for the music and performances, but not for originality.","Reese Witherspoon should win an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of June Carter, the wife of country/pop legend Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) in Walk the Line, the biography of Cash until the two married. Director James Mangold takes no chances with this biopic: Cash is as we knew him: hard driving, substance abusive, womanizing, and one of the most talented musicians of the 20th century. Because the same could be said of Ray Charles in last year's Ray, both the lives of some great entertainers and the films that depict them could be considered formulas no one dares to tamper with. It's tough to earn an A in this genre for originality.Phoenix does a credible job imitating Cash although the screenplay offers little insight into how he developed his style or why he was abusive to himself and Carter; however it does play ad nauseam the conflict between Cash and his tight-fisted father, Ray (Robert Patrick). Phoenix has down Cash's signature roll with his guitar and more famously the basso greeting to each audience, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""Would that Mangold had spent more time with Cash and Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), the Sun Records mogul, who weaned Cash from gospel into music from his heart. As it is, we have one tryout session, enough to make me want much more of that creative molding. The Folsom Prison sequence captures the gritty and humane side of Cash, who not only thought this was the best audience on the tour but also empathized with their bad boy backgrounds.Too much time is spent watching Cash fall and then rise again¬óenough already, I get the idea within 5 minutes. And would that we could have more of Witherspoon and Phoenix singing together; they may not be as good as Cash and Carter, but they surely are electric enough to hold my delighted attention. In whole, Walk the Line is enjoyable for the music and performances, but not for originality.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Good movie but didn't meet my expectations,I thought the performance of both leads was great. They played their parts with great emotion and stride. I went to see this movie because I am a Johnny Cash fan and was hoping to get a strong sense of his career from start to finish. However it didn't do that for me at all. This movie did get into some significant events of his childhood but it turned out to be too much of a love and drug story that at times dragged on way too long for me. When their was music it sounded great and some of the other great musicians of that era added a nice touch to this movie. Maybe its because Ray was so good last year that I was hoping this would rival that movie. However it did not.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A somewhat crooked line...,"""Walk the Line"" offers a good look into the lives of Johnny Cash and June Carter. My first expectations upon seeing this movie today were not very high. And there were some slow parts that were long and drawn out. But I have to admit that it wasn't awful. I believe this can be accredited to Reese Witherspoon. She really stole the movie and was a fabulous June Carter. Phoenix expressed VERY impressive talent, don't get me wrong. And he did an excellent job of depicting Cash's destructive and morose behavior. However, Witherspoon truly brought it home. I would give this movie a 6/10, on the sole purpose of it being kind of boring. The acting was fabulous though, and it's worth a rental I'd say. Those fans of Johnny Cash will not be disappointed, but it lacks something for later generations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Johnny Cash deserves a better film.,"The moment I looked at an exterior street setup with beautiful 1950s picture cars, each looking brand new without a speck of dust on it, I knew I was in for a poorly thought-out run of the mill biopic. From scenes of his all-string trio with a phantom drummer on the soundtrack to the dubious audience interaction at Folsom prison, the filmmakers aim low and mostly achieve their aim. The script takes needless liberties with the facts, presumably to ""dummy down"" a complex and interesting life story. For instance, Johnny Cash was a successful amateur musician long before he met Sam Phillips, not the unskilled beginner the film depicts. This is an insult to the audience. The second half devolves into an addiction story but deprives us of the ""come to Jesus"" moment that may have led to his recovery. And whatever became of his first wife and daughters? And so on.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
One For The Ages,"When it comes to biographical films, ""Walk The Line"" may be at the top of the heap for its ability to portray its subjects with an energy that never wavers. It is a great story filled with compelling drama, and I also can't think of a film that features such great music.For a basic plot summary, ""Walk The Line"" tells the story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), who we all know ends up being one of the most successful music performers of all-time. This film focuses on the early portions of his career/life, such as the impact his brother's death had on him at a young age, as well as his rocky relationship with first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin). Stern father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) is also given a decent amount of screen time. As John strikes gold in the music business, he is also visited by the temptations of that lifestyle, such as girls, booze, and drugs. Through it all, friend, fellow musician, and eventually partner June Carter (Reese Whitherspoon) shares in his ups and downs in the music business and helps him try to put his life back on the right track.There are three things in this movie that really make it stick out as an all-time classic:1. The acting; mainly the chemistry between Whitherspoon (who won an Oscar for her performance) and Phoenix, who is one of the most underrated actors of his time. When they are on screen together, it is magic every single team, whether in a singing scene or high drama. Also, it is fun to see the performances of other contemporaries of Cash, such as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne). 2. The music. Though the movie is not a ""musical"" by definition, its music scenes are perhaps the best I have ever seen in cinema. They are filled with so much energy that you can't help but start the foot-tapping or even singing along! I know that many would call this a ""sacrilegious"" statement, but I really liked the vocals of Whitherspoon and Phoenix, so much so that despite loving the ""real Cash"" too, I also own the official soundtrack for this film. 3. The story. I don't know how accurately the film portrays the little nuances of the Cash/Carter clans, but I know the over-arching story between the two and I think ""Walk The Line"" does a great job in portraying the turmoil and the redemption. This is meant to be a high-octane, over- dramatic type piece anyway, and (like I mentioned before) the energy is just so great that it carries things right along.Put simply, ""Walk The Line"" is one of my favorite films of all-time. Every time I view it, it takes me on an emotional roller-coaster visually, musically, and dramatically.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A Fantastic Movie with 2 Oscar worthy performances.,"What a fantastic movie, a real delight for music fans and fans of period pieces. I'm neither but I gotta say, Walk The Line is a well made movie.Beautiful direction, Oscar worthy performances and a soundtrack that'll get everyone tapping their feet.I especially loved the montages and the transition between scenes. They just made me wild. :-).A lot of people have been comparing this movie to Ray, for understandable reasons. I wouldn't say Ray is necessarily a worse movie than this, but I did like WTL a whole lot better. The story in Ray was all over the place most of the time. Just my 2 cents.

Walk the line.,"Walk the Line is a 2005 American biographical drama film directed by James Mangold. The screenplay, written by Mangold and Gill Dennis, is based on two autobiographies authored by singer-songwriter Johnny Cash-Man in Black: His Own Story in His Own Words and Cash: The Autobiography. The film follows Cash's early life, his romance with June Carter, and his ascent to the country music scene. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as Cash, Reese Witherspoon as Carter, Ginnifer Goodwin as Vivian Liberto, and Robert Patrick as Cash's father.
This biographical tape is devoted to the life story of the legendary country singer Johnny Cash and his second wife, June Carter. The youth of Cash, born in 1932 in Arkansas, was overshadowed by the tragic death of his elder brother and the disdainful attitude towards him by his father, who considered him to be a bad son.
A film worthwhile, vital, about the struggle of a man with himself, to fall to the bottom and find the strength to stand up. Very much hooked and liked!
Joaquin Phoenix and
Reese Witherspoon played their roles perfectly.
A film with very good acting. In trifles biographical, which made the story somewhat ordinary. After all, for us and in particular for me, Johnny Cash is just one of many American performers. I think that for Americans he is a star and a legend.This is an excellent biographical film that will fill you with a musical, love, life atmosphere. The whole film you will go along with the main character on the line, experiencing all the joys and adversities. Uniquely conscience to viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Somewhat disappointing,"Well, saw the film this evening, and I have to say that I was really looking forward to it, being a bit of a JC fan.And my impressions are... well, certainly well acted, both the lead actors give excellent performances. The songs are pretty well reproduced, and there are some tender moments.And yet, and yet ... well, it really did feel rather formulaic, and the JC character really was pretty well sanitised for the (US) public. I would like to have seen the real Cash, I'm pretty sure we didn't see it.The other complaint is, why such brief examination of the JC career ? He was still making good records in the 1990s, and the 2000s. Listen to 'Personal Jesus' if you don't believe me. I was expecting to see the visit to the Holy Land, his baptism, the lean years in the 1990s. None of that is covered. Shame.In summary, I really believe that one can glean more about the 'Man in Black' by listening to the later recordings, than from watching this film, although it does add something to the legend.Entertaining, but maybe one day somebody will make the REAL J Cash movie.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Solid movie but should have been better,"I am a big fan of Johnny Cash, the singer. Like the movie 'Ray', I was expecting a solid tribute to the great singer. In 'Ray', the audience was able to buy into the singer's life because of the strong tie ins of Ray Charles' personal life and his music. We were able to see the influences that quite often gave him his biggest hits. Unfortunately, the movie, in and of itself, followed a rather drab storyline that involved a child growing up, getting into a bad conflict or problem (drugs), recovering from it, and then exiting out of the movie in a great flourish. Sadly, we see the same gambit in 'Walk The Line.' Unlike 'Ray', however, the movie fails to make the storyline as a bit player in the movie's composition. Instead, the storyline itself is the salient aspect of this movie. We do not see genuine attempts to explain Johnny Cash's influences in his music. Rather, we are left with the all too common banality of some tragic experience that affects the main character deeply. With hits like 'Rain of Fire' or my particular favorite 'Don't Take Your Guns to Town', it would have been nice to watch a movie that tried to present a fresh thesis on Johnny Cash's life and his musical influences. The movie's pace is often drab and not worthy of much praise. Much more critical thought could have been put into the script, especially for someone like Johnny Cash. Nonetheless, the movie is quite often saved by the repeated injections of musical performances-all of which were Cash hits. These performances, all performed by the actor portraying Cash, are enough to delude the moviegoer into thinking that he is watching a great biopic. Having said that, the performances by the actor and actress portraying Cash and June Carter, respectively, are outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix is great as Cash; I personally think his singing voice gets better and better as the film progresses. The actress playing June Carter maintains an air of fluffy and bouncy Southern girl charm, which complements Cash's dour demeanor. This movie is a '10' for people who have listened to Cash off and on but are not serious fans. For the rest of us, this movie could have been way better. Cash deserved a solid and awesome screenplay that involved serious thought and exploration into his life, not this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"the performances and music, and a fairly credible story, that's all you need...","Sometimes I take an actor like Joaquin Phoenix for granted, or maybe just not take too much into consideration his talents and strengths. Maybe in films like Gladiator or Signs, he had good roles but amid all the spectacle and big themes and action/suspense, some of his work was lost in it. Or sometimes he just doesn't find the potential in a character. Here though he finds himself in one of his best, if not his most ambitious, role yet as Johnny Cash, a man who rose up from nothing to become one of the legends of 20th century country. His drama and tragedies and successes are nothing new to this sort of sub-genre of the musician's bio-pic (in fact last year's Ray, which can likely draw up many comparisons with subject matter, was in some ways pretty similar). But its the convincing in the performances by Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon that help elevate what could've been more likely standard material.At times there are some fantastical moments (not that it's unbelievable, but like some of the stuff with Elvis early in Cash's career for example), and yet it's not to totally 'wow' the audience. This really comes in the form of the love story between Johnny Cash and June Carter (Witherspoon) who have an on-and-off kind of relationship that borders on being a couple, to being bitter at each other, to being tender on one end and near helpless on another, and then leading to a really moving finale. It's their connection on screen, and the surprisingly fresh dialog, that helps make situations that in Ray weren't as fleshed out make this world not too far from some truth. There are also little supporting performances that help, most notably Robert Patrick as the tough, practically unforgiving for a certain tragedy father of Johnny Cash.So there's the acting, and the story that sticks well with the themes of addiction (this time to pills and alcohol) and to being burned by insecurities and the demons of the past (and present). But there is also the music. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Cash's music, at least I wasn't really before I saw the film (I like some songs, notably from the period covered in the film). If anything co-writer/director James Mangold uses the songs and live performances, and cool gifts of the musical Phoenix and Witherspoon, to his advantage. The songs are sometimes more of a pure rock and roll sound rather than country, and the film does shine some light on how Cash did have a unique sound to him. And the circumstances shown around him playing at Folsom prison is one of my very favorite parts of the film. I'm not saying this is one of the all-time great musician bio-pics. However, if you're looking for something toe-tapping, and something too as a solid, emotionally rewarding 'date' movie, this is the one of the month.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
I shot a film in Memphis...,"Poor boy grows up in rural America, overcome adversity and becomes a successful musician, repeatedly overcoming the scepticism of the music industry to achieve massive hits. But he struggles with the emotional strain of retaining a wife at home and a mistress out on the road; and also with an addiction to drugs. After facing some criticism for confronting social problems, he is finally accepted as a national treasure, and the story ends with a caption telling us he continued to make music until his old age. Meanwhile, the film stars an actor with an uncanny physical resemblance to the real thing, who even contributes to his own musical turns in the movie; but there are a few slightly corny scenes where the writing of a particular song is linked just a little too directly to events in the character's life. Now, this could be a synopsis of 'Walk the Line', but it just as easily be a synopsis of 'Ray', the biopic of Ray Charles released a couple of years earlier. From which one can note how if you take an authorised biography as your source material, it follows that your going to get a certain sort of product as a result. But 'Walk the Line' suffers a bit from the comparison: although personally I prefer the music of Mr. Cash to that of Mr. Charles, the latter's story is more remarkable: black, blind, addicted to heroin, he refused to play segregated venues; whereas Cash, unloved by his father, addicted to prescription drugs, and who recorded an album in a prison, appears to be trumped on most of these points. Additionally, the story features a large role for Cash's eventual second wife, June Carter, who did write 'Ring of Fire' but who is otherwise uninteresting. If you don't like Cash's music, the film will probably leave you cold. But for anyone whose blood runs chill on hearing Cash's deep bass voice sing ""I shot a man in Reno"", the movie will still appeal, and with the likes of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis included in the dramatis personae, it's a history, not just of Cash, but of the birth of rock-and-roll.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Blah,"The actors do not look like...or sound like...the people that they are portraying. I was bored from the the start until I stopped watching it after, on or about, 45 minutes.

He portrays George Burns flawlessly. It is too bad that Gorshin was not part of a well publicized film like Walk the Line, or that Burns-mania is not currently a trend. Angels with Angles is not very good...but Gorshin is.

Walk the Line is Right on Target,"Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up during the Depression and through the second World War as the son of a poor sharecropper (Ray Cash, played by Robert Patrick) on an Arkansas cotton farm. His father's distance and clear favoritism for his older son shaped the young J.R as much as did his mother's love for singing hymns. A childhood tragedy also contributed greatly to the make up of the man J.R. later became.As a young man, J.R. joins the Air Force. He's stationed at a base in Germany where he fills his spare time learning to play the guitar. He's also obsessed with his girlfriend back home, the pretty Vivian Liberto (Ginnifer Goodwin). John eventually wins her hand and settles into a small apartment with his wife and new baby. Trying his hand at door to door sales in Memphis with little success, he yearns for his music even as his young wife tries to get him to settle down and be more responsible.John is finishing up another long day when he happens by a small recording studio where, for a few dollars, fledgling musicians can record their own songs. He begs owner Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) for an audition. John and a couple of his buddies have been playing casually in their spare time for months. Unfortunately, the gospel music they play doesn't impress Phillips, and he bluntly tells them so. Out of sheer desperation, John plays a song he wrote about a man doing hard time in Folsom Prison. Phillips is no idiot; he agrees to work with the earnest singer/songwriter, and Johnny Cash is born.In those days, incessant touring was the only way that singers could both make a living and get the exposure they needed to ensure radio airplay and record sales. It's on one such tour that Johnny meets pretty June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Eventually, traveling around the country, the entire troupe become friends. Waylon Jennings (who is played by his son, Shooter Jennings), a young Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne), Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice), and more of the soon-to-be greats are among them.Although Johnny is successful with his music, his wife is running out of patience. Her husband isn't often home and when he is, he's exhausted. She also worries about the growing friendship between Johnny and June. Eventually, Vivian can no longer hide her disdain. Johnny's disappointment in himself only grows when he's still unable to please his hard-hearted father. He escapes his unhappy home life by touring some more, and then by sliding into drinking and worse. Cash's career ¬ó and his life ¬ó might have ended shortly after that if not for his adoration of June. Though both are married, Johnny's not inclined to give up though he runs into more than a few stumbling blocks along the way.Joaquin Phoenix has already been singled out for high praise and for rumors of Oscar¬ô as a result of his performance. It's true that Phoenix is astounding in the role. Making his performance even more amazing is that he learned to play guitar just for this part, and that he does all of his own singing (both of which he does credibly). What you may not have heard is just what a stunning performance Reese Witherspoon gives. She more than holds her own as an actress in the face of Phoenix's formidable talent, and then goes beyond that with some terrific tunes of her own. When the two perform duets, not only is the music enjoyable but the on screen chemistry is such that you've no doubt in your mind whatsoever that Johnny and June were destined to be together.Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick are both good, especially the latter. In fact, I loathed Patrick's character which is a good indicator that the actor did a fine job in the creation of a man who apparently knew little about love and even less about raising children, but who did his best despite it all. The supporting cast is also excellent.James Mangold, the director of such films as the wonderful Girl, Interrupted and the woefully underrated Identity, did a fine job directing; as the co-writer of the screenplay, his vested interest in the movie was clear and likely enhanced his direction. There are some edits that seem abrupt and effectively interrupt the flow of the story; there are a few matters that are mysteriously skipped or glossed over (perhaps these are scenes that will be returned to the film in the eventual DVD version). But as a whole, the film is well crafted, and the music, by the way, is terrific.The performances alone are worth the price of a ticket, but the story, too, is something well worth telling. Johnny Cash really was one of the greats despite his personal flaws; that he overcame many of those shortcomings only makes him an even better man. And the love story between him and June Carter Cash is at once poignant and passionate, and will likely prove inspirational as well. Walk the Line isn't perfect, but it's awfully, awfully close...FAMILY SUITABILITY: Walk the Line is rated PG-13 for ""some language, thematic material, and depiction of drug dependency."" Small children aren't going to enjoy this movie anyway, and even older kids may not enjoy it much thanks to the fact it takes place in a past they've never known and features people they've likely heard of only in passing. But for adults, Walk the Line has much to recommend it. I said I wasn't a Johnny Cash fan, and I wasn't. But Walk the Line was a film I thoroughly enjoyed, and as a result, even gained some appreciation for Cash's musical legacy. I recommend Walk the Line to movie and music fans alike. It truly doesn't get much better than this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

I am not a Johnny Cash fan but the movie won a place in my heart!,"To be able to offer a comment on this movie I guess I should know something about Johnny Cash but to be honest although I don't know much about him still I wanted say something on the movie.Because I read a couple of negative critiques on the movie. For example Jeffrey M. Anderson says ""Every scene is a major turning point or epiphany; we never see Cash doing anything normal, we never learn his routines or what he liked or disliked. As with Taylor Hackford's Ray, we can easily follow what the character does but we rarely get an idea of who he is."" Well he may be right but I suppose when you produce a biopic you are not supposed to make a movie just for the fans of that person or for people who have known his art. I am in my early 20s and as a foreigner I barely know anything about the American music then.When I finished watching the movie I must say I am very impressed. Even if it seems like an actor/actress showcase than a movie itself the harmony between Witherspoon and Phoenix is really awesome. Even though they just perform these roles they are like real country singers with their impressive mastery.Besides Withersppon must be at her best with this movie. I mean look at her other movies like ""Just Like Heaven"". She is more than sweet in this one. She looks intelligent,precise and full of friendly love tinged with a passionate radiance. Joaquin Phoenix's performance also deserves acclaim though he did not get the Oscar. In short ""Walk the Line"" is a great story of a guy who moved from rags to riches not just in term of material wealth but inner peace, love,parental affection and friendship.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Blur the line,"This is not an homage piece, a la 'Ray.' There are too many praise-worthy aspects of the biography left out of this for that to be the intent. This one is about performance, and its relationship to real life. About walking the line, the fine line between the two.The gist is that June and Johnny live their ""real"" lives, then allow that experience to overtly reflect in their performances on stage. And sometimes the performance drives the real life, culminating in a marriage proposal (and acceptance, finally) in the middle of a performance. All aspects of their public images are deeply rooted in experience, exaggerated and replayed on stage.But between ""performance"" and ""reality,"" which is which and is there even a line between the two? How much does performance play a role in our marriage proposals, our troubles, our joy? Our ""real lives?""--An aside. Reese is not a good actress. She's all head and hands. All exaggeration.

Formulaic biopic with excellent performances,"This is one of the most formulaic and predicable biopics that I've seen. Almost every scene looks like it was written to present a significant event in the characters lives. As such it successfully tells a story but sacrifices any real character development or depth. Each piece fits together so neatly that I was left asking ""What happened to the real people?"". Of course this is hard to avoid when you have to tell a person's life story in 2 hours. That's why the best biopics avoid this trap and instead focus on a particular episode or a small chunk of time (i.e. Pollock). Nevertheless, the performances by the 2 leads are outstanding. Reese Witherspoon was either born to play the role of June Carter or else she has been hiding a lot of talent under the one-dimensional roles she has mostly played in the past. Joaquin Phoenix is very good as the Man in Black- especially since Johnny Cash was such a unique presence. Overall, even with low expectations for this film, I found myself disappointed.

Thumbs up for a love story which turned out to be a labor of love from cast and crew,"""Walk the Line"" is definitely one of the best biopics I've ever seen and one of this year's best films. In my opinion,its major breakthrough is that it appeals to all audiences- even to the European one which isn't familiar with country music or Johnny Cash in particular. I am Greek and even though my knowledge of country music is limited, I absorbed every detail of the film and I even rushed to buy the soundtrack! Biopics are a dangerous genre in the sense that it is always very difficult to recreate a person's life in full length and in full depth; yet James Mangold was wise enough to concentrate mainly on Cash's early adulthood and especially on his beautiful love story with June Carter. He managed to capture the essence of their relationship, approaching it from all sides without being tiresome or boring; and with the help of a really inspired cinematography by my fellow Greek Phedon Papamichael and with T-Bone Burnett's amazing contribution in music, Mangold made a really moving and unforgettable film. My comments, however, would be incomplete if I didn't mention the two ""pillars"" of the film, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. When I first read about ""Walk the Line"" in Premiere magazine I thought that the two would make an unlikely pair and I questioned their chemistry; R.Witherspoon is adorable but she had starred mainly in very ""light""films,which didn't require great talent, whereas J.Phoenix is one of the best actors in American cinema, but there is also sth dark, morbid and disturbing about him. Yet I was curious to see the outcome, and I confess now that I stand corrected! There was an undeniable chemistry between them and they truly seemed to have been born to play their roles. And, of course, I bow before their courage and determination to take this huge risk and responsibility to perform the Cashes' songs, especially J.Phoenix who would be instantly compared to the legendary Man in Black.( Mind you, I like ""Ring of Fire"" by J.Phoenix more than by J.Cash!) I always considered J.Phoenix a very talented actor who has made excellent and diverse choices, sth which proves the vastness of his gift as an actor and I must admit that I was in awe when ""Walk the Line"" was over. What a performance! He displayed a rare sensibility and he rendered Cash's complex personality both when he was fragile and when he was strong with great empathy and respect. I would say that Phoenix submerged into Cash's soul, he intuitively understood who he was and, thus, he masterfully portrayed him. I believe that Phoenix, in some peculiar cosmic way, was J.Cash during filming. Phoenix proved himself as a great actor once more in this film, because he was able to balance effortlessly and beautifully between the profoundly wounded child and the unfulfilled man that J.Cash was. It was truly a shame that the Academy deprived him of this year's Oscar for Best Male Leading Role, because he was the one who lifted the film on his shoulders, the one who gave it its sparkle and above all, he is the one who transcended his personality and became the Man in Black!P.S. I saw the movie on Febr. 14th,it was a coincidence and I think an unconscious tribute to a really moving love story. Also, because of ""Walk the Line"" I sought a different way of creativity and I've taken up acoustic guitar lessons.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Because you're not quite mine, I walk (and walk and walk and walk) the line","There's no question that Phoenix does a superb job inhabiting the skin and soul of Cash, he's brilliant in every possible way (particularly in how he literally turns his eyes into Cash's eyes), and Reese Witherspoon is a more-than-decent June Carter as well. These two performances, unfortunately, are the only really good things about the film, which plays out more like a (two-part!) TV biopic rather than a motion picture.It starts out promising, with Cash being relentlessly drawn to music, but once he gets his foot in the proverbial door and meets June Carter, the movie deteriorates into yer basic lovesick puppy scenario, with Cash continually debasing himself because his fierce and undying love for June is unrequited.More specifically, he wants her to marry him, see, and by the end of the movie, after she finally agrees, onstage (in a sinfully heavy-handed scene that the two actors barely manage to pull off), it's clear that the film has nowhere else to go, and so it ends, somewhat unsatisfactorily.I would have preferred just a tad more depth here, I think both Carter and Cash (who remained together for THIRTY FIVE years after the conclusion of the movie!!) deserved it. I think it's a shame when two actors who were obviously so up to the challenge weren't given anything truly outstanding to work with, but they still deserve acknowledgment come Oscar-nomination time, regardless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Meh - odd choices for a Johnny Cash film,"The stories or slim snippets of people's truths were an odd selection for a basis of a Johnny Cash film.Seems superficial, given everything of Johnny Cash's life and character, I didn't think much of this, and if I base my opinion of it all solely on the film, I couldn't believe in the characters, I can't believe in the Hollywood drama that could have been a workable formula 15 years ago.The acting was ok given what they had to work with on the film.Also there was not enough good material in this film to engage with the audience given the subject matter, but if you want a light formulaic drama film bearing in mind this probably more resonant of a 'based on a true story', it could be your thing.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

His songs are amazing but, the movie is what captured my attention the most.I watched Walk the Line with my father and found it to be the most best movies i've watched, my dad and me were singing along and in most parts so hooked by the story line. The drug addiction, the love. Trust me, if a 14 year old liked it you would as well. I don't think any one else could be a better Johnny Cash actor than Joaquin Pheonix.

A great Hollywood love story with the South glossed over,"I had a chance to see a pre-screening of Walk the Line a few days ago. Ultimately, it was a solid Hollywood film with great performances by Reece Witherspoon & Joaquin Phoenix. Yet, being a die-hard Johnny Cash fan from Arkansas, I was hoping for more on his development as a musician & struggle with his Christian faith. His faith in God & roots in gospel music carried him from childhood throughout his career. Johnny Cash made scores of records recalling scripture & hymns he found solace in his darkest hours. If you want to understand the context of his conflicts, you simply cannot leave faith out of the equation. I was left in want for the texture of the South which I grew up in, where people are as in touch with their surroundings as they are with themselves. In the film, Undertow, there's a beautiful three minute monologue about chiggers as a child sits barefoot on a riverbank. Perhaps taking cues from Terence Malick, John Boorman or David Gordon Green might have helped capture the subtlety which could have made this film truly great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
This movie touched my heart,"I knew some things of Johnny Cash but this movie really makes you see things from his perspective. I caught a pre-screening of this movie and absolutely loved it. People in the theatre were singing and laughing and feeling his pain. Surely their was more that could have been included, like his faith or some of his more famous songs, but it told his life story. How can you sum up a man's life in a couple of hours any way? I am glad that others will have a chance to see him and know him, even if they didn't know who he was until now. This movie was worth buying! Also Reece and Joaquin does an absolutely great job at singing his songs and really getting into character.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Excellent sums it up,"I was expecting this movie to be very good, but it by far exceeded my expectations. The acting was sensational, and the music was incredible. It was even better considering that both Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash's music was actually performed by their prospective actors. Truly breath taking, even if you are not a big Johnny Cash fan. This movie diverges into the personal turmoils of Cash and Carter, and draws the audience into the ups and down, which, helps draw them together. It binds heartache, divorce, guilt, family issues, love, and music together into a beautiful collage of genuine, heartfelt energy. It was remarkable, and worth every bit of hype it received.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A Film That Has An Enlightening Ending,"WALK THE LINE **** This biographical study of the life of country music legend Johnny Cash is both a musical and a drama as we follow through the hard trials of Cash's life, extraordinarily reenacted by Joaquin Phoenix. We see the ups and downs of his childhood, how he got to become a famous musician and a sex icon, what led him to start taking drugs, and how he ultimately overcame his battles. Phoenix's performance owes part thanks to the strong screenplay and solid direction that he worked with in this picture. Blonde-turned-brunette Reese Witherspoon contributed her most widely-acclaimed performance as the love interest. A powerful story that may leave you enlightened as well as entertained by its concluding act.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Cash vs Ray, Booze vs Heroin, guts vs soul","When I was a boy I visited a friend in Germany whose father had the unsettling name of Adolf. He spoke very little English and he used to sit in his great-chair and listen to Johnny Cash, hour after hour. The music never grabbed me, but it sure grabbed him, seven thousand miles away in another land. So when the film came out I was overjoyed. Finally a chance to solve the mystery of why Cash was so appealing. I felt like I was about to be initiated into a secret society. Nobody would go with me so I went alone. I wore black.I can't help but compare this musician biopic to last year's Ray. I loved Ray so very much as a film. His music was more my speed than country but the film too was a warm and loving portrayal of a man who absolutely adored his music. Ray was a musical genius, a kind soul, someone I would be friends with if I had the chance. I wasn't half way through Walk the Line when I knew, Cash was no Ray. He was angry, depressed, violent, disrespectful, and destructive. But he didn't have a fraction of the talent that Ray had to redeem himself with: Cash was not a musical genius. He just had balls. And both Cash and Ray were haunted by their childhood, and they were both addicts. But Cash was addicted to the far less exotic booze and pills rather than Ray's pot and opium. Ray was high but Cash was always low.Walk the Line was a hard film to watch although in the end I wanted the singer to find success or at least love. This was a mean guy that I shouldn't care about or invest in, but I did, so that much of the film worked. I don't think I'll listen to his music, but I understand better whey Adolf did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
the best movie of 2005,"A friend of mine saw this at a film festival and told me I HAD to see it when it comes out. I was counting the days especially after seeing the interview on PBS Charlie Rose. I have always like j. phoenix and absolutely love Reese W. (specifically after Legally Blonde) as in that movie she took the part of June Carter to an absolute level of believability, it is her strength as an actor. I thought it was interesting that Joaquin and Reese never upstaged each other, not in the story line or in their acting, it was true chemistry as there must have been between Carter and Cash in life. I walked out of the theater thinking it would be great if every movie you walk out of you feel as good as I did, it's been a long time since I felt that about a movie. As dismal as the ""movie"" landscape was this year, I know that if there WERE many other fabulous ones, they will still win Oscars for their great performances, hands down they must win. In the interviews before the movie came out, Joaquin and Reese even then conveyed a certain chemistry between them as actors, not to mention that they have tremendous respect for each other as actors, it was just bound to be good. I enjoyed Joaquin in Gladiator so much, and he was so believable, as in this movie. I think Johnny Cash would be proud of this movie, Joaquin's performance was so good he could have been his son in looks and even his singing. It is hard to believe these two never sang before, not to mention having to do IT on screen. THIS REALLY IS THE BEST MOVIE OF 2005 AND MANY OTHER YEARS!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Enjoyable, even if you're not a fan of Cash's music","""I'm pretty sure those weren't Johnny Cash's original recordings, so I wonder who did the vocals?""Stephanie, a bigger Cash fan than I, posed the question after the movie. She was duly impressed when I informed her that Phoenix did all of Cash's vocals with no dubbing.It serves as a testament to Joaquin's dedication to the role. In addition to performing the vocals, he also learned to play the guitar from scratch. And lest we take anything away from Ms. Witherspoon, she performed her own vocals as well and had to learn the auto harp. Maybe this won't impress some of you as much as it does me, but I thought it went a long way in adding a more personal touch that a biography such as this needs to succeed.Another thing that a biography needs to succeed is an ability to condense one man's entire life into a two hour timeframe. How do you take the life of a country music legend and effectively tell a story of family turmoil, military service, music success, drugs, infidelity, and redemption all within such a short amount of time? I don't know, but I recommend you watch Walk the Line for an example of how it can be done.I expect Joaquin to be listening for his name on Oscar night. He puts in such a believable performance that you don't have to be a fan of Cash's music to be interested in his story. We see from the beginning that the traumatic death of Cash's older brother will never cease haunting him. But it's Joaquin that really shows us how this dreadful memory won't allow him peace. His father wishes it was he that the devil took, his wife never seems to fully embrace his career or the fact that he has to live on the road so often, and the road itself contributes to his dependence on drugs.Indeed Cash becomes a man who can't resist temptation.Ironically, it's one of those temptations that eventually becomes his savior - June Carter, portrayed so smoothly by Reese Witherspoon that I won't be surprised if she too will be listening for her name on Oscar night. As the relationship between Cash and Carter develops, the movie shifts from the chronicle of one man's life into a genuine love story. It's not until he risks losing her love that he realizes life can be a failure despite whatever success might come.Consequently, Walk the Line has something to offer audiences that don't wear black dusters and kicker boots. But those who are most interested in the musical aspect of Cash's journey will go home satisfied. I particularly enjoyed watching the correlation between Cash's life experiences and how they influenced his songwriting. Keep a close eye on the scene where Cash strolls the streets of Memphis and watches as a young boy and his dad rhythmically shine shoes and then later on listen closely when Cash sings his hit Get Rhythm. Subtlety reigns supreme, but it's clear enough to give us a glimpse of the man's process.Younger audiences that don't warmly embrace biopics may not find themselves enthralled with Walk the Line, but anyone who likes a good character study or a true-to-life love story should be thoroughly entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Country Licking Good!,"I think I am not being out of line when I state that ""Walk The Line"" will be one of the most celebrated films of 2005. This Johnny Cash bio should cash in a few Oscar nominations for its lead actors, writers, and director. The film does primarily focus on Johnny Cash's relentless romantic pursuit of June Carter. It is not created as a love story but more as a man's willingness to romance a woman he has enduring love for. I will ""Cry, Cry, Cry"" if Joaquin Phoenix & Reese Witherspoon are not nominated for Oscar acting nominations. The Phoenix does rise up here from his acting ashes with a vociferous & breathtaking performance as Cash. Joaquin even perfects the Cash sound by doing his own singing; sound like money in the Cash vocal bank to me. Hey June, could anybody could have perfected your part better than the flawless Reese Witherspoon? Witherspoon also masters the June Carter persona and voice ""withhertune"" too. Director James Mangold might see another ""mangold"" in a Best Director Oscar statuette in the near future. His arty direction of ""Walk the Line"" puts him in line in as one of the deserving candidates for a Best Director nomination. The musical sequences of the film deserve a high note as one of the optimum ever captured in film. The buzz has already started on how hot this film is , or in other words the ""ring of fire"" has already been chained for ""Walk The Line"". So line up at your local movie theatre for this linear narrative that is ""Walk the Line"". It will be cash well spent! ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A pulse-pounder on all levels,"Excellent performances, a heartbreaking and inspiring love story, and a chance to finally see Reese really shine. The best parts are the scenes on the road with Elvis and Jerry Lee. And it's nice to see a regional film shot on location in the real places that does not condescend to southern accents or culture. It gets a bit repetitive, maudlin and dirge-like as Johnny's ache for June wears on, and the film's examination of Cash's drug-addled, room-wrecking clich√© of a superstar life don't go beyond your average ""Behind the Music"" episode. It's kind of sick how we celebrate the antics of self-destructive misfits instead of trying to get them some help, but at least Cash fell in love with a woman who was not an enabler.

Phoenix needs a new job!,"Phoenix as CASH was a bad idea! He is dense and cant get anything through his head in the movie....I think Phoenix needs a new job because he acts as the same little PUSSY cat in all his films. He made Johnny Cash out to be someone I believe he was not. J.Phoenix ruined the entire film for me so thats why I rate this film a 1 on a 10 scale. Find a new Job! The ending was a bit abrupt and sudden, Like the maker had too much information and just lopped off the entire back half of Johnny Cash Life. In my opinion the casting was just off other than Reese. It's too bad that a great film movie had to end like this. I think it should be made over but there is no chance that will happen. There was never anything said about own Johnny Cash in his later years! His career did not end in the 60's! To top things off, No one aged in the film from the 40's to the 60's, what happened there? Overall.................Not good and very disappointing because I really enjoy Johnny's Music.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Long legged guitar pickin' man...,"... is how the real June Carter refers to her husband, Johnny Cash, in a song covering the film's closing credits. He counters by calling her a ""Big Mouthed Woman"" in a famous duet of theirs. That was a very satisfying end to a wonderful film. It seems to have begun some time ago, before the deaths of Johnny Cash and June Carter-Cash, who each personally picked both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon to play them in the film before they died only four months apart in 2003.I went to see this film with high expectations fueled by all the pre-release hype and trailers I'd seen for a long while. For a change I was not disappointed. This is truly a wonderful film. Although it definitely deals with unpleasant subjects such as the psychological and emotional abuse Johnny Cash suffered as a child from his abusive, alcoholic father (played with real talent by the versatile Robert Patrick) and his later fall into pills and alcohol as a result, much like his old friend Elvis Presley; who the film illustrates as having started Cash down the same road abusing prescription drugs that led to his own, later death.This was also a bit of a personal memory trip for me, both from a similarity to some of our life's more ugly experiences and for the backdrop his music and the others of that Sun Record's miracle group in the 50's played to my own life. Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and Elvis Pressley were all musicians I listened to primarily from about 1957 onward for years, in no small part because their music spoke to me in a very personal way (Johnny, Elvis Presley and Hank Williams are the only performers to have been inducted into both the Country Music and Rock And Roll Halls of Fame). So to see this period of their lives depicted on screen was a personal experience that I am sure has to have colored my opinions of this to at least a small degree. However, I don't think even my beginning prejudice would cause me to like the film were it not extremely good - as a bad film of something so personal would have caused me to dislike it far more. Having said that...I was transfixed by the personal presence of the wonderfully talented and beautiful Reese Witherspoon, who plays June Carter-Cash in the movie, much to Mrs. Cash's credit. Her performance has to be ranked with some of the finest I've ever seen in a long lifetime of movie going. She was completely convincing in her role and played every emotion to a well rounded ""T"". Even more impressive, she did a stellar, professional job of covering all of June Carter's songs (she also had to learn to play the auto-harp), including her very surprising on screen chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix, who played the film's main character, Johnny Cash. Even with the danger of it sounding like a tired clich√© in today's Hollywood, if she doesn't win, let alone be nominated for an Oscar, there are no gods...For his part, Joaquin Phoenix was tremendous in the primary role. Even knowing Phoenix was the one actually singing the songs in the film going in, it was very hard to not believe it was Cash himself singing as I watched him on screen, he was just that good. He performed all of the songs himself without being dubbed and learned to play guitar from scratch just for this role. In fact, I think the real danger here for Joaquin Phoenix is that his portrayal was so very exactingly just like the real Cash that people won't notice where reality stops and the magic he creates on screen begins. He was truly mesmerizing in this role, so good it's hard to find the right superlatives to heap the praise high enough.Not to be outdone by any means, a huge amount of credit has to go to the screen writing, by Gill Dennis and James Mangold, who also directed. The script was wonderfully done, inviting the audience into the life of Cash in a way that made me, at least, feel more like I was an eyewitness to the real events rather than just watching a film.James Mangold's directing was wonderful, perhaps even brilliant. His concept of having both Phoenix and Witherspoon record Cash and Carter's music was a masterstroke of genius, assisted in no small part by the surprising talent of both stars, who may now have a second career to fall back on. Their music made the film in a way that nothing else could have. That both Cash and Carter lived their lives to bring music to the world could not have been so respectfully portrayed without such convincing delivery of the very object of their life's work. Both stars should be applauded for even having given the effort to trying, let alone succeeding in such a great way.The other actors did a great job of their performances as well. Both Tyler Hilton as Elvis and Waylon Payne (Wallon Jennings' godson) who played Jerry Lee Lewis were standouts. Waylon Jennings son, Shooter Jennings, also made an appearance playing his father.Last but not least, the costumes, set and art direction gave a rich canvas to the talented cinematography of Phedon Papamichael. Sound, sound editing, music in all respects and the perfect, wonderfully understated makeup for Ms. Witherspoon should all get mentions at Oscar time.Sony, Universal, Focus Features, Columbia Pictures, Paramount, and Warner Bros. who are all said to have passed on the project, should be kicking themselves now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

However, the movie is based only on childhood up until he marries June, and not up into old age.

Joaquin's darkness,"J. Phoenix was the only man that could represent the darkness of Johny Cash's character, just through his eyes. His intensity as a man in struggle is breathtaking. His chemistry with Witherspoon's character burnt the silver screen. Not only he played the man in black, I think he is one himself. Cash's passion for his woman and his music are brilliantly reflected in Joaquin's passion to caption not only Cash's restlessness, but the restlessness of love. Reese was also amazing in being the kind of woman that would inspire such pathos. She completes a beautiful love story that is really the highlight of the movie and has great music as its deserving background. With Walk the Line, Joaquin Phoenix establishes himself as one of the most talented actors in Hollywood. I can not wait to see him in roles were he can unleash layers of darkness not only of the characters he plays but of his own. I don't believe in Oscars, and although this performance should be at least worthy of it, it would barely do justice to his brilliant performance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Superior fare,"As musical bio-pics go, this is certainly superior fare, but how much you'll enjoy it might well depend on how much you like the genre and how much you appreciate the (country) music. This film was more my wife's choice than mine.It is the story of the early professional life of the American singer Johnny Cash, ""The Man In Black"", set mainly in the 1950s and 1960s with a soundtrack of no less than 16 songs. We already knew that Joaquin Phoenix is a superb actor (from movies like ""Gladiator"") and here he demonstrates a fine singing voice too.The revelation is Reese Witherspoon, as Cash's singing companion and future (second) wife June Carter, who makes it clear both that that she is fine actress (not self evident from films ""Legally Blonde"") and has a good singing voice.Considerable credit goes to James Mangold who laboured on the project for many years, working closely with both Cash and Carter (before they died within four months of one another), and then both directed and co-wrote it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Who is Johnny Cash?,"I always thought that Johnny Cash was just a person that was made up and didn't really exist. You can believe my surprise when I was told this movie was about his life.I went to this movie without knowing anything about this man and so I had no expectations. I expected the movie to be a B-movie and just be some boring life story. I was proved wrong.This movie caught my interest from the start and a part from some parts of the movie where the moments passed slowly, it kept my interest till the end. I remember Joaquin Phoenix (like a lot here) from his play as Commodus in the Gladiator. In that movie he already showed that he could act, but in this movie he clearly shows that he is a great actor. I believed him the way he played Johnny Cash.After I walked out of the cinema I knew not only who Johnny Cash was, but the movie made me more curious about the man. This movie showed me the troubled and yet beautiful life this man has lived. This movie made Johnny Cash a legend for me! 8 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Acting makes the movie,"The script for this movie is familiar (at least to Johnny Cash fans) and somewhat pedestrian. The acting, however, is superb. Perhaps the best decision James Mangold made is to have Phoenix & Witherspoon doing their own singing. Witherspoon does a better job approximating June's high, playful twang, but Phoenix's performances make you forget that he sounds very little like Cash. Being a Johnny Cash fan for almost 30 years now, I didn't expect Phoenix to be able to convince me. I was wrong.This isn't a great movie. There are no new insights into the man (then again, Cash always was an open book). The photography is pretty, but unremarkable. Walk the Line is, however, great entertainment, primarily because of the work of Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, and Robert Patrick. Definitely worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Simple Formula,"I just saw this film today and found it to be slightly disappointing. I live in London where the films are at least two to three months behind and each trip back for Thanksgiving means I get ahead of the game a little in terms of films I am excited to see. Plus the price of a movie ticket here in the USA is far more manageable (at least $14 per person).This film was on my must see list and as the opening sequence rolled on starting with the major milestone of the subject and then fading into a traumatic event that shapes the future I knew what was coming almost every step despite knowing next to nothing about 'The Man in Black'.The comparisons to 'Ray' are the most obvious. Both singers lost a brother during the early formative years and then went on to produce ground shattering new forms of popular music while suffering the pangs of a family destroying substance addiction. Unfortunately, Walk the Line does not seem to delve too deeply into the unpleasantness that a drug problem can be. Skimming scenes of a few pills and a desperation for them and then the standard children crying as the parents fight felt forced, like a paint by numbers Picasso.I felt all this detracted from wonderful, singular performances from the two leads who both have an incredible talent for mimicry. If this entire film had been nothing but a string of concert performances; I would have been thoroughly entertained. The relationships between those performers (including that of Cash with his standard issue unfeeling father) felt slathered on for the pulling of heart strings. What must have been a tortured and deeply loving relationship between June Carter and Johnny Cash felt cheapened and commercial.Since bio pics seem to be all the rage these days, there must have been a lot of crowd pleasing to do. The public who, like me, might not be too familiar with the talent of Carter and Cash. Then there are the people who knew or were related to them. I have heard grumblings that the first wife of Cash was not accurately portrayed but again cheapened to look like a harpy. What woman wouldn't be upset that her husband was a cheating drug addict? Last of all there are the fans. Rabid or devoted, they obviously feel a connection through the powerful music of a legend. Too many masters does not a personable film make.All in all this film features two truly gifted actors trying to reach the audience with hollow material. They do this best through the amazing music they perform live each take (so it is said) but when it comes to dialog, the movie feel flat. With a questionable ending leaving the viewer confused and unfulfilled, I can not honestly tell anyone this is a experience that should be had by all who enjoy good film. Nor can I tell them to avoid it. The music makes this worth a look but possibly at home with a remote with a fast forward button.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Just another film to jump on the bandwagon...,"Unfortunately, I was busy the night of the Academy Award's, but when I was told of the Oscars that ""Walk the Line"" had won, I was appalled. My initial reaction was ""How is that possible! It was just 'Ray' with white people!"". Surprisingly, it had been referred to as such at the awards ceremony. This movie really does follow the basic pattern that Ray did. If this movie came out before Ray or maybe 10 or so years after, it may have been appreciated, but this movie gives off a flair of being produced for the sole reason of imitating a successful, previous, better movie, Ray. Not to be offensive towards Reese Withersppon, I admit she is a wonderful actress, but she cannot be taken seriously in this role. I would get emotionally involved with Pheonix's character, and then I would be interrupted by our favorite ditz from Legally Blonde.

Better than Harry Potter,"I saw both movies opening weekend. I totally was digging Walk the Line.

I had no idea what was going on. Two people who read the books talked my ear off about it and it's just not interesting. Plus, I had a terrible time being cramped up by tons of nerds and the nerds got mad when I cut the huge line going in.

"Joaquin is Johnny Cash ""The Man In Black""","Wow, I got to tell you how much I loved watching this movie. I enjoyed every minute of it, from the very beginning until the very end, I actually enjoyed it so much that I didn't want this movie to end. Joaquin Phoenix portrays Johnny Cash a country music singer/songwriter who is a legend, he was known as ""The Man In Black"" because that's all he wore, was black clothing. Reese Witherspoon portrays Johnny's wife, June Carter-Cash. I got to tell you I loved Reese in this movie, and was very, very proud to see her get the Oscar. This movie was very well acted, and the singing sensational. I've seen a couple of movies where the film is based on a singer/band, but this one tops the charts in my book. I love Joaquin and he's a really really good actor, and he's also a very good singer. However, I was a little upset that my favourite song by Johnny Cash wasn't featured in the movie, ""A Boy Named Sue"", but I guess he wrote so many damn good songs, they can't fit them all. I gave this movie a 10, the only thing that I found wrong was that I never got to see Mr. Cash live. That would've been a great show, but heres hoping Joaquin and Reese do a tribute, because if they did, I would pay any price to go see them sing. Watch ""Walk The Line"" it's a great movie, filled with great songs and lot's of sensational acting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Where Have You Been?,"What a great film. The mix of a great story line, gifted actors and great directing is exactly what Hollywood needs to fill those empty theaters. Ladies and Gentleman, we have a new star and his name is Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Johnny Cash was not acting. This performance was far above acting. The proof is found midway through the film where Johnny Cash sits at the dinner table staring at his father. Without saying a word you can feel exactly what he wants to say just by his look. That is how you do it. Reese Witherspoon gave a wonderful performance and seemed to be on the same level as Joaquin. The next five years are going to be very interesting to see where these two young stars go in their careers. I'm putting my money on Joaquin. Great job guys.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Met My Expectations,"What you see in the trailer is what you get in the movie: a story you've seen, read, or heard hundreds of times before. A celebrity overcomes adversity, can't handle success, nearly destroys his life through substance abuse, and finds redemption in the end.The hook in that tired old story that this movie offers is Johnny Cash's unique musical and vocal style. On that front, director James Mangold (""Kate and Leopold"") makes a mistake by having Joaquin Phoenix do his own singing. A big part of Cash's appeal stems from his amazing deep bass voice. Not one male singer in 1,000 has the low notes Cash had, and -- surprise, surprise -- Phoenix isn't that one. It would have been so easy to find a good Cash imitator to dub the songs, but because they let Phoenix do the singing, the audience is left wondering how this guy ever sold a single record, let alone millions. The big audition scene is simply an embarrassment; there is no way any record producer in the world would have touched Cash with a ten-foot pole if he'd sung ""Folsom Prison Blues"" with the mediocre sound Phoenix produces.(Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, pulls off her musical numbers with a nice voice and real country music style.)Another shortcoming of Walk the Line -- and here the movie's trailer is misleading -- is the lack of a credible love story. There's very little romantic chemistry between Phoenix's Cash and Witherspoon's June Carter, but that's the fault of the script rather than the actors. Cash is such a worthless human being through most of the movie that it's impossible for Carter to see anything in him. When she tells a drugged-out Cash that he's a good person, our reaction can only be ""He is?"" In the bizarre marriage proposal scene at the end, she agrees to marry him not out of love, but apparently out of embarrassment.Even with those negatives, the movie is slickly made, features some fine performances by the lead and supporting actors, and has several good concert scenes. If you're looking for something unique or thought-provoking, skip it. But if you're in the mood for a dramatized E! True Hollywood Story, this one fits the bill.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Walk The Line, a great movie!","I loved the movie, and thought Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon perfect actors for this movie. They both played their parts so well, not to mention the songs they sung themselves. As soon as I got out of the theater from seeing the movie, I went and bought the soundtrack. I loved it, but was disappointed to find that the one song I really liked the most ""Time's A Wastin"", was not on the CD. That song will be a huge hit if Phoenix and Witherspoon decide to record it in its entirety. I really think they should, I know it would top the charts. Anyone that loves country music will truly enjoy this movie. Johnny Cash is a country legend. I never knew his brother's death haunted him most of his life. In fact, I never knew he had an older brother until I seen this movie. Also, never knew his addiction was that bad or that long. I also want to add, the movie really portrayed the deep love Johnny Cash had for June Carter. Never have I seen such a powerful, long-term devotion, and passion for another human being.

Overpraised Acting Performance by Joaquin Phoenix,"Joaquin Phoenix got much praise for his role as Johnny Cash in Walk The Line - a chick flick masquerading as a biopic of Johnny and June Carter Cash. His performance - one of the rare instances of a well-deserved Oscar snub - is certainly one of the most overrated in film history. In addition to looking absolutely nothing like Johnny Cash, he fails to sound or act like him as well.His attempts to impersonate Cash's baritone singing style were noble, but Cash was one of the most gut-wrenching of singers in popular music. He conveyed his feelings and emotions through his voice both live and in the recording studio, and was a tremendous storyteller in addition to being a singer and musician. Phoenix, unfortunately, was completely unable to tap into this aspect of the man and his music. Also, as captured in the recordings ""Live At Folsom Prison"" and ""At San Quentin"", Cash was a rather mellow individual when interacting with his appreciative audience of inmates. When the landmark Folsom gig is reenacted at the film's conclusion, Cash is depicted as wild and unhinged - almost as if his motivation for performing at the prison was to start a riot. Cash most certainly was a rebellious individual, but to depict him in a manner such as this is dishonest and irresponsible on behalf of the actor portraying him and the filmmaker, to say the least.The movie's sole redeeming quality is the fine performance by Reese Witherspoon as the love of John's life, June Carter. Unlike Phoenix, she succeeds in capturing the charm as well as capably mimicking the singing style of the late performer.Walk The Line is a slick Hollywood production which will surely satisfy the Lifetime movie-of-the-week crowd. But true fans of Johnny Cash and his music will be disappointed as it does not give the legend and his legacy the proper respect that is deserved.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Hugely disappointing... unreal and untruthful,"I have just finished reading Johnny Cash' autobiography and this movie has disappointed me to much that I wanted to stop it half way but my wife wanted to see the end and watching it was my idea, so I had to see the whole thing. It swings from being unrealistic to being in plain contradiction with the reality of events and character of people (first of all, his father, June Carter and his relationship with both) as Johnny Cash describes them. I honestly think it insults his memory by pretending to be biographical. This is not a biographical film by any means, it's a hollywood style romantic/soap opera kind of movie about an artist who had indeed a very interesting and unique life, just nothing to do with this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
I was prepared to hate it but ended up loving it.,"I've been a Johnny Cash fan since the beginning of his career. I had seen the movie previews on TV and was prepared to hate it because anyone could see that Joaquin Phoenix was no Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon did not remind one of June Carter.I was very pleasantly surprised. Joaquin did his homework. While he doesn't look like Johnny or sing exactly the same or move the same way, he somehow captured the essence. Reese did a very good job of capturing June's behaviors. At times during the movies I felt I was watching Johnny and June instead of two actors. I know it sounds silly, but when John proposed to June and she was taking her time answering, I found myself totally caught up in the moment, urging her to say ""yes"". That's damn fine acting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
THAT was Reese Witherspoon? WOW!!,"I am a longtime Witherspoon fan since ""Legally Blonde"" but in this movie I forgot that was her as June Carter.

Story did drag a little at times but was true to that part of their lives as I am familiar with it--and yes, Cash was indeed that self-destructive, and Carter was that much a part of his survival. As much as a story of rags to riches, this is a story of love and redemption.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"A Powerful, Emotionally Uplifting Film","Like a number of other biopics, ""Walk the Line"" follows a familiar narrative pattern, the story of a man's fight against his inner demons. Recent examples include ""A Beautiful Mind"" and, to some extent, ""The Aviator"" (although Scorsese's film is a complex one and deals with much more than its subject's psychological problems). In this film, Johnny Cash's demons take the form of drug and alcohol abuse, although it is clear that the root of his problems is a lack of love.In the early scenes, we see Cash's childhood as the son of an impoverished Arkansas cotton-farmer, the death of his beloved older brother Jack in a childhood accident, his military service in Germany, his marriage to his sweetheart Viv, and his attempts to earn a living after leaving the forces, before he finally finds success as a musician in the mid fifties. Success, however, came more easily to him than did happiness. Cash's parents, as depicted here, are cold and unloving. In particular his father Ray is portrayed as a sour, morose man, permanently embittered by the loss of his elder son and with an ill-defined grudge against his younger one, for whom he never has a good word to say, even after Johnny has achieved success. Indeed, his son's success seems to make Ray even more bitter. As for his first wife Viv, she comes across in Ginnifer Goodwin's portrayal as not so much an unsympathetic character as a deeply conventional one, the sort of woman who would have been much happier as the wife of an unsuccessful salesman (which Cash briefly was during the early days of their marriage) than of a successful rock star.The turning-point comes when Cash meets the woman who will become the great love of his life, the country singer June Carter, with whom he forms a highly successful double-act. At first, however, this relationship remains purely platonic. June is a divorc√©e, emotionally scarred by the failure of her marriage, and she has moral scruples about getting romantically involved with a married man. They part, and June marries another man. Even when June re-enters his life several years later, after the breakdown of her second marriage and when Cash's marriage to Viv is over in all but name, they only have a brief sexual relationship because she is too worried by his drug habit to be able to commit herself emotionally to him. With the help of June and her parents, however, Cash is able to overcome his addictions, and they finally marry after he proposes to her on stage in the middle of a concert. (This was, apparently, a true incident). Just as a lack of love caused Cash's emotional problems in the first place, he is able to overcome them with the aid of the love of a good woman. (The love of God may also have had something to do with it; the film emphasises the part played in Cash's rehabilitation by the rediscovery of his Christian faith).I am not particularly knowledgeable about Cash's music, but from what I have heard it seems clear that its main characteristics were his deep, growling voice and a powerful, heartfelt emotional sincerity. (This is brought out in the audition scene where, after Cash and his band have signally failed to impress record company executive Sam Phillips with some tired, second-hand Gospel music, he gets a second chance to show what he can do and produces a powerful rendition of ""Folsom Prison Blues""). These are not characteristics that would be easy to counterfeit, so I was both surprised and impressed to learn that Joaquin Phoenix did all his own singing for the film. (My wife, who is a much greater Johnny Cash expert than I am, was even more impressed). Phoenix's acting in this film was just as powerful as his singing; particularly fine was the way he brought out the disastrous effect that Cash's addiction had on his talent. In one scene we see Cash trashing his room and tearing a washbasin off the wall; in another, we see his disastrous attempt at performing while under the influence of drugs.I was equally impressed by Reese Witherspoon's performance as June, especially as I had always tended to dismiss her as a lightweight actress, a perky little blonde girl with a boy's name and a big chin. Now legally brunette, Reese shows here that there is a lot more to her than her ""Legally Blonde"" airhead persona. June Carter, as portrayed here, comes across as a woman who, despite putting on a similarly dizzy persona as part of her stage act, was actually sensible, practical and caring. (Reese also did all her own singing). The Oscar nominations for the two leading performers are both well-deserved. Of the other performances, those that stood out were Robert Patrick as the bitter, censorious Ray and Dallas Roberts as Phillips.There is plenty of sentiment in ""Walk the Line"", but it does not drift into sentimentality in the way that some recent films have done. I found it a powerful, emotionally uplifting experience. As I said, I do not know much about Cash's music, but you do not need to in order to appreciate this film, any more than you need to understand John Forbes Nash's mathematical theories in order to enjoy ""A Beautiful Mind"". 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Great Bio,"Walk the Line (2005)**** (out of 4)Wonderful, if still flawed, story of Johnny Cash and June Carter is brilliantly brought to life by the two lead performers giving terrific performances. Phoenix was certainly born to play the role and delivers perfectly capturing the Man in Black, his drug addiction and his drawn out love to Carter. Witherspoon, in my opinion, is the best actress out there and I've been saying this the past twelve years or so and she really shines here. The two have wonderful chemistry together and the live numbers are filmed perfectly and the two have rather nice voices, although I don't think they sounded too much like the real couple. I said the film was flawed and it is in a certain way but I think this happens with a lot of films based on real people. I think the film is somewhat hampered by the PG-13 rating but in the end this is a love story and an actors showcase and both aspects come off perfectly. The history of Cash's rise to fame along side Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis was a nice added touch. As everyone here already knows I'm a die-hard fan of Dylan and in the film Phoenix and Witherspoon do a duet on ""It Ain't Me Babe"", which was so damn good that I'd call it better than any Dylan version I've heard and better than the real Cash/Carter duet.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

You Get only a Glimpse,"I've waited a long time for ""Walk the Line."" A fan of Johnny Cash all my life, I was anxious to see a movie about his life. No movie can do justice to a man like Johnny Cash in the time permitted. But the part of his life this movie deals with, is does well as far as the story and gives a strong performance of what it chooses to show about the singer. My opinion is that it leaves out some very important things about Johnny Cash. I never got to see in this film the creative intelligence of the Man In Black when it came to his ability to write songs and music. I see it in the way he deals with situations in his life but not otherwise. It was something that made him good all his career that was missing. About the two main roles. Reese Witherspoon absolutely convinced me I was watching June Carter (with the exception of the first scene she was in). Sorry, but I am not one who is crazy about Juaquin Phoenix's performance. As good as it was, he only had me convinced during the scenes he was singing. That part of his performance was powerful but that is where I think he concentrated his study and efforts. In the non singing scenes I had flashbacks to other Juaquin roles - especially in Gladiator. There are other actors that could have matched Reese's performance level - whether they were considered or offered, I do not know.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
At least one Academy Award Performance,"This movie was a very pleasant surprise. Although it got good reviews, it was only the lack of something better when my wife and I decided to catch a matin√©e before going for dinner that got me into the theater to see it.I was never much of a fan of Johnny Cash, who I often described as having a range of half an octave in an unpleasant key. Furthermore, I just did not believe Joaquin Phoenix was the right man for the role. I believe you had to see Cash to appreciate his unique style. ""The man in black"" looked big and powerful on stage as he held his guitar to his shoulder like a rifle, and when lyrics like, ""I killed a man just to watch him die"" passed his curled lip while his eyes seemed to dart about the room he could appear somewhat menacing. I didn't think Phoenix could convey that image.I was wrong. In the Folsom Prison scene, when Phoenix yanked the guitar to his shoulder and curled his lip as he poured forth the lyrics, the darting eyes had a look of madness in them. I felt a chill run down my spine ¬ñ it was as if Cash himself had taken over the actor's body. I actually felt as if I were watching the real Johnny Cash. I have never seen an actor actually become the real-life character he was playing the way Phoenix did. It was an Academy Award performance.Reese Witherspoon handled the June Carter role quite well. She conveyed the spirit quite well, although I don't think anyone ever had the energy and warmth in her comedy that Ms. Carter did. Think Minnie Pearl on speed.Cash is not portrayed as a sympathetic character. He was a self-centered man who could be downright mean. Of course, those characteristics are not exactly rare among big-time entertainers. What makes the story interesting is June Carter's unwillingness to marry him, in spite of her obvious love for him. She made him wait until he knew she could live without him if could not return that love and be faithful to her. Possibly, for the first time in his life he came to value someone else as much as he valued himself. It seemed to work and Cash, along with June Carter Cash, went on to a great career, and reportedly, a good life with the woman he loved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
One Cash Too Many: The June Carter Story,"Too early in ""Walk The Line"" a Cash-to-be, June Carter, is introduced into the story thereby subverting what should and could have been a more focused, intriguing and intimate story of ""The Man in Black,"" Johnny Cash, into a sappy, too-oft-told, linear, Hollywood-esquire, predictable story of star-crossed lovers. I would have no complaints about THAT story if the title to the film were, say, ""The June & Johnny Cash Story,"" or, better still, ""The Real Story Behind the Lyrics to ""I Walk The Line."""" But, that is not the case, and but so this well-intentioned and well-acted film suffers immensely from the unwelcome, shoe-horned introduction of Ms. Carter into this biopic of the film's central character, Johnny Cash.The introduction took place within the first 5 - 10 minutes of the film as young Johnny (12 yrs. old) listened to the Carter Family sing on an ole timey radio show. Even if one did not know that June and Johnny were to eventually get married many years later, one would have to be lacking concentration to overlook this early scene as an all too obvious set up for the story-line to the remainder of the film. The scene renders the youngster as smitten, portending his inexorable pursuit of June Carter. A pursuit the story-line doggedly follows instead of concentrating on other more interesting facets of Johnny Cash's life.Playing the older Johnny Cash, Joaquin Phoenix decides against impersonation, opting for a brilliant interpretation. Word has it that he learned some of Cash's songbook prior to shooting and his education into that songbook parallels his subject's education into the music business and the cult of celebrity. If the chronology of Cash's rise to fame was rendered accurately, Phoenix vividly, and subtly, portrayed Cash's meteoric rags to riches ride, presenting Cash as a contemplative young man still feeling the wounds from his father's stern and sometimes unforgiving presence, and the deeper pains suffered from having lost his best buddy, his older brother Jack, when Johnny was 12 yrs. of age. Both of these males shaped Johnny, Jack via Johnny's assessment of him as his wiser more righteous, if not ""right,"" sibling; his Dad via his take-no-nonsense, my-way-or-the-highway method of fathering. The resultant Johnny being a soft-spoken but headstrong kind of fella not all too sure of anything but his love of Carter Family music and a sense that he too could play his songs on the radio. Phoenix ""aged"" Johnny well, metering his subject's maturity deftly throughout the film.As June Carter, Reese Witherspoon played her character as caricature, employing a squeaky southern drawl and moving around, when on stage, like a teen-aged version of country comedienne, Minnie Pearl. This caricature was accurate because June (not unlike Michael Jackson, as an example) was a star since childhood, having the good (bad?) fortune to be one of the famous ""Carter Family,"" a seminal country/blue grass ensemble responsible, to this day (see Gillian Welch, et al.), for inspiring countless country and blue grass performers to try their hand at making a record.Subsequent to meeting Johnny, June's character changes slightly, more as an effect, I think, of aging and maturation, than any direct effect from Johnny Cash, country music star. I say this because June was Johnny's senior, by far, in the music business, having ascended to stardom while Johnny was listening to her on the radio--long prior to even recording his first hit. There was little that Johnny Cash, the star, was going to teach June about ""the business."" As such, as shown in the film, June always called Johnny out for his drug abuse and drinking, refusing to settle for the ""rock star"" version her friend, Johnny Cash.I feel that ""WTL"" suffers, as most biopics do, from broad-stroking exposition that mistakenly attempts--ever in vain--to tell a whole story instead of sacrificing trivial details for to paint a more solid portrait its subject. For instance, though Johnny's first marriage to Vivian is given a key role in the film, one is left to wonder why he and Vivian ever got married in the first place. We are hop-scotched along in that relationship. Initially we see Johnny, at that time serving our country in Germany, making a long-distance phone call to Vivian. Even then she is reluctant to believe in him, recounting her Dad's belief that his daughter's suitor ought to be career-minded instead of a dreamer. Then, once together, we see the two do nothing but square off in every subsequent scene, from the moment Johnny brings his work buddies home to rehearse some songs to the time after Johnny returns home from his first tour only to be further harangued by distrusting, over-burdened Vivian. Their in-fighting never ceases and one is left to wonder about the specifics of their hatred for each other.Ginnifer Goodwin, the actress portraying Vivian, was hung out to dry by the screenwriter, left without option to play the first Mrs. Cash as anything but a hen-pecking harridan whose suspect devotion to Johnny Cash never came without a price. Phoenix and Witherspoon, thanks be to their starring roles, had more to work with.Overly, ""Walk the Line"" suffered from the same kind of lack of alternatives provided to Ms. Goodwin. What should have been a far more intriguing examination of Johnny Cash, the person, the songwriter, the entertainer, was little more than a trite love story featuring Johnny Cash and June Carter as this movie's version of Romeo & Juliet or Oscar & Lucinda or Dick & Jane--take your pick. There should have been more examination of the man than of the particulars of pursuit of June.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Just thought it was brilliant,"This is time I ever enjoyed a film so much I felt the need to comment somewhere publicly.The film was subtly observed, extremely moving and, above all, inspiring. The portrayal of a man's near destruction by the demons of guilt and addiction, and his eventual rescue by the power of love and determination gives us all hope.Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix were phenomenal - giving masterful, heartfelt and totally authentic performances. They completely re-created the essence of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash without ever making you feel that you were witnessing imitation. I felt that they were wholly the characters and wholly themselves - the highest compliment you can give an actor.I haven't seen Capote yet, but, in any other year, Phoenix would have grabbed the trophy.Big kudos to Mangold too, for the sensitivity in which he told the story and his ability to pull these performances from the whole cast. It was beautifully framed and never at any moment one bit sappy.Finally, T Bone Burnett deserves massive praise for his uncanny ability to re-create one of the most exciting times in music ever.

An Oscar Winner For Sure,"Joaquin Phoenix has outdone himself in this performance as Johnny Cash. I was awestruck. True - Phoenix is too good looking to be Cash. But put that aside. His performance was off the charts. I've never seen ANYONE who could actually become the person he was portraying as Phoenix has done in this movie. It's beyond description. I had heard he had done his own singing in the movie, and as I watched I thought to myself, ""I must have heard wrong."" He doesn't have an ""awesome"" voice, but then neither did Cash. But take it from me, he can sing! My husband - sitting next to me - whispered, ""He must be lip sync-ing."" (He was unaware of the fact that Phoenix was supposed to have done his own singing.) The scene where he's at Folsum Prison is absolutely priceless. (Short, but priceless.)Reese Whitherspoon is perfect as the perky June Carter. And her voice is amazing. The evolving of their love affair was played out with such tenderness. I especially appreciated how each detail was created to build upon the next in order to show how Johnny and June were meant for each other.I'm not sure which kept happening more during the movie- my heart swelling with emotions like anger, compassion, and love, or my jaw dropping because of the unbelievable actingIf Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this performance there's something seriously wrong with the Academy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Not your average biopic,"I had no expectations for this movie; I hadn't seen the ads or heard the buzz. I wanted to go to the movies, had the choice between Pink Panther and Walk The Line, and having seen the Pink Panther ads, I picked this one. I went in expecting another biopic: OK to watch once, not remarkable in any way, just a quick fast-forward through the biggest moments of Johnny Cash's career. I was wrong.The focus on Johnny and June is what makes this movie so compelling. It serves as a filter: every detail about Johnny's career doesn't have be shown, we don't have to follow his life until he dies, and so forth. Instead, we can focus on the topic of Johnny and June, and the movie has a story with a structure and a happy ending. It also serves to make this movie more intimate than most biopics: we see Johnny's personal life, not only in short clips, but as a continuing theme throughout. It makes him more human. Stellar performances from both lead actors, particularly Reese Witherspoon, who portrays June's compelling personality very well. The chemistry between the two lead actors is great.The childhood scenes also worked. In most biopics, these are very short and seem like gratuitous foreshadowing of the star's later career (see the otherwise brilliant Man on the Moon, for example). Here that was avoided by focusing on the brother's tragic death. That and the father's attitude served to explain Cash's problems later in life, and they weren't overdone. The death was touching, but not too dramatized; it seemed fairly realistic. We got to see just enough of Jack and the family dynamics to understand how devastating his death would be for the others.The only thing I wanted to see more of was the courtship between Johnny and Viv; there never seemed to be any chemistry between them, as all we saw were their marital problems. It would have been nice to know why Johnny fell in love with her and what made them get married. It would have humanized Viv a bit; as it is, she comes off as a rather demanding woman who doesn't understand Johnny's devotion to music. I'm not saying she had no reason to complain, but this aspect was overdone in my opinion.The music scenes worked well to set the tone and serve as transitions throughout the movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon shine on stage and their chemistry is especially good in these scenes.All in all, this is one of the best biopics I've ever seen. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
I hate country music . . .but WOW!!,"I went to see this film last week with my Dad because we were bored basically, not much else. When I suggested we see Walk the line, he was a bit sceptical mainly because of the Country singing in it.Whilst wating for the film to start the over 60's parade started piling in, and we felt a bit silly sitting there. However once the film got started, I soon forgot about what was happening around me.It is a typical James Mangold film, showing not holding back on any of the characters intensity or passion for what they feel is right. It reminds me of Girl Interrupted (one of his previous films), in which he created such strong characters. He sets the picture of Johnny's life perfectly, and not knowing about Johnny Cash previously it was such a memorable experience. We are let in to Cash's heartbreak as his older brother and idol are taken from his life, and the rejection that he faces from his father. Phoenix is absolutely brilliant at the emotional scenes that would have sunk most other actors. He delivers an understated performance that is just so beautiful and pleasurable to watch.Enter Reese Witherspoon as June Carter: What an incredible performance, and as Oscar worthy a performance, which I have ever seen. Whilst Phoenix's portrayal invites you in to share his life, Resse contrasts this beautifully, leaving Carters feelings relitavely private. The bonding of these two perceived opposites is incredible to watch, how people with different ideals and takes on life, can share such a mutual bond.To top off an already incredible film, the live music scenes are quite simply astounding! The energy and Camera work used, really captivates you. Joaquin and Reeses voices are amazing, and it is hard to think that Reese once considered herself a bad singer.Miss this film at your peril . . .It is absolutely fantastic . . one of the best that I have seen for a long time",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Haven't we seen all this before,"For the second time in as many years, an autobiography of a music legend is rushed to the silver screen after the untimely death of their star character. Where Jamie Foxx channeled the late Ray Charles to awards glory in 2004, Joaquin Phoenix tries to emulate country music legend Johnny Cash in the new James Mangold film, Walk the Line.The comparison between Ray and Walk the Line are unescapable. Both films followed the music icons from their childhood through to the height of their stardom. Both films dealt with the drug abuse that almost ruined both of their careers. And both films spend a good deal of screen time on the various women in their lives.In Walk the Line, the woman who most influences Johnny Cash is June Carter (Resse Witherspoon, Legally Blonde). After we watch as Johnny survives the death of his older brother and his struggle to cut his first record and go on tour, Mr. Cash meets June Carter at a small auditorium gig that includes Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley on the same card. Although already married, Cash is immediately smitten by June's beauty and ability to communicate to an audience. You don't need to have seen the True E! Hollywood Story to know where this will lead.In truth, knowing where things will lead is exactly the problem with Walk the Line. It has been done before. Many times. A musical artist that becomes a sensation in a short period of time, gets hooked on drugs and then becomes clean towards the end of the film. Ho-hum. How many times have we seen that in the past ten years. Two films, Ray and Some Kind of Monster took similar paths just months before and Walk the Line gives us nothing new or interesting to marvel at as we take the already beaten path.What does save Walk the Line from the mediocre are the stellar performances by the two leads (Phoenix and Witherspoon). Joaquin learned to play the guitar from scratch for the role and even does all his own singing (take that Jamie Foxx!). His walk with the favoring limp and the way Cash talked out of the side of his mouth are mimicked to perfection by Phoenix who is sure to get his second Academy Award nomination when the are announced in just a few months.But performances can only take a film so far, and Walk the Line falls short of providing us any new insight into the world of a rock star that most of us growing up wishing to one day be a part of. In fact, the film spends too much time just mulling around that when we finally get to what should be the hi-light of the film ie. the concert at Folsom Prison that became one of the best live albums of all-time, we are not jumping out of our seats, clapping to the music having enjoyed the journey to this particular historic event.Instead, we meander with a man who never gained his fathers full respect, never was a good husband to his first wife and never lived a life that was so extraordinary that people would shell out hard earned dollars just to see how a legend walked the line.www.robertsreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Mesmerising,"This is the first time I've actually commented on a movie here but the movie left me mesmerized and I felt the need to share my views.You live through the joys and internal misery of The Man in Black and the journey is perfected with the superb acting, beautiful music (and I was not a fan of country music) and the whole story - the highs and lows of his musical success, his battle with alcohol and pain-killer addiction and the great love between he and June Carter.Joaquin and Reese are absolutely amazing in this movie - they are so convincing in their roles that you actually feel a special connection between the lead stars.

I loved it!,"I am not an expert on Johnny Cash, I liked him, but he was before my time. I have been reading about the Carter family for the last couple of years and so was familiar with the story of June and John. Joaquin blew me away and Reese proved that she can act and deserves to be taken seriously. I loved this movie, I would love to hear the two of them comment on this film. They can't have been huge fans either, but for some reason their chemistry makes this work. I recommend it highly. I have heard some of the criticisms, Joaquin is too short, Reese too pretty but I had no trouble believing them as John and June. I wanted to be entertained, not pick something or someone apart and I was entertained, transported even, to their lives. What more should a movie do?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Unimportant, rather dull movie, despite Witherspoon's usual excellence, and Phoenix not Cash","Not sure why it has become so trendy to say this is a great movie--it is not. First, Johnny Cash was a big man--that was a major part of his identity--while Phoenix is very short. The idea that ""Phoenix was Johnny Cash"" is absurd. Second, the movie leaves out many of the songs that people really identify with Cash, ""A Boy Named Sue"" just one of the numerous obvious examples. Third, the movie lacks the type of passion that makes films memorable years hence. This one, like Capote, which also features one great acting performance and little else, will be largely forgotten. Fourth, it is worth asking why we need biographies of Johhny Cash or Truman Capote, anyway. If we are going to do biographies, let's at least start with the truly historic figures. Witherspoon has great screen presence, which means she is always interesting, and she does a fine job here, but it isn't enough to make this movie worth seeing again. Not my cup of tea, and frankly, it's high ratings here are a little disconcerting. Do we embrace mediocrity so lovingly now?",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
not a good legacy  for Cash,"I saw this movie and wasn't very impressed. I am in my late 50's and always liked johnny;s music, but didn't know his story now I do and now I don't like his music cause I don't like him anymore. The movie depicts Johnny Cash as I drug addict, wife beating, child hating, parent disrespecting, self centered, loser all characteristics I don't care for in a person. Watching this movie was painful and many times i just wanted to get up and leave. Reese Witherspoon deserved her Oscar but Juaquin was no Johnny cash not looks at all not voice or even mannerisms. The only time the music sounded good was at the Folsom Prison before Johnny got on the stage the prelude beat music got me pumped until Joaquin started to sing and he ruined it. I rated this movie a 5 and was to generous.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
The Best Picture of 2005!,"I first heard about this film on the internet way back when it was announced that they were going to make the biopic of Johnny Cash. I didn't think too much of it and, as months went by, I started becoming more and more interested in it. I thought Joaquin Phoenix was great in a lot he had done since ""Gladiator"" and was becoming a fan. Reese Witherspoon I aways saw as a girl next door type so I was up in the air with her playing June Carter.When I finally saw a preview of the film, I immediately wanted to check it out do to my curiosity and speculation. Something inside me wanted this to be good so I checked it out. I was hooked from beginning to end and I even found myself toe-tapping to the music(I am not even a fan of country!). The performances are outstanding with both Phoenix and Witherspoon at their career defining best. I am pulling for both to win the Oscars for Actor and Actress, but am shocked to find out it isn't up for Best Picture! It's an outrage!!! Because whether the Academy agrees or not(apparently, not) this IS the Best Picture of 2005!!! See it for an entertaining story, music, drama and overall great film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
light on story but the music is excellent,"This film follows in the footsteps of other biopics such as 'Ray' in presenting the story of country music's Man in Black, the late, great Johnny Cash, and his on-off friendship/relationship with the wayward daughter of the Carter family, June.As Cash, Joaquin Phoenix is perfect, with facial expressions and vocal technique on target throughout. His performances of iconic songs such as Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, and Jackson, are exciting and perceptive. Reece Witherspoon is much less irritating than usual as the jokey June Carter, and her vocals are excellent as well.The story starts with Cash preparing for his gig at Folsom Prison, where he recorded his best-selling live LP, and takes the form of a flashback to his early life with dad, mum and elder brother in the 1940s. We get some sense of where his roots were and where he wanted to go.With first wife and baby settled in Memphis, Cash heads off to Sun Records where he secures a record deal with the legendary Sam Phillips alongside Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis (both depicted in this film; Tyler Hilton is an OK Elvis, while Waylon Payne is excellent as Jerry Lee). From then on we watch his ascent into stardom and his descent into the grip of drug addiction; all the time shadowed by his faithful friend and singing partner June.The plot wears a little thin but is more than fleshed out by the fabulous musical numbers (filmed with real energy and mostly provided in full), and the central performance of Phoenix.Other notable performances in the cast include Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's frustrated first wife, Vivian; Shooter Jennings playing his father, Waylon; and Robert Patrick as Ray, the father who can never forgive his younger son for growing up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great from start to finish..,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I'm not a Johnny Cash fan, although I've always admired his music. I actually went to see another movie, but chose Walk The Line because it was about to begin, and am I glad I did! Joaquin Phoenix gives a first rate performance that fully deserves the Oscar. He gets into the role so well, you feel you're seeing the movie from Cash's point of view. Added to that is Reese Witherspoons equally splendid performance - both actors manage to give a fully believable performance, which is difficult when portraying well-known characters.The scenes where Cash's older brother dies are chilling - Lucas Till makes Jack such a solid, likable character that his death is really tragic and sad.He and Ridge Canipe build up an excellent relationship early, and each actor must have a promising career ahead. They convey the hardships of that time so well without relying on overkill.Set in the context of changing times, social attitudes, and the pressures of Cash's fame, his family dynamics and his guilt over what happens to his brother, and surrounded by first rate music, this is a movie that deserved recommendation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Wow,"Wow. Finally, you can believe the reviews! This film is awesome. I did listen to Johnny Cash before I saw Walk The Line, and I knew generally about his life - but not in that much detail. When I watched the film though, it almost swallowed me up. It completely hypnostised me. It takes you into a world of music and drama that you will find difficult to tear yourself away from. When the credits started rolling I really did want to sit there again and watch it for a second time. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing as Johnny Cash and I can't find a single floor in his performance. Then there is Reese Witherspoon, who again plays an unbelievably convincing role as June Carter. Both actors have a chemistry which makes the film that bit more wonderful. I very rarely watch a film and say ""My gosh, that was so good"" at the end of it; but at the end of that I could only say praise about this truly excellent film. It's a shame that Johnny and June couldn't be around to see this amazing film of their lives - because they would be so proud of it. If you want to see a film that will touch your heart, and make you truly believe that Johnny Cash's music is the best of its type - just watch this film and you will fall him love with it. Brilliant movie, amazing actors - definitely a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
The best film made in years!,"Well I have to say, I did (and do) like Johnny Cash's music before I saw this movie. But after seeing this movie, I saw the person, the character who wrote these songs.This movie is one of the greatest I have seen, whatever genre. It really feels like you get into J. Cash's life and the actors! WOW! They do an amazing job! The feel when Joaquin Phoenix (as J. Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (as June Carter) perform on stage in the movie, can only be described as... hmmm.. beyond amazing!Nothing in the movie feels over-made or unreal.To sum it all up, I say: ""I drowned in the movie, and at the end of the movie, I felt like I was waking up from a very real dream""SEE THIS MOVIE!!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Enjoyable and well-acted,"I wanted to see this film for 2 reasons. First off, I am a long time Joaquin Phoenix fan. I remember him when he had to fit his tiny little body into a huge space suit and save the day in Space Camp, and when he was a troubled pre-teen having to deal with a deadbeat dad in Parenthood. As an adult, he conquered Rome. And now, he's conquered again. I must confess, I know little about the real Mr. Cash, so I can't comment on his portrayal, but the performance was stellar as always. His emotional moments with June(Reese) were moving. And his reactions to his father's rejections and humiliations felt so natural---and that piercing stare over the Thanksgiving table was wonderfully intense. I would have loved to see him get best actor (still not a Clooney fan). Oh well.Secondly, okay, you caught me...THE HYPE--- I normally HATE, and I can't emphasize this enough, HATE hyped up movies...However, if it involves one of my favs, whelp...I'm guilty.As far as my thoughts on the movie in general...It was enjoyable. The supporting cast was talented and did well. Although, I didn't see anything special about Reese's performance. Yeah, it was good, but, come on, Oscar-worthy? I didn't find the movie boring as some on the site have said. It's a story about a man's life. Honestly, and I've said this before, I'm not sure what those people were expecting to happen. maybe they thought they were there to see Crash and got confused.In summary, I liked it. It's worth the time!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Hot. You heard it , sexy and hot!","I don't need to say much. Reese Witherspoon is excellent. She is a fun June, delicate in body but filled with confidence and spirit. Reese is great cast against Joaquin because she is so slight. He is 5'8"" and certainly not the height which helped Johnny Cash command his audience. What is Joaquin Phoenix? He is magnificent, gorgeous, and hot, hot, hot. OMG, he manages to look at June/Reese with the adoration that Ewan McGregor gave Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, except it isn't innocent. It smolders with passion and yearning. Where did he come from? This isn't the little creep from To Die For. This isn't the smarmy creep from Gladiator. This is a complex, brooding, fascinating man that would be worth the trouble to get next to, and trouble he is, in spades. Oh, and the singing? It's fabulous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Well worth the time...,This movie is amazing. I literally have nothing bad to say about it at all. Joaquin Phoenix does for Johnny Cash what Jamie Foxx did for Ray Charles. He brings to the screen the true story of a legend. Not just the good but the bad too. Phoenix and Foxx both became their character. They convince you that your watching the subjects life and not a movie. You feel like your standing at a window watching as this story all unfolds in front of you. The movie moves along very well and dosen't seem to spend to much time on any one aspect but still manages to go in to great detail of his life. If Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best male performance then there is no justice in Hollywood.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Cash on delivery,"I'm no fan of country music with its corny ""somebody done somebody wrong"" lyrics, yee-ha vocals and gloopy strings, but Johnny Cash was definitely different. Although not quite the icon here in the UK that he undoubtedly was in his native America, his ""outlaw"" stance, along with his hard-living ways and honest lyrics for my money put him a country mile (ouch!) ahead of the current crop of mega-successful but anodyne superstars. Pop culture bio-pics have been intermittently successful at the box-office and ""Walk the Line"" was quick to follow the success of ""Ray"" in celebrating the wayward life of a one-time neglected but lately revered musical giant and there's no doubt Cash was deserving of the accolade. The film itself is fine to look at, capturing especially well in its early sequences, vistas of the American South, back-dropping young John's cotton-picking days with its attendant tension in his family life, particularly his strained relationship with his taciturn, hard-drinking father, exacerbated after the accidental death of his (and his father's favourite) adored older brother. The director seems to mix Cash's story up with blues-man Robert Johnson who surely cornered the rights to images about cross-roads, which recur frequently in the movie, in any case it's a hackneyed image at the best of times. The movie follows the parabolas in Cash's career up to his inspired and ultimately triumphant return to glory in 1968 when he recorded his seminal ""Live at Folsom Prison"" album, although I would argue his greater triumph was achieved at the end of his life when he collaborated with Rick Rubin even as he was dying of cancer. Interesting to compare the time-line of his career with another Southern boy, Elvis, whose stellar career was foundering until he too in 1968 made his comeback with his ""From Memphis to Vegas"" album and TV Special. Although enjoyable and well acted (and sung), the movie does suffer from Joaquin Phoenix's inability to convey the sheer presence of the man; wearing black shirts and dropping his voice a notch or two not being enough for me for him to truly get into character. A similar lack of veracity affects the depiction of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and other rockers from that era, - I can't believe in a nation full of Elvis impersonators the casting company couldn't have come up with a better look- and sound-alike than we get here. Reese Wotherspoon is fine in the role of the elusive and effusive June Carter, the love of his life although I wouldn't have marked her performance as Oscar-worthy. Parts of the movie seem apocryphal too (did Cash really happen by Sun Studios just as Elvis was setting up?) but generous dramatic licence has been the watchword of screen biographies since the year dot so I'll let that and others of its ilk pass. In conclusion then an entertaining pass at a big man's up and down life, but in the end the real deal is Cash's heartbreaking video rendition of Trent Raznor's ""Hurt"", a life encapsulated in only four minutes. The man truly came around...",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Confused as to why these filmmakers were allowed to make this...,"Now, I must begin by stating that I've never really been that big of a Johnny Cash fan. But, maybe that's why my opinion of this film holds some modicum of credence: a lack of bias. Before seeing the film, I didn't know too much about his life except that one of my all-time heroes Shel Silverstein wrote many of his songs, and a bit about what he did before he died (working with the likes of Rick Rubin and Trent Reznor, his wife dying right before he did, etc.)So, I went into WALK THE LINE with a true tabula rasa, not knowing what to expect out of his life.My only really bias for the film at all was that James Mangold was tapped as the director even though his GIRL,INTERRUPTED was mediocre at best, IDENTITY was absolutely horrendous (and forgettable), and KATE&LEOPOLD was certainly nothing to think about. Gill Dennis, the writer, had done nothing at all beforehand except for a few random movies no one has heard of before (LINCOLN ON THE NOSE?!?)And these are the people who are to make a biopic about Johnny Cash?!? Yes, I never really liked his music too much, but this doesn't mean I don't respect him as a man and for what his music did for the rock-a-billy and folk music world (music of which I enjoy quite well).It wasn't too bad for me that the character of Johnny was a whining milquetoast throughout the entire film who spent his time either crying, falling down, doing copious amounts of an unknown drug every five minutes, or begging June Carter to marry him (and then having constant childish temper tantrums whenever she would say no), but that nothing in the movie ever changed.There was never a sense of growth or movement in the film. There was never a real sense of conflict less his problems with June Carter, which I would imagine must have been a LITTLE more three-dimensional than the representation in this banal film.The steady ebb and flow of the film grew further and further monastic, as any time there was any real potential for something new, time was compacted and we were left experiencing nothing. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** (a sequence toward the end of the film in which Johnny is at his nadir, living in an apartment with Waylon Jennings, and then all of a sudden it's years later and he's wandering through a beautiful forest to discover a magnificent treehouse that he can now suddenly afford... what happened in the middle there, James and Gill?!? Why not let us in a little bit?!?)***DEFINITE SPOILER**** The hackneyed ""love"" (really no semblance of love here, Cash just basically beats Carter down as much as he can until she's so embarrassed and mentally abused that she gives in... I doubt this is the way it happened, and if it did, that's a real shame) story completely takes over every other aspect of the film or the story of Johnny Cash the musician. The three or four other plotpoints slowly dissipate such as exhibited with his sense of immense loss over his brother or his problems with his father. In fact, the end of the film abruptly and without any hint just brings us to some random moment in Cash's life when: BAM! Dad loves him again for no reason we, the audience, can ascertain. But, I guess when the movie ends, you have to tie up those loose strings even if they're not ready to be tied.The movie was certainly watchable, but in the end wholly prototypical and bland. I'm just as confused why this movie is garnering the praise its gained (less the usual Hollywood politics nonsense) as why it was made by its filmmakers.But, I guess that's how it goes.Matt's suggestions for TRUE Best Pictures of the Year:1) LAST DAYS 2) WHERE THE TRUTH LIES 3) ROMAN POLANSKI'S OLIVER TWIST 4) DEAR WENDY 5) KISS KISS BANG BANG 6) GRIZZLY MANThanx, MK",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Powerful entertainment,"Well dammit - I am not a country music fan and went to see this film kicking and screaming along with my wife - and loved it. The best adjective I can use when describing this film is Power. A powerful storyline with a huge performance by Joaquin Phoenix. To me,a Great Film starts strong from the very beginning...no need for a long build up to the point of entertaining the audience - just get us there quickly and keep us there without any lags or dead spots. This film delivers that with a superb screenplay that starts with his sharecropper childhood but doesn't dwell too long on it to the point of overdoing it. We get a good taste of his hardscrabble early life and the get to see the beginning of his lifelong relationship with his father - which is well continued throughout the film.And yes as other critics have written, this music biopic goes into the usual portrayal of what musicians lives inevitably are like - touring, substance abuse, problems in personal relationships and - hopefully for them - a later life of good personal habits and steady relationships. The fact that so many musicians lives have followed this path, is not the fault of the screenwriter - this too - like Ray Charles - was the life of Johnny Cash as it has been with Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and ad infinitum numbers of individuals who make their living as recording and performing artists.Phoenix's performance is spot on - both in terms of portraying Cash's on stage persona as well as his personal life and battles with drug addiction. Dammit he becomes Johnny Cash...What more can you say about an actor portraying the life of a performer?Reese Witherspoon is superb in her role as June Carter Cash. Right out of the Legally Blonde mode and into a believable and realistic portrayal of the classic southern country girl who spends a lifetime on the stage... And the hell of it is - apparently both their voices are so good, they could be recording artists in their spare time...Starts strong and never, ever lets up. Go see this sure to be Academy Award winner...",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
An achievement on and off the screen,"I guess I'd never listened to more than a couple of Johnny Cash songs before seeing this movie - and even then only with half an ear. A lovingly-crafted film, Walk the Line not only got me listening to his music and seeing qualities in it not at first obvious, but impressed me with the way it carries off a difficult undertaking and delivers remarkable performances (especially that of Reese Witherspoon).The image of Johnny Cash seen in the first two thirds of Walk the Line is that of an unredeemed and not awfully likable man, ignoring his wife and child, recording songs with questionable lyrics, and getting involved in drink and drugs with all the attendant ills. He meets fellow singer June Carter (who is also married) and is instantly attracted. Cash's behaviour continues to worsen and he narrowly avoids jail or worse.Many of Cash's songs are written from the depths of despair, by a man with no self-esteem. He dresses in black and seems to succeed against all best advice. Sometimes he is too drunk or drugged to perform. But at one point he recovers enough to read fan mail - much of it from prison inmates. His songs, it seems, have given them hope, a sense that someone understands them. For Cash, there are people who appreciate and love him when it seems no-one else does. He dedicates his efforts.Walk the Line is a film of bad examples and prejudice, but also the possibility that there is a light at the end of the darkest tunnel. Cash's strict father blames him for the death of the other sibling and nothing Cash does can win a single word of praise from his father. Society condemns June Carter for being a divorc√©e. The whole film is redolent of the evils of straight-laced righteousness and arrogance (ironically, the Christianity that has spawned such attitudes is later embraced). But each individual has their own path to find. Cash's descent into hell was (without his intention) his means of reaching out to others. The legacy is one of which the music scene is appropriately proud.All the songs in the movie are sung live, which might not suit die-hard fans (Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and convincing though - I had to compare his renderings with the originals afterwards to see the leap in voice quality). But the real discovery is Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) who has found the most charismatic role of her career. When she enters, the screen lights up, and the expressiveness of her face, her perfect characterisation, and the sheer devotion and joy that she brings to the role kept me glued to the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
It's life and Energy Transcends Forumlaic Structure,"It's strange that someone as unique and original as Johnny Cash would have a movie made about his life that is so formulaic-it was almost scene for scene the same outline as Ray. However, Mangold does something here that most Bio-pic's don't. He narrows the subject matter down to two plot lines, often ignoring other things that would have been interesting, or cool to put in. At its heart this is a love story-a film about the redemptive power of love, true love, problems and all. At the same time its also a film about redemption in general. This is due in part because of a great script, and incredible performances. Phoenix is amazing as Cash. He is not just impersonating him, but adds a level of depth. Robert Patrick was also surprisingly great as Cash's father. But its Reese Witherspoon who steals the show, mostly because I forgot she could act. While the composition of the film is nothing new, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the editing is great. In fact everything about the film is great technically. However, what makes this such a great film is its energy. There is a life to this film that transcends its formulaic nature, and adds a level of emotion that is more than just from the memory of the man in Black. Mangold, Phoenix, and Witherspoon create complex and beautiful characters that we care about, and love despite their faults. And that is the beauty of Cash's life and the message of this film-that Love, from God, from each other, can save even the worst of us, despite of ourselves.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A rare cinematic achievement,"I do not watch many films. Music moves me in a way that film very rarely, if ever, does. Which is why I took a chance on ""Walk the Line;"" it is about a musician. I could not have made a better choice. I have never seen a film quite as moving, or absorbing. From the opening scene, to the end of the film, ""Walk the Line"" gets in your blood, and stays there. Nothing is wasted. Every scene, every word, and every gesture, has meaning and contributes not only to the story, but the tension, and drama as well. As Joaquin Phoenix says at the end of the movie, "" ¬Ö you gotta pull the string tight,"" and the film does exactly that. The acting, directing, sound, screenplay, and costume all mesh together to create a whole that far outweighs the sum of the parts. If this film does not make artistic history, it will certainly make cinematic history.There are two reasons why this may very well be the case. One reason is the exceptional construction of the film. One could begin with the sound work, as for example the eerie background music, usually a guitar, that accompanies many scenes. Such background music not only enlarges the particular scene, but lends a surreal resonance that elevates the scene not only visually, but mentally, and emotionally as well. Or, the thick popping of old style camera flashbulbs also enhances the drama of several scenes. And the film editing results in a movie that tends to flow like a river. One scene often begins as the prior scene ends. When John asks June to come back on the tour, "" I miss the music,"" the playing of an auto-harp is heard in the background, and grows louder, as the film transitions to a long shot of her in an out door amphitheater, in front of hundreds, singing her rendition of ""Wildwood Flower."" The scene, and the song is one of the most captivating in the film. This technique is used throughout. Most importantly however is the exceptional, and innovative cinematography. Normally when actors are filmed on-stage the point of view (POV) is from that of the audience, which is bland not only visually, but emotionally as well. Within ""Walk the Line"" the POV is largely from that of the actors on-stage while they are singing. Just like the actors on-stage, one is gripped in the spotlights. And the second reason is the acting. Both actors complement each other in a manner that I have rarely if ever seen. Like night, and day neither could exist without the other. How they managed to bring to life Johnny Cash, and June Carter in such an absorbing and convincing manner is beyond me. The plot revolves essentially around his obsession with, or desire for her, and is the string that ties the film together and keeps everything tight. She is without a doubt his salvation. He meets her for the first time back in 1956 in Nashville while performing at the Opry. However, they do not finally marry until 1968. The events of these years, most importantly her attraction to him, and at the same time repulsion (because of his addiction to amphetamines, which he eventually overcomes), make up the bulk of the film, ending with his famous Folsom prison concert. But it is the singing, the sounds these two actors make on-stage that is, I believe, in some ways almost historic. In some cases the renditions these actors produce, either alone, or usually together rivals the original, as for example ""Get a Rhythm"" by Phoenix, or as already mentioned the very moving ""Wildwood Flower"" by Witherspoon. Together their best effort in the film may be ""Times A Wastin."" Lastly, this film cannot be seen just once. The psychology of the two main characters is complex, and there are nuances that inhabit nearly every scene. This film is a rare artistic achievement. And yet for some disturbing reason the film has been overlooked by that astute institution known as the ""Academy."" Witherspoon, and Phoenix were nominated for Best Actress, and Actor, and the film has also received nominations for Costume, and Editing, but was left out of the Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay categories, and most importantly the Best Cinematography category. The ones that really count. It has been argued that Academy voters opted for films that made some contribution to, or discussion of controversial social subjects as for example, ""Brokeback Mountain,"" (homosexuality), or ""Transamerica,"" (about a pre-op transsexual). I am not sure just how important these subjects really are. Having ones genitals surgically removed, or altered is extreme behavior, and I think most of us are familiar with the subject of homosexuality. Just because a film deals with a controversial sexual subject (""Brokeback Mountain,""), or extreme sexual behavior (""Transamerica,""), why does this fact justify a nomination in any category? And why this infatuation with sexuality on the part of Academy voters? Should a film not have to rise to some level of artistic achievement? If one considers the fact that superb acting cannot be separated from superb directing, and the screenplay, then the voting on the part of Academy members becomes a little absurd. Phoenix himself said to director James Mangold during his acceptance speech at the Golden Globe Awards that half of this (his award), should go to you (Mangold). And if the acting is so good, then why was the film left out of the Best Film category, and again Best Director?

"I don't rush out to buy, but I did this one. Seen twice in two days!!!","The only thing short on this movie is it could have gone further into their life together. It was tender, painful, loving, real life emotion through addition and the love that is strong enough to break it. It had points to make, viewpoints from all sides of the people involved.It was said when the movie was coming out that Miss Vivian was discredited in this movie. I didn't see it that way at all. I saw her portrayed as a woman who was fighting to save her marriage who was a wonderful mother and wife while her husband was hellbent on finding his dream. Many women have walked in those shoes and I think she was portrayed with utmost respect and at that time of his life, she was probably better without him.But the love story of Johnny and June showed a fire that wouldn't go out and that is what the story was intended to prove -- a lifetime love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A solid biopic elevated by heavyweight performances and slick direction,"Walk The Line doesn't quite reveal the full Johnny Cash story, and may have all the predictability of standard biopics that we've all seen before, but is executed with such skillful relish and expert performances that I really didn't care if I saw it coming. Like any good album it has you moving to the beat and miming the words. The film documents Cash's early life. As a child Cash witnessed the death of his older brother, which his dad always held against him. After leaving home, he then sets out to be discovered, despite having a band of mechanics who can't play for squat. Eventually he is discovered, and then goes on tour with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presly - and this is where he finds June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), whose relationship with Cash provides us with the heart of the film.Johnny Cash loved Joaquin Phoenix ever since he saw him in Ridley Scott's Gladiator. So did I. Like his late brother River, he has this raw intensity that just grabs you in. He was certainly the finest thing in Oliver Stone's putrid yet compelling U-Turn, and stood toe-to-toe with Mel Gibson in Signs. This is definitely his finest hour. He walks, talks, moves and even sings like the ""man in black"". He is a tower of screen presence. And the most remarkable thing is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash is even better. She is a fizzy mix of southern charm and sass, making June as likable as she is fierce. Phoenix is dead on but never astonishing. I still think Heath Ledger is the most deserving of the big Oscar gong, but Reese Witherspoon deserves all the awards she gets. When the film threatens not to work, their performances ensure that any liberties Mangold takes he gets away with easily.No it isn't a deep insight into Cash's tormented soul. It is well documented that his problems existed with him deep into later life. But this is a fantasy vision of his love for June. It's not, and never aspires to be, a documentary of his life. Joaquin Phoenix is great, Reese Witherspoon is amazing and James Mangold has regained the form he showed with the likes of Copland. Sure it's flawed, but I loved the characters enough that I forgot how easy it is to assume that it'll pan out the way it does.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Johnny Cash is Worth Your Time & Cash,"""Walk the Line"" Opened this Weekend with TOO Much Hype to be a Good Movie, Right?Fellow Film Buffs (FBs),Nothing tires me more than going to a much anticipated box office opener only to be fooled by the ""Hype"", leaving the theatre disappointed because I wasted $12 and 2 hours of my limited free time. I'm going to share with you the ""Three Realities of Movie Hype"", and whether ""Walk the Line"" is worth your time and money (without revealing too much).""The Three Realities of Movie Hype""1) The BUZZ: Come on, of course this movie is going to be hyped; it's a movie about the legendary Johnny Cash! I mean, even after he died he won the ""2002 Grammy for Best Country Album"". Honestly, I am not a fan of Johnny Cash, I never liked his music, nor do I like Country Music, but the guy is legendary, so I was curious. As a result of the Johnny Cash ""Hype"", I saw Joaquin Phoenix every where, on countless magazine covers, billboards & ads, and TV shows including Oprah. I heard three things about ""Walk the Line"":i) Was Joaquin Phoenix 'too wimpy' to play the gritty Johnny Cash? ii) Forget learning how to play the ""Ghee-Tar"" Joaquin Phoenix took 6 weeks 'just' to learn how to hold the guitar properly - ya right, ""Ree-Tar-Did"". iii) Joaquin (pronounced ""WAA-keen"") is quitting acting for life after this film because he wants a real life. Maybe because it's of his highest paycheck yet (a salary of 3.5 million dollars). Sadly, nobody wants to see this fine actor go.2) The TRAILER: After watching the trailer, I could just hear the evil Producers voice say ""That's right, and even if this movie sucks, we're still going to get millions of Johnny Cash fans to the movie and buying the soundtrack¬Ö Hahahahaha. Suckers!""3) The STARS: Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix. Reese (what kinda name is that anyhow?) has not made a movie I wanted to see since ""Cruel Intentions"". Come on, Reese ""Legally Blonde 2"", why? Joaquin on the other hand is ""the man"", his ""real"" performances leave you wanting more: ""Signs"", ""The Village"", and ""Gladiator"" are all sensationally acted.WINNER or BLUFF*?""Walk the Line"" is a Winner! Go see this movie because Joaquin delivers, this is Reese's best movie ever, and perhaps, like me (a hater of country music), you too will find yourself thumping your feet to the music.*Unfortunately, all adequately 'Hyped' movies win their money back and more¬Ö we're the only ones who lose our precious time and money.Film Buffing by JP Richards""Taking the risk out of going to hyped movies.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
if you like Johnny Cash his music you definitely need to check out the performances of Joaquin and Reese !,"First of all, liking something or not is very subjective, whatever is written here, you should go watch the movie yourself and make up your own mind. In my view the performance of Joaquin and Reese as Johnny and June is fabulous and talent full! BUT i can't say that this is the best film from 2005...no, not in my opinion. The amount of dead performers in this movie is exaggerated...Elvis, Orbison, j-l Lewis + entourage... In a certain scene somebody encourages J.Cash to take pills and says, Elvis takes 'em too. I don't know why that sneer was necessary for.. So, enjoy Joaquin and Reese for their musical performance and the magnificent love story between them... The rest is a little ""zombie returns""-show because of too much dead artists !",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Phoenix Painful in ""Walk the Line""","Comparing ""Walk the Line"" to ""Ray"", is comparing night to day. Both are biopics of famous singers with troubled pasts, but the similarities end there. Phoenix's singing is akin to fingernails going down a chalkboard. Witherspoon saves what little is good in the film. Phoenix's acting is palpable, but as an entertainer, Cash was a singer, not an actor. As a Johnny Cash fan, listening to the music in this movie is arduous. Phoenix couldn't carry a tune in a bucket and fails miserably to hit any of Cash's famous low, soul gripping notes. Why the studio didn't dub over Phoenix as did Universal in most of ""Ray"" is truly dumbfounding. Foxx sang a few songs but for the most part, gave way to the authentic Ray Charles. The irony is, Foxx can sing. Phoenix butchers the Man in Black's warmly cold, rumbling deep sounds that made Cash legendary. When Sam Phillips of Sun Records asks ""Cash"" in the movie ""if (he) only had one song to sing, what would it be,"" Phoenix lumbers into a drolling off-key rendition of Folsom Prison as could only be worsened by American Idol's William Hung.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Hard line to walk,"When I first heard that there was to be a ""Johnny Cash Movie""... I was fairly skeptical. I grew up listening to Johnny Cash and I was horrified to think that Hollywood would/may/could destroy the legend as it stood in our minds. How wrong I was... This movie is awesome. The acting is flawless and believable, the music is great but not overdone and the created atmosphere of the 1950's and 60's is near perfect. It is a sad, funny, uplifting and demoralizing cornucopia of a story about a man who rose from a dirt poor and bitter childhood to become a music superstar to the world. Along the way he encounters the likes of Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis and Waylon Jennings, all introduced in a passing parade kind of manner. The drug issues that almost destroyed John's life are there in all their stark honesty. The failed marriage and an almost predatory pursuit of June Carter are skillfully handled. The whole thing just works. Add to that the fact that the actors actually performed the musical numbers in the movie can only been seen as a credit to their dedication to the project. It is a story and a movie to behold and to be long remembered.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
One of the best I've seen in years,"I cannot say enough about this movie! While watching Joaquin Phoenix play this role, you forget that it's him. He really becomes the character with such amazing skill. His singing gave me chills - you really can't believe it's him and not a dub of Johnny Cash. His range is astounding, being able to go from high to the really low notes Cash is so famous for - without breaking or sounding sour. You walk out of the movie knowing that he's the Oscar winner this year - there can be no question. And Reese... that girl just continues to build herself in my eyes as one of the great actresses of our time. For those who think all she's good for is eye candy or a romantic comedy, you are dead wrong. And in my opinion, her singing was even better than the woman she portrayed. This was an explosive relationship, and the two of them pulled it off perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Here Comes the Man in Black.,"The life of Johnny Cash (dynamite performance from Joaquin Phoenix) is told from humble beginnings in the Arkansas cotton fields to musical success and a terrible addiction to liquor and prescription medication. Tragedy strikes early on as a young Cash (Ridge Canipe) must deal with the death of his older brother (Lucas Till) and a standoffish relationship with a stern father (Robert Patrick in an appropriately rough part). Adulthood brings military service, marriage (to sweetheart Ginnifer Goodwin) and finally a chance at the brass ring (not to mention a relationship with fellow singer June Carter played to the hilt by Reese Witherspoon). ""Walk the Line"" is no doubt inspired by the amazing success that ""Ray"" produced last year. Phoenix and Witherspoon get in a fevered rhythm of performing excellence as co-writer/director James Mangold keeps the drum beating with his quick pace and lightning fast flash-points. Although a bit long and sometimes too loud, ""Walk the Line"" still proves that a cinematic biography done correctly can lead to beautiful music for all to see and hear. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
an all together good film,"I just saw this film about 2 hours ago and it is probably one of the best bio-films i have ever seen...maybe except Sid and Nancy. i think the entire cast was phenomenal. my only real problem with the film is the editing, it seems to have been cut with a meat cleaver. By this i mean, the chronology of the film seems a bit erratic for the first 30 minute, but gets better toward the end of this 2 hour film.The music in the films is fantastic and shared a complete likeness with Johnny cash himself.

I'm trying to rectify my wrongs."" Well Mr Pheonix,relax you've done the best!

Admirable Effort That Never Quite Strikes the Magic It's Striving For,"Joaquin Phoenix takes on the early life and times of Johnny Cash, with something more than an assist from Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. It's great material, more factual than many dramaticized biopics, but seems like it's always standing just a hair away from fully embracing the man and his mythos. Phoenix emphatically pours himself into the role, but can't quite nail the man's authoritative, larger-than-life presence either on the stage or off it. That, along with his ever-so-slightly imperfect take on Cash's legendary singing voice, had me seeing the Oscar nominee as a tremendous impersonator but not a living, breathing character unto himself. Surprisingly, Witherspoon fares much better in a role that seemed on the surface to be terribly miscast. She's sweet, streetsmart and talented, and much of the trauma we endure from Cash's self-inflicted trouble is drawn from the toll it takes on her. An ambitious picture that has its heart in the right place, but can't fully recover from a few crucial, disappointing near-misses.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Phoenix brings Cash to life.,"Going into the movie theater, I had never even listened to a full song by Johnny Cash. I was interested in the movie because I could tell from the commercials alone that it was Oscar worthy. Not only did I leave with a greater appreciation for the actors, but a new love for Johnny Cash. The man in black lived a rough life behind the scenes, and Joaquin did an excellent job of portraying him. Witherspoon also managed to play a believable June Carter, she brought new life to the role and her voice wasn't half bad either. Overall, this movie was utterly amazing. I would see it again, and definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Best acting,"To anyone who has not seen this movie....GO GO GO!! One of the best performances I have seen. Joaquin Phoenix, gave an amazing performance as Johnny Cash.

An actor with such brilliance should be mentioned more than once. I look forward to seeing him in other roles. Reese Witherspoon as well made this movie great. As I am sure you all know by now. She won best actress. This should further her career in more dramatic roles. Direction should also be complimented in this movie. I am so glad that the actors learned how to sing, it made the movie that more real. As well as the other musicians featured in the movie, I am speechless!

Oscar Worthy,"What amazing performances! Pheonix and Witherspoon are definitely Oscar worthy for their roles as Cash and Carter. It was a long movie-around 2 1/2 hours but worth every minute. I wish it could have actually been longer. There seems to have been more story to tell. I especially loved the telling of the beginning of Cash's career when he walks into Sun Records for the first time. The determination he had was amazing. The performances were all believable - almost like a time warp - watching the likes of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, June Carter and J.R. Cash. Thank God Pheonix and Witherspoon did the singing themselves. This made the movie so much better to watch - no lip-syncing!! They were great!! What a beautiful story they were telling. It was a treat watching them. Their on-screen chemistry was beautiful. Quite a bit of unexpected humor, too. What a huge disappointment it would be if they weren't nominated for Oscars...and WON. This movie deserves a best picture nod, too. I am sure the soundtrack will be sought after and Cash's music revived for a whole new generation. What a beautiful love story it was! Johnny Cash was - and still is - a force to be reckoned with.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Amazing performances...,"As a life-long professional musician and music educator, I have always cast a suspicious eye on biopics based on the lives of famous musicians.Will an actor with no musical training be authentic? Will the story be historically and artistically correct? Will the story capitalize only on the negative drama (since sex, drugs and rock'n'roll sell, they always seem to make movies about the tragic figures), or on the musician's contributions to the art?Past attempts have either done a passable job or failed miserably at all of these - even the best of them (""Bird"" being one standout) still contained errors that bother a real musician (fingers not moving correctly in sync with the overdubbed recording).The only two movies I've seen recently to do an outstanding job of all of the above are ""Ray,"" and now ""Walk The Line."" The fact that these actors learned to sing/play just for the role is an amazing feat - as a musician I can't imagine learning to act convincingly in such a short time, let alone learn well enough to impersonate a famous personality so well that it's Oscar material.And the story - a well-balanced and historically accurate look at his career and that period in American music, and all that came with it.Stellar! I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
WHY doesn't Joaquin Phoenix have an Academy Award by now???,"EVERY film he has been in deserves an award, yet he is passed by.....The way he captured Johnny Cash in Walk The Line is enough of a reason to give this man an award for his awesome talent. Not to mention ""To Die For"" and every other film he has been in.He has a way of becoming any character that suits and does it in a brilliant way. Why Tom Hanks, whom is a good actor in his own right, gets two awards in a row and Joaquin is totally ignored is beyond me.Of all actors in this day and age, the greatest is Joaquin. And he is Vegan. Loves animals and wont eat or exploit them. You cant find anything better in a human being.Vegan, by the way, is a person that wont eat, use or wear anything that comes from animals.

Better than expected,"Every one I've talked to that has scene this movie either loves it or hates. it. I was pretty much indifferent. It was better than I thought it would be, but still very lacking. The story jumps too much. You just start to get a feeling for that part of Johnny Cash's life then its bam 2 years latter. Almost none of the characters were developed in the story except Johnny Cash and June Carter. At the end of the movie I didn't even remember most of the characters names. The man lived an incredibly interesting life and they decided to touch a little of every aspect, but in the end didn't really go into detail of any of it. The movie also seemed to drag a lot, which you would think would allow them to go into detail, but alas, no.

Walk The Line,"This movie is excellent, I saw it last night and it is a very accurate portrayal of Johnny Cash's life. Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon's acting in this movie were Oscar worthy.

"Could have been great, but was somewhat lacking...","The biography is well worth watching. Johnny Cash, himself, is a country legend and one of my favorites. In fact, his legend has crossed over into new territory with younger audiences, and this film may help further the legend. Reese Witherspoon does June Carter to a ""T"" ~ she turned in an excellent, energetic performance, capturing the voice and the spirit of the singer. I wouldn't change a thing about her. Unfortunately, I thought that Joaquin Phoenix missed the boat on his portrayal of Johnny Cash (and that's where strength of performance is needed). He captured Johnny's persona and strength of character, but he failed miserably on the music, I thought. Granted, Johnny's voice and style would be hard to emulate. To me, Phoenix's voice just sounded weak and off-key. This is one instance where dubbing would have been a good thing. This is not a bad movie, though. The story is wonderfully real and contains great material even for someone who doesn't know much about Cash.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Excellent biopic - better than most!,"I can't say that I'm a fan of Johnny Cash or that I know much about him - but there's something for everyone in Mangold's film, and you certainly don't need to be a fan of the country music legend to appreciate it. This is a film that is based much on the performances of its stars, and while I don't know how Johnny Cash acted; Joaquin Phoenix gives a great performance in leading this film. The fact that he sings Cash's songs himself makes it all the more impressive, and for an actor who hasn't produced much of note over the past decade or so; the performance works on a number of levels. Of course, it was Resse Witherspoon who took home most of the acting plaudits with her role as June Carter; and on the whole I'd say she deserved her 'Best Actress' Oscar award. Phoenix wouldn't have been a bad winner either; but it was near impossible for anyone to beat Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Capote portrayal. The rest of the cast is good, and Robert Patrick is the actor who stood out most for me. His role as Cash's father is a world away from his usual sort of casting, and he does really well with it.Pulling good performances from his cast isn't the only thing that writer-director James Mangold can be proud of himself for. Biopics tend to leave me cold, as they tend to want to follow the full life story of the subject, which ultimately ends in depression. Contrary to the norm, Mangold focuses on Cash's life while he popular, and although the film has its depressing moments; it ends on a real high. The climax to the movie is one of the most moving moments seen on screen over the last decade. The finale is genuinely heartfelt, and provides the perfect ending to a movie like this. The plotting is good, as it gives equal credence to both sides of Cash's persona; we've got the music side, and the human side. The film always feels very personal, and the director does a good job of offsetting Cash's personal life with his musical life; but at the end of the day, at its basis - Walk the Line is a film about the love between the country legend Johnny Cash and his sweetheart June Carter. Walk the Line is a movie that I can recommend to anybody - you don't need to be a fan of Cash or his music to enjoy this movie. And that's how a biopic should be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Good performances, unoriginal biopic","I went to a screening of this movie at ""The Toronto Film Festival"" in anticipation of seeing something wonderful based on all the early reviews of this film....particularly for the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. The film begins with Cash getting ready for his performance at Fulsom prison in the late 60's and we then proceed to the telling of his story with a formulaic flashback to his childhood ... proceeding thru his career, marriage and relationship with June Carter. The storytelling and direction is unoriginal. Within the confines of the story this movie was trying to tell...I felt that the director could have shown us some moments of brilliance or originality...but chose a very conventional style instead.As for the performances....Joaquin does some good acting here but for the most part a ""one note"" performance. He does an admirable job at singing the Cash songs but I felt the film should have kept the original recordings since Cash had such a signature style and I found it hard to accept Joaquin singing them. I think lip-syncing like Foxx did in Ray would have worked better.The best performance of this film belongs to Reese Witherspoon. Her performance as June Carter is charming and she shines in every scene she is in. I was pleasantly surprised. I am positive she will get a nomination for an Oscar for this role and she has enough screen time for the lead category. Reese and Joaquin as Carter and Cash have a wonderful chemistry. The interaction and dialogue between these two was very enjoyable.Overall good performances in an unoriginal formulaic biopic.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great Movie!,"Being a country fan all of my life, I grew up listening to Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, etc. All of the old greats. I was really impressed with how well Joaquin Phoenix played his role. Not only did he sound so much like Johnny, but his mannerisms were right on the money. You would almost believe it was Johnny Cash himself starring in his own movie. I remember the 60s and 70s when he looked so much like Joaquin did in the movie. I certainly hope he gets an award for the part he played. I don't believe I've ever seen anyone do a better job. Being a great Waylon Jennings fan, however, is the reason for this email. In the movie when it showed Waylon and Johnny living together, it portrayed Waylon with long hair and a beard. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty certain that at the time that scene was taking place, Waylon was still clean shaved and had wavy hair that he combed back. The movie ended in 1968 and that was when Waylon made his Hangin On album at which time he was still clean shaved and had slicked back hair. It wasn't until he was in the hospital a few years later, ready to quit, that he decided to try it one more time, ""his way"", that he changed his look, took control of his music and the rest is history! Was this just Hollywood or was there another reason for his appearance in that scene. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't detract from the quality of the movie at all. Most people who aren't lifelong Waylon fans, like myself, wouldn't even know what I'm talking about. Anyway, this was a great movie with a great cast and although I only saw it two days ago, I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. Keep up the good work!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Better Than Ray!,"Ray was a very good movie and on my top ten of 2004, but only at number ten. It had a powerful performance by Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles. He had it all down. The walk, the talk, the piano playing. The only things that hurt him was near mediocre direction and the fact they wouldn't let him actually do the singing. Walk the Line is on the other hand a wonderful movie. It is one of the best movies I have seen in years. Not the best of the year because 2005 was extremely strong but surly number two to only Brokeback Mountain. Walk the Line has two great performances to Rays one, both of which are much better than Foxx's as well. Joaquin Pheonix, an actor we have all known has great talent after his turns in such films as Gladiator and Signs has finally gotten a great roll. He gives what is easily his best performance as Johnny Cash. He knows the character better than probably anybody but June ever did. He gets the voice right, and all the mannerisms. It is not just an impersonation. Anyone can do some sort of a Johnny Cash impersonation while Pheonix creates a full and amazing character. Reese Witherspoon is a less proved actor in my opinion with a wonderful turn in the underrated Pleasantville to help her. I have now finally decided that she can actually really act and that it was no fluke. Her performance as June Carter is on the same shelf as Joaquin Pheonix's. She gets the tone and who knew she could sing? The supporting performances are also very good but are unfortunately overshadowed by the two leads. Dallas Roberts is though particularly good as the man who gets Cash started. The direction is a little by the book but since when has that really hurt? Doing something risky is the way to making a masterpiece but who says that by the book hurts a movie? The movie made me listen to Cashs songs and I really loved them. It made me feel great. It is some of the most fun I have had at the movies in years. It also just grows on you each time you see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Reese Witherspoon does an excellent job as June Carter and good lord, is June's behavior an example to us all. I dream of being able to be that polite, but I just can't do it. The warmth in the move comes from June and her family. They are just marvelous.

I'll go keep the guy company, maybe learn a little bit about something I know nothing about, eat some popcorn, and make fun of some odd moviegoers with my dad."" I took my seat, relaxed, and after the first 5 minutes of the film I was already on the edge waiting desperately for whats going to happen next. Jaoquin Pheonix was Phenomenal, and throughout the film you care for this Johnny Cash guy as though he were your brother. Through his hard times you feel the pain; through his happiest moments you sense the joy; and through his music, you sense who he was. Even though I knew nothing about Mr. Cash, I had heard some of his songs, and let me tell you this, if I had sat in that theater with my eyes shut tight I would've thought that was Johnny Cash singing his own songs. Jaoquin put all his emotion into this film, and to the many critics say Witherspoon steals the show, I disagree.Now, when I say I disagree, I'm not saying that Witherspoon was bad, because take it from me, she was also phenomenal. Witherspoon, who played the role of June Carter, acted as Johnny's ambition, and without her, Johnny wouldn't have been able to survive. Witherspoon brings the joy into this movie, with all her pep and brightness. Her portrayal of June Carter is worthy of 100 Oscars, I just may give Jaoquin 101.Now, believe me, I wouldn't take the time to write this comment had I not loved the movie. I am usually more of a Dodgeball, or Anchorman kind of person, but this film may have just converted me to the Drama genre. Every scene in the movie hits you in the heart with something new, and there's no way to explain the emotion that you are forced to feel for the characters thanks to their stunning performances. Backed with a strong story line, this film is worthy of every award that is available to win. I mean, think about this, who really wants to see a couple of homosexual cowboys win awards, sure, they may give great performances, but being able to pull off the role of two of the most famous musicians in American History sounds a little bit more difficult to handle, and yet, the actors did just as good of a job. Give the Oscar to Walk the Line, it's the best movie you'll see in years. And if u disagree, well then maybe you should become a gay cowboy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Not only about Cash but also about the popscene in the 50's and 60's,"""Walk the line"" (2005) is a biopic about the popstar Johnny Cash.Around 2005 biopics about popstars were a really popular genre. Around this year also appeared ""Ray"" (2004, Taylor Hackford) about Ray Charles, ""I am not there"" (2007, Todd Haynes) about Bob Dylan and ""Control"" (2007, Anton Corbijn) about Joy Division singer Ian Curtis.Popular or not, biopics of rock stars tend to be a bit predictable, neatly divided into rise, heydays and fall. It becomes more interesting when it is not only about the individual popstar but also gives an impression of the broader popscene of those days. In this respect ""Walk the line"" is an eye opener for those who thought that sex, drugs and rock and roll only started in the sixties with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Woodstock. Johnny Cash and his contempoaries such as Elvis Presley, Roy Orbinson and Jerry Lee Lewis already knew how to ""walk on the wild side"".Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny Cash in a decent way, but later on he played better roles in ""Her"" (2013, Spike Jonze) and ""Joker"" (2019, Todd Phillips). The real star in my opinion is Reese Witherspoon who plays June Carter, the second wife of Cash. She received both an Oscar and a BAFTA award for her performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

magic,"when i first read in rolling stone about this film being made and phoenix as the lead i hung my head and asked god ""why? why him? of all people why him?"" flashbacks of the village and 8mm and a slew of others such as his role in Uturn which was awful came flooding back into my mind. Reese Witherspoon wasn't that bad after all who could argue with sound acting experience that is Legally blonde and legally blond 2...not to mention Overnight Delivery. But after hearing and seeing some clips and audio files i thought ""maybe they'll do the man in black some justice"" they did more than that...they took that entire genre and perfected a movie about it. with great renditions of jerry lee lewis and Elvis and buddy holly i was blown away. i wanted to know and see more about those characters and people in that time period as well. but phoenix takes it and makes it his own his guitar playing style and charm and shear weirdness that was and is johnny cash was excellent.

If possible you also leave the theater having more appreciation for Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I cannot describe how brilliant this movie was. Watching this movie made my boyfriend and I feel like he was so legendary that he was almost fantastic.If you haven't seen this movie yet, GO SEE IT! now, immediately!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Phoenix and Witherspoon are sensational,"Biopic drama about the late country singer-songwriter, Johnny Cash. Structured very much like ""Ray,"" last year's biodrama about Ray Charles, the storyline focuses on Cash's early career, up to his mid-30s, the creative period when he eventually achieved fame, culminating in 1968, after his marriage to June Carter and his musical comeback, fueled by the immense popularity of his album, ""Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison.""And, as in Ray, we also get footage sketching in a family-of-origin backstory. In Cash's case, it concerns the accidental childhood death of his older brother, who was favored by Cash's alcoholic father, Ray, at least as told here.Director (and co-screenwriter) James Mangold (""Heavy;"" ""Copland;"" ""Girl, Interrupted"") excels in working with actors, and he succeeds here spectacularly. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, as Cash and Carter, are brilliant, authentic, captivating. To top it off, both did all their own vocals on the Cash songs in this film; Witherspoon also had to master the autoharp. (The day after seeing the film, I listened to some early recordings of Cash's hits. Phoenix's vocal timbre and timing in this movie are stunningly similar to the young Cash's.) Robert Patrick is also riveting as Cash's dour and hypercritical father.The narrative is almost a clich√© of many other musicians' and artists' lives. Early promise and success. Increasing career hassles and pressures. Neglect and disruption of family life. Alcohol and drug addiction. A plunge in artistic productivity and popularity. And then, in Cash's case, redemption, another chance, abetted importantly by his co-performer and eventual second wife, June Carter Cash.Perhaps the story lacks luster precisely because the narrative arc is so familiar, one we've heard so often in varying permutations, that it no longer has legs. The New Yorker magazine critic, David Denby, has written that Cash was an intriguingly complex man, but the nuances in his character are not developed in this film. (One item left out, for example, was that Cash apparently was a community college grad before he went into the Air Force during the Korean War.) If we had been offered more particulars about Cash, the narrative might well have been the stronger for itThis movie is at its best when music is being made. In the second hour, there is a long music-free period, when Cash was succumbing to the effects of amphetamines and other prescription drugs, and here the film drags. My biggest beef with many films about musicians (narrative or documentary) is the nervous tendency of the editors to cut off songs midway through a performance. I suppose I should be grateful that the editors for ""Walk the Line"" commit this transgression only a few times, and not as ham-handedly as in some other films. Still, with a film length of 136 minutes, there is no excuse for any song cuts at all.It doesn't help ""Walk"" that, following the slavish biopic convention (think of ""Pollock"" or ""Frida""), we are offered meaningless postage stamp cameos of some of Cash's musical associates and contemporaries (Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis.) But there are also some small yet very good supporting contributions from others: Dan John Miller and Larry Bagby (as Cash's original sidemen, Luther Perkins on guitar and Marshall Grant on bass), and Shooter Jennings playing his father, the late Waylon Jennings.The parallels with Ray Charles don't end. Like Charles, Johnny Cash achieved no further artistic breakthroughs after his mid-30s. Instead, both men plateaued out and kept doing what they did best for decades to come, making lots of their familiar music and lots of money too. In the end, Charles and Cash both died too soon, in their early 70s. This film, like ""Ray,"" doesn't achieve greatness, but Joaquin Phoenix's virtuoso performance, like Jamie Foxx's as Ray Charles, is as good as it gets. If you like Johnny Cash, don't miss this movie! My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 11/20/05).

The story was very similar, but that cannot be helped much considering they are based on true lives. I just felt that the formula was the same for each movie, and i also felt that Ray was in fact a much better movie because i had not seen anything like it before. I also think Ray had more texture to it, it got me more involved with the characters and had a draper meaning within it. It also made me feel for Ray Charles and his addiction to heroin, more so then Johnny Cash and his addictions to speed.

WALK THE LINE as Joaquin and Reese Light Up the Screen,"Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash is a triumphant performance from a very talented actor who captures the essence of the famed performer on the screen; while Reese Witherspoon as June Cash just knocks the ball out of the park in her role and with every scene she becomes more magical and visually on the screen, so important to Johnny's development as both a singer/performer, and more importantly, for his future happiness as a father, husband and a singer.I loved this film from the first frame to the last, as the chemistry and the talents of Joaquin and Reese make this film come alive with energy, passion and solid writing to make WALK THE LINE one of the best films of 2005. Golden Globe and Oscar are written all over this film.WALK THE LINE is an honest film, as it shows all the flaws and past sins of its characters, as well as triumphantly ends with the love and marriage which Johnny and June Cash shared together to the end of their lives.Watching the last frame as Joaquin finally enjoys the richness of family and love with Reese as June Cash is one that I shall always remember and cherish. WALK THE LINE deserves to be nominated as BEST PICTURE for 2005. The film warmed my heart, as it will yours.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Impressed with Joaquin as Johnny Cash,"I came away from the theater with a whole new respect for Joaquin Phoenix. I was amazed with his superb performance which was deserving of an Oscar, in my opinion. His acting was so natural and smooth that I became totally lost in his portrayal of Mr. Cash, which brought back memories of Johnny's performances on TV. I only knew bits and pieces about Johnny and June's relationship, but the movie left me feeling thoroughly involved in their trials and tribulations, and wanting to know more. I feel Reese Witherspoon was very good in her rendition of June Carter, but at times the wide-eyed cutesy-look and whiny voice of her ""June"" was distracting, leaving me feeling she had slipped out of character into one of her prior movies. Joaquin and Reese are outstanding vocalists, no doubt about that Walk the Line is a winner. I've seen it on the screen and rented the DVD twice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
As good as it gets.,"The performances in this film are fabulous. Starting with Robert Patrick, who breathes the despair and disdain inherent with a hard drinking cotton picker of the 1930's into the character of Ray Cash. Elvis, Jerry Lee, and Waylon are afforded an interesting take by Messrs Hilton, Payne, and Jennings respectively. No one in this film is imitating, all are acting, and it really comes off clean. Reese Witherspoon is nothing short of amazing as June Carter. Her singing, insight into character, and precision of nuance is spot on. You will be enthralled by her performance every time you watch it. Joaquin Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash right before your eyes. From the slightly higher tone of his vocals at the beginning, to the rich robust baritone that a hard life injected into his voice as he matured, Mr. Phoenix is perfect in his interpretation of this music legend. Tieing these great performances all together is James Mangold, who never forgets that this is above all else a love story, and treats it with the respect that it deserves. Mr. Mangold uses the great music and strong characters to build upon the deep felt romance that lies throughout this excellent motion picture.

A Nutshell Review: Walk the Line,"How uncanny. Today is the day that Walk the Line won big at the Golden Globes, winning Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy, as well as snagging the Best Actor and Actress - Musical/Comedy for both Joaquin Phoenix and Resse Whiterspoon. Today is also the day that I attended my first GV Surprise Screening, and Walk the Line was shown.You've got Elvis, and you've got Johnny Cash. Walk the Line chronicles the life of country music legend JOhn R. Cash, who performed alongside other music legends like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. It also tells of the struggles of one man's determination to make music his life, the reliance and subsequent battle against drugs, and looks into his various relationships. Sound familiar? Of course it does. Walk the Line is in 2005 (locally 2006) what Ray was in 2004 (locally 2005). I know it's probably unfair at making the comparison, given that both musicians' music are so different. But the way the narrative is structured for Walk the Line, resembled that of Ray's quite a bit, that you might think you know what would go next when you substitute Jamie Foxx with Joaquin Phoenix. Both had to pick up music, both won nods for their accurate portrayals, and both had to sing in their actual voice. Drawing parallels, we see how both draw inspiration from their life encounters and encompass them into musical lyrics, how stardom grew in their heads, how succumbing to drugs screwed everything up, and how they harness creativity in making comebacks.While Ray was a more personal look into Ray Charles' extraordinary career, Walk the Line seemed to have tried to cover more ground, but somewhat loses its focus occasionally. Too many subplots just got tied up at the end without much detailed exploration, like the strained relation between Johnny and his father (played so stoically by Robert Patrick), whom the former is blamed for the death of his beloved brother, or the struggles June Carter (Resse Whiterspoon) has to face being a divorc√©e in days were marriage is sacred. Equally glossed over too is the matrimony development and deterioration between John and his wife Vivian - we know he loves her and managed to provide her material needs, but all she longed for is his presence. Sigh, sometimes you can't have the cake and eat it too. He works hard to build up his career (therefore spending a lot of time on the road), and can't seem to juggle and find the work-life balance.Where does Resse come into all this you say? She plays his best friend and fellow performer on the road, June Carter. It's like the third (married) party coming into the life of a lonely married man giving in to temptation. She tried her darndest best to reject Johnny, but ultimately caved in to his persistence.But both of them, when paired up on screen singing their songs, have the exact same power as Ray's in having you tap/sing/groove along to the tunes. Their chemistry is a delight to watch. If you're not too acquainted with Cash's music, this is as good an opportunity to do so. Until the drugs rear their ugly head and the tunes just stopped while he undergoes some soul-searching rehabilitation. A pity that his comeback at recording live at Folsom Prison, was too short, otherwise it would have been a really good way to cap it all off.It's a good film nonetheless, though I felt that those who have watched Ray might have sensed a deja-vu.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"A dreary, disappointing movie","I had read the reviews, from friends as well as the papers and the Oscar hype and was looking forward to seeing this. Good performances go a very long way to determining my enjoyment of a movie and Joaquin Phoenix and especially Reese Witherspoon did good jobs. But the movie failed to engage me, or the 3 others I went with. Perhaps you need to be a Johnny Cash fan, the tedious songs that we had to endure throughout didn't help. He came across as a miserable character whose life wasn't really all that interesting in the end, or at least the script didn't make it so. Annoying inconsistencies were the casting of young Johnny with a perfectly normal face but Joaquin Phoenix of course has a cleft palate scar. His parents didn't seem to age at all over the 20 or so years the movie spanned. All in all I thought it highly overrated.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

I love her to pieces and think she is wonderful, but I always see her in the cute little romantic comedies. Seeing her in something like this really shows her versatility. She was awesome. Not to mention the fact that they both(more Joaquin than Reese) had to learn how to sing and play instruments. They both did an amazing job.

Enthralling On Stage and Off Stage Romantic and Musical Story,"""Walk the Line"" is enthralling from the opening scene as it makes clear this is a bio pic equally of sound and sight.We are aware of a strong rhythm as we're told a signature date and and place in musical history -- Folsom Prison 1968 -- and only leisurely is the source of that gradually increasing rumbling beat identified. Just as we are anticipating a standard performance recreation, the gray of prison shifts suddenly to a flashback of the wide open spaces of childhood memories that are not as sunny as the sky.Director James Mangold in obviously close partnership with musical supervisor T. Bone Burnett ties the intertwined, riveting stories of Johnny Cash and June Carter very much to their roots in Americana music at mid-20th century, capturing the interplay of music, period life on the road and feelings. The tense dramatic scenes are silent on the soundtrack, completely enthralling the audience, so that the music emphasis is on music-related scenes.The detail on music authenticity is marvelous, both in the background selections, like Wanda Jackson, and the foreground re-enactments, as Burnett has done so well from ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" to ""Cold Mountain,"" but the film doesn't patronize to explain the historical significance to un-musically knowledgeable audience members as it's more personal here. So it's just background mise en scene that we see Johnny the child drawn to listen to the Carter family on the Grand Ole Opry radio show, as we hear June the child introduced, when his family finds even those icons of traditionalism too far astray from gospel music.Later we see him take in the black and white sounds and rhythms of post-war Memphis, drawing him to legendary Sun Studios. Though Dallas Roberts' portrayal of Sam Phillips seems a bit too bland, at least compared to how charismatic the legendary producer seemed in later interviews (let alone Rip Torn doing a similar character in ""40 Shades of Blue""), we are gradually brought into the ferment of the rockabilly nexus that revolutionized popular music -- Jerry Lee Lewis (engagingly captured by Waylon Payne, from that signature tinkling of the 88s to the ""killer"" personality); young Elvis (Tyler Hilton doing one of the mildest of the interpretations on film); and Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice capturing his look but not quite his sound, as unfortunately Chris Isaak is probably too old now to portray the young Roy).June is a critical musical link for them all from country to rock 'n' roll and the burgeoning folk scene. Her important linkage from the traditional Carter family to rock to Dylan is beautifully, albeit quite briefly, encapsulated through a wonderful segue of Reese Witherspoon herself with an auto-harp singing ""Wildwood Flower"" as ""My mama's favorite song"" into a duet with Joaquin Phoenix singing as Cash on Dylan's ""It Ain't Me Babe,"" with its lyrics particularly ironic for the duo. These connections become even more personally significant as Mother Maybelle is shown as a key forgiving and steadfast rock in both their lives. Details such as Cash's move from Sun to Columbia are just indicated visually in passing, while fans will finally now get straight how their children Carlene Carter and Roseanne Cash are step-sisters, as the guilt over their family responsibilities are a major plot point.The love story on stage is as dramatic as its off stage progression, even though we know how it'll eventually end, especially when June tries to limit their interactions to when they click musically. Witherspoon is breathtaking at capturing the complexity of June's life-- the comedy, that we of course know the actress is a smooth pro at, as June explains how she developed the comic persona in the family business to insecurely stand out compared to the musical talent she was surrounded by, as well as the tightly wound, uber polite professionalism of someone who's been on the road since childhood such that she can more than hold her own on tour with these raunchy, macho guys like traveling salesmen. But the depths of June's hurts from fans and family pressures that Witherspoon portrays, the sensuality of the romance and close friendship, and especially the magic she creates on stage with Joaquin Phoenix in the many combustible on-stage performances are new revelations to us of her talent.All this would be of illustrative interest to music fans if it weren't for Phoenix's intense performance. We see the influences come together that make up his guilt and rebellion that he incorporated into his songs. But the camera seems to restlessly move when it's not focused on him, as he powerfully draws the audience in from the first shot of him back stage at the prison. He is not just physically being another person -- not just living in Cash's skin in a dead-on capturing of body language and even an extremely close approximation of that voice-- but this is as much a psychological portrait as well. It's spooky this year with Philip Seymour Hoffman channeling ""Capote"" and David Straithairn doing Edward Murrow in ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" but Phoenix goes beyond those recreations to an intensity of capturing the subject's inner life. He'll surely earn the Best Actor for the Golden Globes comedy/musical category.The camera work and cinematography are beautiful. While the many southern locations are used very atmospherically, each scene has a different cast of sharpness and color, from period brown to the grays of prison to the green of peace.Shooter Jennings too briefly captures his dad Waylon completely. Shelby Lynne is marvelous as momma Cash singing gospel in the cotton fields. Robert Patrick is a bit stiffly one-note as Cash's father.The packed opening weekend matin√©e audience with a multi-ethnic and multi-racial audience of all ages of adults as the kids and teens were at the new Harry Potter, was intently involved and cheered at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Phoenix's voice in the early going was dull, flat, and nearly lifeless (although I wonder whether it was just that his timbre and range were far better suited to Cash's later music?), and you had no sense that this would become a legendary singer. The early exposition was terribly rushed, going from vignette to vignette in a choppy, barely-explored fashion. Beyond that and throughout, it struck me that scenes with other stars (such as the ones with Waylon Jennings and Elvis) were thrown in more for their namedropping than any dramatic purpose.

Walk the Line,Bravo Bravo Bravo What a movie. Finally a movie worth the price and worth sitting through. I could have watched another 2 hours. I am not a Johnny Cash fan but have now become one mainly due to Phoenix and Reese's vocals . I thought they were both very good. When I saw Joaquin in the Folsom Prison sequence it was like being there . But I have mainly become a Phenix and Reese fan.What chemistry these two bring to the screen.Electrifying. My favourite movie of all times. Better than Ray because they did their own vocals. Imagine my surprise when I sat down to watch the Academy Awards expecting Reese and Phoenix to win only to lose to that guy in Capote. Please give me a break Joaquin was much much better and more believable. This movie shows a man through much poverty addiction & a lot of pain over losing his brother but yet he manages to be mean and vulnerable. How this movie got left out for movie of the year is beyond me. But at least the Golden Globes got it right by rewarding both Phoenix and Reese and the movie.Academies are out for me a joke as far as I'm concerned.Can't wait to see these actors in their next role.

This movie will become a collectors item,"Probably not the movie for anyone born after 1975, but for those who remember the Johnny Cash era - it was brilliantly acted and directed. Got to be the best movie I have seen in the last 10 years. They got just about everything right,the feel of the period, the wardrobe, the music and the wonderful casting. Sorry to see they missed out 'Boy named Sue' in the prison concert but then again perhaps they didn't and it ended up on the cutting room floor. The performances by Reece Witherspoon and Phoenix were as powerful as any I have seen in recent years and the decision for them to actually take on the singing roles proved to be masterful. Was pleased to see that Phoenix captured the 'moody' side of Johnny Cash and even his body lean when on stage. This movie has Academy Awards written all over it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
This movie takes the cake,"OK, I'll have to be truthful here: Walk the Line is one of the best movies I have ever seen. No only do I love the actors that play the parts, I also love the music they play all the way through it. After watching that movie with my class, I had all of his greatest hits including, ""Cry, cry, cry"" ""The Ring of Fire"" and ""Walk the line"" playing in my head for two weeks straight. Although I would definitely not recommend this as a family movie, it would be the bomb for any curious Teens or Johnny Cash fans. Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny in the movie, and I don't think they could have gotten anyone better. He sings just like him and the things they do copy Johnny Cash's life nearly to the end of the string. After that movie, Reese Witherspoon has become one of my favorite actresses. If you want a movie with a great plot, lots of music, and neat actors, Walk the Line is my first suggestion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Poor actor choice,"I liked the story, and the music. But for me, the actors for Johnny Cash and June Carter don't fit. Joaquin is a good actor, but he is better playing villains, and tuff guys. Johnny where more of a repent full sinner, then handsome. He had large eye bags and wrinkles. And we loved him for being that sad looking, but also that man who seem to understand our burdens. I either don't know why the chose Reese for June, since they are not so similar either.This film could have been so much better, if they did not choose two of the most popular Hollywood actors for the main characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Extremely disappointing,"I don't know if there was something wrong with the DVD that I rented or if the sound for this film is just awful to begin with. I have heard much superior sound on old Three Stooges and Laurel and Hardy shorts. I couldn't understand half of his mumbling dialog - but that may have been for the best! To be accurate, though, the horrible sound in this movie about music was the least of the problems with it.The only bright spot for me was Reese Witherspoon's performance and that was illuminated only by the incredibly awful rest-of-the-movie! One thing this film did do for me was to verify what I had suspected all along - that Johnny Cash was no more than a self-serving, irresponsible, marginally talented, drug-addicted hack. I suppose that's to be expected in most high-end entertainers, but he displayed it in spades!! The character inspired no sympathetic feelings in me whatsoever. His many problems and trials were brought on by his own stupid, self destructive actions.Anyway, I returned the DVD & received credit for the rental price. To me, it was a total piece of junk!

Don't miss this movie!,"Walk the Line (2005) was co-written and directed by James Mangold. The movie is a narrative biography of Johnny Cash. Country singer Johnny Cash lived a life that could have been a successful fictional movie script.That life--with its many bad turns--is presented vividly in the film. Cash's life was tumultuous, and the movie doesn't gloss over the rough parts. The fact that the depiction is accurate adds to the film's excellence.However, what really makes the film great is the amazing acting by Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter.Witherspoon won an Oscar for her performance, and Phoenix was nominated for one. The amazing fact is that both Witherspoon and Phoenix actually sang the songs we heard in the film. I would never have guessed that--it's made clear in the credits.Walk the line has a very high IMDb rating of 7.8. I thought it was even better than that, and rated it 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Essential to ANY aspiring musician . . .,"I definitely agree that this project maintained the perfect balance for those either familiar or not familiar with the legend, Mr Cash. I am a ""rockaholic,"" for lack of a better word, and was never a big fan of classic, early country . . . ANY country really, before I saw this film. But whether you knew his music or not, this film definitely spoke many truths to any aspiring musicians out there; any who appreciate all music as a beautiful art, a love that speaks to the masses, a ""natural drug"" which helps us through rough times . . . and so much more. I'm sorry. I just worship music. It is an amazing thing. Anyway, I hope others who attempt any bio-musician-pictures in the future will model theirs appropriately (in reminder of maintaining their OWN creativity of course) after this well delivered piece. I cannot wait to see a piece which carries similar aesthetics and original portrayal about one of the most legendary musicians, dreamers of humanity ever . . . Mr John Lennon.

I was surprised,"I was very surprised by the performances especially the vocals from the Reese and Joaquin. Reese really nailed it. Joaquin struggled early on but had it down pat by the end. And overall excellent production especially for a biog. The story line was excellent and brought out Johnny's character quite well. Along with Phoenix's performance, Reese pulled off June Carter so well you knew why Johnny fell in love with her and was willing to change and pull himself up from his addictions. Thanks to the producers, directors and cast that made such an excellent film honoring Johnny and depicting him as the American music icon that he so well deserved to be.

I never 'got' Johnny Cash - but I do now,"I never 'got' Johnny Cash, or knew much about him, so the maverick nature of the man, his inner (and often outer) violence and tragic scar baggage from his country childhood, came as a complete surprise. As much so as the extent of Ray Charles' darker side had been in WALK THE LINE's closest film relative RAY.And yes, the movie is every bit as good as you probably expect it to be. Joaquin Phoenix is every bit as accurate ¬ñ and not just his copy of Cash's awkward, uncomfortable style of holding a guitar that made even Gerry Marsden look relaxed. And Reese Witherspoon is every bit as convincing as he is powerful.The musical set pieces, of course, are tremendous ¬ñ from Cash's debut in Texarkana to the seminal Folsom Prison gig. Plus some interesting cameos of Jerry Lewis, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley and Waylon Jennings (by his real-life son). Even Roy Orbison gets a glide-by appearance.But the suddenness of the 'coitus interruptus' ending was eased by the retired national newspaper journalist who went with me to the preview and recalled how his photographer colleague was once sent to photograph Cash during a stopover for a gig in Manchester. They did the pictures, then Cash asked where he could get a decent drink. So the snapper treated Cash by taking him for a few at his local pub in Cheadle Hulme just outside the city.

A long movie that moves too fast,"I hope that title makes sense. This movie is long, but the movie also seems to jump too quickly from year-to-year. This movie is decent. Not great, not bad, decent. I felt the movie understated Johnny Cash's stardom and made it feel more like a guy who was constantly struggling to break out. I also felt as if Johnny Cash was some little boy chasing an OLD woman the whole time and that was kind of distracting. The actors were good. Phoenix is probably a little overrated as Johnny Cash, Reese Witherspoon is great as June Carter Cash, and whoever played Jerry Lee Lewis was really good. He's not a main part of the movie, but the acting of the man who played Lewis really stuck out to me.Overall rating: 6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Top acting,"Even though the movie is long, it is definitely worth it. It might not be the best movie I have seen but the acting performances are truly great. Phoenix is very convincing as a lost soul. I was actually amazed to realize it is actually their own voices you hear. I am not familiar with most of Cash' work but Witherspoon and Phoenix were very convincing. One of the nicest things about the movie I found is to watch a man who can be loving and caring one moment and the next scene he can be as scary as only Jack Nicholson can be.

Best true story musical since Sound of Music,"Not since Julie Andrews wowed audiences years ago with the telling of the Von Trapp family singers has there been such a captivating, electrifying, or poignant film. I must admit, I was skeptical at first, not knowing a lot about Johnny Cash. But after seeing it, I couldn't get his songs out of my head. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were amazing together, and it really impressed me to learn that they both studied song and instrument to get it right.After seeing this movie the first time, I ran out and got the soundtrack. I'm sure you will, too. This is a timeless film, telling a melancholy story about one of America's greatest performers. I will watch this movie many times, and am rooting for it, as the underdog, to win at the Oscars this year.Anyone who says there were not impressed with any aspect of this film is either lying to you, or hasn't seen it, and is only going on the fact that they hate everything.

Biggest Miscast of a Biopic in Movie History,"Although there were a few touching moments, this biopic would have been infinitely better if there were different actors in the lead roles. I don't know who, but definitely NOT Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who just tried too darn hard in this film. Although Joaquin Phoenix gave it his best shot, he just didn't have Johnny's look. As for Reese Witherspoon, she's been in too many perky blonde girl movies that this one just made her a perky brunette and she got to pout a little. If this is the best that Hollywood had to offer in recreating the legend that is Johnny Cash from an actors point of view, then the movie industry is in a whole lot of hurt. Oscar Contender? In this year of generally crappy movies, why not? Hollywood wonders why that they're having such a bad year at the box office. Walk the Line is a prime reason why.

Superb Witherspoon Complements an Evocative Phoenix in Real-Life Love Story,"What is most intriguing about the new Johnny Cash biopic is how Joaquin Phoenix does more of an impressionistic take on the Man in Black rather than the dead-on impersonation that Jaime Foxx did as Ray Charles, or going further back, that Gary Busey did as Buddy Holly. Although Phoenix lacks Cash's craggy features and full-throated delivery, there is enough resemblance vocally and physically for him to get away with it. Moreover, what Phoenix does very well is get under the skin of Cash's psyche through sheer intensity in director James Mangold's 2005 film. When he performs onstage, it is not so much the musicality that gets you but the often scary glare he gives as a tortured soul. Whether destroying a dressing room or feeling ill-at-ease with his stoic parents, it's a powerfully unrelenting performance that evokes Cash's spirit, albeit one that is sometimes too off-putting and humorless over the course of a 136-minute film.Recent biopics seem to be following similar dramatic patterns. Especially in the early going, the movie bears a striking resemblance to ""Ray"" in treatment - a rural childhood, a demanding parent, a transformative childhood trauma, adultery, drug addiction. However, to Mangold's and co-writer Gill Dennis's credit, he does not go back and forth to Cash's childhood to make us understand his pain. Instead, he deals with it succinctly upfront and uses the periodic reappearance of his parents as the emotional link. The other aspect that works in the film's favor is the love story at the core. Cash's incessant, decade-long yearning for June Carter provides the spark of the film.Reese Witherspoon takes advantage of portraying a real-life character less recognizable than Cash and inhabits June with an obviously deep empathy and an authentically Southern-fried sensibility. What remains consistent from her most recent films, for instance, her anachronistic Becky Sharp in ""Vanity Fair"" or her overachieving half-spirit in ""Just Like Heaven"", are the fierce intelligence and iron will that seem to be her growing trademarks. She also easily brings out June's natural kinship with performing (not only singing but comedy bits and playing the autoharp), and her duets with Phoenix onstage, especially ""Jackson"", are among the movie's best moments. Casting a fishing reel with aplomb or facing her Christian guilt over the first divorce, she brings a natural goodwill that's completely convincing. As the love story moves toward resolution with a family intervention and a romantic onstage moment, it's really Witherspoon's no-nonsense nurturing that attracts our attention more than Phoenix's doleful responses.It's always a risky decision to go with the singing voices of the real-life performers or the actors portraying them. Some voices are so recognizable as to defy impersonation (e.g., using Ray Charles' original tracks in ""Ray""). Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon sang or performed musical instruments before being cast, but they bring such a great sense of showmanship that their vocal deficiencies simply don't matter. Credit needs to go to T. Bone Burnett for training them so well for six months. There are also terrific scenes with Cash interacting other legendary figures like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, the latter played with fiery mischief by Waylon Malloy Payne.The movie has a solid supporting cast even if some of the roles falter toward stereotype, for instance, Robert Patrick simmering near a boil as Cash's cold father, country singer Shelby Lynne looking and acting dour as his psalm-singing mother, and especially Ginnifer Goodwin, who has to play Cash's first wife Vivian as a small-minded shrew. Like all-fact-based movies, the movie can also feel episodic, and it does sag somewhat in the middle as the film belabors Cash's amphetamine addiction. Regardless, even if you are not a fan of Cash or the Carter family, this is still fine Hollywood film-making with two actors going at their roles with real brio and Witherspoon, in particular, getting to the real heart of the story with conviction.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Take a bow Mr Phoenix,"I am a big Johnny Cash fan and was worried that The spineless Caesar in Gladiator could pull off the role of My music icon. Nevertheless he took on the role as he was made for it, obviously he did is homework as he adopts some of the mannerisms of Johnny Cash whilst singing. Reese Witherspoon's role of June carter is also grade A. The story is of the struggle that Johnny Cash faces over addiction to drugs and alcohol. With the death of his brother who he idolised, through a horrific accident, with the neglect of his father J.R. is set for a difficult road ahead. If you to are a Cash fan, don't worry you wont be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Walks a fine line....,"Walk the Line: ***.5* (3.5)'Walk the line' opens in the dull and drab atmosphere outside Folsom Prison. A faint echo of music cuts through the air barely recognizable. We move inside and see the band play while Johnny Cash (Jaoquin Pheonix) runs his fingers along a saw blade. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie as we flash back to Johnny's childhood, and then move forward until we catch up with the beginning.Pheonix captures perfectly the spirit of Johnny Cash. This should be no surprise as Cash chose Phoenix to play the role in the first place. As a child we hear Johnny listening to the Carters on his radio, quizzing his older brother Jack on which Carter is singing. ""Thats June"" says Johnny. And, as we all know, Johnny meets June and is immediately smitten with her, if not in love with her. June Carter is played by Reese Witherspoon in what is far and away her best role yet, and possibly ever. That is just how good she is in this film. Phoenix also does some of his best work here, but its no surprise as he is a wonderful actor. Whats is surprising though, is that both Phoenix and Witherspoon sing every song. And they absolutely nailed it. That is part of the mystique of their performances. It is one thing to nail your character, its another to nail their songs. And, boy, do they nail their characters. Last years big music movie was 'Ray' which garnered a lot of attention for Jamie Foxx. Phoenix far and away out does him here. Watching 'Ray' I saw Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles. In 'Walk the Line' I saw Johnny Cash on film. While both 'Ray' and 'Walk the line' are fairly conventional, 'Line' is definitely the better movie. Walk the Line overcomes its conventionality with spot on performances from Phoenix and Witherspoon. Its a conventional film without seeming so. The concert scenes are fantastic, whether you're a cash fan or not. This movie sweeps you off your feet and into the life of one of the greatest music icons of all time. 'Walk the Line' walks a fine line and never over steps it. This is one of the funnest movies of the year for sure, especially if you love Johnny Cash's music. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

This movie had it's flaws such as the random time jumps and the ending that kinda made me mad, but overall this movie was actually pretty good and I can happily say that I now know who Johnny Cash is.

fake poverty scenes,"It seems to me the maker's of the movie didn't do their homework about Cash's background. If they wanted to depict Cash as being poor as a youngster, they would not put in the following: painted sharecropper house- no one in that situation lived in a freshly painted house. They lived in tar paper shacks. Cash's house looked even better than the house Richard Nixon drew up in in Whittier. Poor boys then did NOT have fresh barbershop haircuts. Their mothers cut their hair. Also, the clothes the boy's wore looked totally fake- no mends, tears, or dirt. The other thing that got me was that some of the characters- June and those who played John's parents never aged in the movie.

"outstanding film, well-directed, and perfectly acted by Witherspoon and Phoenix","James Mangold takes us through a basically true story (although there may be some exaggerations to make the film work) of Cash as he sees success, drug addiction and loses himself followed by the will to overcome his weaknesses. He needs and relies on the love and strength of June Carter throughout the movie. He asks Carter (Witherspoon) to marry him ""40 times"". And when she tells him the only time he can talk to her is on stage, Cash uses that opportunity to propose and what we get in that scene is a most heartfelt, believable performance with Witherspoon and Phoenix at their best.This is a movie that would have probably done okay without Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix. But what they do alone and more importantly in their scenes together is about as good as acting gets. There is something very special about Reese Witherspoon that is rarely seen on the big screen. She may be the best actress in the business right now. And Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular, as well.In a year of 8-10 excellent movies, ""Crash"" and ""Walk the Line"" have the lasting power. The scenes keep coming back around again and again long after you have left the theater. I know Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for Best Actress as well as nearly every other Best Actress Award offered for her performance. And Joaquin Phoenix was nominated for Best Actor by the Academy Awards and actually won the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Musical or Comedy.I highly recommend this movie to all adults.

"Very good, all around","OK, nothing is perfect, but this movie comes about as close as any. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the music, especially considering I really don't like Country music. I've never been a big fan of Johnny Cash, and I honestly don't know if I'd heard of June Carter before this movie. So, with all that said, I was surprised by the amazingly good performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. I even like some of their song version better than the originals. I had admired the acting of Reese and Joaquin in other movies, and with this movie am convinced that they are both deserving of Oscar nominations in my very humble opinion. Of course much credit has to be given to T. Bone Burnet and James Mangold for bringing out a story that looks, sounds and feels real. A rare thing with today's formulaic Hollywood films. As a bonus, it was clean enough that I felt fine taking my 12 year old son, who is now a JR Cash fan... Go see it, and hopefully this film will be rewarded in March, if we ever hope to see more fine films like this made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Hello I'm Johnny Cash,"Hello I'm Johnny Cash, the 4 words that send shivers down your spine and tell you that you are in for something special. Walk the line is a film with heart, passion and dedication without so much as a special effect or any CGI. Which is what you don't see nowadays, when I saw Walk the line in the cinema I was in awe, because I was watching some of the best acting I had ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Johnny Cash, he gets every emotion perfectly and you feel that Johnny is embodying Joaquin throughout this film, especially during the music sequences and Joaquin shows how Johnny's confidence as a performer grows, from the first time he sings Get Rhythm to when he sings in Folsom Prison and knows how to taunt the crowd. Also Reese Witherspoon brings a great performance to the picture and you feel that this women could save a man because of her caring nature and determination.Overall, I think Walk the line is a fantastic film that Johnny would be proud of, you tap your feet when the music plays and you feel for when you see Johnny go down the slippery slope. It has become one of my favourite films that I can watch over and over and over again and not get sick of.

Johnny Lives On In Joaquin,"In 1955, a tough, skinny guitar-slinger who called himself J.R. Cash walked into the soon-to-be-famous Sun Studios in Memphis. It was a moment that would have an indelible effect on American culture. With his driving freight-train chords, steel-eyed intensity and a voice as deep and black as night, Cash sang blistering songs of heartache and survival that were gutsy, full of real life and unlike anything heard before. That day kicked off the electrifying early career of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix). As he pioneered a fiercely original sound that blazed a trail for rock, country, punk, folk and rap stars to come, Cash began a rough-and-tumble journey of personal transformation. In the most volatile period of his life, he evolved from a self-destructive pop star into the iconic ""Man in Black"" -- facing down his demons, fighting for the love that would raise him up, and learning how to walk the razor-thin line between destruction and redemption. As his music changed the world, Cash's own world was rocked by the woman who became the love of his life: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Walk The Line 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
This is one amazing film with brilliant performances. I loved it.,"The story of the young Johnny Cash and his love affair with June Carter Cash come to life in Walk the Line. It stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon with the best female performance of the year-no doubt. This movie starts how Johnny Cash got to where he is at, one of the most recognizable artists in history. With his popular country music to the love of his life, June Carter. Johnny meets June at a local concert and I liked the way this movie shows us how they met. Johnny grew up listening to June's music and the way he began to look at her, he saw beauty. Johnny and his band later begin to tour with June and go out there and perform and do they're own shows. Johnny becomes one of the most famous musicians and his singles begin to rise on the billboard. But Johnny takes a wrong turn and begins to pop pills every now and then and his career and his love for June begins to fall apart. June later wouldn't look at him or talk to him. He later turns into a big mess.I really loved this movie but this movie probably wouldn't be the same if the performances weren't there. Reese Witherspoon gave the best performance in this movie and I really think she is a real hot woman. After seeing all her other movies and seeing how she acts in this movie, she is brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix also gave a really powerful performance. I saw the horror film ""Signs"", in which he co-stars and it seemed like he was a different person in this film. This is one amazing film with brilliant performances. I loved it.Since the Oscar winner ""Ray"" was released 2004 and this was released 2005, I may want to compare it. Although Ray was more depressing in some ways and powerful, Ray beats Johnny Cash but these two movies are both wonderful pieces of work. I am very happy that Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar for ""Best Actress"". She really deserved it.I really loved this movie and I would wanna see it again. This was one of the best movies of 2005 and it is a wonderful piece of work. Everyone should see this movie. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Exceptional performances raise the level of excellent bio...,"It's been a long time since I've been privileged to see two such heartfelt performances as are given by JOAQUIN PHOENIX and REESE WITHERSPOON in this excellent bio of Johnny Cash. It's a bittersweet love story of how a good woman is able to handle the difficult, stormy relationship with a man and redeem him with her love. And around these two, are performances of such high caliber that the result is a deeply satisfying feeling that you've experienced the pain and love along with the characters.The supporting cast does wonders, each and every one of them is absolute perfection. Mention must be made of DALLAS TAYLOR as the man who auditions the guitar-strumming trio and makes a very important suggestion; ROBERT PATRICK as the callous, indifferent father who creates scenes of enormous tension when he clashes with his son's lifestyle of drugs and opulent living; WAYLON PAYNE as the frenzied Jerry Lee Lewis, doing a remarkable job in his first acting role and showing the kind of charisma that makes him stand out among the supporting cast of musicians.Admirers of Johnny Cash should enjoy the movie unless they want to quibble with the fact that Phoenix does not have the same deep timber in his singing tones that Cash had, except for certain moments where his lower register does get a chance to show. But Phoenix is an extremely talented actor who rises to the challenge here. His chemistry with Reese Witherspoon is especially powerful in a quieter moment early on when they meet at a coffee shop. And from that moment on, the chemistry is palatable until the final sweet moment when she finally says ""yes"" to his marriage proposal.An excellent film, even for those who are not at all familiar with the darker side of Cash's life.

The acting is stunning but the story is biopic formula,"Enough can't be said about Reese Witherspoon's performance as June Carter. She nails the duality of a character who lives on and off the stage while maintaining a purity and charm that certainly has pushed her into the A-list.Joaquin Phoenix as the man in black is superb as well. He takes the role into some pretty dark territory and sells it without question. Cash is haunted throughout, by the death of his brother, the mental abuse of his father, and a marriage/life that was rushed into. A complicated character made far more difficult to play by the fact that Cash is a man of few words - leaving Phoenix to mostly express himself with physicality and song.This movie will not make Johnny Cash any new fans. His music isn't exactly as accessible in snippets as the grooves of Ray Charles (the comparisons between Walk the Line and Ray are inevitable as they have many scenes and a general form in common.) With Cash you have to get a sense of the persona he created in his songs...and film isn't the best medium in which to present lyrics.A couple of scenes are absolutely stand-out. One being a diner scene early in the film after we have met June on stage. We get to see her and Cash plant the seeds of the relationship that the film follows. They have a huge amount of chemistry and it is vital that they do as their love story drives the movie.Another standout scene is when Cash auditions for Sam Phillips at Sun Records and Johnny essentially becomes the Man in Black. After performing a limp version of a gospel number Phillips goads him into singing something that he believes. Cash whips out Folsom Prison Blues and by the time the Reno line comes around, Phoenix has transformed the character from doddling, loveless salesman into massive superstar.The acting is worth the ticket, the story is standard. Its too bad that this movie had to come out so soon after Ray. They are so very similar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Run, Don't Walk, to See ""Walk the Line""","""WALK THE LINE""(2005) Johnny Cash personally picked Joaquin Phoenix to play his character for this movie as did June Carter Cash when she selected Reese Witherspoon to play her character before they both passed away about two years ago. Their choices were both wise decisions as neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon disappoint in this film. Quite to the contrary, their performances are so perfectly nuanced that they both look and sound just like the real singers.There is a lot of great singing in this film along with a rather sweet tale about bad boy Cash finally getting June Carter to become his wife. Cash was tormented for years by the demons of booze and pills besides being married to another woman during the time he fell in love with June. Carter wasn't in much better shape with two failed marriages behind her and Cash offering little hope for marital stability. Their on again, off again relationship in both their singing and in their work before their eventual marriage forms the foundation for this film.I will gladly admit to the astounding verisimilitude of their acting and their singing. Phoenix and Witherspoon become Cash and Carter. Their singing, while not quite up to the caliber of the originals, certainly passes muster. If you close your eyes and don't think about it too much, you would easily believe that you are listening to the real Johnny Cash and the real June Carter.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon clicked with me both as actors and performers.

Not a pedestrian effort,"Gaining a lot, I'm sure from being familiar with its subject, as someone who never knew of Johnny Cash until watching this (cut me some slack, I was 12), this was still a vivid and well characterised story of all the highs and lows of stardom.Efficiently paced considering we cover like, 30 years, the movie end where it needs to end and becomes a creative romance along the way that steers clear of any sentimentality.In short, excellent for what it is but you got to have a real appreciation for it's trying to do.

Amazing movie.,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. Contains great performances by both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and there could not have been a better two actors chosen for these parts. Their performances are stunning and can I just mention that I looove June Carters hairstyles, the pouf is great!! In addition, the soundtrack was phenomenal and full of as much life as was in the movie. Features the newly popular, at least on the country charts, Shooter Jennings to play the part of his father, Waylon. Also, Tyler Hilton was cast to play a -blonde- Elvis Presley. This is with out a doubt my new favorite love story-- even over the Notebook, which is quite an accomplishment!! I cannot wait to own it... March 7th!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A Thing Called Love,"It is the movie I was waiting for...about the childhood and early rock 'n' roll years of Johnny Cash as well as the relationship with June Carter. All mixed together it results an excitable and amusing movie. The story is based on Johnnys autobiography with some slight changes, but generally captures the best and the most important moments. The Folsom prison scene at the beginning makes you really feel like entering into a live concert and is one of the few memorable scenes in this movie.Surely the acting has to be praised, Joaquin Phoenix as well as Reese Witherspoon really got into their roles and were very convincing, you actually feel the chemistry between them! Both Joaquin and Reese made a Oscar-worth performance!Although I sometimes missed Johnnys voice in the songs, Joaquin(Reese also) made a solid singing performance as well so there cant be any real objections. Throughout the movie we hear great early songs of Johnny (and June), like Cry!Cry!Cry!, I Walk the Line, Jackson, Get Rhythm, Ring of Fire, Folsom Prison Blues,...""Walk the Line"" must be watched as a love story in first, and not a detailed Johnny Cash movie, and some parts of his life were just kind off simplified for the purpose of this love story(like why Johnny wears black,...). I cant loose the feeling that Johnny was even stronger and more charismatic then shown in the movie. But I guess its because we see just the young years of Cash.But this movie succeeds not only because of its great actors and classic love story. ""Walk the Line"" also manages to display the engaging portraits of stars like Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis(also episode roles of Waylon Jennings or Roy Orbison), of course just as background, but after all the 50ties are just unthinkable without them. And it comes to my mind that Johnny Cash really outlived them, they lived fast but also burn out fast, except for Johnny. He went on, and on,...and the strength for this came out of June and the love that was connecting them..",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
a pathetic movie about an ignominious country and western singer.,"This film is synonymous of the type of modern film making that seems to eulogise facts and circumstances which are not only trivial but of no substance.We have the usual rags to riches type story peppered with some personality defects and from this we have to identify a character who appears to be a world wide representative of the good ol'country boy doin' good after a period in the wilderness. Maybe our American cousins have a greater affinity to this sort of thing but as a movie it was quite pathetic. The acting was reasonable but where a characterisation of a once living person is depicted an actor of merit should accomplish this without too much effort. Our friends in the movie business seemed to rate this movie quite highly this is not surprising in a mutual admiration set -up. I am beginning to question my own values where we are continually directed in way of MASTERPIECES which turn out to be so much turgid , uninspiring normality",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Love Burns Burns Burns,"This post contains MAJOR spoilers-Do not read unless you've seen the movieI loved this movie. It shows that you can't control who you love and love makes you do crazy things. Johnny is like most country artists born poor in Arkansas to tenant farmers, June best known from the singing Carter family. The two meet at Johnny's first big gig. Johnny instantly is won over by June's sense of humor and beauty. Despite both being wed to another, they develop a warm friendship.But fame has a dark side, Johnny begins using drugs and drinking a lot of booze. June tries anyway she can to get John clean, including taking all his medicine and flushing it down. Johns downward spiral continues. He gets arrested for possession, and his marriage (which has been failing for a while) takes a final turn, when his wife leaves and takes their daughters with him. Johnny then gets a spot by himself and pines only for June. She is disgusted by the sight of him but Johnny won't give up on the woman he loves. He shows he can change and that he loves her more than anything, the night of they sing together after a while apart Johnny has proposed over 30 times but she still says no.She tells him in the dressing room that he is only allowed to speak to her on stage tonight. While singing Jackson Johnny stops in the middle of the song, June is confused but continues singing, Johnny then announces that he can't sing the song until he asks June something. He then asks June one final time saying that he knows he did some bad things, but he only wants to be a part of her life, he just wants to take care of her. June finally says yes and it begins their life together.The acting blew me away. Joaquin Phoenix captured Johnny Cash. He showed his bad and his good sides with such dedication. Reese did amazing as June Carter, she hit every emotional note. Gennifer Goodwin won me over too showing a woman who was in love but the love died out. I recommend this film to anyone, it is a truly beautiful film and deserved to be viewed by all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Wonderful Film,"This was a wonderful movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon both deserved their Oscar nominations.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Outstanding,"This is the life of Johnny Cash based upon two books that he wrote.The things that makes this movie good are the music itself and the times June Carter (Witherspoon) and Cash (Phoenix) are together whether singing or just talking. They have great chemistry, but the singing part has the edge as far as I am concerned. The music might even over-ride all else, but when you consider who the singers were (in real life), this becomes really great. What a time it must have been for a young Johnny Cash to be on a circuit with June Carter, Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Of course I am sure each didn't know how great each was to become, but it must have been good times nevertheless.Phoenix's singing was good and at times you almost heard (at the end of the movie) Johnny Cash, but the mannerisms were down pat and you know we looked for that. You just know.Now for the title. I would have put the title as Ring of Fire, or Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. Come on he didn't walk the line when he was still married to Vivian, his first wife. It was just wishful thinking on his part. Okay, the line was given to him by June. Still¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö.I still cannot help thinking that besides the music the person that puts this over the top is Reese Witherspoon. Without her, this still would have been good, but with her singing and portrayal of June Carter, this became great in my eyes. I had the best feeling when she was on screen with Phoenix, especially when she was singing. She may have been the friend, the girl friend as a secondary focus to Johnny Cash, but she made this movie. She was much more than an excellent Supporting Actress. She was the Best Actress and she has my vote.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A good film redeemed by a great story,"The story of Johnny Cash and June Carter. That would have been a more fitting title and sounds like something you'd watch on the Hallmark channel or something like that. The story of Johnny Cash is a great and interesting one that anybody with any interest, I'm sure, has heard many times. The problem with this film is that it's just being told again. The acting is brilliant, possibly Reese Witherspoons best performance ever and she deserves to get the Oscar. The scripts is, like Johnny's music ""slow like a steam train and sharp like a knife"". It's these two factors that make the film so good. There was so much possibility to make this a classic but instead it won't be remembered in 20 years time. There is a great energy on screen during the opening scene and the main scene at Folsom Prison. Some of the other concert scenes, particularly when he's in a bad way, are shot really well. Bringing to mind album covers and photographs of the man in black. I think what's happened here is we have the director making the mistake of focusing on the actors and not spending enough time directing the crew. This I find strange when you think of films like Girl Interrupted, an immensely atmospherics film throughout and Identity which, in my opinion, suffers on the acting front, is made good by the production and the story.Having had my little rant I must stress that I still rated it 8 out of 10. The film is very good and I would recommend it. I don't think you'll lose out by waiting for the DVD but if your reading this and the year is 2026 or later, I've a good feeling you'll think this is very average. Hopefully by then we'll have a Darren Aronovsky version of the life of Johnny Cash that will be darker and more mysterious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Brilliant Movie!,"Its difficult to comment on this movie because its almost impossible to decide where to start when describing how good it is! I'm not going to sit here and say its my favourite film or the best I've ever seen but there is very little in this film that i feel could have been improved. In a Biography,its is the acting and not the directing that is the most important, i feel anyway. The Directing is sufficient and consistent throughout and as has been echoed from professionals the world over, Joequin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deserve Oscars for their performances. I read one journalists report on this film and they say Joequins too short to play Johnny and Reese too pretty for her role. I don't know to be honest, and it may well be the case. But ill say that if that is all they can find wrong with this film then i think that says it all. I didn't know a whole lot about Johnny Cash when i watched this film and it didn't embellish on his character or romanticise his persona like most Hollywood tripe, i wont go into details but there are times you feel sorry for him, angry at him or sometimes don't care. As I've said, everything in this film is excellent or sufficient for what is needed. The Music, excellent. Directing, sufficient. And the Acting and Casting, Superb. And Reese Witherspoon is gorgeous throughout! I give this film 9 out of 10 and would recommend it to anyone!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Best,"Whenever I see so much ""Oscar worthy"" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.I absolutely loved it. More my dad's music than mine (I was born in 1960-am a rock-n-roller), but tapped my feet the whole way thru. It is funny, I grew up with certain songs of Johnny Cash, and heard about the legend of the ""man in black"" for as long as I remember, but this movie adds a whole new dimension to the man, his music. I think it's great maybe a whole new generation might come to enjoy his contributions too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Still good- don't let Ray dampen it for you,"While Ray was a really good movie, this one is almost as good if not as good if only for Joaquin Phoenix's and Reese Witherspoon's performances. Both of them are so electrifying as Johnny Cash and June Carter, the movie would just not be good with other actors playing them. The same can be said of Ray, and while some people are calling Walk the Line 2005's Ray, I really don't think that's true. Ray was sad and melancholy, and more of a full and broad portrait of Ray Charles than Walk the Line is of Johnny Cash. Walk the Line focuses in on his love for Carter and his addictions. Ray covers more of Charles' life while still feeling focused- Walk the Line actually is focused, and each works on its own terms.While the movie wouldn't be the same without Phoenix or Witherspoon, it supports its players well, connecting the different plot points well with each of their songs and allowing a glimpse of the characters past Johnny and June, such as Johnny's wife and father.A good movie- don't miss it because you've been told Ray's better.

Like today's musical biopics, the film also has really strong acting. Joaquin Phoenix, whos legendary acting prowess precedes him, obviously does terrific work here. Reese Witherspoon too, is excellent. Now I don't know exactly what Direction means. I don't know what a director really does.

This movie needs intelligence to watch,"This is an intelligent movie, requiring the viewer to watch carefully and evaluate the significance of what is both said and spoken. I suggest you watch the DVD version so you see the deleted scenes and the director's comments. They're helpful and a guide to the art that went into putting the film together. In fact, I doubt that a book can be turned into a movie any other way.You need to keep this understated technique in mind to appreciate Reese Witherspoon's performance in the film. Her hidden agony as the religious June Carter in love with the married Johnny Cash is, to put it mildly, Heavenly. She's no longer Legally Blonde. I never fully understood the significance of ""Burning Ring of Fire"" until I saw Reese's interpretation of why it was written.

One of the better recent biopics,"One of the better recent biopics. I had never paid much attention to Joaquin Phoenix before. But I must say now that he is an actor that must be taken seriously. He neither looks nor sounds much like Johnny Cash, but I don't think that is absolutely necessary to evoke the character, which he did very well. The middle sequence about addiction, and overcoming it, was a bit tiresome. I understand that it had to be there, that it was a big part of Cash's life, but it seems like they all go through it. Phoenix did that well, too, and I presume that he knows more than a little about addiction. Kudos to Ginnifer Goodwin for her performance as Vivian Cash. She was excellent in the role. I had seen her on a TV show (Ed) and am glad that she is getting quality parts. By the way, some of Cash's survivors have publicly complained about the portrayal of Vivian Cash. With one small exception, she (Vivian) never came across as a bitch, or a harridan, but as a real woman, a wife and mother, with real and serious concerns. I haven't read Cash's book, but I imagine that he would be the first to admit that he was responsible for Vivian's travails. And this brings me to Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. It seemed to me that she absolutely stole the show. She deftly mixed comedic and dramatic acting. Who knew she had this sort of range? A well-deserved Oscar for her. And while she may not look that much like June Carter, she was able to sound very much like her when she sang. I have a feeling that Miss Witherspoon might be quite formidable at a karaoke contest.

Walk the Line,"Joaquin Phoenix might take top billing as the legendary American musician Johnny Cash, but it's got to be Reece Witherspoon who steals the plaudits as June Carter. She demonstrates all the feistiness and determination of a woman, in a man's world, quite prepared to do her own thing. Assisted by a fair degree of charisma and musical talent, she can play a stage with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis and Carl Perkins with confidence. The film starts at the now famous Folsom Prison just before he takes the stage and by way of a continuing retrospective, we learn of his childhood - one touched by tragedy very early on, of his strained relationship with his father (Robert Patrick) then his service in the US Air Force before, gradually, his stage career and burgeoning romance with his co-star. He is married to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and they have children, but that doesn't really curtail his passion for Carter and we see that relationship evolve in parallel with his affection for just about anything that comes from a bottle. The life of this man has been pretty publicly documented so there's little room for James Mangold to manoeuvre with the facts here. Instead, we are offered a plausible speculation on just how this couple made it through. I found Phoenix's performance just a little too close to mimicry at times, but there's a solid chemistry between him and Witherspoon throughout with the depiction of his descent into chemically indeed oblivion quite sad to watch. It's underpinned by a strong score and both deliver the songs - especially ""Jackson"" quite toe-tappingly.

Superb Portrayal of the Man in Black,"Johnny Cash is, without question, a legend. One of the greatest singers and certainly the greatest Country and Western singer. Based on his autobiographies, this film takes us from Johnny Cash's humble and tough origins, the son of a poor farming family, neglected by his father, with a beloved brother who died when they were still children, to his superstar status, depicting both his passions for music and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and his self-destructive appetite for drink and drugs.While the film takes on the typical structure of musical biopics, it is saved by superb performances from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon, who deservedly won an Oscar for her role. The two actors did their own singing and playing and sound perfectly convincing. The film is well-made and hugely entertaining with, of course, plenty of great music.

"lust, guilt and body language over dialogue","James Mangold is a rarity in American 'studio' cinema: he is not interested in sticking to one category or genre; the director of 'Girl, Interrupted' might not be expected to voluntarily make the biography of a pop star. The Johnny Cash story, though, is well-stocked with the stuff of Gothic legend and that ole dichotomy of lust and guilt that has informed the work of the blues and western greats from Charlie Patton through Robert Johnson and Hank Williams to¬ÖJohnny Cash. Mangold is pretty adept at exploring the dark undercurrents whatever his subject. The wide screen was made for the kind of shots cameraman Phedon Papamichael sets up here - there really is a camera language which is not quite the same as that used in medium-width frames, and he is especially fluent. The Memphis of the 'fifties, fat big automobiles and the air heavily moist with music, is lovingly recreated, and the vignettes of rock 'n' roll taking shape will make most of us who were born after 1950 feel an aching regret at not having been older, just as today's young rock bands keep trying to redo the 'sixties they never knew. Joaquin Phoenix has joined the top league on the strength of his performance, going from playful and innocent to bloody dangerous, and he has a better voice than Cash, actually - and we should not be surprised to see Reese Witherspoon's first album out soon. She can cut the mustard. One major problem with this film for non-American audiences is the dialogue. There are many long scenes consisting of nothing but talk, or even half-whispering, where we can't help wondering, 'What on Earth are they talking about?' Sometimes, only sometimes, we can guess from watching the subsequent action. There have been letters in the press from British cinema-goers, begging for subtitles in US films, but only notably since 'Walk the Line' came out, although it is by no means the first film to meet with incomprehension away from home.

The Movie was awesome I have seen the movie 5 times all ready I was that good and that my favors actor and actress was playing Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. All and all go see walk the line if you haven't yet. We'll see on March 8 2006 if Walk the Line or Joaquin and Renees will take home and Oscar.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Over rated,"Reese Withspoon is great in the film but Joachim Phoenix is just not believable as Johnny Cash - too squat, and no voice. The thing that sold Johhny to Sam Phillips was the voice. Sam would never have signed someone who sounded like Phoenix- good song or not. So he's no Jamie Foxx ""inhabiting "" Ray Charles; or even Val Kilmer being Jim Morrison. He's not the worst actor to play a rock star- that dubious award has to go the Garey Busy for his impersonation of Buddy Holly playing Gary Busey. A second problem; by and large we know the stories of these celebrities already, so dramatic structure takes a beating. Did any one not know that Johnny was saved by his amphetamine addiction by June Carter and that they lived happily ever after. A bit more of Mother Maybelle's character would have been welcome as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Stays with you long after the credits roll.,"After watching this film I was sure it had something missing, that it was somehow floored. But on reflection, it's not. It's amazingly fulfilling and every minute enjoyable. The film is not a masterpiece. It rarely manages to delve into the subjects motivation and inspiration for his choice in music style. And I'm sure the Sun Records road show with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis and the likes had considerably more to tell than merely Cash's introduction to June Carter and excess. In general coverage of the limelight and overindulgence seems scant. But it's not a documentary after all, it's a love story.Is it well rounded and complete? I don't know and I'm not bothered. As a film in its own right it is fantastic.Undoubtedly, in keeping with every other review, but it's so prevalent to the film's success that it has to be said ¬ñ the performance scenes are brilliant. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon sing their own songs and do an unbelievably good job. Their portrayal of Carter and Cash's romance is just as compelling and you just want to watch the character's appealing sadness with as many songs thrown in as possible. And that's exactly what this film gives its audience ¬ñ complete satisfaction.Watch this, watch The Buddy Holly Story, and watch Ray because they're all great.

"Perhaps not totally emotional, but well-driven by great performances","Perhaps similar to ""Ray,"" ""Walk the Line"" is a documentary on Johnny Cash, a country singer played by Joaquin Phoenix.After a brief clip of Johnny's childhood, the main story starts off when he comes out with his record ""Cry, Cry, Cry."" So, he goes on tour with June Carter, (Reese Witherspoon) trying to make himself a country singer. He meets his partner, June and they become friends. But, Johnny wants to become more than just that. He does have a wife, but they aren't too close. ""Walk the Line"" is a story about character development and heart.I believe the title ""Walk the Line"" either stands for one of Johnny's songs or walking the DUI line. (A test to make sure you aren't drunk.) If it's the second one, then it probably because Johnny gets drunk at one point. You see, Johnny had a rough life. His brother died, and his dad blamed it on Johnny. From there on, Johnny takes anger pills for those rough times. He also makes plenty of mistakes when trying to get June Carter to fall in love with him.""Walk the Line"" has a lot of country music. Reese Witherspoon is probably the best singer out of all of them, because of the neat tricks she can do with her voice. It also features plenty of Johnny Cash songs including ""Rock n' Roll Groupie"" and ""Ring of Fire."" Joaquin sings them with a deep voice and all his songs sound good. My favorite songs would have to be ""Get Rhythm (When you get the Blues)"" and ""Time's a Wastin'"". Of course, if you dislike country music, you probably shouldn't see it.I found ""Walk the Line"" to be a little short in the storyline department. It has plenty of music, but the music takes up time for a story. It's simple. There are no major twists or turns. But, ""Walk the Line"" is about character development; not story.That's where the drama comes from. It's about how characters change and feel. If the emotion came from the dialogue, it would probably fail emotionally. I thought more heart could have been put into the dialogue. But, with pretty deep characters and great performances, (Reese won an Oscar for giving enough sass to June, and for excellent vocals.) ""Walk the Line"" succeeds, even if there are few scenes of powerful emotion. I wouldn't call it amazing, as so many have, but it's powerful at various points in the movie.Overall, ""Walk the Line"" may be a little short, but it's entertaining and occasionally powerful.7/10Good: Music and actingBad: A bit lacking in substance and dialogueFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

It's a movie praising cheating & making a woman look bad though she was right.,"Though I actually preferred Phoenix & Witherspoon's singing (actually, just Reese, June Carter sounds like she has a frog in her throat) this movie really romanticized cheating & made his first wife look like a psycho when she really had a good reason to be upset. Whether the movie accurately portrayed events correctly, I don't like how this portrayed cheating as if it were ok bc it was a ""love story"" based on cheating. His first wife was portrayed as someone who held him back during a time when women were raised to rely on men for support and God forbid expect fidelity & trust. She accuses him of cheating...because he was cheating. She's the only character I had sympathy for.Low grade movie. Best part was seeing Shooter Jennings portray his Dad & Waylon Payne (Godson to Waylon Jennings) who was also connected to a real person & both did a fantastic job portraying both Waylon Jennings & Jerry Lee Lewis.I'd prefer listening to Reese Witherspoon sing than June & Shooter Jennings version of You Are My Sunshine is amazing & never realized how sad the lyrics were.

There should have been a double Oscar.,"Don't ask me why the academy chose not to nominate Phoenix for an Academy Award; I just watched the film and was hugely impressed with his depiction of Cash. Not only could he sing the famous Cash songs beautifully but he also had the stage actions down virtually perfect. I loved watching how he played Cash and his stage movements with his guitar-no other performer that I know carried his guitar behind his back and moved it around as he did on stage and Phoenix copied his moves perfectly.I have read reviewers that were disappointed in Phoenix and his depiction of Cash so I went to the film expecting to be disappointed-how wrong I was. From the opening at Folson Prison with the music's heavy beat leading to Cash's stage appearance, I could see Cash in the interpretation that Phoenix gave-I had no trouble, particularly by the end, thinking that Cash was still with us and I was watching a live performance. In my opinion the various reviewers missed with their interpretation this time around.Margold's direction and his script writing can not be faulted. All in all I thought the film was superb and much underrated, with great acting, great singing and set decoration right out of the period.Even if you don't like country music, make every effort to see this wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

She definitely got the spirit of the '50's and makes it look easy.One thing I did not like in the movie is that the vocals didn't match the lip sync.

New Appreciation For Johnny Cash,This movie is great for those of us (I am 37) that are too young to really appreciate Johnny Cash. It was fun to see sides of him that I have never seen or heard of. I was never a real fan of his music but after seeing all that he overcame in his rise (most of it self inflicted) make you really appreciate him. This movie also show Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon's range of talents. To actually learn to play and sing like the Johnny and June was amazing.

Hard going to keep watching,"I'm currently deployed overseas and have a fair bit of down time at night - if I was in any way busy this evening there's no way I would have stuck around to watch the film through to the end.The film portrays Johnny Cash as a weak and pathetic individual, bereft of any redeeming features. From what I've read of him, the film portrays the character accurately - the type of character I genuinely dislike, hence I suppose why I didn't enjoy the film. I could see nothing uplifting in the story - at all. He seemed to be a poison to all he had close contact with and his lack of strength led him to succumb to all temptations. If not for his musical talent and consequent wealth, he would have been an even more lonely man.I love his music, but not the man that sings it - nor the film about the man.Joaquin Phoenix is very strong in the role and his depiction of Cash's voice is excellent - in fact, his voice is 'too excellent', and considerably better than the true Johnny Cash. You see, I think a real charm of Johnny Cash was that his success belied his singing talent. His acting skills were great and his living of the ballads were most convincing - the anger borne from frustration and desertion of the boy named Sue, and only the Lord knows why that boy took his guns to town.But don't get me wrong, I still love The Man in Black's music and have many of his albums. But just because a person can sing and entertain does not mean he is a good man, nor does it mean we should just blindly accept all his weaknesses.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Great psychologically; Great musically.,"I'm a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist and get annoyed when psychological and family dynamics are inaccurately portrayed; I was not annoyed.

His early closeness with his brother, the effects of his alcoholic father and his complex, changing relationship with him, his burdens and attempts to escape from those, are quite realistically portrayed in the film.What there was not time enough to portray was what motivated June Carter Cash.

"""Walk The Line"" lacks dimensions","Okay, pick your own worst fault and have someone make a biographical movie centered on it. This is essentially what this movie did for Johnny Cash. His drug and alcohol dependencies, such as they might have been, were not central to his image, to his stature in country music, or to the humanity he represented. This movie marginalized Johnnny Cash.I was happy to see from movie-review websites such as yours, that the under-30 age group raved about his music, belatedly realizing that rhythm is not the exclusive property of rock musicians. A further evolution will occur when they get to appreciate Johnnny's slower, more melancholy country rhythms which were absent in this movie, no doubt in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience.Take it from a life-long fan, apart from his ""songwriting"" in that German hangar and his audition for a recording, folks, it was Johnny himself actually singing, not J.

"A solid, well-made film about the life and times of Johnny Cash","'Walk the Line' tells the story of music legend Johnny Cash and his journey to becoming a popular country rock icon. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as The Man in Black and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, who Cash desperately tries to marry many times. Director James Mangold ('Girl, Interrupted') tells the story of 'Walk the Line' through flashback initially then moves into ""present"" time.The film shows Cash as a young boy growing up in a farm in Arkansas. His father (Robert Patrick) is tough on him, but seems to hold more love towards his brother Jack. Unfortunately there is a bizarre saw-blade accident and Jack is killed. This incident is shown to scare Cash as the responsibility for the death is blamed on him. After joining the Air Force and serving in Germany Cash moves into a house with Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and has two kids. After an unsuccessful stint as a salesman, he goes into music and is sharply elevated to fame. This is where he meets June Carter, the woman who he falls in love with although it causes a problem for his marriage. The rest of 'Walk the Line' covers Cash going to places like Folsom Prison, singing his songs to large audiences, and doing several duets with Carter.Employing emotionally raw scenes, Mangold attempts to tell Cash's story honestly but not without heart. The screeenplay, based on Cash's autobiography, weaves together a narrative about Cash as a man who got into trouble his fair share but was ultimately honest with himself and who didn't care what other people thought. The screenplay is simple enough - it shows cause and effect and develops the relationship between Cash and Carter well. One can tell Mangold put his heart into the project and very much cares about the subject matter. His direction, too, is solid but nothing spectacular. In terms of technical elements 'Walk the Line' is richly edited and well shot. Even though the film is well made it's not quite great.As much as it tries to cover Cash's life, Mangold doesn't cover everything and the ending feels abrupt. The performances are very strong from both leads although the supporting cast is forgotten about, unlike 'Ray'. It doesn't delve deep into the material but covers things too simply. Overall, 'Walk the Line' is a good biopic for anyone interested in Cash or music but it never gets to the level of great.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Good film, two great performances","If ever there were a case of two performers taking over a film and making it their own this is it. Walk the Line is elevated by two of the most brilliant performances you could ever hope to see from Joaquin Phoenix as the legendary Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, Cash's partner on stage and eventually offstage as well. The love Johnny Cash and June Carter had for one another was legendary and the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon more than do their story justice. The story of Johnny and June is a great one and it's told pretty well in this film. The film takes a little while to really get going, showing Johnny's troubled childhood and his struggle to launch his music career. The film doesn't really take off until Johnny and June come together. There are still some lulls after that and some tough, painful moments as well as Cash's terrible addictions are honestly and at times rather brutally displayed. But throughout the brilliance of Phoenix and Witherspoon is constant. They are terrific in portraying the great love their two characters had for one another and also brilliantly express the frustrations they would have with one another as their relationship progressed in fits and starts. And where Phoenix and Witherspoon really shine is on stage as, yes, they do all the singing themselves. In this area Phoenix in particular is simply mesmerizing. In look and sound he is so believable on stage as Johnny Cash it is downright eerie. Close your eyes and you would be forgiven for thinking you were listening to Cash himself.As wonderful as Phoenix and Witherspoon are the film does struggle at times to keep the story moving. You get the feeling there could have been ten minutes or so trimmed out that wouldn't have been missed and that would have helped the film maintain a more constant energy. When it's good, this film is very, very good but there are too many moments when the story drags. The filmmakers take great pains to make sure we really get to know Johnny Cash but there are definitely some scenes which could have been shortened or eliminated altogether without taking away from our understanding of who Johnny Cash really was. By the end of the film it is obvious this is not just Johnny's story but the story of Johnny and June together and in retrospect it seems the film was just killing time until the two leads could be brought together. Other performances, including Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny's first wife and Robert Patrick as Johnny's father, are fine and their roles are important in establishing why Johnny Cash became the man that he was. But this movie clearly belongs to Johnny and June, Phoenix and Witherspoon. Walk the Line is certainly a good film. If you feel it is something special it will have been the performances of Phoenix and Witherspoon which will have made it so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
good as far as it went,"The film was great, as far as it went.

I would like to have seen more emphasis on his addiction and the hell he went through to kick it.After he wed June, he travel led a lot, including to Vietnam during the war, plus his own TV show.

I've seen better,"There are many people who thought this was a fabulous piece of work, but I'm not one of them. I respect other people's opinions, but I just saw it as a flat, old-fashioned biographical film. It really did not offer any real gripping stories, that I have not seen in biographical films before, there was little room I felt, to really like or dislike the lead characters. It was pretty much a standard love story with really good music, and strong acting performances. The music is enough for some recognition for this film. I can not argue with the authenticity of the music which made this film appealing throughout. Granted of course though, just get a Johnny Cash album for that. I don't drive to Vegas to see Elvis impersonators only. Recordings of the real Elvis or Johnny Cahs are hardly that heavily in demand. If you want to capture the different loks on the music being made, that is another story. Granted though, I thought that was extremely watered down. For the most part, this film is a total ripoff on the film that inspired it, ""Ray."" ""Walk the Line"" deals with the same primary issues of the lead that ""Ray"" deals with (i.e. the scandal, negligent family man, origin of artist finding unique sound, etc.). One scene I thought was done very poorly in this film which was inspired by a similar scene in Ray is when Cash and his two performers audition at the sound recording place and the producers finds their sound boring because it is the same old thing. And the scene gradually turns into him doing something really spectacular with his music. It was absolutely watered down with minimal energy. This level of energy remained constant throughout the film. The best part of the film was the acting. I can not deny that the acting n this film was absolutely fabulous and kept the film. Both Joachin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon absolutely became their characters. It was not an impersonation. They really were the characters. Witherspoon's Oscar was completely deserved. Since I have not Capote, I can not completely against Phoenix not receiving the Oscar, but he sure could have won and wold have deserved it. Overall, this film was at best, a little more than decent.

With Walk the Line, though, I had been looking forward to it all year and was worried that I wouldn't like it as much. But was I wrong!This movie is amazing! Every single bit of praise it has received is well deserved. Jaquin Pheonix does an excellent job at portraying Cash, and it really feels as if you're looking at the real thing. The show was truly stolen by Reese Witherspoon, though. From the first moment she ran on screen, you fell instantly in love with her. When her voice soared it was incredible. She truly deserved her Oscar and has definitely proved herself a truly wonderful actress. In my opinion, she has given one of the greatest performances of all time.All in all, Walk the Line was by far one of the greatest films of the year. The music is excellent, the performances great. It rocks!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Not great acting but great impersonations!,"I liked the movie but like so many it is more impersonating than acting. I thought the same thing of ""Ray"" last year, except walk the line does a better job than ""Ray"". The story line is good and gives you enough background in the life of Johnny Cash and the type of person he was. I was pleased to see that it didn't glorify him and showed the faults in his personality and moral character. It did not give a whole lot of info of the life of June Carter. The story doesn't really tell you anything that you didn't already know about Johnny Cash unless maybe you just weren't ever interested in his life before hand. Big Johnny Cash fans might not find it all that compelling but probably will see it, people who don't like Johnny Cash have no reason to see it.

Superior Performances,"This is truly a superior movie. I don't understand how this could not even be nominated in the Best Movie category at the Oscars. Joaquin Phoenix delivers and absolutely stunning performance and is even singing all the songs in the movie himself! Not to speak of Reese Witherspoon who is playing the best she EVER did, no wonder she won that Oscar! Even the small parts in this movie has great cast, and is all played with such a devotion, especially Robert Patrick impressed me with his play as Ray Cash, Johnny Cash's father!This movie is gonna be remembered for years to come, that is for sure.

Bravo! Well done!,"Truly one of the all time greats. Very impressive, very well done. Excellent quality, excellent acting, excellent story, excellent music. I see T Bone (Henry) Burnett was responsible for the music production.Awesome sound!! How on earth were they able to get those 2 actors to sound ""real""?? I bet they have horrible voices but somehow they were able to make this sound 100% real and authentic. I loved seeing the old Fender,Gibson and Martin guitars. The clothes, hards, cars, guitars, homes, hotels---everything looked like it came out of a time machine!!! I like movies that are historically accurate. I don't know too much about Mr. Cash but I hope they did his family and his life's story justice with the movie. I loved seeing the peripheral characters too--Sam Phillips, Elvis, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis.Hollywood knew what we wanted to see and hear. It's like they listened to Mr. Sam Phillips advice to Johnny Cash at the first audition--""you have to believe in yourself--play songs that make people want to buy them""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Interesting,"This movie was a look into the life of Johnny Cash, and how they portrayed him in a way that I find to be an interesting way to portray a popular figure. There were a lot of times when I was really frustrated with the characters in this movie and the events taking place. I think seeing something like this in movie form really just shows how frustrating or sad the whole situation was. It's interesting to explore the darker side of popular celebrities, which most are in bio or autobiopic formats, but in movies it's on a different level with visuals. Just for the pain this movie caused me, I'm taking off an extra point, but I didn't hate this movie. I thought it handled its themes well and the way they executed. I think this movie was probably a little biased due to the directors, and some stuff is probably false or definitely hammed up for the drama, but it was good nonetheless. Doing your own research on subjects is always good, too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Another story of Elvis,"The film ¬´Walk the Line¬ª is based on the true story of the life and formation of the American singer and songwriter, a key figure in country music of the 20th century, Johnny Cash.
I like starring actors in this film: Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.
The film reveals the history not only of his musical path with all the ensuing consequences, but also the history of child-parent relations and how they affected in adult life. Also here between the lines it is well read that there is true Christianity.
I can't say that I liked the movie. First of all, I can not understand why he was nominated for the award for best editing, because the first half of the film is mounted frankly bad, and all the sudden leaps in time and the complete absence of logic transitions spoil the impression. Well, personally for me, watching this movie was just as hard as reading the biography of Elvis Presley in 13 years. Perhaps for those who are well acquainted with the work of the singer and are involved in the time period, about which the film was shot - he will prove to be good. For me, this film is ""passing through"".
Of the positive points: Naturally, many moments were predictable. And what's new in a musician's life? But that's what pleased me, so this is the end of this story. Usually, such characters end their lives sadly and early. This is not a musical, but music is present here, in large numbers. And of course, a great acting, worthy of their awards and nominations for this film, was pleased.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"A strong powerful biopic of Johnny Cash's struggle with drink, drugs and the women in his life","Biopics are always a favourite of award ceremonies, and Johnny Cash's story of rags to riches, from poor beginnings into major musical icon is one that was always going to be of keen interest. Story focuses on his struggle (and lack of effort at many times also!) to deal with his demons, be it the struggle to come to terms with his brothers untimely death, or to be able to properly be a family man to his long-suffering wife and daughters. Into this mix comes his love and obsession with June Carter (very well done by Reese Witherspoon), who herself is trying to come to terms with her life struggling to bring up her children as her own marriages fall apart.Drugs and drink spiral the whole movie into a whirlwind of a vortex, with Cash being his own worst enemy, but the man has a gift. I'm not into country music, but even I had to say that the music in this movie was exceptional foot-stamping brilliance. The tours were great, and the lyrics fitted the atmosphere well. Joaquin Phoenix was incredibly good, and was unfortunate not to have won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of the country and western legend.Some scenes may be harrowing for some, as it depicts the violent and difficult family relationship he had with his father, and then with his first wife, but it is worth watching through. Thankfully they did not whitewash over Cash's character, showing him to be pathetic as he was at times, but it was hard not be come over by his mite.Overall, a great directed, written and acted movie. One of the better (if not best) American movies of recent years. Will definitely be getting some of his music now!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Movie subtitles did not contain song lyrics,"OK - I agree the movie was really good - however, I was shocked and dismayed that the DVD subtitles did not include the lyrics to the songs.

It's not you. It's me.,"Movie itself is great, I guess. Witherspoon and Phoenix's performance is awesome. Especially, Phoenix is good at acting, being vulnerable but not pathetic and being an ordinary man but not unattractive. I like his eyes when his soul is hurt; it shatters my heart, too. Music is higher quality than I expected; some songs are even better in the actors' voices. It's just I've watched enough of this story with musicians struggling with stardom, loneliness, drugs, alcohol, family drama, and love. On the top of my head, there are A Star is Born, Bohemian Rhapsody, George & Tammy, Daisy Jones & The Six, Dreamgirls, and etc. Of course, 'Walk the Line' comes first even before said works, but I watched the last. It does not have any 'great' quality that pops from others.It is too clear that 'Walk the Line' is set to make Vivian a villain of the story. It's director's choice, and it is obvious because it is based on Cash's autobiographies and because Cash and Carter's son is one of the producers. However, the director does not have to push it down my throat because it makes me feel repulsive and side with Vivian in reaction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Quite possibly the best picture of 2005.,"Last year, us moviegoers were given a biopic about one famous music legend by the name of Ray Charles. Jamie Foxx did commendable work as Mr. Charles. A year later, Hollywood did it again, this time with country legend Johnny Cash. Were they able to pull it off? Absolutely.Joaquin Phoenix is at his pivotal acting peak as Johnny Cash. People have said it too many times, but I need to remind everyone reading this that his performance deserves the Best Actor Oscar.The film takes us from Johnny's childhood, filled with horror, to some of his finest live performances, and through his difficulty abstaining from his drug addiction along the way.Along with Reese Witherspoon's stirring portrayal of a sometimes confused and outreaching June Carter, ""Walk the Line"" is just what movie goers are looking for.

all about the acting,"You don't have to be a fan of country music or Johnny Cash to enjoy this movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give the best performances of the year in a biopic that gets behind the image of its subject to portray a tortured, and often unpleasant, man. There are obvious similarities between this movie and ""Ray"" the life story of Ray Charles. This is a better movie though and that is due purely to the outstanding on screen relationship of Phoenix and Witherspoon. Joaquin Phoenix just about reaches that pinnacle of becoming more like Johnny Cash than Cash himself. In much the same way as Val Kilmer occupied the character of Jim Morrison in ""The Doors"". Reese Witherspoon gives is a feisty June Carter who's sheer energy carries the movie at moments when it may seem to flag. The depiction of Cash's struggle to make it as a singer is very real and doesn't indulge in the overnight success story so many biopics portray.This is a thoroughly engaging movie that I will definitely be adding to my DVD collection as soon as it is released.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
He sounds like Johhny Cash...so what.,"OK let me start this review off saying that the performances by the two leads were excellent, and they got the sound of the music down, which was wasn't easy to do considering they did all of their own singing. However, once I got over that fact (and it didn't take me that long since there is lots of singing in the movie) I wasn't too impressed. The plot in my opinion is pretty boring, especially considering the run time of nearly 2 and a half hours. It basically follows the standard rock star story of break out success followed by dysfunction at home, womanizing, and of course booze and drugs. How will this one end? Will Cash sober up and get the girl just in time for the happy Hollywood ending? I'm not gonna say, you'll just have to see it for yourself. *wink* Whether this movie portrays the life and times of Johnny Cash accurately I can't say, since I'm not really a fan of his. And in fact I will probably never be able to say, because ""Walk the Line"" doesn't make me interested enough to find out. I'd recommend this movie for fans of Johhny Cash (obviously) and for people interested in that genre of music in general. ""Walk the Line"" is full of singing and I imagine if this style of music was my cup of tea I'd be giving this movie a better rating but as stands a 5-6 is the best I can do. What more can I say, I realize the actors are delivering on their end, but the story and really the title character himself give me little reason to care.

I'm fascinated by great actors as it is, but these two unleash some serious SERIOUS talent in this film.

''Ray'' with white people? Not at all.,"If you haven't already, I think you should see this film. Incredible acting; great music; true story.

The obvious similarity between ""Walk The Line"" and ""Ray"" is the fact that both films focus on the life story of a musician. Yes, there is the rise and fall from fame, but both are true stories: thus similarity should not be considered during comparison.You should know if you are musically inclined enough to watch this film; even if you are not, I can't see how it will fail to at least entertain.I could keep writing but there's no point ‚Äì just see it.

Solid biopic of Johnny Cash with a captivating third act,"Released in early 2005 and directed by James Mangold, ""Walk the Line"" is a biopic of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix): His rise to fame, his travails with alcohol & drugs, his first marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and his ever-tightening relationship with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Robert Patrick (the T-1000 from ""Terminator 2"") and Shelby Lynne play Johnny's parents.This is a solid drama that naturally works better for people interested in the inimitable Cash. The first two acts are decent, but nothing great. However, I pleasantly found myself really entering into the story with the third act, which focused on Johnny in his self-made pit of despair and his angel of deliverance, June. I don't have a problem with Phoenix playing the musical icon, except that he was a full half a foot shorter than the towering Cash. Witherspoon is a nice fit for the humble June who was decent-looking, but by no means some hot starlet. In the movie, Vivian (as played by Goodwin) is clearly hotter than Witherspoon. In real-life Vivian was Italian American with an exotic look; she obviously had a splash of African blood running through her veins (nothing wrong with that, of course).Some criticize the movie's portrayal of Cash & his guys auditioning for Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) of Sun Records the same day Johnny worked up the courage to visit the studio in Memphis, hoping to get a recording contract. While they did audition for Phillips and scored a record contract it wasn't the same day and they didn't play ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" but a less incendiary song, ""'Hey Porter."" However, it is true that, after auditioning with mostly gospel songs, Phillips told Cash that he didn't record gospel music any longer because it wasn't selling, at least not the dispassionate tripe Johnny was trying to sell. It was once rumored that Phillips told Cash to ""go home and sin; then come back with a song I can sell"" (lol), although in a 2002 interview Johnny denied that he made any kind of statement.Another problem is the generally negative portrayal of Vivian who, by all accounts, was a good, supportive wife. The problem with their marriage wasn't Vivian, but rather Johnny's increasing addictions and infatuation with Carter.ADDITIONAL CAST: Waylon Payne appears as Jerry Lee Lewis, Tyler Hilton as Elvis and Shooter Jennings as Waylon Jennings.The film runs 136 minutes (extended cut 153 minutes) and was shot in Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas and California.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
It had an interesting story,"Unlike the filmmakers who only use their actor to repeat the excellent work done by him before and do not have a special plan to advance the level and details implemented in his role, there are directors like James Mangold who push the actor forward with a movie. Mangold 12 years before many viewers of ""Logan"" (Logan) called him one of the top five superhero movies of all time and fifteen years before ""Ford v Ferrari"" (Ford v Ferrari) he received several nominations and awards in The 2020 Oscars will arrive, with Walk the Line, it gave the audience the opportunity to face a new image of Joaquin Phoenix; The actor who won many awards this year for his portrayal of the Joker (read Arthur Flack) stepped into the shoes of American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash in Walk the Line. In a movie that was related to the introduction of aspects of this real person's life to the audience, and a large part of its minutes consisted of the conversation of two people in the same room and their singing together. The combination of the beautiful performances of Reese Witherspoon in the role of June Carter (Johnny Cash's lover) and Phoenix was also the main heart of the film. So if you enjoy watching a singer's journey to becoming a legend in the country music world, and you have these two actors on your list of favorite actors, get James Mangold's Walk the Line ASAP.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A plane walk with rolling coaster actors,"It's a long (two hours-and-something) walk the one James Mangold put us through, but it's worth to take the ride since Johnny Cash sings in your ears all night while Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon show us what acting is about. The movie has a simple story: the life of a music legend; the actors put some good magic on while Mangold walks with the camera nearby. The director never lets the story or the actors take over the movie or slip away, and the time flows. Mangold doesn't take risks on screen and delivers (that will keep him in the world of blockbusters movies), but it doesn't make him - now - a director worth following.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Reese Witherspoon is a revelation,"A lot has been written about Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Johnny Cash but it is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter who gives this movie its heart and soul. Phoenix is wonderful showing Cash as he grows on stage and finds a comfort with his voice; however it is only in his duets with Witherspoon that the sparks really fly. Witherspoon lit up the screen in Legally Blonde but after such dogs as Legally Blonde 2 and Sweet Home Alabama I was unprepared for the way she could carry the emotional weight here. While Phoenix's voice was always on the edge of musicality, Witherspoon's always hit the right notes and tone. She deserves an Oscar nomination for her portrayal! Overall, Walk the Line is well crafted with a particularly pleasing inclusions of subtle scenes that make their way back into songs or later plot lines. Phoenix captures Cash's intensity on stage and his misery when apart from Carter very well though he is somewhat less effective in capturing other aspects of Cash's motivations. The core story of Cash's relationship with Carter is extremely well done. Although the film-making avoids some of the clich√©d Hollywood touches that showed up in Ray, the story line is lacking in the complexity of Ray and thus yields a somewhat weaker film overall. Abstractly, I would say that the film could have benefited from some tighter editing to cut about 15 minutes from its running time, but I wouldn't want to cut one minute of Reese Witherspoon's screen time!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great Entertainment,Walk the Line is the story of Johnny Cash. There's a strong focus on the relationship between Cash and June Carter. I wasn't really aware about their story prior to the movie and I did wonder how Carter was wearing so well bearing in mind Cash used to listen to her music as a child. A bit of research since watching the movie reveals she was a child star! The two central performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are excellent and well worthy of their respective nominations by the academy. I expect Witherspoon may well walk away with the gong. As with most good bio pics based on musicians the real highlight of the film is the music and I've no doubt the music of Cash will see a revival as a result of the film. It's a cross between country and rock n roll and the film really captures the spirit of the 50's. Highly recommended.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

And I'd like to mention that the chemistry between the two of them is just breathtaking. About the director Jamed Mangold. He's already done some real good films and with ""work the line"" he proves one's again his talent for the storytelling.

Well delivered Bio-film.,"Walk the Line is a competent, but not transcendent film that follows the Bio-film format to the letter. The strong points of the film come from the excellent original music sung by Pheonix and Witherspoon, the on-screen chemistry and the impassioned performances by the whole cast. The weakest point of the film is the lack of detail and story content.

"It ain't no ""Ray""","I know this won't be popular, but ""Walk the Line"" has to be compared to ""Ray"". And, sorry to say, it finishes a distant second. There are so many similarities to ""Ray"", that there's not enough room here to list them all. From the accidental death of his brother, to his Southern/religious/country roots, to his drug addiction, and then to his marital betrayals, Johnny Cash's life absolutely paralleled Ray Charles'. But Ray had something Johnny didn't. Ray rose to the top of the music industry after overcoming physical disabilities and racial discrimination. What was Johnny's big problem? Many people mistakenly sympathized with Johnny for returning to prison to perform and entertain the inmates. The only problem is, Johnny wasn't returning. He was never a convict. He got away with using drugs, while Ray was arrested and embarrassed by the negative publicity. We can sympathize with Ray's problems and misbehavior a lot more than Johnny Cash's. And Jamie Foxx was much more convincing in his portrayal than Joaquin Phoenix. Reese Witherspoon did do an outstanding job as June Carter and saved the movie with her lively personality and excellent singing voice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Other than an electrifying performance by its star, what we have here is another typical show biz biopic.","WALK THE LINE is the 2005 biopic tracing the roots of country music legend Johnny Cash, as well as his relationship with second wife, June Carter. As someone who has, if nothing else, a vague recollection of Cash, I found him to be a refreshing topic for a film biography. Since his son's name is one of the names credited to the screenplay, I would think that it is probably pretty accurate as far as the facts are concerned, but that doesn't make it necessarily a great film. Joaquim Phoenix is electrifying as Johnny Cash and totally nails the darkness and intensity of the character in a performance that I now think should have won him the Oscar. Phoenix completely loses himself in this character and turns in one of the greatest screen creations of a real life person ever. Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for her work as June Carter, but I was not nearly as impressed with her work as I was with Phoenix. It's a solid performance but Oscar-worthy? I don't know. Other than an amazing performance by Phoenix, what we get here is just another show biz biography with all the same tired scenes we've seen in every show biz biography, from the ""My daddy was mean to me when I was a kid"" scene to the ""I don't really have a drug problem, I'm just misunderstood"" scene. Ginnifer Goodwin plays Johnny's first wife, who is drawn as such a total b*tch here you have to wonder why Johnny stayed with her.
