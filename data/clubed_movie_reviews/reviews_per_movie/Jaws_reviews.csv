It holds up,"I saw this movie again after a few decades. There are a lot of movies from past eras that don't hold up over time, but this one does. It's just as suspenseful as it was in 1975.

A monster of a movie,"I re-watched this film recently and was blown away by the absolute suspense it invoked in me. My daughter (whom is 17) and I were both stunned at the quality and realism of a film made in 1975!! Our TV is 55 inches which showed the movie off to it's full potential and it certainly did not disappoint.That iconic moment of the young lady going skinny dipping in the dark with her male friend is utterly haunting. You know the horror of what's going to happen, the buoy dinging in the background gives you the chills. Steven Spielberg captures pure terror in that scene.Jaws completely absorbs you, as the trio of shark hunters venture off to try to snare the great white you begin to feel part of their adventure. You fear for them, get excited with them and dread what will happen next. When that fishing line starts spinning your heart starts pumping. This is pure class.The dynamics of Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw's relationship(s) work brilliantly. The differences in their characters persona's is such that they rub each other up the wrong way, disrespect one another and wind each other up but in the end they are there for each other and develop a bond that I think surprises them all.As things begin to unravel your heart goes out to the trio and trepidation is the only way forward. They have the fight of their life on their hands, their bravery is boundless. You feel in awe of them.An absolute legend of a movie which I am grateful to have been able to watch and enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"Even with very dated technology, this is a great film to watch.","Back in 1975, ""Jaws"" made a huge splash (pardon the pun) in theaters. It set all sorts of box office records and made the covers of magazines all over the country. And, the film was seen as groundbreaking and amazing. When seen today, it's still a great film to watch even with it's very dated technology. In other words, the shark often looks very fake but the story is so good and handled so well, you really don't care. Excellent acting, a very nice script and excellent direction make this a definite must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"So Much More Than Just A ""Shark Movie""","Reputationally-speaking, ""Jaws"" will forever be known for two things: director Steven Spielberg's unique ""shark-eye view"" camera work and building of suspense, and composer John Williams' two note ""attack"" motif that became as iconic as any piece of music ever created. Perhaps those two aspects alone would have been enough to make ""Jaws"" an iconic film--who knows. But the fact is, this 1975 effort is about so much more than just suspense/horror. It is one of the most well-rounded, complete movies ever made.For a very basic overview, ""Jaws"" tells the story of the coastal town of Amity, which suddenly and inexplicably becomes the hunting grounds for a rogue Great White shark. Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close down the beaches until further notice, but is opposed every step of the way by city official Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who worries about the potential loss of tourist business. When the attacks continue, however, Brody enlists the help of shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled boatsman Quint (Robert Shaw) to help hunt down the giant predator.As stated, the general premise and music here are well-known. But what always strikes me with each ""Jaws"" re-watch is how much it is a human drama as opposed to a horror piece driven by a villain (the shark, in this case).The first half of ""Jaws"" takes place almost entirely ""on land"", if you will, and focuses more on the politics of fear and commerce than anything supernatural or scary. If there are ever any doubts as to whether that material holds up, they can easily be put to rest after viewing the film through a pandemic context. Substitute ""global contagious disease"" for ""mindless, unstoppable shark"" and it's as relevant today as ever.The second half leans more towards ""adventure sea chase"", and is buoyed by ocean scenes that, despite being filmed 45+ years ago now, do not seen old or outdated in the least. Masterful cinematography almost always holds up, and Spielberg's behind-the-camera decisions certainly do here as well. Even then though, in the midst of a brutal and thrilling chase, Spielberg stops the action for a touching scene in which the three seaman bond over song and shared experiences.In order to fully exhibit such depth of character, great acting is required--and given here in spades. ""Jaws"" features a collection of unique characters that are always a joy to revisit. Scheider as the ""why-won't- anyone-listen-to-me!"" sheriff lets viewers relate to the story in a much more personal aspect, while Dreyfuss' Hooper is insightful, hilarious, and provides some of the best dialogue of the whole show. Of course, Shaw as Quint is singularly iconic, juxtaposing jocularity and complexity perfectly within his single character.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give ""Jaws"" is that every time I see it, I can't help but be swept away in all its winning aspects. Whether it be the drama, emotion, music, thrills, adventure, visuals, acting, or just overall heart of the piece, there is not a single scene wasted or underutilized. I have absolutely no doubt that it will remain just as visceral of an experience going forward as it was for those sitting in the theaters in 1975.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
One of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies,"I will never forget the first time I saw Jaws. I was glued to the seat from start to finish. I jumped, I held my breath; this was one of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies. This was probably the first film where I completely forgot everything around me. I was there, in that boat, in that gloomy cabin, with those people - everything seemed so real (and alas, the sea never looked the same again). When I watch it these days I still marvel: the atmosphere and the performances in this film are simply magical. Spielberg without the schmalz.

One of the Greatest Films Ever Made,"Jaws (1975) **** (out of 4)Steven Spielberg's classic about a man-eating Great White shark stalking the beaches of Amity and the three men who go out to try and kill it. Seriously, is there anyone who doesn't know the plot to this masterpiece?Considering all the production trouble on this thing it would be amazing to get a half-way decent film yet for some reason, perhaps the movie Gods were shining down, we ended up with one of the greatest films ever made. This is without question one of the greatest films to deal with tension as Spielberg masterfully handles all the material. The movie is like an amazing roller coaster as we get one scare after another until the end when we just get our senses attacked from all around. Millions of people have discussed the greatness of this film so it's hard to pick one thing but I'd say the greatest achievement of the film is the simple adventure it gives us.Even though we get some very intense scenes the screenplay is smart enough to give us other things to go with. We got some nice black humor in the witty dialogue but we also get a good buddy picture with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss delivering memorable characters. The three of them together are so different yet all three are like people I'm sure each viewer has met so it's easy to connect with them and it makes the film all the more fun when we go on this adventure.The film, of course, benefits from the brilliant John Williams score, which is perhaps the most memorable in film history. Bruce, the name given to the shark, caused most of the problems during filming but you wouldn't know that by just watching the picture. The look of the shark is incredible and Spielberg certainly made the right decision of keeping it hidden and just revealing bits and pieces as the movie went along. The first glimpse in the pond is hauntingly shocking and each sighting just grows more and more tension. The director also knows how to build suspense without us seeing the shark as we're constantly viewing objects floating (the dock, the barrels) to imply that the creature is there.What's even more amazing is that this film scared people so badly that they refused to go into the water yet the most suspenseful scene is probably the now legendary speech by Shaw about his time on the USS Indianapolis. It goes without saying but the three leads are all terrific in their roles and I really can't think of too many movies that have as many memorable characters as the ones here. We also get strong supporting work from Murray Hamilton as the Mayor and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife.For me this ranks as one of the greatest adventures ever captured on film because everyone involved makes it feel so real. When the men get on the boat to go after the shark you feel as if you're really there. When the camera is underwater given a POV shot of the shark, you feel as if you're in the water. The final death scene in the movie also just happens to be one of the most terrifying ever captured on film and it might even be the most brutal. The movie is a true masterpiece of suspense and I think it would be fair that nothing has come close to this in the past 35 years. Like PSYCHO, we've had a lot of rips of imitations but nothing has come close to the same power and it's doubtful anything ever will.",,Anonymous,Adventure

You might want to remain on shore for a while after this movie...,"There is no doubt about the fact that ""Jaws"" is a classic. And it is also an influential movie that helped open up for many other movies in its wake.The story in ""Jaws"" is one that I think everyone is familiar with, even if you haven't seen the movie before. Because it is just one of those movies that everyone knows. But briefly summarized, it is the story of a massive white shark turning up in the waters of a popular beach resort and wreaks havoc on the swimmers. Sheriff Brody teams up with eccentric captain Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper to rid the waters of the deadly shark.While this movie was released back in 1975, the year I was born as well, it still holds its ground today. Sure, some of the effects are outdated by today's standards, but other effects still prove effective and great. What makes the movie still stand its ground is not the effects, of course, it is the solid storyline and the amazing performances by the cast.""Jaws"" have some really impressive and very memorable performances by Roy Scheider (playing Brody), Robert Shaw (playing Quint) and Richard Dreyfuss (playing Matt Hooper). Furthermore, there are also some good supporting appearances from Lorraine Gary (playing Ellen Brody) and Murray Hamilton (playing Mayor Larry Vaughn).It is the intense storyline of the movie that makes the movie watchable over and over again, and I don't have count of how many times I have actually watched ""Jaws"" throughout the years. And this is also what makes it a classic, because the movie is timeless.Furthermore, the movie also has an impressive soundtrack. And everyone knows the theme music to ""Jaws"", even people who might not have watched the movie.""Jaws"" is definitely a movie that has withstood the test of time, and it is a movie that future generations will enjoy as well, just as us who grew up watching this movie (and its sequels).",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Changed Cinema For the Better,"I don't think its any argument that this can go down as one of the most influential films of all time as it set Hollywood on a road filled with blockbusters. At the time it was the biggest box office hit in the world and for its budget, it was quite an achievement. It still isn't without problems. There isn't much character development and the movie relies heavily on its shark attacks to keep the movie moving forward. But there isn't much arguing the movie's overall significance in the history of cinema.The first few scenes are quite a thrill even with it being almost 40 years later. Once you see the blood cover the water it instantly sends chills down your body. It takes a while for Richard Dreyfuss to get to the screen, who is by far the best part of the movie. But I would still say that the 3 men who are chosen to kill the shark aren't that interesting. But in terms of the look of the shark, I was stunned at how real it appears to be. There are some movies made now that have worse effects than this. It also amazed me at how dumb the people in this movie can be. The people on the beach are ALL aware of the recent shark attacks but yet they still feel they need to swim in the ocean. It reminds me of the citizens of New York during the Spider-Man movies. People in the world aren't that dumb.I was also taken back by the idea to break their only communication to the world on the boat. I still don't know why they destroyed it with a random baseball bat?

"An Absolute Must See, This Is How To Make A Movie!","JawsI watched this on My Home cinema on a big screen and it really needs to be seen this way I can't say how much I enjoyed it, it really was a revelation re-visiting this classic.Just about everything was in place the acting was just incredible between Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfus, it was a masterclass in acting it really was.The score was unbelievable and the iconic programmatic theme with the piano notes and strings at the bottom just embodied an imagined creeping threat. I could hear bits of Westside Story as well as any Bernard Herrmann as an influence it was masterful!I'd forgotten how much of the movie was about politics and a small town and the threat to its livelihood from a man eating shark, the fashions were also great as was the styling.But the key fantastic thing is the way the camera moved, moving in at the right moment on a characters face moving back to show the panorama and actually making believable a large rubber shark it was absolutely amazing.Overall I'm giving this a 10 out of 10 it would be churlish of me to deduct a point for some of the scenes where the shark looked less than believable but hey ho for entertainment value alone it's a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

That's without even considering John Williams' amazing soundtrack. A nearly perfect film. It starts, happens, and ends without the viewer even being aware that it's happening.

Modern filmmakers need to take cues from Jaws,"Watching Jaws today, the film has just as much impact as it did back in 1975. Why? Because, rather than relying on special effects, the film relies on characters, dialogue and atmosphere. The shark's presence is always felt, even though it is rarely seen. However, what you remember most from this film are the characters. The interaction on the boat between the three leads is cinema perfection. The filmmakers of today have lost their way in a sea of weightless CGI and meaningless noise. A true masterpiece ""monster movie"" begins with good characters and atmosphere, the effects are merely the icing on the cake.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
One of the Greatest Thrillers Ever Made,"'Jaws' is the original summer blockbuster, setting the standard by which all others are measured. It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another 'Jaws,' simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, 'Jaws' centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody, a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack(Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an icthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure.Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis--where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds--is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film.'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character.That said, the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.",,Anonymous,Adventure

Jaws,"A man eating shark is terrorising the holiday island of Amity. Police chief Martin Brody, shark hunter Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper set sail in the hope of killing the great white monster.Jaws is responsible for many things, it's responsible for propelling director Steven Spielberg's career into the stratosphere, it was responsible for a downturn in the package holiday trade, and it was responsible for shaping the summer blockbuster release practise's. There are many other things which one doesn't need to bore you with, it's just true to say that Jaws is firmly ensconced in movie history, if one hasn't seen it then one surely knows about it, it is, even today, part of popular culture.But is it any good? Is it worthy of a long standing reputation as one of the greatest monster movies of all time? Hell yes it is, one or two easily overlooked flaws aside, it busted the box office {world wide} and tapped into a primal fear that resides in the majority of mankind, the unseen that resides in the sea.Jaws sets out its marker right from the start with a truly shocking and attention grabbing opening sequence, from then on in Spielberg {learning from Hitchcock for sure} tweaks the tension to have the audience living on their nerves, even as character building {by way of Brody's family arc} sedates the pace, we just know that it's all relative to an extension of fear and terror that is around the next corner. After the first victims remains are found Brody glances out at the ocean, Spielberg perfectly framing the shot to say so much that we are about to be witness to. Jolts and shocks pop up from time to time to help build the unease whilst Spielberg makes the audience wait before we even see what it is that so coldly and efficiently destroys man, and then the claustrophobic switch as our brave protagonists are out at sea on Quint's boat, unaware that the giant menace is now hunting them, eyes as black as death itself.So many great scenes linger for all time in the memory, the entrance of Quint is a hum dinger, a mournful widow reducing Brody to a stunned realism, the Indianappolis monologue, the bigger boat! Just some of the reasons why I personally love cinema so much. The score from John Williams is as effective as any for the genre and Robert Hoyt's sound team's work furthers the dread unfolding. The cast are superb and uniformly excellent, casting aside technical problems {and genuine resentment at times} to portray this story with verve and genuine depth of feeling. Yet Roy Scheider {Brody}, Robert Shaw {Quint} and Richard Dreyfuss {Hooper} were from from original choices, Charlton Heston was wanted for the role of Brody, Sterling Hayden and Lee Marvin were both mooted for Quint, and John Voight was Spielberg's preferred choice for Hooper, whilst Jaws author {and co screen writer here} Peter Benchley was heading for the top by asking for Newman, Redford and McQueen!! Imagine that!Still it all turned out well in the end because Jaws stands the test of time as one of the best films of its type to have ever been made. No amount of complaining about continuity and a rough looking mechanical shark will ever dim its appeal, even as I revisited it recently for the hundredth time I still got tingles all over my body, file it along side King Kong in the pantheon of Monster Masterpieces, 10/10 always, now go enjoy your dip in the ocean.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

The first major summer blockbuster film,"Jaws is very much a spiritual child of Moby Dick, with a Great White Shark inserted in place of a giant white whale.The hunting of the shark means something different for each of the three main male leads. For Brody, killing the shark would mean ensuring the safety of his children (the relationship between parents and their children being a strong running theme in nearly all of Spielberg's films). For Hooper, the shark is just another shark. It's his job to study them and provide his expertise. That's it. Then there's Quint, a Captain Ahab like figure whose obsession places him in a fit of blind fury. To him, all sharks are the same and killing this one would operate as ultimate revenge.And like Moby Dick, Jaws is a perfectly told straightforward story depicting believable human beings and observing human behavior. Part of the joy of Jaws is watching these characters interact with each other in ways that make them seem truly alive and real, which only serves to make the threat of the shark even more threatening. We also have the land scenes of the first half that expose the stakes at the same time as it depicts the conflict between Brody and the mayor who wants to keep the beach open.And of course, the film is marvelously constructed by Spielberg. Much is made of the way he directs the scenes of suspense, but there's also very intelligent decisions being made in non-action scenes. Many shots burned into my eyes are something as simple as a quiet moment between a father and his son who is innocently ignorant of the danger at hand.",8.0,Anonymous,Adventure

"If this movie scares you to the point where you can't go back into the water, then Spielberg has done job well done","Jaws is a movie the I grew up with, it's like the first real horror film I ever watched. What a great one to start with, right? This movie not only scarred me out of the water, I was afraid to go to the bathroom! I thought Jaws was going to pop up out of the toilet and bite my butt! :D I know it was silly, but that was how much Jaws effected me. I know also that it has not lost it's effect to this day. I'm questioning, because it seems like all the terrific horror films came out of the 70's.Jaws is based on the best seller book by Peter Benchley. Steven Spielberg, before he was STEVEN Spielberg turned this horrifying book and made it into a reason to hate sharks. He brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. To this day, I still need a friend to hold onto, it's that score! Duh na... duh na.... dun dun dun dun.... Oh, my gosh, that music just scares the heck out of me! On such a low budget, Jaws not only turned into one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it turned into one of the greatest movies, period.Jaws starts off with one of the most terrifying scenes in horror movie cinema, a young pretty girl goes into the water and is brutally attacked and killed by an unknown creature in the water. The next day Chief Brody investigates suspecting a shark attack, and urges the mayor, Larry Vaughn, to shut down the beach, but afraid of a panic and less tourists, Larry ignores the chief's suggestions and keeps the beach open leading to another attack on a young boy. Brody calls in Matt Hooper, a marine scientist to see if they can find the shark. But when another attack ensues and almost kills Brody's young son, Michael, he, Matt, and a cocky man, Quint go out to find Jaws themselves.This turns into several of the greatest cinematic scenes of all time, like the ""Indianapolis"" speech brilliantly given by Quint, how he describes seeing his first shark was just so intense and you couldn't turn away from the screen. Then, one thing that is interesting about this movie, you do not see the shark until Brody is just chucking blood to attract the shark over his shoulder and Jaws appears roaring out of the water! ""We're gonna need a bigger boat!"" he replies to Quint. And then the scene where Jaws jumps onto the boat and Quint is trapped sliding into Jaw's, well, jaws! That's the scene that nightmares are made out of! Jaws is one of my favorite films of all time. It's one of those films that should never be missed, because it is so important. To many, including myself, the shark looks fake, but it's your imagination that gets with you. Spielberg embraced that and you could tell there was just something special about him. Jaws will scare you out of the water just like The Exorcist scared you to the church!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"""You yell barracuda, everybody says, 'Hunh, what?' You yell shark, and we got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July.""","This is the movie that started it all. I'm not talking about the Hollywood blockbuster, or the insane madness that sent thousands of misunderstood Great Whites to their deaths, I'm talking about the beginning of my interest in movies. This is the movie that did it. I couldn't tell you how old I was when I first saw it, but I do remember this is the movie I made my parents rent time and time again when we went to the video store. This is the movie that drove my parents and some of my friends nuts while I watched it day after day after day when my mom gave it to me for Christmas. This is the movie that made me want to turn a real interest in the movies from just a hobby and into a career. For that, I owe Spielberg, Benchley, Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, Williams, Fields and everyone else a sincere and heart-felt thank you. I own this movie on every format in which it is available. I love it that much. I've probably seen it between 200 and 300 times. I guess you can say it is an obsession. A sick obsession. The plot, the pacing, the editing, the score, the acting, and, oh yes, the shark. Who cares that is fake? By the time we finally get to see it, do we care? Truly, a more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close, but none quite reaches the primal level the JAWS does. No other film so effectively taps into our fear of the unknown, and then gives it a riveting score to boot. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling off our seats. And no other movie leaves us feeling so spent and wasted after a viewing. And the reason for all the fear, suspense and emotional withdrawal is not top-notch special effects. It was the mid-70's. You can barely apply top -notch to anything of that era. The reason the movie does all that to us is that it is a great story. It is filled with real people, who have real jobs, and who have real fears. And who must now confront a real shark. Can you think of anything more terrifying that getting on a rickety, leaky boat to kill a 25-foot shark when you already have a paralyzing fear of the water? I can't. And Martin Brody sure can't. And so, no matter what ranking JAWS may get on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, or TV Guides list of the top 50 movies, or any list for that matter, JAWS will always come in number one on mine. Steven, Peter, Roy, Robert, Richard, John, and Verna -- thank you. Not for just giving me a sense of direction in my life, not for just making me want to be a screenwriter, but also for making a movie that still thrills me as much now when I watch it as when it did when I saw it for the very first time.",,Anonymous,Adventure
When the B movie became the A movie,"In the history of the cinema, this film (along with Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, etc.) will be remembered as the beginning of a new era.  One hallmark of this new era, which is still with us, is that the genres that used to be confined to B movies--such as science fiction and horror--are now the subjects of major, respectable motion pictures.  To me, it is a little sad that the ""big"" movies no longer aspire to serious themes, but instead confine themselves to the stuff of comic books.  After 1975, mainstream movies were no longer for adults, but are instead geared to teenagers, or perhaps to the child within us. People go to the movies to see fancy special effects and get cheap thrills, not necessarily to explore interesting characters and stories.That being said, the movie that started it all is still enjoyable on its own terms, particularly the second half, when it becomes a Moby Dick story of three men on a boat chasing and being chased by a big fish.  The movie does a good job of showing the camaraderie that develops among the three.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure

"How good acting, editing, directing and music can overcome a silly script","It's a testament to Spielberg's talent that he could make a movie like Jaws into a revered classic. The plot is incredible silly. You have a ocean full of perfectly edible creatures. Yet the SUPER shark only munches on people from one particular beach in New England. Yeah,un-huh, sure.But guess what, it works. Spielberg wisely builds up the suspense. We know the shark is out there and hungry. Yet we have to use our imagination on just how scary the shark is. So the tension and suspence builds and builds as the movie progresses. The New England setting works effectively. The extras all look and act like normal people. Giving the movie a sense of believability that say a Flordia beach setting would lack. The acting is wonderful. Shaw,Scneider and Dreyfuss throw themselves completely into their roles. Even if the characters are rather one dimensional. You can almost feel their fear at the climax. John Williams music is tight, but effective. Usually when Williams scores a movie he practically has music for every scene. (Which most of the time is a good thing) But keeping it to a minimum it's builds the suspence. Recommend if nothing else so many cliches stem from this movie's success. That and Kevin Smith references it in almost all his films.",6.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Review - Jaws,"This movie had one of the best marketing campaigns in cinema history. It is astounding to see the number of people who bite the bait of the tagline: ""You'll never go in the water again!"" However, Jaws shares more resemblance with The Old Man and the Sea than with Ridley Scott's Alien. Don't expect an alien-esque horror film. Jaws demands more patience to be enjoyable because, first and foremost, it is a fishing film.That brings me to another misconception about the film, the beginning is slow, really slow, and pointless. Fortunately, Spielberg's skillful directing was there to insufflate some energy into that otherwise bothersome first act.If you haven't already seen Jaws, I do say go for it. It remains a classic of Hollywood cinema, but keep in mind that what you are about to see is not an action film nor a horror film.",5.0,Anonymous,Adventure
The true horror is that this film is considered an 8/10,"Jaws, one of the greatest films of all time is an 8/10 on this app... disgusting. This is far more than a shark film, this movie revolutionised cinema in so many ways. Jaws masterfully creates suspense with the iconic soundtrack and the shark barely visible to us by only showing it's fun as it swims after it's next victim. This film is the best directorial debut in cinematic history and one of, if not Spielbergs greatest films. Jaws set a bar that could only be reached by few in cinema, with it being a 10/10 in nearly every category, the horror of a creature that exists in our real world that went out of its way to eat human meat over any other food source frightened the world in 1975, people even avoiding the water after viewing the film shows how great it truly is definitely a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

The Ultimate Popcorn Movie,"""Jaws"" is a thrill-ride of suspense that continues to deliver the goods to the audience 25 years later.  The plot is somewhat thin: a large shark is terrorizing the tourists at the local beach.  However, with that said Steven Spielberg's direction is amazing.  The young director (only 28 at the time) showed unlimited potential that would only increase with age.  A great accomplishment that could have been a multi-million dollar bust.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Adventure
An Eye For Profit,"Spielberg didn't get to be so successful by being bad...nobody does. But he did achieve success by deriving all of his imagery from even lesser sources and convincing audiences they were seeing something new. The lower the overhead cost, the greater the net profit, and this is where he first raked it in.There's nothing complex here. He simply uses the eye of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", and gives Amity and its birdbrain inhabitants the mechanics and IQ of so many 50s monster flicks.This is relatively good compared to the rest of his catalog, because the narrative is held together by someone else - here, the writer - who simply usurps the ""Moby Dick"" story...right down to the ""Farewell and adieu...""...Shaw's Quint as Ahab.The absurdity works because of the Williams score which is straight out of the ""Psycho"" playbook; also the rubber shark (""Bruce"") was uncooperative half of the time; it surely saved this by forcing Spielberg to show less of the creature. He had to tighten the tension in other ways.Although this is cheap and simple, that's what makes it ideal for commercial consumption. Just don't call it art - that began and pretty much ended with ""Duel"".",6.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Horror movie classic,"Obvious one, but I like Jaws for that idea of man being subjected to the natural world, done so intensely. Humans are so arrogant, then they go up against nature and they get what comes up. I was still a little kid in grade school when I first saw Jaws. It frightened so many people off from swimming, no one I knew would go out to the deep water anymore after seeing it. It left such a psychic residue. It scares you by making you hyper-sensitive to a situation you took for granted before. Some people I know would still freak out if I even mention this subject as we enter the water.

"Pretty good, but not his best","The acting were superb. You can clearly see the terror on the 3 main actors' acting throughout the film, especially the ending. Even though the shark looked a little fake, it WAS released in 1975 so that was already awesome.I went into this movie expecting something thrilling, something that will leave me scared to go into water. I was left with a sense of disappointment. There wasn't enough suspense, and in some scenes, the music killed the vibe. The ending was... not what I expected for a horror film and it left me with an unpleasant feeling. The death scenes were not clearly shown/depicted. And I get that this film wasn't trying to be gory, but not being able to see the deaths and the bodies kinda made me feel frustrated.I know that the making of this film required more money and time than expected and that it took a heavy toll on everybody, especially Steven. But that's no excuse for the poor execution of the ending. There were some unnecessary scenes that could be cut to save budget and they could have used that time to increase the suspense and thriller feel.But overall it's an awesome classic movie that I think everyone should watch at least once in their life.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Great characterization but predictable story.,"If ""Jaws"" succeeds at anything, it's in making the viewer really start to question what's in the water with them. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that wouldn't give this movie some thought before ever heading into the ocean again. This story is essentially a man versus nature tale, and serves as a reminder that although we are the most intelligent species on the planet, there are forces of nature bigger than we are.""Jaws"" succeeds in establishing a dynamic group of characters whose interactions with one another are interesting to watch. The war veteran turned fisherman gets his rocks off by teasing the intellectual scientist, the chief just tries to keep peace to save his community...the dynamics of the relationships were interesting enough. Where I feel ""Jaws"" fails is in the story department, because although we have some interesting multi-faceted characters, the plot is still that of a B-movie. The story of a shark terrorizing a coastal community could easily have been a Roger Corman production. Spielberg manages to elevate the material to A-level status with his use of great actors and a script that fleshes the characters out more than any B-movie would attempt, and his direction produces some genuine moments of suspense, but it's predictable fare. There are few surprises for the viewer, and anyone that believes the movie will end with the shark still alive hasn't seen enough Hollywood films.I commend Spielberg for making entire generations afraid to go into the water. But nevertheless let's not forget this is a popcorn film, elevated slightly by a good set of characters.",5.0,Anonymous,Adventure

I say no. This movie has it all, jumps, tears, laughter, and (most importantly) tension. Spielberg proved out of the gate that he knows where all of your strings are and that he can pluck any single one at will. What makes this film so incredible isn't the shark at all. It's the people. They are real three dimensional characters who share our fears and feelings. A simple example being when one mother walks up, slaps the police chief and sobs, ""My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that.""Recommendation: I would also recommend Spielberg's made for T.V. movie Duel.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Classic Film.,"Review:
'Jaws' is a thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is based on the novel of the same name by Peter Benchley.
Even for the time it came out this movie is still entertaining as hell. It's not the most realistic take on a shark, but it tells a revenge story that keeps you engaged.
In the film, a giant great white shark attacks beachgoer at a New England summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw).
You can't say anything bad about the acting in this movie, especially from the main cast. I was surprised by that given the age of the film. There are only a select few films that I consider both classics and to have good acting.
Spielberg brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. Between the acting, directing and the amazing score, this movie is one to be talked about for years to come still.
Overall, this is yet another master craft from one of the greatest filmmakers out there. Nobody can walk away from watching this movie thinking it could have been better.

We're gonna need a bigger boat...and probably a scarier shark,"Jaws is a thriller about a shark that has a taste for human blood, naturally this is going to be a problem as the summer season is actively approaching.The actors don't really stand out but they play their roles well. The music is very well written and although most of the songs are forgettable, the main theme is pretty iconic. The dialogue is very effective at conveying the characters emotions in the moment feel very natural. The story is fairly basic and predictable but it has some interesting elements that keep it different. The movie does an excellent job building suspense, even though the shark itself isn't ever really scary.The shark itself looks and behaves in ways that feel fake, especially in a scene near the end of the movie. It might be scary to some but for me it was rather laughable, luckily the suspense building and plot do enough to make up for that. A few characters never get enough development to be likable, in general characters are not particularly interesting.It's fair to say at this point that Jaws is a classic and if you haven't seen it before you should!

Not your average fish story...,"Widely regarded as the film that began the ""summer movie blockbuster era"", JAWS (1975) was also rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies. It was also the recipient of an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture and a winner of Oscars for film editing (Verna Fields) and music score (John Williams).  One of the reasons the film received no acting nods is that everyone involved is so good, how could one single out just one or two? (I personally feel Robert Shaw should have gotten a Best Actor nomination, however). Roy Scheider is wonderful as New York cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a small coastal island town, only to have his bad case of ""aquaphobia"" put to the ultimate test. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as a shark expert and provides some truly funny comic bits along the way. Lorraine Gary (who director Steven Spielberg says was the first person to be cast for the film) does an excellent job of being the concerned wife and mother. Finally, there's Murray Hamilton, who gives one of the best performances of his career as Mayor Vaughn, who seems to be more concerned about the economy of the town than the safety of the residents. In a way, Vaughn is really the film's villain. Solid cast indeed. The screenplay (by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb) is tight and well-written, as is Spielberg's direction. Whether it was the mechanical shark's failure to operate correctly or Spielberg's decision to simply see less of the shark until the end of the film, the ""less is more"" idea works perfectly, particularly in the opening scene, which is chilling to this day.One thing I do want to add: if you choose to watch this film at home, do yourself a favor and rent or buy the WIDESCREEN version. The full-screen pan and scan version is a travesty that ruins the great camerawork that Spielberg and cameraman Bill Butler made. I always recommend the widescreen version but it is especially important for JAWS.No offense to fans of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but this is the film that should have taken home the Oscar gold.

Good,"JAWS was rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies and the recipient of an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Roy Scheider is wonderful as cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a coastal island town. The screenplay is tight and well-written. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect.

It's A Kid's Movie,"The film has its moments of tension, like when Brody (Roy Scheider) feeds fish into the ocean and, as he is chatting, quite unexpectedly the head of a giant shark pops up out of the water next to him. ""You're going to need a bigger boat"", Brody then ominously warns Quint (Robert Shaw), skipper of the rickety old fishing boat they're in. This sequence shows up in the second half, where most of the film's tension is. And the cinematography in this second half is quite good.But overall ""Jaws"" is a silly, made-for-kids adventure that is not remotely plausible. The shark keeps coming back to the crew's boat, as if the shark is out for revenge. Referring to the shark, Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), the third of three crew members, says: ""he's chasing us; I don't believe it."" No, I don't believe it either. Natural predators are not capable of revenge.Of course, to advance the plot and keep the audience engaged, the unlikable and stupid three-man crew does all the wrong things. On-board chaos results. But the film's shallow (pardon the pun) premise and plot sells the popcorn, no ""deep"" themes needed.The story setup is way too long. Lots of talky dialogue, crowds of beached whales (or rather sunbathers), a parade, and a greedy mayor who is more of a villain than the shark render a boring first half. Director Spielberg could have used the shark to chop off most of the script's first half.""Jaws"" is a big budget Hollywood production with some tension out on the open waters.

With special effects now the audience tend to see everything in glorious colour - not much is left to the imagination.  With Jaws we only see the fin, movements under water or the impact of the attack - the shark remains hidden until the end.  This is the best option as it is very rubbery looking, but it also heightens the tension as the unknown moves under water to attack us.Roy Scheider is excellent as Chief Brody with great support from Dreyfuss and Shaw.  The chemistry between the Dreyfuss and Scheider is perfect and Shaw is as tetchy as he needs to be.  The dialogue is spot on in many scenes and has become part of the common knowledge of the world - being spoofed in films included Lethal Weapon 3, Chasing Amy to name two.Later remade as Jurassic Park (!) this is a classic piece of tension.

The movie that has been terrifying ocean goers for years.,"Universal Pictures and Director Steven Spielberg brings the world ""Jaws"" the movie that has been terrifying ocean goers since it creation in 1975.

Chief Brody tries desperately to convince the towns people to listen to him because with the beaches open there is a virtual buffet served up for this 25- foot beast. To help corral the killer Chief Brody enlists roughneck shark hunt Quint (Robert Shaw), who hates sharks more than anyone. These three heroes go where no one else wants to go, the water, to kill this behemoth knowing they no match for the creature.The truly amazing part of this movie is the score it is simple, but terrifying.

A potboiler of the 'slow-death' variety,"A potboiler with grisly action scenes that border on the ridiculous, 'Jaws' is another of the 'slow-death' entertainers of the 70's era.

Spielberg has made much better films later on. Good cinema should endure. This didn't.Watch it only if you want some comedy of the ridiculous kind.",5.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Perfect film,"I saw Jaws in 1975 when it first came out. I was 8. I saw it a total of 4 times that summer and was literally afraid to use the sink and toilet for weeks.Since then, I have watched it over 50 times and never get tired of it. It is a movie I waatch at least once a year, usually in the summer. The only downside is I refuse to go into any natural body of water ever.John Williams score is as strong as a character.The 3 lead human characters are flawless. Everything about this movie is sheer perfection. It keeps you on the edge if you seat from start to finish.I cannot recommend this movie enough.

What to say?,"What can be said about this movie that has not been said a thousand times already. This is the movie that started the shark attack genre of films and 44 years later is still the best of them all. It is by pure happenstance that the wonderful suspense that build through the film by not seeing the shark is actually a direct fault of problems with the mechanical beast they made, affectionately called Bruce (This being an Easter egg for the name of the great white in Finding Nemo). And suspense does build, not because you are not aware that it is the shark killing people, but because unlike many of the films that came along in this genre, it is not in you face. It is a subtle threat and you can sympathize with the people that are being hunted. The cinematography here is phenomenal, as is the acting. This is one of Richard Dreyfus's best roles. This is a long, slow story that back in the 70's was scary as hell, but to a more desensitized group of movie watchers will still be good, but without a lot of the scare factor. This is one of my must see before you die movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure
An engrossing cinematic experience,"Jaws has stood the test of time. Another brilliant soundtrack by the legendary John Williams. And while Speilburg wishes he never made this film because of it's effects on shark killing (not to mention people's fear of the water) his movie changed the course of history. The principal photography rewrite coupled with Bill Butlers cinematography create a palpable window into vacationing in cape Cod where it's been discovered, 50 years later, that there are indeed great white sharks are hunting in the Atlantic Ocean just off of cape cod shores in MA.. A prophetic premise coupled with the vivid chrome color palette - and I still hear the echoes of Spanish lady while sitting in traffic as I head towards my own great America summer vacation.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Suspenseful and Iconic,"Jaws, now an iconic American film, was a film built around the premise of suspense. Why was the film so successful? What separated this film from other scary movies from the 70's & why are we still talking about it in 2016? To begin with, the soundtrack of the film utilizes an escalating trombone to instill tense, dramatic, and suspenseful moments in the film and counter it with silence, another tool of suspense, to build to those moments through emotion before the action starts. Throughout the film they utilize the technique of matching eye lines across cuts to form continuity and the illusion that these two separate images are looking into each other's eyes. Most notably this is seen in the opening scene with the kids on the beach. The guy is in one cut looking to the right, in the next cut the girl is looking to the left of the screen. This implies eye contact between these two characters, a method used commonly in film making nowadays. Lighting was also used effectively for continuity purposes in Jaws, using the angle of light to indicate that people are in different sides of the room in different shots, primarily in the cabin of the ship at night when the men are out hunting the shark. In fact, certain shots of individuals faces make this movie stand out because of the effect they have. In one of the first few scenes with the character of Brody the camera moves with Brody as he walks through crowds of people along the dock. We're following him because he is the main character, & the use of the camera like this shows the audience this in a subtle way. Close ups of people's faces can also do a number of things as are shown in this film. They can make you wonder what the character is thinking and bring you inside their head, or they can bring you, the viewer into the scene, creating a feeling of intensity or shock. Intensity is created when close shots are taken in the water during the shark attacks bringing you into the moment. Shock is found in the close up of the woman's face staring straight at the camera when she sees a fin in the water. Because of the close up, as a viewer, you can relate to her emotions and feel the shock for yourself. In one of the many beach scenes close ups and wide range shots are used to show our main character Brody viewing the water beyond the people who are close in the shot. A quick zoom occurs on Brody's face when he sees the shark, giving us a similar sense of realization as we watch. Techniques like this bring us viewers into the story and make it relevant to our own lives because we can relate to the emotions we are feeling on screen.Close ups aren't the only thing that make Jaws an effective and timeless film. As I had previously mentioned, lighting plays a role as well. Silhouettes and shadows lend an eerie and otherworldly, even dangerous, quality to the scenes. You're never shown everything. Shots were taken from beneath the surface of the water up at swimmers implying the perspective of a sea creature. These shots add to the suspenseful element because paired with the soundtrack of the film you start suspecting that something will come from that depth you are looking at the swimmer from. The same techniques are used in slasher movies when the camera approaches the unsuspecting victim from behind. You don't see the attacker but you know they are there. When the lights flicker and go out in the cabin of the boat near the end of the film the scene then cuts to low lit silhouettes bringing the story from the somewhat lighthearted sense of camaraderie with the men singing together to the dark realization that a shark is hunting them down (and vice versa).The shark itself is mostly portrayed through things being pulled through the water. The ominous presence of the shark can be attributed to the fact that the shark itself is not seen (at least not fully) for a large portion of the film. Its movement is implied through the dragging of these objects. The viewer doesn't need to see the shark to know it is there. When the line on the fishing boat starts being pulled, little by little, you know the shark is responsible and that something in the scene is about to happen. There is so much to discuss about Jaws and why it stands out, the scene of the nails on the chalkboard disturbing chaos and making even the audience uncomfortable, the boat setting out through the image of shark jaws to remind you what they are setting out to, or even how Hooper and Brody's reaching shore in the closing scene imply a happy ending, because honestly Jaws is filled with so many scenes and well used techniques to warrant its recognition. It is suspenseful and daring, as well as comical and overall entertaining. The film brings you in as a viewer to feel a part of the story, as any great film should be able to do.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"""This was not a boat accident!""","*The* original, classic man vs. nature thriller that ushered in the era of the ""summer blockbuster"", ""Jaws"" remains vivid, believable, and highly effective, more than 40 years after it was first released. Everything about it is memorable, from its set pieces to its shocks to its cast to its music to a young Steven Spielbergs' masterful direction, and these elements can thrill even the viewer who's seen them before. Any summer season simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of it. The story is straightforward and compelling; the screenplay (final credit is given to author Peter Benchley and screenwriter / actor Carl Gottlieb, who plays newspaperman Meadows) trims the melodramatic fat from the Benchley novel and goes right for the thrills, which come frequently.The story deals with a resort island community, named Amity, that finds its livelihood - and its citizens & visitors - threatened by a rogue great white shark, which just refuses to go away and insists on staying where the eating is good. Eventually, an expedition is launched to find and destroy the beast.Roy Scheider is perfect as the Everyman hero, police chief Martin Brody, who tries to do the right thing and protect the people even when local authorities, mainly represented by stupidly stubborn mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), stress to him the importance of a financially successful summer season. Richard Dreyfuss is fun as the rich kid shark expert who tries to educate Vaughn and others on the facts of the great white. And Robert Shaw, in a scenery chewing performance, is brilliant as salty fisherman Quint, who has a generous array of the most quotable lines, including a speech regarding the men of the USS Indianapolis. Fine support is provided by Hamilton, Lorraine Gary as the loving and supportive wife, and Jeffrey Kramer as the deputy.On location shooting in Martha's Vineyard supplies plenty of wonderful flavour, and who can ever forget *that* music by John Williams, the composer / conductor who's given us some of the best, most instantly recognizable movie themes of all time?The stories of the making of the movie are now the stuff of legend, with the inability to get mechanical shark ""Bruce"" to function properly the ultimate happy accident, forcing the filmmakers to use subjective camera work and a very simple cue from Williams to indicate the sharks' presence. Among the iconic sequences are those of the first victim (Susan Backlinie) meeting her doom, the misguided attempt by two fishermen to catch the shark, Brody and Hoopers' night time search for the fish and an unpleasant surprise that drops into frame, the entire second half which is seagoing adventure at its finest, and the aforementioned USS Indianapolis speech.An enduring part of the popular culture if ever there was one, ""Jaws"" is one of those movie milestones that any fan of the cinema ought to see at least once. It was extremely influential in its time, spawning a bunch of similar ""nature strikes back"" thrillers, and to this day it would be hard to swim in the ocean or just *think* of the ocean and not have ""Jaws"" on the brain.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Roll Up - Roll Up - Meet the guy who didn't like it much!,"A killer shark throws a seaside town in to chaos.In my movie writing I tend to be benign about movie that seek only to entertain the popcorn munchers, because they keep the industry going. However there are good popcorn movies and bad popcorn movies.(Indeed there are popcorn movies that fall in to the middle.)I was in the playground when this movie came out and the school morons thought this was fantastic - ""did you see that naked woman being bitten in half - wasn't that great. All that blood in the water - fantastic!"" They said, wide-eyed with wonder.(In most movies rated PG women are not bitten in half, so congratulations to Steven S for getting a horror movie stunt shown to kids. And he repeated the trick in Jurassic Park!)I am sorry that special effects were anything other than special in the 1970's. Yes the shark looks as dead as a dodo, but sharks do look a bit like that anyway. I have been to one of the few places where you can view sharks close to in safety and they do look a bit dead-in-the-eye. They like to come very close just to see you!At the risk of starting a ""I'm right - you're wrong"" debate, let us look at what this is: A cheap thrill ride. Psycho and The Shinning were also cheap thrill rides, so let us not knock it for that, but it is worthless as any kind of document about sharks. A few rouge and hungry sharks kill humans, but they really don't like us much. Of all the food in the sea we are among their least favourite!(Does Steven S ever think how much misinformation he has given the world with this film?)The opening shots are, as our school moron said before, skillful and shocking. John Williams is a genius and produces more fright with a chamber orchestra than Spielberg does with a film camera! A master craftsman at work.Sadly the script is flabby and indeed it is just an exercise in filling time before the next cheap thrill or even cheap thrill that never happens. When this film moves it moves well - but Schneider's paranoia is one note and pointless. We know he is right and the town-folk masses are wrong. A better script would have made him doubt himself.We have read about how difficult life filming ""on the boat"" was. The steady cam - not available at the time - was designed to overcome these problems. It looks like they quit early, they could (and should) have extended the climax having kept us waiting for it for so long. Films like The Perfect Storm show that you can keep a scene going longer than they realized in the 1970's.What I learned from Jaws is that films can get away with the murder if they open and finish well. What people who own the video or DVD do in the scenes that involve Schneider's troubled domestic life I don't know - probably hit fast forward I guess.Most blockbusters are actually poor movies: Spiderman, Superman and Batman got a lot of hype and word-of-mouth - but future generations will see them as the flimsy flashy trash that they really are. What is the legacy of Jaws - spreading a load of c**p about the nature of sharks and making teenyboppers - who have even seen a real horror movie - scream?Yes - there are plus points. Lots of pros at work both behind and in front of the camera and a great score - but all these people working their hardest cannot disguise that all they are working with a third rate pulp novel from a third rate novelist.",6.0,Anonymous,Adventure

I was shocked - how could anyone hate sharks? I was sure everyone would realize how false the very idea of ""Jaws"" was, and understand that the movie is nothing but a 100% untrue, unrealistic fairy tale with horror elements - a modern Brothers Grimm equivalent! But obviously, many people believed it and as a result, supported the criminal idea of killing sharks. What a sick thing to do, I thought! Couldn't they separate the truth from the movie? Didn't they know how fabulous and actually not at all aggressive toward humans sharks had always been? Apparently, they didn't... and many grew to hate sharks *because* of ""Jaws""!To sum it up - I would give the movie 9 stars for its value entertainment and minus 100 stars for what it did to sharks.

The true definition of a classic movie,"Jaws is a movie you can see one hundred times and it never gets old or fails to entertain in the way it had its first time. In fact, you love it more and more with each view. There is movie magic in this film that is almost divine. It almost feels like an artist throwing everything up against the wall and miraculously the material forms itself into some kind of vintage masterpiece. Where the movie really sets itself apart from the rest is in the final third, where it breaks all horror conventions by somehow formulating an iconic interaction of the three contrasting characters, all likable: Hooper, Quint, and Brody. The scenes the three of these have together are some kind of an ideal in filmmaking- they're raw, improvised, and each actor completely takes control of their characters in a way that makes the contrast feel even more real. It makes for great scenes, effective drama, and every moviegoer's favorite- memorable, quotable lines and dialogue. Shaw not receiving at least a nomination might be one of the top three biggest snubs in Academy Award history. His two iconic monologues, especially the Indianapolis, are among the most memorable in movie history. In fact, he not only should have been nominated, but he probably should have won. A classic movie, more rare than ever before in recent decades, is one you can watch over and over and never get bored or tired of it. It entertains constantly and finds a special place in your heart. It contains some sort of magic, perhaps with Jaws it is originality or just that raw, risk-taking filmmaking that just sticks, and you just can't seem to change the channel whenever it's on. It withstands the test of time and dozens of views. That is a rarity.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
An instant classic!,"When I first saw the film, ""Jaws"" I was immediately frightened by the unseen terror that pulls the human psychosis to the depths of the ocean...literally! Steven Spielberg had made himself the most successful director of all time when he went all out with this one! Running to the back of the house and turning all the lights on were just a few things I resorted to after watching the opening for the first time!!! I Never watched anymore of it until 1-3 years later. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, a skinny dippers suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time...and it still is now! Once I finally got the courage to view the film, I was still in for a lot of surprises. The cinematography is superb in its ruthless attempt to bring the audience to the depths of a powerful ocean, and to the eyes of the dark, wretched creature the inhabits it. The story of the killer shark attacking the unfortunate island in the world is more than scary. It could have been any place in the world, and it had to be Amitty Island. The shark could have easily lost it's way in the swaying currents of the ocean, but as the opposite inhabitants of the beach get angry, this big mother is here to stay! The technique is wild, absolutely wild, and John Williams score earned more than an Oscar for it! Creepy piano notes enter this films titles, and the blue depths of the uncharted territory beneath the sea let us all know that no sense, however small, was to be spared. The first victim, alone will haunt those who view it for the rest of their days, and the rest of the story is more like a battle. This strange battle is often more focused on understanding the other side. What Brody, Quint, and Hooper must do is plunge into the depths themselves, and seek out the unruly monster of the sea. The common theme in this terrific classic is survival, and why not? Survival is a natural instinct to all animal alike. The shark must survive, as it makes so clear by snagging unsuspecting swimmers, but also the people, they to have to survive, but the island is not big enough for both man and fish together. Always a joy to experience over and over again, this film is the ultimate scare show to end them all!

We Need a Bigger Boat,"Producer Richard Zanuck at Universal bought the movie rights to Peter Benchley's novel ""Jaws"" before the book had even been published. Then he selected 27-year-old Steven Spielberg to direct, although the guy had only made a single feature film before (The Sugarland Express). The studio counted on a fairly simple shoot and aimed to have the movie ready for a Christmas premiere 1974.In the movie, a New England coastal resort is terrorized by a giant white shark. Three men head out in a small fishing boat to kill it.Unfortunately, problems arose immediately. Spielberg wanted to avoid shooting at the studio lot, and instead took the entire film crew to Martha's Vineyard on the east coast. Where there were difficulties with the unruly ocean, annoying crowds of curious tourists and the constant need to revise Peter Benchley's manuscript. But the biggest concern was caused by Bruce, the mechanical shark.Bruce (so named after Steven Spielberg's lawyer) was built in three different versions, each with its own, specialized function. The first one sank, while the second exploded. It was only with the third, automated shark that the director was able to finish his film. But by now the shoot was so far over the schedule, that the crew believed they had a real disaster on their hands.""Jaws"" was supposed to be opening for Christmas 1974, but because of all the delays it was pushed back to the summer of the following year. Back then, that was traditionally the time when the worst movies were dumped into theaters as people typically enjoyed the outdoors instead. But Universal aggressively marketed the film as an ""event"", especially in expensive, primetime spots on TV. And it worked. ""Jaws"" became the first movie to return over $100 million to its studio.

Biting into History,"Jaws is an undeniable cinematic milestone that redefined the thriller genre and launched the summer blockbuster era. Directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 1975, this suspenseful tale of man versus nature is as much about the primal fear of the unknown as it is about the dangers lurking beneath the surface.The story follows Police Chief Brody, played with everyman relatability by Roy Scheider, as he battles bureaucratic resistance and his own fears to protect the residents of a small seaside town from a deadly great white shark. Joined by marine biologist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and the enigmatic shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody embarks on a harrowing quest to confront the predator. The dynamic between these three leads is compelling, with Shaw delivering an unforgettable performance, particularly during Quint's haunting recount of the USS Indianapolis tragedy.Spielberg's direction is masterful in crafting suspense, particularly through his use of suggestion and timing. The decision to conceal the shark for much of the film, driven partly by technical issues, becomes a genius narrative device, forcing audiences to confront their imagination's darkest corners. John Williams' iconic score, with its ominous two-note motif, amplifies the tension, becoming as much a character in the story as the shark itself.The film's pacing, however, is uneven. While the opening and final acts deliver gripping tension and excitement, the middle section lags, with stretches of dialogue and character interaction that don't always sustain the momentum. Additionally, the character development, though serviceable, doesn't delve deeply enough to fully engage viewers with the trio's personal stakes.Despite these shortcomings, Jaws remains a monumental achievement. It set new standards for suspense and special effects while demonstrating Spielberg's burgeoning talent as a storyteller. Its cultural impact is undeniable, influencing generations of filmmakers and cementing its place in the pantheon of iconic cinema.In conclusion, while Jaws may feel dated or uneven in parts, its historical significance and moments of sheer brilliance make it a must-watch for fans of film history and thriller enthusiasts alike.

I honestly thought it was rather boring. For more context, I only recently saw it for the first time, so I've had years of other terrifying movies to skew my opinion but it just wasn't all that scary to me.I don't get why people find this movie so terrifying. I live in Canada, on an honest to goodness island no less and I can't say the thought of Jaws has ever stopped me from going swimming in the ocean. Perhaps this is one of those entry movies that you watch when you're younger that stays with you. It is rated PG after all.There are very few effects, practical or otherwise. In fact, isn't this film notorious for the crew not being able to use the animatronic sharks because they would never work, essentially forcing Spielberg to use implication rather than effect? It's just a bunch of people flailing about in the water until they are pulled under and then the water turns red. That's not all that thrilling or scary to me.Perhaps its been the years of spoofs and homages that has desensitized me so that I couldn't enjoy it, but I didn't. Maybe it's because when I watched it, I already wasn't afraid of sharks because, you know, once you're back on land, there's pretty much nothing they can do, they're not an every present threat.The music is composed by John Williams who essentially did all the music for all the movies for Spielberg and Lucas (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, Superman, ET, yadda, yadda) so it's what you would expect.

People have written about the rubber shark. Everyone knows that the shark's name is Bruce. Everyone knows that it was named after Spielberg's lawyer. Everyone knows that the shark didn't work all the time. Everyone knows that Dreyfuss and Shaw didn't get along. The list goes on... Still, for some reason, this movie inspires people, myself included, to write, write, and write. More importantly, it inspires us to read, read, and read. We need to know that we're not all crazy for loving this movie. We need to know that we can sit there and heave a collective sigh of relief, of comfort, when we watch it. We need to know that there are others like us who love this movie on every level. It touches us. We are Chief Brody when we're scared. We get excited in a very geeky way over things we love like Hooper. We all have moments of bravado like Quint and we're happy to know that he gets scared too. Most of all- we love sharks. We can't help it.This movie is brilliant. There is not a single thing that you could do to it that would make it better. They haven't created an award with a broad enough scope that would be appropriate for this movie to win. It's an action movie, a horror movie, a buddy movie, a drama; it is everything. It is why we go to movies.If you have not seen this movie then stop what you are doing. I don't care if you are delivering a baby- it can wait. You can not go any further in your life without seeing JAWS. If you've seen it before- finish delivering the baby... then go watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"Guess what, folks? I wasn't impressed!","Yes.  The special effects, acting, and script were all well done.  But perhaps the key to any great suspense film is the pacing.  And this particular ""great"" suspense film, was slow to a crawl.  It should have picked up, but it didn't.  In fact it got SLOWER after they got onto the boat!  I was waiting for a lot of action scenes with the shark.  Instead I got Robert Shaw musing on his experiences as a hunter.  It wasn't a thriller so much as a meditation on the potential danger of a shark, and of trying to catch one.  Having started my Spielberg experiences with ET, I was used to a standard for his films that this one didn't meet.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to take a more pre-Star Wars perspective. But I couldn't.  Sorry all.",6.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Jaws Is To Spielberg As Psycho Is To Hitchcock,"Of the many blockbuster films Steven Spielberg directed, I wonder if this might wind up as his most famous years from now. Like Hitchcock and ""Psycho,"" it certainly was his most shocking and scariest film. For months, people were afraid to go into the ocean after seeing this film. Few people knew what a Great White Shark looked like, but they have ever since this film came out!No, it doesn't hold the terror it did when released about 30 years ago, but it is still scary, still entertaining and moves at a fast pace. This is a quick two hours of movie-watching.The shark, which can look a little phony on occasions, is still frightening and the music has held up even better than the special-effects. The creepy music whenever the shark is near still can get your adrenaline flowing!I didn't find any of the human beings too appealing.

Spielberg turns weak story into a cinematic masterpiece.,"Every once in a while the right talented people are at the right place together and come up with a masterpiece. ""Jaws"" is definitely one of those movies, that is thanks to the amazing cast and the crew the classic masterpiece that it is today.Let's face it, the story is dumb and silly and in a way very average. Spielberg magically turns the silly story into a tense exciting thriller with brilliant dialogue and classic scene's. Mark my words, ""Jaws"" is a movie that will never be considered outdated.Everything in the movie works so well! The acting, the dialogue, the tension, the typical Spielberg humor, the music, everything! It's hard to name just one thing why this movie is such a masterpiece. It is the mix of everything combined that makes the movie work. Probably my favorite thing about the movie would be the dialogue, they are very raw and performed well by the perfect cast. Another thing of course would be the music and I'm not just talking about the main theme but about the entire musical score in general.The cast is great but they are mainly great together. All of the Scheider/Shaw/Dreyfuss scene's are like three ingredients thrown together and the end result of it is pure gold.And than Bruce the shark. Yes, he really looks believable even now days.A real classic masterpiece that launched Spielberg's career10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

It wasn't a propeller.. It wasn't a coral reef.. And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.. It was a Shark!,"***SPOILERS*** It's when teenager Cassie, Susan Blacklinie, went skinny dipping one evening in the waters off Long Island Sound that she attracted this giant 25 foot great white shark who ended up taking her out and under for his dinner! With the July 4th festivities about to start the seaside town of Amity, who's economy depends on tourist summer dollars, the news that a killer and man eating shark is on the loose off it's waters is the last thing that the town fathers and its Mayor Vaughn, Murray Hamilton, want the public to know about! It's when against his better judgment due to the pressure put on him by Mayor Vaughn Amity Police Chief Brody,Roy Scheider, kept the beaches opened that the killer shark strikes again gulping down another victim in front of hundreds of terrified beach goers including Chief Brody. With panic engulfing Amity and after a false report of having harpooned and killed the shark he strikes again this time in shallow waters off Amity Island. This on July 4th taking down another victim and thus closing the beaches indefinitely until the shark, the real killer shark not a cheap imitation,is finally put out of commission!With Mayor Vaughn and the town fathers finally coming to their senses their forced to hire the famed shark hunter Captain Quint, Robert Shaw, at $10,000.00 plus expenses to track down and kill the man eating shark before he adds more victims to his already impressive body count. There's also the young wise cracking Oceanographer Hooper, Richard Dreyfuss, who goes along for the ride together with chief Brody on Quint's shark hunting boat the Orca. It's Hooper's know it all attitude about marine life and sea fearing that starts to get under Quint's skin and almost leads the two to go at each other instead of at the killer shark. It's only later on that Hooper gains a new found respect for Quint when he finds out that his obsession with sharks and wanting to kill them was the result of an incident back in WWII where he almost ended up together with most of his 700 fellow US Navy sailors, on the torpedoed USS Indianapolis, being eaten by one of them.With the three, Quint Brody & Hooper, shark hunters out at sea is when the killer shark, efficiently called Bruce, comes out in the open with his razor sharp and serrated teeth, as much as three rows of them,flashing. From then on it's a battle between man and beast on the open seas with the killer shark making the best of the situation. It's his turf or waters that he's battling in and he knows every drop of it. That's until Brody now on his own with nothing to lose, but his life, overcomes his fear of the high seas and together with a high powered rifle and full oxygen tank finally turns the tables on the surging like a train locomotive Bruce the Shark. With Brody leaving about just enough of him,all 25 feet and three ton's worth, to fully pack an 8 to 12 once sardine can!P.S ""Jaws"" released in the early summer of 1975 became the biggest money making hit in motion picture history in only just six weeks after it's initial release! Surpressing and almost doubling the profits of the previous money earing champ ""The Godfather"" without as much as breaking a sweat in doing it. Not at first thought to become the mega monster hit, with all the troubles and delays in filming it, that it turned out to be ""Jaws"" astounded the movie critics as well as it's own cast & crew members who before it's release had them feeling that it was going to be the ""Bomb"" of the century, and end up destroying their careers, who tried to distance and disown themselves from the film. Check out the author of the novel ""Jaws"" that the film was based on Peter Benchley as a TV reporter on the Amity beach just before the killer shark springs or swims into action.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure

He has an affair with Mrs. Brody. He is also eaten by the shark - see ya!. Brody does not kill the shark in the made for TV fashion by shooting an oxygen tank inexplicably embedded and exposed for a long period of time in the sharks's mouth. I guess there were not ""aquarial"" toothpicks in the seventies. The fish merely succumbs to all of the harpoons in which he is embedded as Brody kicks away from the boat wreckage awaiting the end by the pursing shark.

Spielberg at the top of his game,"My Rating: **** out of ****.Steven Spielberg is one of the best American directors working today. He has made many films that have been hailed as classics. Yet before the Dinosaurs, Holocaust, Peter Pan, UFO's, and Indy there was the Shark. Jaws represents one of the masterpieces on Spielbergs resume. It is also probably the ""Quintessential Spielberg Film.""Jaws was very popular when released, it was the gighest grossing film of 1975. It spawned three sequels, which were all inferior. In fact, no film about Sharks or any killer fish has been able to come close to the level of Jaws.The genius in Jaws is its ability to build suspense. The Shark is never really shown till near the end of the film. When ever the Shark is approaching its victims, we get the Sharks point of view, instead of seeing the Shark. These POV shots combined with John Williams very effective score, make the scenes when the Shark is about to devour his victims much more effective.Evry actor does a nice job with their performances. Roy Scheider brings Martin to life. Martin is not a showy character but Scheider is able to make us like him. Richard Dreyfuss exhibits energy in his performance as Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw is very effective as Quint, that Indiannapolis speech is still very chilling to me. Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton also give solid support.People always talk about how fake the Shark looks. I think its passable but today it would definitely be done by CGI. However, the Shark is not seen that much in the film so its not that big of a deal.I would like to say Jaws is Spielbergs best film, Schindlers List closely follows. But I would like to see Close Encouners and the Indiana Jones films again. I did not like Close Encounters the first time, and I like the Indiana Jones films but they never stood out to me. If these films dont surpass Jaws, then it is definitely Spielberg's best film.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
scary stuff,"It left a generation of schoolkids afraid to go into a swimming pool, let alone back into the water. Wunderkind Spielberg's story is all the scarier for hardly ever showing the Great White that is most of the characters' nemesisSpielberg was still in his twenties when he signed up to direct the shark movie that would transform his career - and Hollywood itself. The production was notoriously chaotic yet, with the help of a major marketing campaign, Jaws became the biggest box office success ever, until the release of Star Wars the next year.The cast is top-notch. Scheider is police chief Brody, a hydrophobe taking up his new posting on Amity Island off America's East Coast. His buddies in battling the killer fish are rich-kid ichthyologist Hooper (Dreyfuss) and maverick fisherman Quint (Shaw). The film has political undertones - it is marked by a post-Watergate distrust of authority - but also owes a debt in its theme of self and mutual reliance to those twin classic 50s westerns of contrasting political colours: High Noon and Rio Bravo.John William's great and justly revered score is instantly evocative of the film and its power to terrify, and there are several stand-out shock moments and wonderfully sustained suspense scenes. But the film's real master stroke - keeping the monster unseen for as long as possible - was, ironically, forced on the production by the refusal of the various mechanical sharks to function on demand.",,Anonymous,Adventure

Holds up to an extent,"Jaws is seemingly universally praised by critics and audiences alike, for its cinematography, visuals and overall Jaws like shark. As s first time watch, this film starts off relatively slow and boring in the first half then picks up a lot in the second half (when the three characters start the ""sea adventure"" hunting down Jaws).Did not care too much for the story in the beginning but of course it was set to build up the characters and give them depth. Found the lead of Martin to be rather unlikeable while Hopper was the standout. They weren't too interesting and a lot of the dialogue seemed to drag on. Perhaps too much time was put into the first half. Had it been cut down a little, maybe would have found it more engaging.Still in the end and within the final 30 or so minutes the film does get thoroughly engaging and entertaining.

Truly a classic,"For the very first time, I watched this movie last night, as part of an auteur project I'm doing for film class at school. We each had to pick a director, watch three movies they directed from different points in their career and do a post-viewing journal entry for each one, and I picked Steven Spielberg.All I can say is, I don't regret the choice!!!The performances in this movie, from the likes of Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody, Robert Shaw as Fisherman Quint (may they both rest in peace), and Richard Dreyfuss as Oceanographer Matt Hooper, are some of the best and most memorable I've seen in ANY movie. All three bring so much of themselves and their personal backgrounds to flesh out the very different personalities of their characters. And the special effects? Genius. The mechanical shark (which famously seized up constantly during filming, forcing Spielberg to work around the issue and only hint at the shark in most scenes) does look a little fake when its face is fully and clearly out of the water, but everywhere else, it looks totally real, even for a movie this old! Practically everything in this movie is well-done, from the amazing cinematography by Bill Butler, to the incredibly meticulous editing by Verna Fields, to the amazing score by musical genius and Spielberg regular John Williams (who sadly is now on the verge of retirement), especially the famous Jaws theme (Da-DUN. Daa-DUN.).And even with a 124-minute runtime, absolutely no scenes drag out too long, nor go by too fast, and there's just the perfect amount of terror, humor and excitement to keep me entertained all the way through. And most of the dialogue really amused me, too (hehe, that rhymed)!All in all, Jaws is certainly the classic that all cinephiles say it is. Spielberg truly was at his finest with this movie.

Best of the best,"In a couple of years, 'Jaws' will turn 50. It could've been made last year. Sure, it would have been green-screened to death and been much the worse for it, but as a straight down the barrel action-adventure, it's never come close to being bettered.And it never will, because it's sheer waterlogged perfection.Every single performance in this film is on the money, and the triumvirate of Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss take your breath away, perfect storm ensemble acting that happens once or twice in a generation. And holy cow, do we care about these guys, and root for them tooth and nail 'til the very last reel. Even Shaw's obnoxious Quint, haunted by those desperate hours waiting for death or recovery from the Indianapolis, we come to admire and it truly hurts that one of these guys never makes it to the end zone.And Spielberg was right. Jaws would have been half the movie without THAT score. Just as Jerry Goldsmith's music tipped The Omen over the edge, John Williams wrote a score for the ages that's as synonymous with dread today as it was all those years ago.I was a young lad when I first saw Jaws. I queued around the block, and didn't get in the first two times. Third time was the charm, and such was the impact of those two and a bit hours, that I would see Jaws a further 6 times that Summer at the theatre.

A timeless masterpiece,"Well, I've really never seen Jaws before and there's actually no reason for that. Somehow I just always pushed Jaws aside and pushed it up further and further, but now the time has come, I have seen the film and am just thrilled.But what else can you expect from Steven Spielberg? He simply has an incredible range and has so many different genres in his filmography around action, adventure, war film, comedy, children's film, sci-fi, most recently musical and with Jaws he has proven that he is also great in the horror/thriller genre. This man simply knows how to tell stories, build up characters, build tension and captivate the viewer to the screen and he proves that anew in every film.Well, that what makes the film so special and stands out from other shark films is of course the tension, the incredible tension that mounts more and more until it comes to the climax. The special thing about the tension in Jaws is that a huge mystery is being built around the white shark. At first you see a few killings of the beast and of course only expect a normal shark attack. But without seeing the shark, as a spectator you learn more and more details about the shark that all indicate that this is not a normal shark.It is particularly important that the shark is never really shown at first, because then the mystery is expanded much further. As a spectator, you wonder what this beast must be and then when you finally see the shark, it is much bigger than expected.Of course, this would only be half as impressive if the shark had been computer-animated, because then you could certainly no longer take the film seriously today. But luckily they decided against it and Bruce still looks fantastic today. Oh yes, Steven Spielberg called the shark Bruce, perhaps after his lawyer, who hast the same name. But in any case, the beast in the film looks really impressive and that's why it was certainly worth building the shark instead of animating it. Although the shark has sunk on the first attempt to put it in the water, because it has never been checked its water suitability.But be that as it may, the film offers such incredible tension that is getting worse and more acute and also a realistic-looking shark. But another special aspect is, of course, the horror factor. Because it is not without reason that the film is one of the only five horror films that has received an Academy Award. Well, I thought at first that the film would not be scary and would rather go in the direction of a thriller. That's true, but the horror aspect was still captured magnificently. There were even two moments when I really shrugged and that doesn't happen often with horror movies. Probably it's just because Jaws simply offers a fantastic and immersive experience, so that you are so deep in the story that you sympathize with the characters at all times and are therefore frightened.Well, speaking of characters, because these were also written really brilliantly and also fantastically embodied by the actors. Roy Scheider plays the protagonist and he is completely convincing in his role. He plays a police chief of a smaller island town and he is the only one who actually has his heart in the right place and is not interested in profit. In addition, he also has a personal interest in killing the shark, as he feels guilty not to have done anything earlier to close the beach. The fact that he is also afraid of the water simply makes him a great character in the film.Richard Dreyfuss actually plays the second leading role and is also fantastic in his role. His character is a kind of shark or fish expert, who once again brings a slightly different perspective into the film.And then of course there is Robert Shaw in the role of Quint. Even if he actually plays an asshole in the film, he still plays it really convincingly and with great joy. But his character is at least as important as the other two, as he brings another new perspective into the film. As a result, there are three characters that are all very different, but still pursue a common goal.The characters are particularly important in the film because they conveyed the feelings of the whole event. When they see the shark for the first time and are completely amazed by this size and at the same time afraid, this is really important, because this is the same effect as in Jurassic Park. If the characters react only half-heartedly and as if it were nothing special, then of course we feel the same. But fortunately, the actors convey the feelings of their characters really great, so that we as viewers naturally sympathize much more.Of course, the soundtrack should also be mentioned, because once again John Williams is responsible for how it actually befits Steven Spielberg films. His theme of the film is at least as iconic as the film itself and anyone who hears this theme will probably immediately associate it with the film.Well, it is probably not without reason that the film when it was released, could record the greatest revenue ever, until Star Wars replaced it. Because Jaws is simply an immersive, exciting, thrilling and unforgettable experience that perfectly combines the thriller and horror genre and just delivers a damn great experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure
An absolute masterpiece; a summer blockbuster that is also somewhat groundbreaking,"Often considered to be the ultimate summer blockbuster, Jaws (1975) goes even further than that; standing as a truly radical and exciting piece of film-making, rich in character, action, energy and technique; and filled with some truly iconic moments that have endured throughout the subsequent thirty-five years and still retain the power and ability to shock and excite the audience in more than equal measures. For me, it's an example of almost perfect film-making, setting the template for many of Spielberg's greatest films in terms of structure, presentation and impact; with that opening sequence grabbing our attention with a swift combination of alluring sexuality giving way to full-blown horror and dread; further whetting our appetite just enough to make us persevere with the eventual scenes of dialog and exposition that immediately follow. Here, Spielberg is also able to suggest the kind of danger lurking ahead, creating a sense of suspense for the audience that will pay off in the final third of the film, where we find non-stop action, drama and pure character dynamics.Much has already been written about the sharp vibrancy of the story and the slow build up to the eventual revelation of the event that triggers the narrative and sends us headlong into that four-way battle of wits that dominates the film's final act; with the screenwriters taking an obvious leaf from Hitchcock - and in particular, The Birds (1963) - with that idea of a small, seemingly idyllic island community being terrorised by an ecological, naturalistic horror that is never fully explained (and remains all the more terrifying for it). It remains that perfect combination of script, direction, casting and hook; in this case the frightening and iconic score of John Williams, which benefits from a two-note simplicity in keeping with the rest of the film, and the basic idea of an unseen, unstoppable evil, waiting in the most innocuous place of all... the sea! Spielberg's confident approach to a cinema of this scale, even at such an early point in his career, is already apparent; with the problems behind the scenes actually being used to the benefit of the film, turning something that could have been a fairly obvious maritime disaster movie with a fake rubber shark and producing a film that was slightly more enigmatic, character driven and open to interpretation.For example, you can clearly read metaphorical interpretations into the portrayal of the shark and how it affects this community; bringing out the quiet desperation of the islanders and the corruption of its town officials who just want to keep the money rolling in, regardless of the cost; are of which are fairly prevalent when we think of the film in the 70's context, post-Watergate/post-Vietnam. However, the film isn't limited to political subtext, with the action, characters and deft handling of narrative momentum all adding to the overall great viewing experience; with the director's truly heroic command of framing, shot structure and tight use of editing to make the most out of the film's few genuinely affecting shock scenes. It's also more violent than the PG rating would suggest, with Spielberg once again getting away with the kind of brutality that would have condemned a less popular filmmaker; something that we can also see in the violence of Saving Private Ryan (1999) and the more recent Munich (2005).It's odd to consider now that Spielberg was, despite his success, always thought of as a lesser talent compared to the likes of Coppola, Scorsese and Bogdanovich; his style and influences too populist to appeal to serious cineasts and his films apparently too lightweight to be compared to the similarly great likes of The Last Picture Show (1971), The Conversation (1974) and Taxi Driver (1976). With this in mind, it's surprising to see that Spielberg is now the most interesting, exciting and edgy director of his generation; still as populist and business-minded as ever, but taking great risks with films like the emotionally complicated A.I. (2001), the low-key and minimalist (of the not entirely successful) The Terminal (2004) and the vitriolic and oddly reflective Munich; as mentioned above. Obviously, he is a great filmmaker - as those particular films and many more will attest - however, for me, Jaws is something of his masterpiece; made all the more impressive for the fact that it was produced at the very beginning of his career and was only his third feature-length film as director.",,Anonymous,Adventure
OK Jaws,"I had always thought there was a big hype about this movie,enough to make it a Spielberg classic or to have been considered better than the Cuckoos Nest.Finally I decided to watch this film i thought was crap, and my final conclusion has been that the film is entertaining. I know it has a big misinterpretation of shark's behavior and the plot is too simple but if you give this a chance you will sure like it.

One of the greatest of all time,"Jaws (1975) was the first ever summer blockbuster, it set the tone for the future of cinema. At one point they were so far behind on production that Steven Spielberg's career was on the line but boy did he deliver. Everyone knows of the behind the scenes conflict between Robert Shaw who played Quint, and Richard Dreyfuss who played Matt Hooper, this conflict translated into the film incredibly. Roy Scheider does an excellent job as chief Brody. In my opinion this is one of if not the best thriller of all time. The fact the shark isn't even on screen for the first hour of the film but we see what he can do and we fear him greatly. The music by John Williams makes the movie. When you hear the iconic song you know the shark is just lurking beneath the surface. It leaves you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Feeding Frenzy,"This big white shark not only killed his hapless on-screen victims, but - more disastrously - an era of intelligent and thought-provoking American cinema called New Hollywood. Spielberg introduced a new dimension of immensely successful pulp storytelling. No place for adult themes and honest emotions any more... at least in box-office terms.But fortunately, ""Jaws"" is pre-bumptious Spielberg, when he still worked as an effective craftsman, not a self-important mainstream ""artist"".So the movie's thankfully devoid of the cuties and cheap symbolism and bathos, that would soon ruin most of Spielberg's work.

A Mesterful Piece of Horror,"I recall waiting in line to watch this movie in 1975. It was in such demand we went with friends to a movie theater on an Air Force Base as the lines were considerably shorter.I have always loved great horror movies, more specifically monster movies (Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man, King Kong, etc) but none are as terrifying as Jaws. Other movies are still phenomenal but you often have to make excuses for how they age. The special effects or make up may be dated. Maybe great for the time the movie was made but still dated.Jaws is NOT one of those movies. Probably due to the Hell Bruce put the director through the movie had aged wonderfully. Since we seldom see the shark or when we do it is often in passing, the suspense and terror builds in our imagination and becomes more and more intensifying.I recall women from another generation avoiding showers due to Psycho. Well our generation and anyone who saw Jaws can't help but hesitate just a bit before entering the ocean. I still don't feel comfortable all the time and I snorkel and scuba dive.

"One terrific, suspenseful and outstanding film","""Jaws"" is one of Steven Spielberg's best films to date, and it still manages to scare the hell out of people ever since it's release 25 years ago. The plot has a great white shark terrorizing the summer resort town of Amity around the 4th of July. Chief Brody (Roy Schieder) leads an investigation and closes down the beaches after a young woman was found dismembered, but Mayor Vaughn (Larry Hamilton) objects to closing them down because the town would lose money. After several more people die, a young Icthyologist (Richard Dreyfuss), a weird fisherman (Robert Shaw) and Chief Brody team up and set out to destroy the shark before he decides to make the Amity tourists his meals. The interaction between the three leading players is nothing less than perfect. They laugh, they fight, they yell, they each have their respective differences but you all relate to them in some way. Each of them do a terrific job. The music is tense, and also became famous over the years, being parodied and imitated in numerous films and TV shows. Spielberg did a fantastic job of scaring people to go into the water and I only wish the sequels did as good of a job as this classic did.",,Anonymous,Adventure
It is still a good movie,"Jaws is a famous movie. It is on the English textbooks of middle school in China. Today, I saw the movie, finally.30 years passed, the movie still remains in fashion, and it is exciting.Several days ago, I saw the War of the Worlds. Together with this one movie, I think I understand Steven Spielberg better. When I for the fist time saw the Terminal, I thought it wasn't Steven's Style, because it was not amazing,or astonishing. But I was wrong, it was in Steven's Style. To make big movie is just one ability of this great master, and he also can play around with drama, which may touch your heart, or inspire deep thoughts and always, he do this under a big movie cover.Jaws is exciting, not for its scene. The shark scenes,which were made 30 years ago, though you can't find anything wrong with it, surely couldn't compete the last movies. But there are things that would catch your eyes, and those things wouldn't go out as time go by. Simply, Steven know how to make you feel and stay exciting.Though a good movie as it is, it isn't as good as it should be.For example,some actress were a bit of over acting.In a word, It is old, but it shouldn't be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"""I'll find him for three....but I'll catch him and kill him for Ten""","When reviewing War of Worlds previously, I stated that Spielberg really knew how to scare people, this is where he perfected that craft and for many of us, even introduced it, that was certainly the case with me. This also proved to be the introduction for something has become a staple in cinema, dry closely followed by another who achieved a similar result in George Lucas' Star Wars, The Summer Blockbuster.Droves of people would flock to the cinema, armed only with a limited understanding of the style of movie it was they were going to see, no trailers, no reviews, no spoilers, just a bold step into the unknown. As much victims of Spielbergs Horror as victims of the shark during the film.Jaws is set in the picturesque seaside town of Amity Island, Cape Cod. The town serves as a haven for beach goers and holiday makers every summer, but this summer, there's and unwelcome guest sharing the waters of the tourist filled beaches, a twenty five foot Great White Shark.Police Chief Brody (Roy Schneider) is left to pick up the pieces and quell the panic and pressure from City officials who, for monetary gain, wish to keep the beaches open over the summer, but as the body count begins to rise, Chief Brody is forced to enlist the help of Marine Biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfus) and grizzled Shark Fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw). The three are electric, each in their own way. Spielberg masterfully captures the trauma and panic of those involved, the hysteria that inevitably spreads in the wake of such an event, and yet the humanity and simplicity, even the humour of our characters and those around them.Spielbergs blockbuster delivers on so many of the aspects that horror movies are built on and still use today. There is a perfectly good reason why I still have a fear of the sea, and while it definitely doesn't portray Sharks in the best light, Jaws is a masterpiece.Designated 'Bruce' by the team behind Jaws, the animatronic shark seen in the movie often failed to work during filming. This meant that Spielberg needed to find a way to film without using the Dummy Shark in most scenes. You will see some truly chilling camera angles, scenes where the viewer is literally placed in the eye of the Shark, scanning through the blue, passing by unknowing swimmers, all leading up to a horrific surprise attack. Others where we see the sheer panic of those nearby or those who catch a glimpse of the shark and desperately try to flee from the water. Panic is the emotion that comes to mind most when I think of Jaws.Smart camera angles are one thing, but the most terrifying part of a movie about a killer shark is not even the animal itself, but John Williams score.How do you indicate the presence of a lurking predator on the hunt when you can't see where it is? By adding a Musical Score that grips from the movement you hear it and doesn't leave you until the film ends, trust me when I say that you'll know it when you hear it. It even plays in my own head anytime I'm in the sea, ceasing any fun I might have been having at the time and making me think twice before ever going back in. John Williams is a legend, and once again, he and Spielberg deliver on an experience you won't ever forget.Without spoilers, I can reference a few moments, chilling moments that really stand out to me.Those Barrels! Without the shark even being on screen, Spielberg found a way to make us uneasy by knowing it was lurking nearby, you see the yellow barrels float to the surface, it's coming.The nail drag on the chalk board. Perhaps a favourite moment of mine in cinema and definitely not something you're going to miss. It is used to instantly cut the tension and clamour, from that moment, you want to hear what Quint has to say.Quints monologue on the disaster of the USS Indianapolis is something that glues you to the screen, I have watched that single scene over and over again, so harrowing is his descriptive, that it almost feels as though Robert Shaw might have been there himself. A side note is that the disaster of the USS Indianapolis is completely true, and perhaps a motivator for this production of this film itself.On a relatively low budget and with new experimental techniques, Jaws sets a precedent for all horror films to follow. Rated at 8.1 on IMDb and certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with a 97% rating, winner of three academy awards for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Film Editing and further nominated for Best Picture, Jaws is widely considered one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

"It's a very good movie, but there are a few things that bother me about it.","I don't know if it is pure coincidence or if they did it on purpose, but it's a fact that only a couple of days after we got the news that two people in the USA had been attacked by a shark in a couple of days time, this movie was shown on one of our national television channels (I don't really believe this was just pure coincidence, since they can't get any better 'publicity' for such a movie). And it has to be said: this movie may well be thirty years old, but it's still capable of scaring the hell out of people.The story of ""Jaws"" is actually a quite simple one. When a girl dies in the ocean near a peaceful community on Amity Island, it's immediately believed to be a shark attack. But because the mayor doesn't want to spoil an entire summer by scaring the many tourists away, he is able to have it called a boating accident, much to the new police chief Martin Brody's frustration. He's convinced that more people will die if they don't do anything against this ferocious predator and soon enough he's proved right when a boy is killed by the shark. Together with a scientist and an old fisherman, he goes after the giant white shark to get rid of it for once and for all...This movie may well be one of the most famous movies of the seventies, but that doesn't mean that it is perfect. As long as you don't see the shark this is really a terrifying movie, but from the moment on that they show that giant rubber 'thing', it loses quite a lot of its power. You just know that this isn't correct, because it just is too gigantic and it doesn't react like a real shark. And I'm not even talking about the fact that it attacks boats, what I'm talking about are some 'small' details like not closing its eyes when attacking or not changing the position of the mouth. Normally a shark opens its mouth further when it gets closer, showing a lot more of its gums. This shark however is lifeless as it attacks.However, the movie has a lot of good things to offer as well. The acting for instance is really good. Roy Scheider does a good job as police chief Brody, but in my opinion it was Robert Shaw who was the best with his role of Quint, the fearless boat captain. Also very good is the music. I believe there is absolutely nobody who doesn't know what it is like and if you ask ten people to hum it, nine out of ten will be able to do it. And let's be honest, if it wasn't for the music, most scenes wouldn't even be scary. It's the music that creates the atmosphere of tension and terror when there is in fact nothing to be seen in the movie. But it works perfectly and that's all that matters.Overall this is a good movie, but if it hadn't been from the hand of Steven Spielberg, I'm pretty sure this would have been an awful one. It was probably his very first really great movie and he proved with this one that he was able to make a very good movie out of a concept that begs to become a failure. Many others have tried to copy its success with two sequels, but also with other 'shark' movies and not one of them was able to get to the same level of fear. However, when you are at least a little bit interested in sharks, you know that what is shown in it isn't correct. Many people only feared sharks after seeing this movie and that's too bad, because this marvelous creatures really aren't the mindless terror / killing machines that this movie made of them. I like the fact that the movie is one of the best in the genre, but I wish it had been a bit closer to reality. That's why I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"A ""Less-Than-Convincing"" Eating Machine","For me - The only times that the movie ""Jaws"" ever came to life and became somewhat worthwhile to watch were only during the scenes that showcased the shark's attacks.And since these attacks happened so few and far between, that about rendered the remainder of this ultra-silly monster movie as being nothing more than one big, long yawn, for the most part.And another thing - Yes. Of course, I do fully realize that ""Jaws"" was ""just-a-movie"" - But, all the same, I'm hardly convinced that a shark (especially one of this predator's apparent cunning) would ever behave as this one inevitably did in its hot pursuit of Quint and his 2-man crew on-board the Orca.If you ask me - This great white rogue of the ocean was just too obviously dumb for words. Believe me, this blood-thirsty beast was just asking to be killed. (And, yep, in the end, its wish came true)In conclusion - From where I was sitting - 1975's ""Jaws"" was yet another one of those ridiculous, big-budget movies that (now 40 years old) still manages to be grossly over-rated for reasons that I'd say are, for the most part, quite unfounded.",4.0,Anonymous,Adventure

a classic made by an icon,"How is this movie good? Let me count the ways.First, it's a classic made by an icon, and both started their own version of cult, so watching it is almost didactic.Second, it is refreshing to be reminded that low-tech ways of creating constantly rising tension are at least as powerful as extensive views of most gory scenes. You don't need to see the monster to be scared thoughtless, and the scariest beasts live in the imagination, especially if you add just the right soundtrack.Third, there are some visually hypnotic moments, like the reflection of rapidly flipping pages in Brody's glasses that convey nicely the turmoil of his mind.

Its a classic for a reason,"What can I say about Jaws that hasn't already been said a thousand times in the last 44 years. There is a reason that this is considered a classic. It won 3 oscars and as on pretty much every 'Greatest movie ever made' list that I have ever read. So what made this film so iconic?If you have been under a rock for the last 45 years, Jaws is about a small holiday town on an island somewhere on the east coast-ish area of the US. This town is being plagued by a giant shark and the chief of police not only has to deal with a man eating fish, but with politicians that don't want to risk loosing the town's summer income in order to deal with the problem.It is pulse-pounding, nerve shredding tension right from the start. And there probably isn't a film aficionado left on earth who doesn't know John Williams famous score for this film. That serves as a way of really dialling up the suspense. And what is so great about this, is that it does all of this without you actually ever getting a good look at the shark. That is left entirely up to your imagination, as all good scary movies should be. That way you are naturally inclined to imagine the worst thing you can think of. Which in a film like this, means you get all the scares with none of the expensive CGI bills.The acting isn't always the best, the brief glimpses of the shark we do get make it obvious that the thing is basically just a stuffed puppet, and it isn't exactly the fastest paced but it IS a classic and one that every film fanatic should see at least once for sure.Recommended for fans of:

A horror film I actually like,"Most horror films are just brutal or disgusting, with the whole movie just consisting of people being brutally attacked by the horrifying creatures. ""Jaws"" is an enormous exception. In this film, Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) who refuses to close down a New England beach over 4th of July weekend due to a recent shark attack. After more attacks, he, a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss), and the owner of a boat (Robert Shaw) set out to destroy the shark. The shark is not even really seen for over an hour into the film, making the concept of a shark rather than the shark the source of the horror, a sense of brilliance not found in most horror movies. Also, the film revolves more around the characters and the decisions they must make to deal with the situation, which really brings about a more interesting aspect of the film. Audiences don't want a film to dwell on the horrifying objects that can't communicate; they want to expand on characters and people. That's what makes this such a great film. It's intense, a bit scary, and has little bits of humor throughout that make it fun to watch. The ending proves to be a bit too intense for me, so I don't feel it's absolutely perfect, but very close.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

"Finally, 33 years later, I've seen the movie that reminded us to not go in the water...","""Jaws"" is a movie for the ages. It's an example of what happens when the right people come together for the right reasons, for the right movie.Firstly, author Peter Benchley co-wrote the screenplay (the screenplay itself is adapted from his own novel of the same name) that became one of the new, classic scary-stories of our time: a huge great white shark is terrorizing the residents of a small New England beach community. Amity Police Chief Brody (the recently departed Roy Scheider), marine expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and grizzled shark hunter Quint (the late Robert Shaw) are the heroic three who volunteer to have a climatic showdown with this man-eating menace appropriate described as mother nature's ultimate killing machine.I should make it clear that for years I was never one of this movie's biggest fans. So I just kind of avoided it - the theme just didn't appeal to me, since I've never been afraid to go swimming at the beach. But guess what? ""Jaws"" is the classic adventure-horror of our times, and I am now amongst one of its many, many fans. A lot of things are classic about this movie - it's pointless to even describe them here.Also, I'm sure there are a number of scientific inaccuracies about the true nature of sharks (the recently departed shark hunter who inspired ""Quint"" always said he felt sorry for the shark in this movie) and whether or not they are truly something to fear - but, you know what? - it's Hollywood, they always win. And I'm also sure that the liberties with sharks were liberties well-taken for the sake of dramatic potential: This movie did its job in scaring the living daylights out of a lot of people.Most importantly, other than serving up great scares, suspense and adventure, ""Jaws"" is responsible for starting the career of Hollywood director Steven Spielberg. ""Jaws"" was his claim to fame; it's also the movie credited for starting the summer blockbuster phenomenon (this currently ranks pretty high amongst one of the highest-grossing movies of all time), and spawning three sequels and countless imitators. Spielberg would go on to do great things in his career, long after ""Jaws,"" and he still continues to do great things to do this day because of this movie. It's probably one of my favorite movies of his and one of my favorite movies of all time.""Jaws"" is a movie not likely to ever go away any time soon. That is part of its appeal: its ability to remain an important piece of cinema and a pop culture phenomenon that continues to genuinely frighten us even 33 years after its release. And that is also the mark of a truly great film.

Jaws should have won best picture and Spielberg should have won best director because Jaws was better than any other movie made in 1975 by miles and than any other movie EVER made. In my opinion Spielberg should have won several Oscar's before he finally won it in 1993 for Schindler's list. ET should have won best picture and director and close encounters should have won some major Oscar's too. Also Indiana Jones and raiders of the lost ark and last crusade were better than any movie made the same year they were made, so he deserved some more credit than he got for those. Jaws has everything you need. It has three brilliant actors who do an excellent job, especially Robert Shaw, its scary, jumpy, tense, funny , edge of seat excitement, and believe me once you see it you will never feel the same going into the water again, ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Just amazing,"Just watched at cinema finally.Unbelievable film!! Absolutely perfect from start to finish. Perfect pacing, script, atmosphere, direction, dialogue!! Even the effects are still good. It takes time to build the characters and blends the horror, drama and light humour perfectly. They just cannot seem to make films like this anymore. To think it was made on a tiny budget with a prosthetic shark that never worked is astounding. Completely stands up to this day.Considering my son has been brought up on marvel etc and said it's one of the best films he's ever seen, says it all.Oh and keeping half an eye on your 11 year old while waiting for Ben Gardeners head, then getting the reaction you were dying for was priceless.

Quint,"Many will fail to realize that the strongest character of all throughout the film was Quint, which probably didn't survive in the movie simply because Spielberg isn't like him (he stated so indirectly in ""Saving Private Ryan"", when he identified himself with the low-life pathetic coward Upham).Quint wasn't just any fisherman.A real human being, with anger, fear and  regrets, he is THE ONLY character that gave this movie the depth that only history, world-changing events and/or a man's past can give.He is possibly the least ""spielberg-looking"" character of all (watch more Spielberg movies for reference), and it comes as no surprise when he steals every single scene he's in.Quint, with his colorful personality, did tons more for the film than any of the others could have.  You take away that character, and the film loses a lot.Also, although probably not true, sometimes I wonder if the fact of Robert Shaw not being an american had anything to do with his disregard as an oscar nominee in this film, for his portrayal of Quint.Without Quint, this movie wouldn't even be half of what it became.",,Anonymous,Adventure

Best Classic,"This is the movie that made people around the world afraid of the water. I didn't realise how long this movie was and was shocked that it stretched to 2hrs. There was a lot of long conversations and honestly some scenes were unnecessary and could've been cut altogether.There were some good directorial choices made in terms of camera work and intensity of the scenes. At the beginning when the shark attacks the boy and there is a dramatic zoom to the main character. That just makes you feel the sense of panic and gives you goosebumps.It was a nice movie to watch as an adult and I still remember how it made me feel as a child when I watched it. Not something you'll watch more than once or at least not until years and years later.I wish it captured my full attention as it did at the start and at the end but in the middle it was almost boring at times, not always, but at times.Good classic and will always be one of the good shark horror movies out there.",6.0,Anonymous,Adventure

PriceyPopulist...B-Movie Entertainment at its Best,"This is Not Director Steven Spielberg's Most Overrated Movie, that would be ""E.T."" (1982). But it is Certainly Overrated. Overwhelmed by the Popularity and Zeitgeist of the Whole Thing, It was Certainly a Blockbuster and Cultural Phenomenon in 1975.A Slickly Made and Innovative Movie for its Time, Spielberg had Enough Clout and Money to Experiment with the Genre and was a Creative Talent that Crafted a Different Look and Feel to the Film that Helped Make the Movie a Slightly Offbeat Experience. John Williams Haunting Score Helped.But the Movie has Some Things that are Far From Perfect and Keeps it from Becoming a Masterpiece that So Many Claim. In the First Act, Spielberg Borrows from Howard Hawks and Includes a lot of Over Talking that is Just as Clunky as When Hawks Kept Pushing that bit of Pretension on Audiences.The Second Act is Corny at Times with Roy Scheider's Chief Brody Character Channeling Every Teen Sci-Fi from the Fifties Trying to Convince His ""Elders"" that there Really is a ""Monster on the Loose"", and When Robert Shaw's Over the Top ""Old Salt"" Shows Up, the Camp becomes Quite Silly at Times.The Third Act Suffers Mostly from Mechanics of the Shark Kind. When the Shark Jumps on the Boat, Suspension of Disbelief Goes Out the Window.But the Movie is Entertaining and it has Become One of Those Band Wagons that Everyone wants to Jump On for Fear of Being Left Behind. Objectively, it's a Fine Film, Better than Average, and Deserves Credit for the Now Famous Tapping of that Middle Class Angst that the Director is Well Known for Exploiting.Spielberg is a Craftsman, a Playful Filmmaker with Great Talent and an Ability to Know What the People Want and Gives it to Them in Heavy Doses.Jaws was His First Film of the Sort, and He has Never Really Changed and Strayed Only Occasionally from what Might be Called Populist Entertainment Rather than High-Art.

"""Jaws"" Just Couldn't Keep Its Head Above Water","This decidedly heavy-handed, $8 million monster movie (which earned back 25x its production costs within its first year of release) actually had me yawning uncontrollably within its first half-hour.Following the very first shark attack (which was, by far, the best of the lot), Jaws' story steadily lost serious momentum as the dramatic edge of this tale spiralled hopelessly downward at a constant rate.It's really hard for me to believe that Jaws actually thrilled audiences to pieces back in 1975. If you ask me - This Spielberg ""Creature Feature"" has got to be one of the most over-rated and undeservedly praised horror movies of all time.And what made Jaws even more difficult to enjoy was that the principal characters were all impossible to like. I mean - As an example - Can you imagine a mayor (who was well-aware of the shark attacks) actually pressuring citizens to get back into the water regardless of the great risk that this posed to their very lives?All-in-all - I'd say that Jaws came very close to being a total dud, in my books. And, besides the laughable, old-school shark effects, I thought that Quint's inevitable demise was one of the worst staged moments of ultra-violence that I've seen in a mighty long time.In conclusion - Spielberg, as a director (then & now), is certainly far from being the genius film-maker that so many of his devoted fans make him out to be.",4.0,Anonymous,Adventure

A third act that lasts an hour, completely disconnected from the story, completely different setting, but somehow manages to be one of the most entertaining in cinema history, with only three characters and very few action (compared to today's production in the same genre).

I'm still afraid to go in the water.,"What were my parents thinking when, in 1975, they took me to see Jaws at the tender age of 7? Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel (about a man-eating shark feeding on the inhabitants of a small island) had me squirming in terror for nearly two hours when I first saw it. Even now, 32 years later, this film still has the ability to horrify, nauseate and generally upset me; testament, surely, to the brilliance of its director and the talent of its amazing cast. But it's still definitely not suitable fare for a 7 year old!Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody, who has moved with his family from the crime ridden streets of New york to Amity, an idyllic New England island. But when a spate of shark attacks threatens to ruin the island's 4th of July weekend, Brody, along with salty sea-dog Quint (Robert Shaw), and shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), sets out to catch the fish responsible.Opening with a terrifying scene in which a woman taking a midnight swim ends up as fish food thanks to the toothy terror lurking in the deep, Spielberg creates an atmosphere of fear from the word go. After a second attack, in which a child is chomped in full view of the sun-worshippers on the beach (possibly the film's most shocking moment), it becomes clear that anyone is fair game for the Great White prowling the waters of Amity, and the tension becomes almost unbearable.Spielberg's impeccable storytelling and incredible visual style, coupled with amazing performances from practically all involved, plus a fantastic score from John Williams, result in a film that is as close to perfection as humanly possible. Packed full of jump scares, great characterization, nerve wracking suspense, and exciting action, this one really does have it all.Jaws was the film that kick-started the summer blockbuster phenomenon and made Spielberg a household name; more importantly, it was the first movie to completely scare the crap out of me.

The shark itself is not shown until the very end (Spielberg intelligently uses the Hitchcock suspense technique there) and John Williams' brilliant score delivers all the scares.

However, the structure of the movie draws one in, despite the ridiculous nature of the plot. We are given a clear picture of the stakes for this town, the mayor, and the people that had decided to face down the monster that terrorizes the beach. When a small town becomes prey to a large offshore shark, the mayor, a local scientist, and a sea captain team up to defeat the deadly monster and save both the towns citizens and the local tourist industry.

Still Spielberg's best,"I think ""Jaws,"" after all these years, remains Steven Spielberg's best film (outdistancing his second-best, ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark."")  And it's my all-time personal favorite movie.  While you'd likely not find it on many critics' best-of lists for the 20th Century, it's the most fully entertaining film I've ever seen -- a classic mix of drama, plot and characterization.I believe Spielberg was quoted as saying he was disappointed that the shark scenes near the chief's boat looked less than authentic.  And while it's true the shark that attacks the boat looks more mechanical than real, it's only in the film for a relatively short time, and does not distract from the overall brilliance of the movie.An expert buildup to the shark attacks, a sense of chaos and fear that never feels phony, a fine (and underrated) collection of acting performances, a terrific score by John Williams, and refreshing moments of comic relief to ease the tension.  All this and more make ""Jaws"" one of the great Hollywood films.I especially like the acting chemistry between Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss when the three are trying to hunt down the shark that's been terrorizing their beach-vacation town.  Also, I found Shaw's character's tale about shark attacks on survivors of his sunken WWII boat to be a memorable piece of acting.Spielberg aimed for higher meaning with films like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and he made more money with ""E.T."" and ""Jurassic Park,"" but I maintain that ""Jaws"" is Spielberg at his best, doing what he does best: solid storytelling and characterization, memorable and gripping plotlines, and first-rate entertainment that pushes all the right buttons.",,Anonymous,Adventure

It doesn't take long for things to get interesting; the setup is simple yet effective. The subtle suspense of the opening scenes, along with Spielberg's masterful command of the film set, makes this film shine. There's a lot going on in the frame (actors talking over each other and frantic extras moving around) but Spielberg manages to keep everything in perfect harmony.

"My son was in the water, too...","It's hard to imagine that, if ""Bruce"" (the name given to the mechanical shark by Spielberg) had worked as he had envisioned, this movie may have become another low-grade horror flick.  Instead, it's more than halfway through the film before the creature appears in full view of the audience.Until then, only William's haunting score is there to warn you of the approaching danger as people get picked off one by one in the surf.  It also allows sufficient time to develop each of the main characters: Brody, the city-boy cop trying to deal with small-town politics, Hooper, the oceanographer who also thinks about the scientific possibilities, Vaughn, the slick mayor who turns a blind eye to the problem in favor of the business people that put him in office, and Quint, the hunter who will solve the island's problem for a handsome fee.The movie only gets better in the second half as Quint becomes a modern Ahab, who looks upon the shark as an adversary and pledges to rid the seas of this great white terror without much thought of this daunting challenge or its significant consequences.  Meanwhile, Brody and Hooper now face two problems: the menacing shark, who seems to be toying with them, and Quint, who has no problem taking them down with him should it come to that conclusion.Having grown up on the water, had I seen this film as a young boy, I may have thought twice about dangling my hand over the side of the boat or diving off the town docks.  The horror genre is usually synonymous with bad cinema but, on the rare occasion, some unforgettable classics are created and the first of this series (the only one worth watching or owning) is such an example.",,Anonymous,Adventure

Endlessly rewatchable in any mood you are in at any time of the day at any time of the year, as well as endlessly quotable start to finish, combined with powerhouse performances by all four leading actors that really were not even necessary yet they all dug so deep into their scenes and dialogues, Jaws is a masterpiece of Hollywood and is definitely the greatest movie of all time.And here's the kicker: this story actually happened in real life in 1916 in New Jersey, where five people were attacked within one week around the 4th of July, four deceased. Woodrow Wilson was actually called in to garner support to hunt the
shark. Sure the movie has to take some liberties, but they're barely exaggerated. The story itself is mostly true.Bonus: How was Robert Shaw not even nominated for a Best Supporting actor Oscar?

The man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget,"The British film critic Barry Norman once described Steven Spielberg as the man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget. That sounds like a devastating put-down, but I don't think Norman meant it as such. What he meant was that Spielberg borrowed themes from the cheap and cheerful science-fiction and adventure stories he had known in his youth and then gave those themes the full, glossy A-movie treatment. ""Jaws"" is a case in point. If a film on this subject had been made twenty (or even ten) years earlier it would probably have had some lurid title such as ""The Giant Killer Shark Horror"" and have been made on a very low budget with comically bad special effects. It would doubtless have disappeared from view almost completely, only surfacing for occasional late-night showings on specialist movie channels, probably on a double bill with something like ""The Blood Beast Terror"" or ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"". (I am not making that last one up; there really was a film with that title).""Jaws"" is set on the island of Amity, somewhere off the north-east coast of the USA. (The film was actually shot on Martha's Vineyard). The film is a mixture of disaster movie and hunting epic. It is something of a convention in disaster films that the disaster should be either caused or exacerbated by human stupidity, negligence or greed, and ""Jaws"" is no exception. After a young woman is killed by a shark while out swimming, the local police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches, but allows himself to be overruled by the town's mayor and councillors who argue that the girl's death could in fact have been the result of her being struck by a propeller. They are motivated by the fact that the island is a popular holiday resort, dependent upon the income it receives from tourists, and any hint of a man-eating shark in the area would be economically disastrous. (There was a very similar plot line in the 1990s disaster film, ""Dante's Peak"", although that concerned a volcano rather than a shark).Of course, Brody is proved right and the shark strikes again, causing panic on the beach and killing a young boy. Soon afterwards a shark is caught, and the relieved local politicians announce that this is the one that was responsible for the two deaths. One man, however, is not convinced. Matt Hooper, an ichthyologist, believes from the wounds on the two bodies that the shark that has been caught was too small to have carried out the attacks. Hooper and Brody, who is suffering from feelings of guilt over the boy's death, charter a boat, skippered by a local fisherman named Quint, to hunt down the true culprit.Although the film was made more than thirty years ago, it has dated well, despite the many advances in cinema technology that have occurred since then. Today the shark would probably be conjured up by CGI, but in 1975 Spielberg had to rely upon a mechanical model. As this model frequently malfunctioned, we do not, in fact, see the shark all that often, although this probably adds to the film's effectiveness by making the scenes in which it does appear all the more frightening. Also very effective is John Williams's simple but eerie theme tune; like Bernard Herrman's score for ""Psycho"" this demonstrates that the most effective film music is not always that which would sound best in the concert hall.Roy Scheider as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper play their parts well, but I have never really liked Robert Shaw's eccentric Quint. Although Quint does not actually have a wooden leg, a gold earring or a parrot squawking ""Pieces of Eight"", Shaw seems to have fallen victim to the curse of overacting which frequently afflicts film stars called upon to portray members of the seafaring profession. (He was much better in ""A Man for All Seasons"" and ""The Sting""). The film has other weaknesses; at times it appears improbable (could a shark really batter its way into an iron cage so easily?) and at others, particularly in the first half, overlong. Overall, however, ""Jaws"" is a reasonably good film, and in the second half, when the great shark hunt is under way, manages to be both thrilling and, at times, genuinely frightening.Nevertheless, I certainly would not agree with all those who have voted it into your top 100 films (it is currently at #97). It was only Spielberg's second feature film, and his first major success, and I suspect that its continuing popularity owes as much to its place in the Spielberg canon as it does to its intrinsic merits. I have never been an adherent of the quasi-religious Cult of the Great Director which has grown up around Spielberg; he has made some excellent films, notably the brilliant ""Schindler's List"", but these have normally been when he has tried to produce something of greater significance than the popcorn blockbusters which have constituted much of his output. ""Jaws"" is a well-made and exciting adventure film, but at the end of the day it is still only a B-movie made on an A-movie budget. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Spielberg's direction is exemplary, skillfully building tension through both the shark's menacing presence and the characters' interactions.The film is notable for its groundbreaking approach to the summer blockbuster, setting the standard for future films. The iconic score by John Williams adds to the suspense, making the theme synonymous with impending danger. The performances, particularly from Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss, are memorable and contribute to the film's enduring appeal.Overall, ""Jaws"" is a brilliant blend of great direction, compelling characters, and innovative storytelling, solidifying Spielberg's legacy as the creator of the modern blockbuster.",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure

One Spielberg's most greatest films.,"JAWS was excellent. And when I saw it I said it's probably like a dull film. But I was wrong this is one of Steven Spielberg's most greatest films ever made. He is now a favorite and hollywood legend now and has directed some of my other favorite films like JURASSIC PARK and AMISTAD. JAWS is about a shark that has been killing off people at a small town called Amity. Roy Scheidner plays the sheriff, Richard Dreyfuss plays the biologist, Lorriane Gary plays the sheriff's wife, Murray Hamilton plays the mayor, and Robert Shaw plays the salt greedy sailor. Susan Backlinie plays the first victim and her scene is now memorabile. My favorite part is were Roy Scheidner blows up the shark and says- Smile You Son Of A Bitch!Lee Fierro plays Mrs. Kintner then in JAWS THE REVENGE she plays her role again as a cameo. JAWS is my type of movie I stil enjoy the music from John Williams and Spielberg's direction changed movie business forever. Followed by JAWS 2, JAWS 3-D and JAWS THE REVENGE. [ I always here rumors about a JAWS 5?! ]and was also made with rip-offs- GRIZZLY, DAY OF THE ANIMALS, ORCA, ALLIGATOR, CROCODILE, DEEP BLUE SEA and MAKO. Rated PG.",,Anonymous,Adventure

Timeless and Classic,"Jaws must be considered both timeless and classic. Why? Watching this movie in 2021, 46 years after its release, the jumps, tension, and drama are still there. The film's impeccable pacing and taught script keep the viewer glued. The practical special effects hold up because CGI didn't exist back in 1975. They built a realistic mechanical shark and used it at all the right moments.
I remember seeing this movie in the theater. I wasn't even ten years old yet. My siblings and I begged our parents to take us. Jaws scared the crap out of me back then and remains the ultimate shark movie today.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Where's a killer whale when you need one?,"When a young woman's body is discovered in the water it is quickly determined that she has been killed as a result of a shark attack. Upon this discovery, police chief Martin Brody wants the beach to be closed down, but Amity Island mayor Vaughan isn't keen on this notion as he is worried about the impact on tourism. Shark hunter Quint offers to kill the shark for a large sum of money and with the assistance of Brody and oceanographic expert Hooper the men set out to sea to kill the shark, but trying to defeat one of the deadliest predators in the ocean proves challenging and is fraught with dangers even for experts such as Quint and Hooper...Jaws is an iconic film no question...for many years after its release it was responsible for many a man woman and child being too scared to go in to the water and its famous line uttered by Brody of ""You're gonna need a bigger boat"" has become legendary as being one of the most famous lines in the history of cinema. Jaws is also one of the first of what would become known as 'summer blockbusters' so its reputation very much proceeds it. Whilst Jaws is still a very good film and is a must see film I didn't quite enjoy it as much watching it again having not watched it for about 10 years...When the focus is on the shark and the terror that it is bringing to the island Jaws is a first-rate thriller; the shark is not revealed until quite late in the film meaning that the threat is always there and you never quite know when Jaws is going to strike. This creates tension and suspense within the film and it is these components that make the film enjoyable.Where I found Jaws to be slightly problematic was when the focus shifts away from the sea and back to dry land. It's fair to say that the politics that engulfs the first half of the film is not all that interesting and there are a good number of characters here that don't convey much in the way of interest either. There is one point when Brody, Quint and Hooper are a bit drunk and all have heart to hearts, but for me this went on for too long and took away from the tension and suspense that Spielberg had masterfully built up till this point.Working in the film's favour though is that fabulous score by John Williams (which in my opinion is one of the best scores that I've heard). As soon as you hear the strings of that cello you know trouble is never far away. The acting is generally good; Shaw and Dreyfuss reputedly hated one another and some of this hatred is well-conveyed by their characters on the screen.If you haven't seen Jaws then you owe it to yourself to see it as it is very good, but it's fair to say that watching it again it certainly has its slow spots and, for me, isn't quite the flawless masterpiece that many claim it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure

A teen writing an honest review on Jaws in 2023,"Jaws is a classic movie that everyone is familiar with. Before I begin, I just want to say how amazing these special effects are for 1975 and how realistic the shark looks. The casting is just brilliant and they really bring this film to life. Definitely one of the better shark movies I've watched. But then again, as a teenager in 2023 soon to be 2024 watching Jaws, I found it quite boring and long. There was a lot of talking and a lot of scenes were I thought personally didn't really have to be in the film. Originally, I thought there was going to be a lot more shark action but there were only extremely short snippets throughout the entire movie. Also, there's one part of the movie that I did not understand. Why did the man bash the radio with a baseball bat? It was an extremely confusing scene and was really unnecessary. What were the motives? They say it's a shark thriller when really, the shark is only on screen for about 10 or 15 minutes in the entire two hours and 10 minutes it's on. Anyway, Jaws is a great movie if you enjoy long and extensive films with some action. I definitely see why it is a classic, but don't see the hype about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Most overrated movie ever!,"A bunch of bland white men engage in 2 hours of boring conversation in which they manage to never show an emotion, other than aggression (even if their children just almost died), while they are trying to kill a living creature, without ever feeling an ounce of empathy. The music does not fit the feeling of the scenes half the time and these pathetic characters' attempt to one up each other in their toxic masculinity almost got my eyeballs stuck from all the rolling they had to do.
I really wanted the shark to eat all of their crusty asses.

Even when I first saw it on tv,   it was pretty frightening with the head coming out of the boat.   It left me feeling frightened for few nights afterwards.Nowadays, there are a lot of slasher graphic movies but no story or theme content.    The first JAWS movie had story and an issue (about how the mayor of amityville ignored the attack for the sake of seasonal tourism that make the town a profit) .

The watershed of Hollywood,"This was the first blockbuster ever made. An early hit by Spielberg, who would become the most popular director of his age. The inspirator of other cult movies, such as Alien (aka Jaws in space). It is one of the rare examples of a high-concept movie which is also worth studying. It is a social phenomenon.Admittedly it is not flawless, but it is so damn close. It's thrilling and scary with some comic reliefs. Seems familiar? Well yes, most action movies use this formula, but this was the original. The Shaw-Dreyfuss-Scheider trio is a blast to watch, and John Williams wrote a score still widely recognizable with two simple notes. This is Cinema in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Still hold up....more or less...,"Jaws was the original summer blockbuster movie. Its the story of a police chief who believes a shark is responsible for a number of unexplained deaths and his fight with a local mayor, who is worried that closing the resort to protect the public will destroy the local economy. 
However the action with the shark seems to have overtaken the rest of the narrative in many peoples minds due to the effectiveness of the shark scenes which terrified audiences at the time. Anyone who watched this movie in the past recalls the shark attacks but the main driver of the story, which was about officials arguing about financial survival versus public safety, is less well remembered. 
Many of the sequels of Jaws seemed to focus more on the shark action than narrative, which seems to have angered many of the fans of the original to the extent they have exaggerated how bad they sequels actually were. 
The thing is, the shark scenes, driven by the now famous score were only as effective as they were due to them having a shark which looked terrible on film. As a result its screen time was minimised which added to the air of menace. 
The cast in this movie is iconic. However many of the deaths come as less of a shock as they do in the second movie. In some cases not everyone who dies is a sympathetic character.....
Watching this movie in 2018, this is no longer a film which is as shocking as it would have been in 1975. Horror movies have moved on and this is now seen as more of a thriller than something that would deliver real scares. As such its viewed more in terms of being a decent quality movie with great characters but the effects etc may not scare your average cinema goer. Remember this was an A rating when it was released, it was then downgraded to a PG. It will likely still scare kids but adults not so much.
If you haven't already seen this movie where have you been? Its a genuine classic, just don't expect it to give you nightmares like it would have to audiences in the 70s.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
This was a great movie.,Honestly this movie was pretty amazing considering it was made it 1975. Jaws was a pretty good movie and I enjoyed watching this with my family. I think that Jaws should make a sequel movie. With better cast and crew. This movie had some scary moments and was pretty well put together. I really liked the beginning of the movie and the ending. There was some parts in this movie where it was pretty slow and unentertaining. I think this movie was pretty well acted out and that it was amazing for the time it was made.

"The original block buster, but more than that","The original block buster, but more than that, its a great film thats famous for a monster shark but is appreciated more for the rich performances, the cinematography that suits the mood and actions of the film very gracefully with an unforgetable film score to make one of the best films ever made, I only make that claim based off revisiting old films to see if they hold up, as I have grown up, I've actually come to enjoy this film the more times I have seen it.Its a classic and I think comes from a time when hollywood was more open to new ideas, with a director with a razor sharp vision who had to give the monster a backseat due to technical error to instead show off the nuanced and very greatly realised characters vivid lives and intentions fantastically realised on screen.This film is a rare gem among many others from this period in hollywood film making.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"""You're gonna need a bigger boat.""","This is not only one of the best films of the 1970s, but one of the best ever by legendary director Steven Spielberg.Not sure what I am going to say that likely has not been said countless times by other people on this site, but I will try. Right from the beginning of the film we are introduced to the setting and the shark through the use of John Williams' amazing, yet still simplistic score that has been copied or imitated numerous times when someone dips their toe into the water. We are also introduced to two young kids who are on the beach partying. They decide to go for a little swim. That is when we are really shown what this terrible monster in the water can do. Susan Backlinie really does an amazing job in this opening scene. It is from here that Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider in a fabulous role) is wanting to close the beach due to the death of the girl. Especially after Hooper (amazingly done by Richard Dreyfuss) an oceanographer states that it was a shark that killed her. Unfortunately, there is a great bit of resistance from the slimeball mayor (Murray Hamilton in a role that I will always remember him for). Until the deaths keep racking up. In steps Quint (wonderfully portrayed by Robert Shaw) a local shark hunter who offers his services for $10,000. So, the trio of Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw take Quint's boat to find and kill the shark.Now, the things that really makes this film work first off is the acting is beyond great. To me Scheider doesn't seem to really get enough credit due to the performances of both Dreyfuss and Shaw. All three of them were spectacular and really give the film more than enough fuel to make it to the final frame. My favourite scene in the whole picture is when the three of them are sitting around the table on Quint's boat after downing a few drinks. Both Dreyfuss and Shaw share stories about scars on their bodies until they come to the story about Quint during WWII being involved with a certain onslaught of sharks while he was in the water after his ship the USS Indianapolis was sunk. I find Quint's monologue scarier than anything else in the whole movie. Secondly as I mentioned earlier, the score is top notch and will forever be in your head. Thirdly, Steven Spielberg's ability to unweave the story on screen while not having you stare at a shark for half the movie wowing at it. No, he is setting up the scenes and driving home a fear that many of us would have if faced with the same life-altering challenges some of the characters face.Written for the screen by Carl Gottlieb (who has a role as Meadows in the film) and novelist Peter Benchley. I have read the novel and while it was okay and passable, in comparison to the film though it was teetering into a forgettable novel. Other than the shark that is. They took everything good from the novel and placed it into the film. They left a lot of the stuff I didn't really care for in the book completely out. Also starring Lorraine Gary who puts in a great performance as Brody's wife Ellen.If you haven't seen this movie, you have to watch it. A must-see for any fan of film in general. .",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Three Interesting Men,"As much as the shark suspense is key to ""Jaws,"" I've always been intrigued by the relationships among the three men who go to sea to kill the shark: Chief Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and Quint (Robert Shaw.)Each man is at odds with the other two.  Chief Brody, who is scared and useless on the open sea, is at odds with salty seafarer Quint and brainy shark expert Hooper.   Rich kid Hooper is at odds with working class heroes Chief Brody and Quint.  And the crazed Quint is at odds with the sane Chief Brody and Hooper.  Since each man lacks something the other two have, there is constant tension among them -- both comic and dramatic -- even as they must band together to stop the killer great white from killing them.I saw this with a giant crowd in the summer of '75 -- and went down to the beach after the matinee.  EVERYBODY was thinking about that movie. Everybody.A great movie -- and a better ""movie going memory"" of a long time ago.",,Anonymous,Adventure
Shark tale,"Okay look...a 7 is still positive, alright?Because there is a lot of...positive in this film. Spielberg directed it pretty well (although if I'm to be really honest, I do think he did a better job with Duel overall), the performances are all good, John Williams' score is blood-curdling to this day, and the second half or so on the boat is definitely better than the first half of the film......it's just that there really isn't much to it, is there? The plot is: there's a shark. The characters are: there's a shark, let's kill it. And while you can definitely boil Duel down to this level, if not even further (there's a truck, avoid it), three things make that film better to me. One: I thought Duel was quite a bit better directed. Two: it's shorter, so it doesn't feel like it wastes any time on its simple concept, and three: most importantly, it sets up its minimal plot, and then gets on with it. It doesn't spend an hour setting up a conflict between characters I frankly don't care about before getting to the good parts.And some of that set up in Jaws is definitely effective, some of it is funny, some of it is interesting, but none of that changes the fact that to me, the plot is way too simple to justify the film being this long, and I don't care at all about the characters. If nearly the whole film had been Brody, Quint and Hooper on the boat, much like how nearly all of Duel is about David in a car, then I might have liked it just as much.But for its second half, I was thinking I would probably give it the same rating as Duel, so it's doing something right. It's just that for all it does right, there's a few things that feel...not exactly done wrong, just not bothered with all that much.That said, anyone who used to find it unbelievable that the mayor would keep the beaches open with a 20ft shark swimming around...well, it's been two years since you were proven wrong, I'm sure Spielberg is taking written apologies by now.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Great storytelling,"Jaws succeeds in many ways, none more important than pure storytelling brilliance. I believe this is missing in so much of today's cinema. Everything seems rushed in modern films, and when a film does get back to the roots of telling a proper story (this takes time) people complain that it is too slow.Let's take the way Spielberg sets up the beach scene for example. There was one to two minutes of establishing beach-goer shots. If this film was made today I believe 80-90% of that would be removed to ""speed up"" the story and we would be left with a single establishing shot of the water/beach then jump right into the scene. Instead we are treated to a montage of real people enjoying their day at the beach. This sets the realism of the scene; it does not feel like a film set with paid extras walking in their choreographed patterns given to them moments before ""Action!""The town feels like a real place with real people dealing with a simple, yet serious, situation and it is done masterfully. I wish films today were still made with this kind of passion and integrity.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

One of the most polarising films of the Decade,"Incredibly well crafted, put together film. With a great score.Plot,I like how the plot is simple yet so effective. The Characters are well developed. And have great onscreen chemistry between them. And the jump Scares are generally creepy. And dark screening makes for a more crisp and grounded film. Under water playing on people's fear of the water. I love how the shark is hardly in the movie creating for a more suspenseful film. With an interesting dynamic between the cast and wonderful dark scenes. Now onto the Music.Music,Which is fantasticly unnerving and eerie. The film has a brilliant credit scene being one of my favourites as the brilliant Iconic music plays out. John Williams score is truly epic. And creates for a more tense and overall atmospheric story. Which is personally for me why I love it. And the Jump Scares work well because of the music for me. Now time for the Direction/effects analysis.Direction/Special effects,Let's start with the effects. Which still holds up to day. The Shark however isn't so great but it's bearly in the Movie. And the Direction they take under water is dark. Creating for a more immersive and atmospheric creature feature. And for me I love it, the fact it's more gritty and makes the film more interesting for me. I love the film. And would recommend it to anyone.Also after all these years, and yet it's still holds up as a classic. And not only that but is still the best Shark feature we've gotten after all these years which still amazes me to this day. The Characters are so well layered Creating for a more interesting story. And lots of dark themes that elevate this fantastic film. Has it aged well? Most definitely and I can't stop praising the films brilliance. Feeling more natural and a well made put together film.

Think like a shark,"I agree with almost all of the positive comments about this film.  The Williams score is near perfect in adding to the suspense and is even better during the less suspenseful if not downright fun and exhilarating scenes. The film is, however, very suspenseful and the relationship story among the three lead characters and how they have to learn to tolerate and work with one another is tremendous.  Far better than any other variety of mismatched partner story lines. They all have very different motivations for doing what they are doing.  Quint: Revenge. Brody: to protect others. Hooper: to study and understand.  Yes, it's scary and largely so because Spielberg cleverly refrains from showing us too much.  What is missing from all of the comments that I have read here is that one of the things that the viewer finds himself doing is trying to figure out what the shark is thinking...  It's behavior gives it so much personality that we try to understand its motives. It's not a monster.  It's the fourth member of the cast and its motivations are not at all clear.  That's what makes it so scary.  The DTS DVD should be a treat.",,Anonymous,Adventure

"Honestly boring and overrated, fear factor saved it","So like I said in the title, Jaws is pretty overrated.

Fear Bites Deep,"Jaws is the OG blockbuster that still slaps 50 years later. Spielberg basically wrote the playbook on how to make a killer movie with budget limitations. No fancy CGI? No problem. By keeping the shark mostly hidden-just a fin here, a toothy close-up there-he turned the ocean itself into a villain. Half the terror is in your own head, and that's genius. The story's anchored by Chief Brody's everyman panic (shoutout to Roy Scheider's sweaty, wide-eyed charm), making you feel every gut-punch of dread.Yeah, the editing's straightforward-no flashy cuts-but that iconic dolly zoom shot when Brody realizes the shark's attacking? Chef's kiss. It's not just about a fish eating people, though. The movie sneaks in sharp jabs at small-town greed (mayors prioritizing cash over corpses), the clash between book-smart scientists and salty sea-dog Quint, and the haunting scars of war. Quint's monologue about the USS Indianapolis? Chilling stuff.Is it perfect? Nah. The mechanical shark looks cheesy by today's standards, and some subplots feel rushed. But Jaws nails the big idea: true horror isn't the monster-it's how humans react to it. The shark's just the catalyst; the real chaos is our greed, fear, and fragile egos.

Review of the Film Jaws by a 10-Year-Old,"I am 10 years old, and I've never seen such an exciting movie before. I saw the film with my father.What I liked most was how well the technology worked despite the film's age.The action scenes were very thrilling, especially the part where the shark eats someone.I also thought the music was amazing-it made the movie even more intense.I was never bored; the film quickly pulls you in.There was one underwater scene that really scared me-it's about a head that suddenly appears.I would recommend this movie to other kids, but it's not suitable for everyone.It's best for kids who are already 11-12 years old.A fantastic movie I won't forget anytime soon.10 out of 10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
A classic thriller that still bites,"""Jaws"" (1975), directed by Steven Spielberg, remains a benchmark in the thriller genre. The story centers on a small beach town terrorized by a massive great white shark, leading the town's police chief (Roy Scheider), a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss), and a grizzled shark hunter (Robert Shaw) to embark on a perilous quest to kill the beast.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to build suspense. Spielberg masterfully uses John Williams' iconic score and clever camera work to create an atmosphere of dread without showing the shark too often. This approach intensifies the fear of the unseen menace lurking beneath the waves.The performances are strong, with Shaw's portrayal of the hardened Quint standing out. The dynamic between the three main characters adds depth to the story, balancing the terror with moments of camaraderie and conflict.While ""Jaws"" is a groundbreaking film, it has some pacing issues, particularly in the middle act, where the story slows down. Additionally, the special effects, though impressive for their time, can feel dated.Overall, ""Jaws"" remains a thrilling ride, combining suspense, strong performances, and an unforgettable musical score to create a lasting impact on viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
The Movie That Changed Cinema,"Jaws, one of the most iconic, shark thriller movies of all time this movie invented summer blockbusters. With Jose receiving $476.5 million in the box office with only a budget of 9 million. Steven Spielberg put his all to make this movie to what it is with him using his own money to help make this film to his image. No, we can all talk about the shark, not looking realistic, but the shark barely appears this movie with making you have to use your imagination to make the shark to your horrifying image. Jaws has probably one of the most iconic theme songs. John Williams song plays an amazing part of this movie. This movie is one of my personal favorite movies. If you haven't watched this movie yet, what are you doing? You need to watch this movie you need to. Though I will warn you some people that have watched this movie can never go back in the water because of it. So go watch the movie I promise you'll either leave entertained or terrified.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Watching this film again has left a bad taste in my mouth and reminded me why I don't like 'creature horrors',"""I truly, and to this day, regret the decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film. I really, truly regret that,"" Spielberg said during an interview. This is one of those moments when someone realises that they used the power they had for something awful; in this case the genocide of sharks as a direct result of this film. The number of large sharks in the waters east of North America declined by about 50 percent shortly after the release of this film. Pretty sure it caused damage in other parts of the world as well. Perhaps, it could've been avoided if the film had the right message, instead of demonising the entire species of sharks. When a marine biologist (who says he loves sharks) is happy to see trophies of dead animals and is excited about killing them, instead of educating people and informing them that we're a much, MUCH, bigger threat for sharks than the other way round, you know something is wrong.",2.0,Anonymous,Adventure

"For me it is Spielberg's greatest moment, but it had an unfortunate side effect","The beach resort town of Amity Island has a spate of shark attacks and police chief Brody battles with civic authorities and local businesses over how to deal with the situation.Jaws is a classic film of the late twentieth century that (along with Star Wars) pretty much invented the modern blockbuster by combining a simple story with clearly defined characters, high production values and lots of entertaining spectacle.The story is a simple as it gets. A great big unseen leviathan is striking fear into heart of a community and a group of heroes go on a mission to save everyone. It contains a number of interesting underlying themes such as the threat of capitalism, mistrust of authorities, class conflict and the manifestation of fear. These are all shown during the interactions between various characters.There are a number of classic scenes such as the infamous opening attack sequence, the numerous beach scenes, the wreck dive and pretty much the entirety of the final seafaring chapter. My personal favourite is when Brody, Quint and Hooper bond over a few drinks aboard the Orca and Robert Shaw delivers one epically good monologue.The shark scenes are ingeniously put together. Most of the terror is unseen and translated through John Williams' famous theme and the reaction of people. When we do see the shark it does look fake but the movie is so well edited that I easily suspended my disbelief.All performances are top drawer. Roy Schneider is terminally stressed but electric as Brody. Lorraine Gary is naturalistic as Ellen Brody and the two have great husband and wife chemistry. Richard Dreyfuss is full of cocky, youthful exuberance as Hooper. Robert Shaw is perfect as the cynical, working class, sea-dog Quint. Murray Hamilton is an edgy, frustrating antagonist as Mayor Larry Vaughn.Jaws is a product of its time and a clear downside to the movie was its impact on people's perception of sharks. That coupled with an unfortunate rise in the amount of sharks hunted following its release is a sad indictment of the human race. This for me somewhat tinged the legacy of a near masterpiece from Spielberg.That being said it is a movie I never tire of watching and is as effective today as it has ever been. For me it's one of the few movie adaptations of a novel that is superior to its source material.It's a 9.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
A VERY well done flick.,"This is a truly great movie. The idea that something so simple as a shark can terrorize an entire community and drive the citizens to such drastic measures is pure genius. For the JAWS guru, it's really about more than a shark that swims around and eats people; it is a perfect machine, too cunning in its natural instincts to make a decision between good and evil; in the shark's mind, there is only food. The fact that it can so easily outwit some of the most skilled men is fascinating and at the same time terrifying. Even without the plot, this is still a fantastic movie. The cinematography is excellent (anyone who remembers the head popping out of the boat can attest to that), and the use of camera angles instead of actually showing the shark (until the last few scenes) is a brilliant idea.The acting was one of the best uses of method acting since Bogey left the screen,which worked out quite well. One of the best examples of this can be seen in Robert Shaw's account of the sinking of the Indianapolis, which was mostly ad-libbed. Also, before JAWS, there were not any good movies (generally) that came out in the summer; JAWS was the first of the summer blockbusters, bringing in almost $260,000,000 in its first year. With its great plot, bang-up acting and terrific cinematography, this flick is definitly one of the essentials for any avid moviewatcher's repertoire.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Jaws,"A shark is terrorising a beach resort leading up the 4th July. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) helped out by oceanographer Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), must hire grizzled shark fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to catch the creature.Divided pretty neatly into 2, with the first half looking at the violent attacks and the conflict in closing the beaches in a tourist town desperate for 'summer dollars', with the second half the hunt. It remains Spielberg's best film, a sublime thriller, full of humour and terrifying thrills supporting a terrifically exciting story held together by 3 great performances and the famous Williams' score. There are so many scenes and lines that have passed into cinema history - Chrissie, 'you're gonna need a bigger boat', USS Indianapolis, 'drowning' - the list is endless.

Good shark film...,"Robert Shaw's fingernails on the chalk board at the town meeting was the perfect way of introducing Amity's potential savior. What he might not have known about rogue shark mentality and territorial behavior is provided by Richard Dreyfuss' character, derided by Captain Quint as a mere college boy, but with enough sea smarts to know that this could be the big one. Boy, was it!I forgot about the dead sailor in the hull of the boat discovered by Hooper (Dreyfuss). It's still one of those unexpected 'oh s---' moments in movies that works even after the gimmick has been played out countless times since. What's remarkable about the film is it's ability to convey unspeakable horror in a way that doesn't get in your face. The opening scene is a perfect example, but how about when that patrolman's leg gets lopped off in the water and slowly floats down to the sea floor - the stuff nightmares are made of.Filmed in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard in the fictional town of Amity, the picture also explores the crass commercialism of summer tourism winning out over safety concerns. Murray Hamilton's Mayor Vaughn is a master of the spin machine that successfully lures the crowds to the beach on the Fourth of July, right before the fireworks break loose. The beach reporter on the scene is none other than Peter Benchley, who wrote the novel and screenplay.When I saw this movie when it first came out, I recall doing an 'aw c'mon' when Brody shoots the cylinder in the shark's mouth sending it to fish heaven. But you know what, it might have been luck, but it certainly wasn't for lack of trying. It took Brody six shots before connecting with the big bang; just in time too since he was going down with the ship. Did anyone else besides me forget about Hooper in all the excitement until he surfaced to hook up with Brody after the fish fry?",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"What a Perfect spin on ""Moby Dick""","Having watched Spielberg's films for decades, his work is predictable and full of white people and cliche.However, he remains one of the best directors - ever, and this film conveys why.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
What a great play on the monster movies that many of us grew up with, from ""The Mummy"" to ""Moby Dick.""Yes, this story is in the spirit of the latter, but is it's own unique tale. No film, no sequel, comes anywhere close
to this story. Frankly, it has it all.ACTING:
What a perfect blending of the three lead actors. While they all uniquely contributed as only each could, Shaw
stands out as he assumes such an ""Ahab"" like character so well. I'm citing Shaw because I've seen him in so many
films, and this demonstrates some stretch for him. Kudos.ENTERTAINMENT:
Moderate to high valueTEMPO:
Great pace throughout with ebb and flow end-to-end, though it exudes Spielberg's climax-building signature (not a fan).CINEMATOGRAPHY:
PerfectDIRECTING / WRITING:
Director: I have a love / hate with his work. On one hand his work is often soaked in cliche and is as ""white"" as can be.On the other, he's so technically gifted and ... and ... consistently so, which is the hallmark of a great director.Writers: Clearly, this was a ""one hit and quit"" (420 reference) for both writers.

Still holds up,"I only remembered this movie from my childhood on video, but it is out in IMAX for a limited period, so had to check it out. This movie still holds up. Funny to see how times have changed, they can't warn people because the phone is out for example :D The practical effects are still really cool, especially considering it's 47 years old now.

Grand entertainment that holds up well,"I've seen this many times starting when it was released in 1975, but I hadn't seen it in a couple of decades or more. The opening sequence is just as exciting as it was then as are the dock scene and the major beach scene, but the bottom line is that the film holds up very well despite some silliness now and then. As Spielberg has said many times, the importance and effectiveness of the simplistic musical score by John Williams cannot be overemphasized! It's based on a very bad book that was radically restructured and it's production problems have been well documented over the years. That it is among the biggest success stories of all time is stunning considering all that went wrong during it's making. The second half of the film takes place on an old boat hunting for the shark in question and it is very exciting too, but I do like the first half of the movie better. There isn't any great acting involved in this, though Richard Dreyfuss is fun and the others do what they're supposed to do. At one time this was the biggest money maker in North American film history. In case you should be a newbie to this, be aware that the sequels go from bad to worse. To this day I find it amazing that this was Oscar nominated for best picture but not for director?! In a perfect world, both should have been nominated, but if it could only have one or the other, it should have been the other way around.",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure

A memorable Spielberg film,"Jaws was a huge success in the Box Office, 2 years before Star Wars past it's record.The story is about a regular beach that's never had any serious accidents.

The ones who volunteer are a police lifeguard, a shark expert, and Quint an expert in fishing. These 3 unlikely characters will be spending the next few days at sea trying to hunt down the shark and kill it.Jaws will change the way you think of Great White sharks, and it may give you the fear of swimming in the ocean.

A masterpiece,"One could write a review about how much this film made Steven Spielberg a star. One could also write a review as to how it shaped a generation, and future generations into distrusting the water, or ruined the holiday trade. However, this review is about the chemistry Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss provided to make this film one of the greatest of all time.The scene where they're inside the cabin at night, drinking and comparing battle scars, is one of the true examples of cinematic gold. Especially Robert Shaw's monologue concerning his experience on the USS Indianapolis. That being said, Richard Dreyfuss, at that time still a relative newcomer also, in my opinion, helps to create an atmosphere one finds hard to disbelieve isn't real-life. It is one of those scenes which you can watch time and again and never get bored. Absolute perfection.I truly hope that a production company never tries to remake this classic, as they'd fail miserably. No one could replace Robert Shaw or Roy Scheider, and Richard Dreyfuss would logically refuse taking any part in it.Jaws is a masterpiece of suspense, character acting, script writing and direction. For those who've never seen it, make sure it's on your bucket list. And even if you've seen it, make sure you watch a 1080p or higher resolution version to make it just the more magical.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

3 Oscar wins (Editing, Original music score, sound mixing); nominated for Best Picture.This movie was made 45 years ago and I just watched it for the first time. I have known about it for many years and finally decided to watch it since it is regarded as an excellent shark movie.I LOVE shark movies and I have ever since I watched Deep Blue sea in theaters in 1999 as a kid, which I have re-watched twice.Anyway, I think this was a good movie, but nowhere as good as Deep Blue Sea (1999). But this film was actually a very solid work and overall well-made. Steven Spielberg (my favorite director) did a great job. The CGI people did an amazing job with the shark - it was so real and it looked absolutely amazing.The plot was simple and yet effective. The plot was written in a realistic manner, which I appreciated. A realistic shark plot worked.The cast was fine. Richard Dreyfuss (Hopper) I think had the best performance.Roy Scheider (Chief Brody) had some decent performances but later only gave very flat scenes, especially at the end. Very flat and mediocre acting at the end.Robert Shaw (Quint) had a pretty average performance.The supporting cast did acceptable, although completely forgettable.Moreover, this movie had more flaws, aside from the acting issues.The triumphant orchestra music when the protagonists were haunting the shark was extremely inappropriate. The orchestra in general was so bad it knocked down 1 Star from my review. I cannot believe the orchestra music won an Oscar.Also, there were scenes in the last quarter of the film that did not have dialogue when something would happen and I thought that that was inappropriate and unrealistic. Any normal person would be swearing and verbally reacting to anything that goes wrong and talking to themselves in such a bad situation. Instead there is no dialogue. What is even worst, the acting at the end was totally inappropriate and unbelievable - I mean if you are in the water alone with a 25-foot long 6,000 lb. great white shark, it does not make sense for you to have a fearless face and not say a word? These two things cost the movie two stars. This was completely unrealistic. It is common sense. You would naturally be absolutely HORRIFIED of such a shark and mumble things to yourself, but definitely you would not be completely fearless! The actor Roy Scheider failed and the Steven Spielberg failed too. How can you forget common sense?Another issue is with the last scene - there was a missed opportunity to create absolute horror for the audience, which a shark is supposed to make anyone feel The fight should have been taken into the water - there is nothing more horrifying than knowing you are in the water with a 25-foot 6,000 lb. great white shark under you. But instead, the character is in a safe spot and to make things worst, with a completely fearless face. I, the viewer, never felt the horror that I should have felt, that the director should have made me feel. This is a failure from the director and the actor. Extremely disappointed.Conclusion: it is a good movie, but I do not think it deserves such a high reputation. Maybe it was the first shark movie done right, but it is nowhere near as good as Deep Blue Sea (1999). Nevertheless, it is still a good movie that deserves a watch since it was mostly properly made from start to finish, although with some flaws.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Good film,"Good film. T is very much a film of two halves; the first land based as Brody tries to get the town authorities to take the shark seriously and the second out at sea as Brody, Quint and Hooper hunt down the shark. These three, brilliantly played by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss respectively, are great characters and the scenes between then on the boat are a delight; sometimes tense, sometimes funny and, when Quint tells the story of what happened when the USS Indianapolis was sunk positively chilling. The shark effects are pretty impressive, only in the final scenes does in took a bit rubbery; of course it helps that we aren't shown too much of the shark early on. The music, by John Williams, is great not just the famous 'shark theme' but also the other music. There are plenty of scary moments throughout the film; some at least as frightening as horror films largely because of its familiar setting and the fact that even though shark attacks are rare we all know that they do occasionally happen.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Spielberg's Best Movie,"There's something terrifying about open water that has etched itself upon the human psyche . Undoubtedll this is because our natural survival instincts tell us to keep away from it . We can't see , hear or smell what's under the waves and we can't breathe in water either and anything that can has got one over on us . Why do you think there's been so many legends about sea monsters ? And the success of JAWS is entirely down to the way that it exploits mans fear of the seaThe great thing about this movie is how focused it is , Spielberg's cut out all the crap from the book like the politics of the town , and the sexual subplots and made the ending truly climatic . Compare this film version to Peter Benchley's BEAST which is basically the same story where a greedy capitalist is in denial , an obsessive boatman tries to catch the monster etc the only real difference is that BEAST features a giant squid as the monster . You would probably be correct in arguing that JAWS is the only time when a film adaptation actually improves over the source novelSadly at the age of 28 the then unknown Steven Sielberg seems to have reached his creative peak . True EMPIRE OF THE SUN , SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN may contain more artistic achievements but JAWS is certainly a more consistent movie that's difficult to fault . The only time there's any disappointment is when the eponymous shark appears in the last segment of the movie . It's obviously a giant animontronic model of some kind and since Spielberg has spent so much time using very effective suspense like the soundtrack and the shark's POV for much of the running time the on screen revelation is unfortunately going to be a disappointmentBut let's not talk about minor disappointment and just admire what the director has given us here . We know that someone is going to get chewed up on the crowded beach so Spielberg teases us . A fat woman walks past the screen and the audience snigger "" I bet she'd make a good meal for the shark "" so everyone in the audience puts money on Mrs Obesity being eaten , especially when she's surrounded by cute kids because cute kids never get eaten in movies . ooopppps I spoke too soon . Perhaps the reason it is a good film is because Spielberg has ignored convention , certainly we don't get drowned in sentiment or family life , unlike say THE TERMINAL or ET . Non existent are the other Spielberg faults like overlong shot duration , here everything is shot in a very snappy manner and the movie is quite rightly regarded as a classic fright fest",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Quite Possibly the Best Monster Movie of All-time!,"Jaws is, and probably will always be, the film in which truly defines a blockbuster. Of course unlike many modern day blockbusters, Jaws had something more than just action and suspense; it was chock full of likable, three-dimensional characters, and it had this magical touch that could simply be explained if one only looks to the film's director, Steven Spielberg.The premise of Jaws is one that if you were simply told about as opposed to seeing it, you would probably laugh your head off. I mean how could you make a film about a gigantic great white shark preying on the inhabitants of a beachside town a serious and engaging movie? Well Mr. Spielberg knew how. First he made the smart decision to make all of the characters in the film three-dimensional, then he cast terrific actors to pull off the magnificent roles. Robert Shaw truly shines as Quint, but Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are no slouches either. Of course where Spielberg's true mastery comes through was in his decision to not show the shark until the movie was almost over. Yeah you'd see a fin here and a tail there, but the full shark was never exposed until the end. This made the film feel more tense and threatening, because lets face it, the mechanical shark looks pretty fake. Still, applying the classic Hitchcockian principal of the viewer is more afraid of what they don't see, Spielberg was able to craft a film that still stands tall as one of the best films of all-time.When one gets off the amusement park ride which is the film Jaws, you feel as if you just went on one of the most thrilling rides of your life. For this reason alone Jaws is one of my favorite films.I give Jaws a perfect 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

I got home after midnight to find the police from the 105th precinct waiting with my Mom on my stoop...I was grounded for the next month. I got smart though...I sneaked out to see it 15-20 more times...during the day.I have most likely watched this movie more than 500-600 times over the past 25 years ( since I got my first VCR ) It never gets old to me. I can recite every line including the background characters at a moments notice.There are so many reasons why this is a great movie ( got robbed at the Oscars ), but I have a question for Mr.Spielberg?? ... The scene with ""holiday roast"" a. you have 20 feet of dock b. you have 25 feet of chain & c. you have 25 feet ( 3 tons of 'em )of shark. Here's my ?? The man is swimming for his life ( ""take my word, Charlie. Don't look back! Swim Charlie ! Swim!!"" ) The dock is chasing him. To get that full torque the chain would have to be fully extended.

""" You're   Gonna   Need   a   Bigger   Boat ""","According to his own recollection, novelist Peter Benchley stated he considered his story involving a huge shark attacking beach swimmers several years before the movie. When the book came out, Steven Spielberg first thought it would make for a good scary movie. That was before he became aware of all the technical problems involved. At one point he hated the project and anything having to do with it. To his credit, he finished the difficult film and it became a true Classic in it's own right. The actual story is based on the 1916 account of New Jersey beach goers being attacked and devoured by a real life shark. It is no surprise, when you see the film ""Jaws"" be prepared for some unexpected shock scenes. There are several which if you're seeing it in the dark room, at night or alone, you'll find yourself seeking company, comfort or a large weapon. To my way of thinking, it is the actors who imbue the film with such artistic reality, they cause audiences to re-consider going swimming in the ocean. Spielberg did an excellent job in finding Roy Scheider to play, land loving Police Chief Martin Brody. Robert Shaw is superb as Quint and his ' USS Indianapolis story' makes for mental horror. Youthful newcomer Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as Matt Hooper, the 'professional' shark expert. Murray Hamilton plays the fiscally stubborn Mayor Larry Vaughn. Together the cast add their personal signature to this incredible film and place it on the shelves of the finest movies ever made. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Nice Job Spielster,"This was when I liked Mr. Spielberg's movies. Jaws was an original movie that gave us suspense, entertainment, and a little bit of fear when going ocean swimming. The Spielster filmed some of ""Jaws"" in Australia where great white sharks are a regular feature on the beaches. The sharks never swim between the flags though so you are safe there.Some movies don't age, although unfortunately for ""Jaws"" the special effects cause it to age quite quickly. I won't hold this against the Spielster though, with ""Jaws"" he came out with a classic.A well earned 7.5 out of 10 for the Spielster this time.",8.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Steven Spielberg at his best,"Every summer thousands of visitors go to a small beach-side town of Amity to get some rest and relaxation in the sun and sand. But one summer, the summer of '75 a new visitor comes to the bech an enormous man-eating great white shark. Brody (ROY SCHEIDER) a former big city cop and now the local sheriff, finds the remains of a college girl and orders the beaches closed. Mayor Vaughan (MURRAY HAMILTON) and other city officials, however, rescind that order for fear of what it will do to the town's tourism. Brody and his wife Ellen (LORRAINE GARY) don't think that was the right thing to do and worry about the safety of their two boys. After several more people are killed by the shark, though, Brody closes the beaches and brings in Hooper (RICHARD DREYFUSS), an oceanographic expert, to help find the shark. In the end, however, they need Quint (ROBERT SHAW), the local, grizzled ""old man of the sea"" to hunt down and kill the shark. The three men then head out into open waters and bait, and wait, for their encounter with the dangerous shark. One of the great box-office hits of all time is also one of the best horror films in the last few decades. Spielberg's classic shark story, based on Peter Benchley's novel, kept millions out of the water during the summer of '75. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and the great Robert Shaw go shark hunting off the New England coast and find Melvillian adventure. A classic combination of suspense, effects, editing, cinematography, score and bristling characterizations. The movie that was supposed to be 1975's biggest flop, but instead it has become a classic thriller. This film briefly turned all of those actors into big stars, and for the next few years they headlined many of biggest released movies.From John Williams unforgettable score to Spielberg's unmatched directorial talent, Jaws is grand entertainment.",,Anonymous,Adventure
In the Shark-fin Soup,"Spielberg's big commercial breakthrough followed up his earlier ""Duel"" with another often invisible, inhuman murderous thing wreaking havoc in its path.Of course, this time, as opposed to a hulking juggernaut of a lorry, we get a hulking juggernaut of a great white shark.The special effects are great with the animatronic shark genuinely scary and Spielberg certainly knows how to jolt the audience out of their seats especially when the monster jumps out at the screen although the worst moment has to be that rolling head!The weakest part of the film for me was the small-town politics we witness when not only one but two young people become the shark's first victims and the commerce v public safety argument is posited, as if the beach wouldn't be closed down immediately such a tragedy occurred. I also felt the film dragged in the middle section with all that male bonding stuff among shark-hunter Quint, marine scientist Hooper and police chief Brody, the three madmen who go out on their own in pursuit of the great white.Did I believe that the shark had the brains to effectively stalk their boat and almost seemed to be luring them into a trap? Of course not, no more I could an inanimate articulated lorry, but once you grant Spielberg his artistic licence, just strap yourself in for the ride and in particular the last thirty minutes.I liked the way Spielberg teased the audience with various false alarms, nodding to Hitchcock and Eisenstein's techniques as he builds up the tension, before the shark reappears or turns up in unexpected places. The action set-pieces are terrific especially when Hooper crazily enters his submersible cage to take on big-tooth, plus no mention of this movie can pass without reference to John Williams' inspired music, in its way every bit as memorable as Bernard Herrman's was for ""Psycho"".Probably the smartest move Spielberg ever made was walking away from the host of no doubt tempting but reportedly dismal cash-in sequels that followed. Here though, he left us one of the enduring shock-horror movies of all time and no doubt implanted that lingering doubt in all of us that we just can't shake whenever we take to the water on even the calmest beach...",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Jaws still lurks in the waters,"This is the mother of all shark movies. Still standing the test of time since it was made, Jaws is a solid gold classic. I have had this on video and DVD many times now, but every time i see it on TV I always end up watching it. It is a film that has universal appeal (no pun intended). By now everyone should know the story a killer Great White Shark is chowing down on the small town inhabitants of the peaceful Amity and the Police Chief Martin Brody must find a way to stop it. Right from those terrifying (Spielberg found the tune silly when John Williams played it for him, later it would become the theme that would strike fear into film-goers hearts and still do to this day) opening scenes with THAT music immediately instills the fear into you. To tell the truth i have never been swimming in any sea since i saw this movie, purely because like its depicted in this film, you don't know whats under you. This is a gem of a film as it still has the power that it had many years ago and still terrifies the new generation. Spielberg did a wonderful job capturing the magic of Benchley's novel. A lot of people slag off the ending even benchley didn't like the way that Spielberg scripted the shark dying. I say think about this without that scene Scheider would never have had the opportunity to say that great line ""smile you son of a....."" If you haven't seen Jaws then where the hell have you been, you have missed a great film. The shark breaking down during the film was great because then Spielberg gave us the POV of the shark as it's about to attack. If he had of had the shark to begin with it probably would have never worked, thank god he didn't. There's something about the view of the shark that more scary than seeing the shark. Maybe it's cause you know it's going to kill someone, or it could be the fact that Spielberg makes the audience think that for brief moments WE are the shark. The film should have got an Oscar for not only Editing (which it did) but for Roy Scheider for best actor, Richard Dreyfuss as Supporting Actor and Spielberg as best Director because it deserves it. When you do finally see Jaws, you do jump and if the shark had been seen earlier, i believe that, the scene on the boat would have lost it's shock value. All in all Jaws boasts some great performances from all the key players and yes even to ""Bruce"". This is also the only Jaws film where the shark was believable and not rubber looking like the sequels. I'm not so sure that it would still work if a CGI was integrated into the film or if they do a remake, the power is behind the eyes and thats exactly where i should stay.""I think you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bite you on the ass""",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
My All Time Favorite,"I love this movie!  I don't think anyone could love it more.  I can't understand why Spielberg hates it so much...I realize that the filming was hell (trust me, I've read up on everything about this movie) but there 's such magic up there on the screen, esp. when Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw get together.  I could watch it over and over and know it by heart (my husband will occasionally come in and see in on TBS/TNT and say, ""Not again !"" before leaving the room in disgust).  Sure, Spielberg has gone on to bigger and better things (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List) but nothing tops ""Jaws"" in my book!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
It's a 70's classic,"I was 9 or 10 when this came out, I didn't see it until it came out on TV years later. It's still a good watch, but, this has always bothered me. The shark kills several people right off the beach, but when our heroes decide to go after it, they go way out to sea to kill it. Wasn't it just off the beach?

A classic shark attack flick.,"This movie put me on the edge of my seat while I was watching it, before there was Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, Jurassic Park, Minority Report, War of the Worlds, Indiana Jones, etc. There was Jaws, a classic killer shark movie with everything with it.Its based on the novel by Peter Benchley.It stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Murray Hamilton, Lorraine Gray, etc.Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is the new police chief of Amity, an island resort town somewhere in New England. He has a wife named Ellen, and two sons named Michael and Sean. On a Summer morning, Brody is called to the beach, where the mangled body of Summer vacationer Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backlinie) has washed ashore. The medical examiner tells Brody that it could have been a shark that killed Watkins. Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who is desperate to not lose the money that will be brought in by 4th of July tourists, wants Brody to say Watkins's death was caused by a motorboat propeller instead of a shark, because the thought of a shark in Amity's waters would drive tourists away from Amity. It looks like Vaughn is a mayor who puts money ahead of people's lives. Shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) believes Watkins was killed by a shark. Hooper is proved right a few days later, when Alex Kintner is killed by the shark that killed Watkins. Looking for the quickest solution, Vaughn tells all of the local fishermen to let him know if they see the shark. A shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to find the shark and kill it, but Vaughn thinks Quint's price of $10,000 is too high. When a tiger shark is killed and hauled in by a couple of boaters, Vaughn hastily says that the shark crisis is over, but Hooper says the shark that's been killing people a huge great white shark is still in Amity's waters, but Vaughn leaves the beaches opened because all he cares about is the 4th of July tourist money. On the 4th of July, Vaughn encourages people to swim at the beach, and Hooper is proved right again when the shark kills a man, biting the man's leg off. Michael, who was in the water at the time of the attack, is taken to the hospital, where he's treated for shock after watching the shark kill the guy. Brody asks Vaughn to hire Quint to find the shark. Because his own kids were at that beach too, Vaughn agrees to hire Quint to find the shark. Quint, Hooper, and Brody are sent out to sea in Quint's boat, the Orca, ready to do whatever it takes to find the shark.Nothing beats the original Jaws with the sequels that came out.John Williams musical score was fantastic, he also did the music for Star Wars, ET, Jurassic Park, etc.Overall, this movie is just another movie you should see.Jaws gets 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
My Favorite Movie of All Time,"Jaws is, hands down, my favorite movie of all time. The reason for this is simple, I own Jaws, I have seen Jaws about 100 times, and still Jaws is the only movie that no matter how many times I see it; it still makes me feel the same as the first time I saw it. The directing and acting, in particular Robert Shaw, are flawless. I would argue that no movie has ever had the immediate horrific impact on a viewing public as much as Jaws. The film spurned a shark kill that has never, thank God, been duplicated. It was banned from sea-side communities on both the Atlantic and Pacific side of America. This movie made you afraid of something you did last summer. (no pun!) The chemistry that the cast had is something that I have never seen recreated. The whole Community of Amity, even the background players, flowed so natural I would believe Amity was a town I had visited as a child. If you have never seen this gem get on it now. 100 years from Jaws will still be a vital part of American cinema despite how many new movies may be ""more popular"".

Good movie but...maybe slightly overrated?,"I just bought a Jaws blu-ray and watched it yesterday. I have first seen the movie in the late 90s when it was on tv so it has the chance of childhood nostalgia...which it has a little bit but...I don't know. This time it wasn't as good as I hoped it to be. I had this optimistic look that maybe the movie is even better than I remember but it didn't do any new tricks.The movie starts with pretty small budget as we only see people on the beach that are occasionally attacked by the shark. This slowly builds tension but it isn't as spectacular as a film of this caliber (its fame) should be. The best part starts only later when the three main characters head to the sea to hunt down the shark. This adds more adventurous and thrilling atmosphere.There are two moments in the film that are legendary classic to me (and probably to everybody else): the corpse in the sunken boat, and the night on the fishing boat when the captain is telling tales of his past. As a whole the movie is not bad but these are the moments that I looked forward and those were still the most effective.Overall: Jaws is not going to my top-favorites and I think its legendary fame may be a little bit exaggerated. But it's still an interesting and exciting film, so if you haven't seen it I recommend seeing it. But don't pay too much. Try to grab some special offer.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Jaws is an Example of a True Masterpiece in Cinema,"Everything from the filmmaking, to the storytelling, and the MUSIC is fantastic. Despite all the problems that occurred while making it, Jaws is not only a genuinely well written and well made film. But, it is a masterpiece when it comes to film itself and every aspect of film. I honestly find it difficult to find anything really wrong with this movie or anything I dislike.Yes, Jaws is about a man eating shark, but there is so much more within this film. There are real characters and you get to see those characters and like them. So yes it's an iconic monster flick, but it's also much more than that. Chief Brody, Hooper, and Quint are honestly some of my favorite characters in film and Jaws itself is also one of my favorite villains.My favorite scene in the movie is the scene where Brody, Quint and Hooper are all sitting at the round table telling stories, drinking, and singing songs. ""Show me the way to go home, I'm tired and I wanna go to bed."" I love it.John Williams composes one of his best scores for this film. Every time I hear it, it reminds me of Universal Studios. But, it's an iconic score and the main theme is one of the most menacing themes for a villain in movie history. Without that score this movie would have been a completely different experience and the film would have had a much different impact. John Williams is the real star of this movie.Overall, Jaws is a cinematic masterpiece. Steven Spielberg combines fantastic storytelling, good characters, beautiful cinematography, superb filmmaking, and an iconic score to create arguably one of his greatest and most iconic films of all time. Among being an iconic blockbuster monster movie flick. Jaws also combines the genres of comedy, action, drama, suspense, and horror all into one. *chefs kiss*One of the most iconic movie posters of all time.The first summer blockbuster before Star Wars, it also caused the world to go into shark hunting panic mode 😬.

Stay out of the water,"Steven Spielberg's movie Jaws (1975) is one of his best films he has directed other than the three great Indiana Jones movies he directed, but also that this is based on the book with the same name by author Peter Benchley, though I have not read the book, I know there are people who read the book and like the movie adaptation. The movie Jaws (1975) is a fun thriller with good performances, likable characters, beneficial effects, and memorable moments; the effects and look of the shark also works well for the movie adding some mystery by barely showing it in multiple attack scenes.The three main characters Brody, Hooper, and Quint are likable and funny characters that are played very well by Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw; Brody being chief of police on Amity Island, I like how he is just an officer who wants to protect people who go to the beach, so he tries to kill a shark any way he can. Hooper being a marine biologist, I like how he has the knowledge on sharks and can tell the difference between sharks when looking for the right one, along with having skills when it comes to setting a trap for it. Quint being the hunter hired to find and the kill the shark, I like how he has his methods in catching a shark, and how he describes a shark was cool; all three characters work great together and are all entertaining.I like that we do not see the shark for most of the movie keeping it a mystery until a point where the shark is revealed, and once the shark is shown, the shark is mostly an animatronic and the effects are well done; I also liked how we will get the point of view of the shark from under and above the water. The music for the movie is great with it being done by John Williams, who is fantastic when it comes to making music for movies, especially for Steven Spielberg's movies; but also, the main Jaws theme is iconic and cool to listen to. Plus, the music helps the suspenseful moments and any action scene that happens that involves the shark attacking people in the water or on the water in a boat.Jaws (1975) is a great thriller shark movie that a lot of other shark movies try to copy and fail at, even the Jaws sequels were not able to top the first; the characters are likable, the music is great, the shark effects are well done, it has a good mystery for most of the movie, and good suspense during attack scenes.

I never really saw what all the fuss was about...,"Sure Jaws started a massive monster movie craze which has lasted all the way up to the present day, an was undisputedly a huge box office success worldwide, but that isn't saying it's necessarily a great or necessarily good movie.  I always found this film good in places but overall the viewing experience is an overlong and generally unpleasant one.This film has all the essentials of a good shark movie, the 3 R's... yeah Roy, Richard, and Robert.  Yes, the acting in this film is surprisingly top-notch for the genre, even Shaw who almost overdoes his thick seaman drawl to the point where it often becomes hard to understand.  There's also a classic musical score by John Williams, who with the Star Wars and Indiana Jones tracks has become one of the most successful composers in history, film or otherwise.  Probably the best aspect though is the photography which looks even more mystifying at night-time with an almost silvery-great look to the water than it does during the day.There, so it's a good movie but the hype surrounding it is totally overblown.  First of all, there's not really much in the way of action in this film.  There only are 4 actual shark attacks over the course of the film's 120+ minute running time.  The film slows down terribly near the end with the three men endlessly bantering amongst themselves ending with several repetitive scenes of them shooting harpoon after harpoon into the shark.  Maybe it's just the overfamiliarity of the subject matter that has come over the years, but the scene has very little in the way of tension. The mechanical sharks look awfully cheesy during some of the close-up shots revealing some wrinkles in the rubber nose.  On top of that, the ending was completely ridiculous, in that there was no way the guy could have gotten out of the cage and hid from the shark for several minutes.So to conclude, this film is a good movie, but it never was really worthy of the classic status its overblown hype has brought it.",4.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Definitely Above Average,"This is one of those rare films that has won so many awards that it's hard to keep up with them.

It was also nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best Picture"" and while it didn't win on that particular night it later did win a Golden Globe award for ""Best Motion Picture-Drama"". Likewise, Richard Dreyfuss won a BAFTA award for his performance as the oceanographer named ""Matt Hooper"". And there were other awards and nominations as well. In all it was quite impressive. Now, as far as the movie is concerned, this is definitely one that I can recommend to all but the very young and faint-hearted. Although there isn't much gore, graphic language or nudity it still has enough drama and suspense to keep a person's interest throughout most of the movie. Personally, while I thought the special effects were more than adequate for that specific time period, I still would have preferred a bit more gore to make it seem even more realistic. Additionally, I thought some of the film got a bit bogged down by the dialogue-especially while the three main characters, ""Sheriff Brody"" (Roy Schieder), ""Captain Quint"" (Robert Shaw) and the aforementioned ""Matt Hooper"" were at sea waiting for the shark to appear.

""Jaws"" is not only an amazing film in pretty much every way(OK, the shark is phony looking, but it's not like they had CGI or Stan Winston), it is the movie that redefined the way movies are marketed, not mention it raised the bar for filmmakers everywhere. ""Jaws"" could easily have been a mess, what with the budgetary constraints, uncooperative islanders, bad weather, untried methods and relative inexperience of it's director. It could've been remembered as one of movie history's greatest blunders, or worse, not remembered at all. Steven Spielberg, however, chose talent over star power and the power of suggestion over shock value and gave us a masterpiece, not just of horror and adventure, but of true human-factor driven movie magic. It's not the shark that makes ""Jaws"" great, though it serves it's purpose just fine. It's the characters. It's the knowledge that, this isn't some alien planet or time long past or yet to come. It could be anytime, anywhere, anyone(assuming that you live near the ocean). Sharks are real and the events described in ""Jaws"" are not at all far removed from reality(i.e. - New Jersey, 1916, the Mattewan Creek incident, Rodney Fox, Henry Bource, etc). We've seen the startling images of massive great white sharks leaping from the water at 30 mph to rend some unsuspecting seal into shreds of torn flesh and shattered bone. We've seen the scars of the survivors. Aside from that, we've all felt out of our element, up against things we don't understand and fear, just like Chief Brody. Many of us have felt the drive to fight and win, regardless of the cost to ourselves or others, like Quint. Some of us have rushed into danger, brimming with confidence and know-how, only to be defeated by something too big or powerful for our skills, like Hooper. ""Jaws"" is a very human tale, giant carnivorous fish aside. There is also the technical aspect of ""Jaws"". Verna Fields' masterful, Academy Award winning editing, cutting in all the right places to heighten the tension or magnify the emotions. There is the incredible, unforgettable and oft-imitated score by the great John Williams. His massive, pounding shark theme is forever linked, not just to sharks, but to the dread of what's beneath you, unseen, ready, waiting and hungry. Then, of course there is Spielberg himself, giving us images of naked flesh from below, unaware of the unseen beast stalking from below. Images of children playing as one of their own is torn asunder in massive jaws, no pun intended(well, maybe...). The image of that fin, cleaving water like a blade cleaves meat, moving towards a helpless victim. Spielberg waited, giving us teasing glimpses of his behemoth so that when it is fully revealed, our imaginations are already primed and giving us our own ideas of what the monster looks like. It is both a joy and a jolt when the titular beast breaks the surface before Brody, scaring at least two years off of his life. ""Jaws"" is a great film, pure and simple. It is funny, exciting and frightening, all at once. It is a standard by which others should be measured. I assure you, though, if you wish to stand up next to this masterpiece, you'll need a bigger boat.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Classic movie icon,"It's Chief of Police Brody (Roy Scheider)'s first year on Amity Island. It's the all important summer holiday season and the 50th annual regatta. When a girl gets eaten by a shark, Brody wants to close the beaches. Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) has a different opinion. When a little boy is killed by the shark next, Brody closes down the beaches. There's a private bounty of $3000. Local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to do it for $10k. Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) from the Oceanographic Institute answers Brody's call for help. The bounty brings many yahoos and they catch a tiger shark. Only it's not the right shark according to Hooper. Mayor Vaughn reopens the beaches for the 4th of July despite Hooper and Brody's strenuous objections. When the shark attacks again, mayor Vaughn relents and agrees to hire Quint. Quint isn't impressed with Hooper, but he's forced to take both Hooper and Brody on board.There are so many great things about this movie. It holds up even compared to more modern movies. The trick or the luck of this movie is to not show the shark for much of the movie. It is director Steven Spielberg's first big hit in a long line of big hits from one of the most prolific directors.

Beach Horror Classic!,"aws (1975 Dir. Steven Speilberg) Even if you've seen this horror blockbuster a thousand times before you simply have to rent this video during the summer months. For those of you who have been living on Mars for the last thirty years or so and are not familiar with this classic horror flick, a local beach town in peak tourist season is terrorized by one very large and hungry shark.Robert Shaw stars as a classic Captain Ahab type complete with sailing songs, salty language and a fondness for the grape. An early performance by Richard Dreyfuss and '70s star Roy Scheider round out the cast. Steven Speilberg takes the American tradition of fun at the beach and turns it into a classic horror tale of Man vs Nature. For extra points, watch it the night before a planned outing to the shore.

Bruce Almighty,"This blockbuster about a shark feasting on crowds at a summer resort launched Spielberg's career into the stratosphere. The success of this film can be attributed to the chemistry among the three stars: Scheider as the police chief, Shaw as the shark hunter, and Dreyfuss as a marine scientist. Shaw, who met with an untimely death three years later, is particularly memorable as the cantankerous Quint. Of course they are just supporting actors to the real star: Bruce the shark. Spielberg does a masterful job of generating suspense and terror. Williams adds to the tension with the throbbing theme music that is quite effective if unoriginal (he lifted it from Dvorak's Ninth Symphony).",8.0,Anonymous,Adventure
You Can't Ask For Anything More,"How would one even begin to criticize this? It's a brilliantly put together, fast moving and extremely scary movie. It features one of the greatest and most iconic pieces of theme music in movie history, it features tremendous performances from the cast and perhaps the scariest thing about it is that it isn't really a ""horror"" movie as you would normally define ""horror."" There's no ""monster"" in this - just a large great white shark that has developed a real taste for human flesh and takes up residence off an East Coach beach on the fictional community of Amity Island to feed. There's no wasting of time on this. The movie grabs you by the collar in just the first couple of minutes with the truly frightening first attack - made even more frightening by the fact that (although you know what it is) you never see the attacker. A young girl is just grabbed by something and disappears screaming in a pool of blood. It was a brilliant and very effective opening that ensured that the viewer would never lose interest, and indeed the shock of that opening means you don't take your eyes off the screen for even a moment.The first part of the movie deals with the efforts of the local sheriff (Brody, played by Roy Scheider) to convince the town to shut the beach after that first attack. He's convinced (and the local ME confirmed) that it was a shark attack. But the town is about to host thousands of tourists for the July 4 holiday. Under pressure from the mayor and town Council, the ME changes his report to a boating accident, and Brody isn't allowed to shut the beach, because it would cost the town too much money. A marine biologist (Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss) is brought in and confirms that this was a shark attack by a huge shark, but still the town won't listen, and disaster occurs. Finally, the mayor - stunned by the carnage that ensued - agrees to pay Quint, a local fisherman played by Robert Shaw, a bounty of $10000 to hunt and kill the shark, assisted by Brody and Hooper.It's marvellously put together. Maybe the only thing I could have done without were some of the male-bonding scenes between Quint, Brody and Hooper on board the Orca as they sing songs and compare wounds. But that's nowhere near enough to detract from the overall power of the movie, and it's in that scene that Quint shares his story as part of the crew of the USS Indianapolis, an American ship sunk by the Japanese in the closing days of World War II, with many of the crew being taken by sharks while they waited to be rescued. I had never heard that story before, checked it out after watching the movie and discovered it to be very true. The climax of the hunt as the trio is finally able to locate the great white is a tremendous fight. There are really very few moments in this that give you much of an opportunity to catch your breath. It may well be the best movie of its type ever made, and one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. (10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"You don't need a bigger boat, you need a smaller shark.","Almost 50 years after the original release, Jaws still packs a punch and has the ability to shock and scare the viewer. If I have a criticism now it's that the shark is just far too big. It's a totally unrealistic and unbelievable size.When a shark is captured, killed and hung up on the dock, the expert Hooper indicates that the jaws aren't big enough. He gestures to indicate how big they should be, which is probably a tenth of the size of the monster they eventually encounter. (Also, why is somebody from an Oceanographic Institute performing an autopsy?)The main ""shark"" theme became a classic soundtrack, but during the film there is plenty of annoying musical scribble which intrudes and irritates. But Jaws is still a classic of its kind. The ultimate 70s disaster movie. Jaws seems to represent the 70s as The Terminator exemplifies the 80s.",6.0,Anonymous,Adventure

I'd never seen anything like it. It was breathtaking. For those who don't know, Jaws tells the tale of three men who set out on a perilous journey to try and stop a killer shark that has been terrorizing a small New England island. For the majority of the film, the shark is never seen. This builds up the tension until the big reveal. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss play the three men who set out to catch the shark, and they all give stellar performances. However, Shaw stands out the most. His speech about the USS Indianapolis is riveting, and each line he gives is perfectly delivered. The film also stars Lorraine Gary as Scheider's wife and the perfectly cast Murray Hamilton as the persistent Mayor Vaughn. The screenplay is written perfectly, and the character development is simply fantastic. Jaws is a great movie, and it will always be one of my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
A revolutionary vision from Spielberg,"""Smile, You son of a...!""What can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie; it is a timeless classic, in the truest sense of the word. This is where it all began, all those movies on sharks, and oceanic predators; god knows how many people from the film fraternity as well as from the pool of ordinary spectators got their dosage of inspiration right here.In a way, this venture revolutionized the entire industry from the inside out. It transformed people's viewpoints and beliefs on what could be achieved with a little ambition in your heart. And it is needlessly to say, Steven Spielberg not only was the quintessential catalyst behind all these reformations, but he also made a ton of crucial contributions to this industry or to this medium of 'Cinema' in general, which I believe will keep on bearing fruits for the eternity.Now coming back to the film; while I may not put it on my all-time favorites list, I can see why this garnered so much love and appreciation from the audience. Despite having a simple, uncomplicated narrative, it managed to keep us thoroughly engaged for the full duration. It is fraught with tension, anticipation, and a bunch of unforgettable moments (Like when Hooper located the dead body inside of the sunken boat).Nevertheless, it had its fair share of issues as well. For example, following such an incredible build-up, the concluding act seemed to have dragged on for too long. While the characters themselves had some interesting stuff to share, all their emotional availabilities came about missing. Maybe it's just me but unlike Steven Spielberg's other works (the likes of Jurassic Park, E. T.); I could not seem to establish any personal connection whatsoever to any of these personalities, let alone care for them!",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Men Acting Like Morons: The Movie,"Jaws is not about a giant shark, it is about the enormously stupid egos of a bunch of men living in a small seaside resort town near Cape Cod in the mid-1970s.First there's the arrogance of the Mayor Vaughn, and the greed of associated town business men, then there's the arrogance of the three men out on the boat. Really unnecessary lengths of scenes are devoted to Brody, Quint and Hooper competing with each other and acting like jerks in a locker room.I don't think this movie holds up well and I like horror films from the 1970s. This isn't really horror, it's more like an action film for dude bros to watch.I mean, I hope you all realize this movie has been condemned by animal welfare interests and wildlife conservationists for its unrealistic demonizing of sea life.

Classic Hollywood,"Steven Spielberg captures the thriller aspect of Jaws in different elements than ever seen before in 1975, when this film was released. Although it was noted that the production costs were going over budget and there seemed to be many malfunctions with the robotic sharks, there would be a big surplus. The editing done to capture the camera work between the great white shark and people being terrorized was unique during the time this film was released. It is considered a classic also for the soundtrack to create tension for viewers watching the film and anticipating what will happen for the survival of the characters after encountering a shark. Overall Jaws had the highest grossing film of all time until other well-recognized films would top this. It is difficult for the audience to miss the camera work of extreme close-ups between the characters in the film and the close up of the sharks as the suspense is built throughout. Steven Spielberg took this creativity of the staging for this film and worked with the elements of water. Spielberg generally avoided low-key lighting during the film so viewers could clearly see the distance of the shark and it's victims. He took this film to the next level of shocking viewers using a soundtrack that keeps the audience on its toes for what will happen next as the camera zooms in to the shark. Actors, Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss worked incredibly well together that will have the audience anticipate what will happen as they encounter the great white shark.",7.0,Anonymous,Adventure

All the leads give excellent performances, so, unlike nowadays in a disaster movie, you actually care about the people nearly being (and in some cases) eaten alive by a giant shark (and the shark dos not looks very rubbery to me!).

Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss all gave memorable performances in their respectable roles, out to catch and destroy the man-eating shark. The special effects were great, especially the performance of the shark - realistic and downright scary. Seeing people being drag beneath the waters by the shark as the water turn blood red is one creepy experience you'll never forget. John Williams' haunting music score is one of his most popular and signature musical works, an icon in the movie soundtracks. Just those few musical bars will forever make audience realize that this is ""Jaws.""

One of the best movies of 1975.,"There was never a great thriller like Jaws. Why is that? Because Jaws was legendary. It's suspense is surprising. Jaws is about a great white shark that terrorizes a summer resort in a small town called Amity. The police chief played by Roy Scheider, is determined to find out how to eliminate the shark after it's eaten one of the citizens of the town. Later in the film, a marine scientist, played by Richard Dreyfuss explains that the first victim in the movie, in the beginning of the film says that it wasn't no boating accident, it was a shark. Then, the Fourth of July comes up and the people of Amity are having a good time until the shark shows up. After the panic on the fourth of July, an grizzled fisherman, played Robert Shaw, plans to hunt the shark down and kill it. So, Dreyfuss, Scheider and Shaw team up to eliminate the shark. Director Steven Spielberg's has a great sort of suspense shots. Thought the shark is not seen the entire time, that is great because it is how Alfred Hitchcock directs suspense.

A classic for a reason,"I base this review upon the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD release. We all know the theme and the famous lines. This is part of popular culture, with countless references to it and parodies of it in the almost 35 years that has passed. I suppose I will still describe the plot: A small island community finds itself terrorized by a shark. A really, really big one. The storytelling is good, and this never loses your attention. It's interesting to note that the limitations of the mechanical effect led to this being as excellent as it is. Not being able to show the animal all the time, Spielberg opted for build-up and character development, thus creating a marvelous suspenseful atmosphere as well as getting the audience properly invested in these characters. This is immensely exciting and intense, and you don't know exactly when something is going to happen. The acting is great, every single performance(with the possible exception of some of the kids, but that's nothing new). FX are better than you might expect, and the careful and precise editing and cinematography succeed in making them entirely convincing. The score is solid. This comes with an featurette that is almost two(in total, all of the stuff amounts to maybe three) hours long and worth watching, an interview with Spielberg, deleted scenes, Shark Facts, a minute and a half of unfunny outtakes and some galleries. There is frequent moderate to strong language, a little bloody violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of horror films and/or thrillers. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
A film classic one of my favorites. Well done suspense adventure and very memorable pulsating original score. Spielberg's best.,"""Jaws"" a film that I've viewed many times over the years is one of my favorites, it's clearly one of the 70's best and probably one of cinemas all time best films ever made. As well before the days of special effects, CGI, and 3-D Spielberg did his best making this film with scenes of a mechanical shark. And the film is suspense filled as most scenes don't show the shark directly attacking the victims, yet it's often the things that are hidden and underneath that are the most terrifying like an underwater great white. And most memorable is the pulsating original theme score from the film, you've heard it many times as it just carries the suspense and drama of the film along so well.Based on Peter Benchley's novel(I must say a must read)""Jaws"" is set in a New England northeastern island resort town of Amity. And all of a sudden unexpected bodies float ashore and deaths are reported. And the worst fears of the ocean have come to service a great white shark is responsible. So enter the town's sheriff stressed out Chief Brody(wonderfully played by Roy Scheider)and upon his assumptions and investigations he's meet with resistance and protest from the town mayor Mr. yes man and the politically corrupt Mayor Vaughn(well done by Murray Hamilton)as it's better to lie about shark attacks to the citizens for fear of losing money as people will not want to vacation in Amity if reports of shark attacks are true. Brody does the best to cope with it with support from wife Ellen(Lorraine Gary).Still matters need to be taken further so enter two problem solver helpers one in the form of Sam Quint(Robert Shaw)a weathered and crazy odd ball shark hunter who's methods are unorthodox and then to complete the twosome it's young hotshot educated marine scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss). And along the way this film turns into a suspenseful adventure of shark hunting that's helped by the wonderful and pulsating score it just keeps you on the edge of your seat, as in the end your happy to be served a big great white lunch with the death of Jaws! Overall a film classic one of the 70's better pictures and one of cinemas better suspense thrillers. Well remembered for it's strong and pulsating score which moved the drama and suspense of the film along so well. And the way the scenes were shot Spielberg made many of them hidden and suspenseful by doing them underwater proving what you can't see is most often the most dangerous just like the opening sequence of Chrissy's death. And the way that Steven shot the film even though tough and difficult by filming water scenes and moving the camera a lot on boat was well done and his working of the mechanical shark takes a big bite out of today's special effects and CGI and 3-D works. Really probably Steven Spielberg's best. ""Jaws"" is a very memorable cinema classic, one of the all time best films.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
One of the greatest movie ever,"This movie would be one of my favourite movies ever.There are so many quotes and famous characters from this series but mostly this movie. This is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen especially the parts where the shark is going to attack and that part with the decapitated head and others.My favourite character would have to be Quint the old sailor who knows how to kill the shark but won't do it without a price tag attached. The general storyline is three men go out and hunt a shark that is attacking a town.So in summary if you want to see a good movie and get a bit of a fright see jaws one of the greatest, most quotable movies ever made. I was frightened to go swimming for months even in a local pool!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
still great and relevant,"As most know by now, Jaws is an excellent film about our favorite great white shark terrorizing poor Amity and the locals. The main characters are unforgettable, especially Chief Brody, Matt Hooper, and Quint and most of the top notch dialogue is terrific. Naturally, the most memorable lines revolve around Quint's legendary story about how they ""delivered the bomb"" considering how many of the men were killed by sharks. Anyway, the real star of Jaws is Bruce the shark, and how Spielberg keeps it hidden from us before we see the actual beast. This is better than any silly CGI knock off could be considering this is from the summer of 1975. This is one of movies, like Goodfellas, that I make sure to catch at least a few times per year, no matter the season. It never bores me, thanks to perfect and flawless film-making and legendary performances, scenes, and atmosphere throughout.",,Anonymous,Adventure

The terror. The music. The actors. The dialogue. THE SHARK!,"The terror. The music. The actors. The dialogue.THE SHARK!Those elements sparked a newfound interest in the nature vs. man genre back in 1975 when ""Jaws"" was first released.It follows the story of a man named Brody (Roy Scheider), the sherriff in a pleasant little town named Amity, which is seated right by the ocean. Nothing ever happens in Amity. It is the same little routine every day for Brody. Wake up, go to work, come home, go to bed, wake up, go to work, etc...But all that changes in one moment of disbelief.But after some vicious incidents occur in the water outside his town and home, Brody investigates and finds that the killings were no boating accidents, but shark attacks. After calling in marine biologist Matt Harper (Richard Dreyfuss) and hiring a mysterious man named Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody takes to the seas to hunt for the Great White Shark...and defeat it.Steven Spielberg got his big break directing this film. It brought him to fame and he since went on to create many more popular movies, including ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and such. But it is his direction that makes this film's tension work so well. Granted, the reason the shark was never shown was because the fake shark robots wouldn't work, but even if they had shown the shark in the beginning, Spielberg still does good here.John Williams' score is quite possibly one of the best film scores ever performed, ranking right up there with ""Psycho"" and Alan Silvestri's ""Back to the Future"" theme. It is moving, frightening, and all around completely emotional. The thing that is most impressive about the score is that it revolves around a few keys on a piano being hit over and over and over again.Roy Scheider quite possibly gives his best performance ever in this film. He has dropped out of the limelight lately, not being in any films as of recent; but everyone will remember his performance as Brody in this film. Always.Richard Dreyfuss is also at the top of his game here. I think it is interesting to note that like Scheider, Dreyfuss has not been in many films recently. Maybe it's post-""Jaws"" effect. I'm not sure. But I know that the only time I've seen a performance as good as his in this film was a little comedy with Bill Murray called ""What About Bob,"" which is an excellent comedy.I read the novel ""Jaws"" by Peter Benchley, and it is one of the few novels where the movie is better. Benchley lost my interest halfway through the book when he stopped talking about the shark at all. He introduces it in the beginning, and uses it a little at the end, but most of the story is all about character development and has nothing to do whatsoever with a great white.That is what is so nice about the film. It keeps character development going while keeping interest in - and not letting the audience forget about - the shark out in the water.All in all, ""Jaws"" is one of the best films ever made. It easily combines horror, comedy, thriller, mystery, comedy and drama into one little bundle called a film. It's a masterfully crafted thriller that never stops delivering.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure

All this stuff is now pure Hollywood Legend.The acting is superb: Scheider down-plays his role as an everyday working man and pulls it off Big Time. He really is one heck of an actor, and incredibly underrated.Richard Dreyfuss over-plays his role and pulls it off very nicely. He is funny and in-your-face without ever being annoying.Robert Shaw . . . . he over-plays it and . . . well, he's like a cartoon character. I have never ever liked him.

I guess I have to fall in line here and...,"....give this movie praise, along with everyone else. In the beginning, it's a shallow, predictable, embarrassing 1970s 'horror/shock' flick.By the time the longshoreman enters the picture, along with the bearded scientist, the movie takes on a whole new tenor. Now it's about something else, something eternal, and this is where the movie finds its light. This is why the movie is revered the way it is. There's something cosmic about that shark, the skipper, the scientist, and the policeman. These people love the shark (except for the cop), and they hate each other. They are jealous lovers of a shark, in a fatal embrace.A good story for kids or adults, it transcends itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Steven Spielberg started his legend here !,"I saw this incredible movie at the age of 6. I remembered after seeing this film, I was always wondering if the great shark came to bite me while I was taking the shower. Indeed, this unique movie in 1975 scared all the people away from the beach and screamed in the theater. This movie has good photography, complete story, amazing special effects (at that time), and good directing. Though this movie was a disaster for Spielberg during filming, the box office still reached unbelievable point in film history. Obvious, this movie makes Steven Spielberg this name well known all over the world. the movie is intensive, frightening, and well entertaining. Spielberg is good in creating nervous shot (like shark's point of view for approaching the victim) and excellent atmosphere. In addition, the greatest music composer John Williams used simple three to four phonograms to grab the audience's attention. At any rate, this highly entertaining movie affects film making of this genre for the later thirty years.

"""For $10,000 I'll give you the head... the tail... the whole damn thing.""","I'd love to teach the screenplay of Jaws to a bunch of fresh-faced young'in film students, who may or may not have seen the film before (I got introduced to it at about the right age, 12 or 13, and watched it steadily over the years, including once in a marine biology class in high school - why I don't know, but it was an annual tradition for the teacher, funny especially that the film gets some things wrong biologically speaking but whatever). It's a script that thrives on character development and interaction, and shows that a three-act structure is not really a cut-and-dry thing.Actually what is so lovely about the film is how it's really a two-fer, a kind of prototype of what one might see Tarantino do later on with some of his films - From Dusk till Dawn, Django Unchained - where it's really two movies: first is the quasi-horror-mystery as to what this shark is, which shark (""THIS IS NOT A BOAT ACCIDENT!"") and how the politicians - namely the Mayor (who has great hair btw), a spineless weasel who kinda, almost, sorta gets a sympathetic moment in the hospital (""My kids were on that beach too"") if it wasn't so pathetic - screw things up. Spielberg, by proxy of a shark machine that didn't work so great, went for what would later become a (over-used?) staple of horror films, especially serial killer flicks, where *we* become the killer in a sense, floating around, looking for victims, and then BAM.The other movie is an adventure movie where the character hinted at in the first half - Surly Mr. Quint (and really, thanks to Robert Shaw, isn't it one of the two or three most 'something' characters in modern cinema? a ""Working-Class Hero"" with a lot of layers and demons and a lack of AA sponsorship) - takes center stage as our other heroes, Brody and Hooper, are almost at his mercy, and yet help him and collaborate on this hunt.And what makes the film is that both films work unto themselves, and yet are all of a piece. In an odd way even though sharks ARE very important to the story - where else would we get the Indianapolis story without em - they could be hunting anything really. I don't mean to marginalize the location, the Orca boat, the sea-bound sense of what has to be done physically on the ship (""Know how to tie a sheep shank?"" ""You didn't say how short you wanted it."" God this movie is quotable), but if they were out like, I don't know, hunting a mountain lion or a big bear, it would still be the same great characters and the same stakes of life-or-death as well as life-or-death for anyone else.I can't really think of a better man vs nature film, can you? Certainly not any without Murray Hamilton. or John Williams, who made such a score that you could put it on (like other classical Spielberg tracks) a classic-baroque music station on the radio and it'd fit completely in. Matter of fact, it's surprising the shark's theme- 'dun-un (repeat)' doesn't just come out of the shark's mouth!PS: the Shark was named ""Bruce"" after Spielberg's lawyer.

We're going back to get a bigger aren't we,"What could make a man go out into a hostile environment and fight a monster. This is the very heart of this story. When a rouge shark stakes his territory off the shore of Amity Island, the community responds first with disbelief then shock as the shark repeatedly takes victims.3 men venture out to catch the shark. Salty sea dog and shark hunter Quint has his own reasons, which I won't reveal here, but are not so dissimilar to that of Captain Ahab in Moby Dick. Hooper, a marine scientist has always been fascinated by sharks. Police Chief Brody who is scared of the water who must protect his community and his own family.Each person is an interesting character, and that is what makes the movie special. Mostly importantly it has the shark, a genuine monster that regularly causes the deaths of people in modern countries. If you have ever even paddled in the ocean you have visited the home of monsters.This movie is fabulous adaption of Peter Benchley's very famous book. The formula created in this movie for the battle between these men and the beast has been copied endlessly in monster movies since, but never so well.It genuinely reawakened humans fears of sharks (but shark fear was written about in Jule's Verne's 20,000 Leagues under the sea) and stopped people going to the beach. However, Peter Benchley has since spent much of his life campaigning against his own book for the preservation of sharks. In truth sharks don't often eat people, the usually take a bite, think ""yuk"" and spit them out again.It is a movie that should be on everyone's must see list and worth returning to if you are feeling jaded by some of the current monster fests.",8.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"This is ""THE"" Summer blockbuster","'Jaws' is considered the pioneer of the Summer blockbusters. After all, its impact and success made it a much copied movie, by giving birth to 3 sequels and different movies inspired on it (such as 'Deep Blue Sea'). But 'Jaws' is definitely THE Summer blockbuster (and also the one to own).Steven Spielberg was in the beginning of his career when he made this movie. Although he made other movies before, this was his first hit. Its success surprised even Spielberg himself. The movie is based on a 1974 book (same title) by Peter Benchley. I read the book and there are many differences...Filming of the movie took much longer than planned. It was supposed to take about 2 months, but ended up taking more than 5 months (also due to reliability issues with the mechanical sharks).'Jaws' is considered a classic in its genre. Indeed it is a great movie but also shocking. It is intense and combines strong suspense and horror. The shark is immense and intimidating. It is clearly over-sized, but that also makes the movie more terrifying. It looks a bit rubbery at times, but I don't think it looks as artificial as many do.Nicely filmed, the movie takes place in a fictional Summer resort town (Amity Island). The place looks very appealing, the sandy beach is big, beautiful and very inviting. And that's where the brutal shark's attacks occur. It's heaven and hell at the same time.The movie's got some of the most horrifying deaths ever in a movie. While not the scariest movie of its kind, it surely is scary when it is. In fact, I often read and heard that when the movie came out in 1975, never before had the cinemas been so full and the beaches so empty. It wasn't just because of the movie's euphoria, but also because of the shark's attacks seen in it (maybe more than the sharks's attacks in real life). Today the movie continues to marvel and shock audiences.And the soundtrack by the genial John Williams is strong and powerful, very appropriate for the movie. It gives the sensation of being spooky and carried with suspense, the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.Roy Scheider portrays the town's police chief Martin Brody. Richard Dreyfuss stars as the marine biologist Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw plays the rude fisherman and shark hunter Quint. Murray Hamilton is Larry Vaughn, the selfish Mayor of Amity Island. Ever since the beginning, Brody wants to close the beaches to protect beachgoers from the shark's attacks, but is overruled by the Mayor, who refuses to close the beaches because of his greed for money and also refuses to listen to or believe anybody. His selfishness costs lives, as we see in the film - including a child's life.The first half of the movie focus more on the attacks and also lets us know Amity Island and appreciate its scenario. The second half focus on the attempt to hunt the great beast.The movie's poster is great, even more so in the DVD cover.",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"""Swims up and bites you on the ass""","Blockbuster is a bit of a dirty word in ""serious"" film commentary. It gets associated with base commercialism, the motion picture as mere product, simple fare with no long-term appeal. But such an assessment does a disservice to the savvy filmmakers who make the hits, as well as the movie-going public who make the box office figures. You can fake art house sophistication, but you can't fake popular approval.Jaws was adapted by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb from Benchley's best-selling novel. In many ways it follows the book closely, but there are some key differences. In the novel the mayor was being pressured by the mafia, and bizarrely enough there was a subplot in which Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife. With these aspects gone we have a story stripped of anything that may introduce a different tone - anything that might have been the focus of another story in its own right. The plot and dialogue are succinct and direct, especially in the earlier scenes. This is not a picture that wastes time getting itself going.And a lot of the racy pacing is down to director Steven Spielberg. Like John Ford before him, Spielberg has great economy of expression, often working two ideas into a single shot. In Roy Scheider's first scene, we get Scheider on the phone in the foreground while his wife tends to their son's injured hand in the background. The details of the phone call aren't important, we just need to know that it happened, and thus Spielberg can afford to balance it with something that demonstrates the significance of our hero's family life. The tenderness Scheider feels towards his two boys is the closest this picture comes to having a subplot, and it is something largely brought out by Spielberg. For example, scenes like the one in which the younger son imitates Scheider's every move were improvised at the director's behest.But more than conciseness, Jaws has dynamism and punch. Like another ace director of the previous generation, Victor Fleming, Spielberg encourages performances that really move. Take a scene like Richard Dreyfuss's inspection of the first victim. Rather than a professional study, the scene is staged like a heated argument, the actors waving their arms and snapping out their lines. Almost always there is movement – characters walk as they talk, or stand before a busy crowd. The few moments of stillness – Scheider with his family, the stirring Indianapolis speech – are those of subtle significance, and their calmness helps them stand out.Of course Spielberg didn't operate in a vacuum. The invigorating style of Jaws is aided immensely by the tight editing of Verna Fields. Fields uses techniques of the art film – jump cuts, rapid edits – but with the difference that her use of them is purely functional, never attention-grabbing or stylistic, and as such she disguises her cuts to make them blend in like finest mise-en-scene. Take the beach scene where Scheider scans the seascape, fearful of another shark attack. Most of the cuts take place as an extra walks across the screen, softening them so that we barely realise the angles are changing.And it all works of course. Take this kind of professionalism, and you can make an exciting, box-office busting thriller about a shark, a dinosaur, a killer truck or whatever. This is why, when all those rip-off shark flicks began to appear (and I don't just mean the Jaws sequels – the more recent Shark Attack franchise makes the Jaws offshoots look like masterpieces) they were invariably awful. They took the premise, killer-sharks-versus-humans, thinking that alone could make a hit. These are the true lowest-common-denominator cash-in trash. If a movie gets audiences flocking in to see it in phenomenal numbers, it surely must be a high-quality piece of entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Adventure
A different skill to the hunt,"I've always had a theory of why Jaws is such a frightening film for so many people. It is because we are challenging the shark which maybe the most perfect killing and eating machine in nature in his own habitat. We are land creatures, we cannot breath in water, we can only hold our breath going under for a limited time. Even with scuba apparatus we are no match for the shark in the place where he lives and breathes. So when one of them gets real close to our land habitat and starts killing off swimmers we frighten easily because any one of us could be his victim if we dare venture in the water.It's this terror that Peter Benchley's novel and Steven Spielberg's film exploits to the max. Jaws is almost like two films put together about the same subject. In the first part when the first shark victim shows up, Roy Scheider as constable of the small island town of Amity Island on the New England coast, he wants to close the beach. But the city fathers led by Murray Hamilton say no way. This is the summer tourist season which the town lives and dies by. Of course a couple of good lawsuits would truly cripple the town, but that fact never seems to enter anyone's thinking. Spielberg truly shows the greed of humankind here. Of course when more shark death occur, then the professionals have to take over.Those professionals are Scheider, oceanographer Richard Dreyfuss and fisherman Robert Shaw who has a boat they can use for shark hunting. He's got first hand experience with sharks, he spent some time in the water as a sailor in the Pacific War with sharks picking off his mates one by one. They each bring a different skill to the hunt.These three are not the most compatible shipmates ever brought together for a common purpose. In fact the conflicts between all three leads drive the film in the last half. When the big great white shark comes calling though it's a tough battle to put him down. Jaws won three Oscars in technical categories, music scoring, sound, and film editing in addition to being nominated for Best Picture in 1975. But it's as much the actors as well as the technical virtuosity of Jaws that make it the great film it is.Centuries from now Jaws will be scaring the pants off people because we're still afraid of what lives in the water.",9.0,Anonymous,Adventure
a masterpiece,"Any movie that can scare as many people for so long has definatley earned the place Jaws has in the vast sea of movies.  I first saw this movie as a young child, and being an impressionable young child with mean older brothers, I was afraid of even tap water for months.  In attempt to reduce my fear, my mother told me Jaws was the size of the swimming pool at the YMCA, and I have not swam there since.  I appreciate the movie on an entirely different level now, but I am still in awe at it's pure genius. The fear that the shark induces will never fade in my eyes, I will never grow out of that.  But I have learned to appreciate the characters, dialogue, and depth that Jaws offers.

A chilling account of what happens when a shark strikes,"I saw this movie on telly when I was quite young, and from then on it gave me an obsession with Steven Spielberg and sharks. Since then my obsessive nature with anything to do with sharks has died down, but I still love Spielberg and his work. This film started the whole summer blockbuster and along with it started the whole hook thing where the first few minutes of a film leave you hooked and wanting to see more. Those first few minutes had me on the edge of my seat with my heart pounding. I later found out it was so convincing, because Susan Backlinie who played the helpless victim Chrissie was being yanked too hard on her feet by the divers underneath and those were real grimaces of pain. Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw make a perfect trio and the film really starts to focus on these 3 characters and really starts to get thrilling as they leave land to kill the dreaded 25-footer. What follows is a fascinating portrayal of the 3 different ways these men handle what is before them. Roy Schneider's classic line 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' has been ripped off time and time again most recently with Godzilla 'We're gonna neeed bigger guns' A classic chilling film masterpiece from beginning to end.

Duh Dum.....Duh Dum.....Dah Dum!,"In the summer of 1975, America experienced a phenomena that sent people running from the beaches into the cinema.

Though the younger set (my age group of 10-16) often scoff at the fact of a movie from the 70's, I truly think Jaws is a classic and ranks up-with the great horror/adventure films like The Exorcist, The Omen and Psycho (1960).

A bigger boat,"A quarter of a century on, this remains Spielberg's most perfectly accomplished film, at once poetic and fiercely efficient, without a trace of the mawkishness, and latterly preachiness, that has marred much of what he has done since. The disastrous watershed of `Star Wars' and the dumbed-down 80s lay ahead. `Jaws' marks the final flowering of the mass-market Hollywood genre movie as high art.Like the best of the Westerns, this film resonates with the myths of the Old World. It is Homeric in form: the internecine squabbling on land in the film's first half is the `Iliad'; the testing of Brody at sea in the second part, the `Odyssey'. (`Show me the way to go home', he sings in his cups.) The great shark is the monster threatening the community that, like Theseus or Oedipus, Brody must sally forth to slay, testing and discovering himself in the process. There is something of Athenian tragedy, too, in the veiled and grieving mother who curses Brody at the dockside. Every hometown in America had its Mrs Kintner during Vietnam, and the guilt of that war  barely past when `Jaws' was made  is surely the film's deeply coded subject-matter.`Amity, as you know, means friendship', intones the corrupt mayor, a small-town Nixon with a taste for horrendous polyester sports-jackets; yet its good burghers collude in the sacrifice of their children for the sake of a quiet life and an honest buck, and  as in Ibsen's `Enemy of the People'  disown the decent citizen who tries to blow the whistle. In a sense, Amity/America has conjured the predator into being. Quint's grisly yarn (scripted, it is said, by an uncredited John Milius) of the wreck of the USS `Indianapolis'  the film has a kind of out-of-body experience at this point  implies that this is Nature's revenge for the sin of Hiroshima (`Anyway, we delivered the Bomb'); as if the shark, cheated of full atonement in 1945, had followed this ancient mariner home, claiming him as a final (superbly gruesome) canape before sinking forever into the deep.The film is framed by the clanging of a bell upon the waters, first in the stillness of night, finally in the light of day. Rarely has the space immediately in front of the lens been so effectively used to create a sense of depth and subjectivity  often, a face in extreme close-up filling one edge of the Panavision frame, almost breaking forward from the plane of the screen. We watch the boat set sail, ominously framed by a shark's bleached jawbone in the window of Quint's boathouse; the camera glides forward, through the jagged O, after the departing vessel, as if reaching out to call it back; the next shot, eerily and perfectly picking up the flow of that movement, is a direct reverse  we look back from the boat, over Brody's shoulder and following his gaze, at same window, receding in the distance (our last sight of land until the credits roll), the jawbone just discernible as a tiny ghostly shape behind the pane. Far out at sea, Quint's haunting tale told, the shark attacks in the darkness before dawn; Brody scrambles onto deck, fumbling to load his revolver, his face lurching towards the camera, then turning aside in a moment of stillness while, in the sky behind, we glimpse, for a fraction of a second, the low diagonal streak of a chance meteor, a foreboding of disaster and a sign of grace.This is film-making of the very first order, effortlessly transcending its commerciality and genre, luminous with pity, fear and wonder. `Jaws' has featured in every `ten best' list this viewer has ever scribbled on a tablecloth. Time has not wearied it. See it again soon.",,Anonymous,Adventure
The first and still the best,"Jaws was and is still the most terrifying movie of all time, Leaving the shark hidden for most of the movie was a piece of genius, Jaws scares people because we are more afraid of what we cant see, the mostly lack of blood is replaced by a leg falling leg hitting the bottom of a lagoon, a head falling through a hole in the boat. The funny thing is that when Jaws came out and people were leaving the beach by the millions scientist's told us that a large shark like that would never come close to a public beach a 28 foot great white was caught 150 miles off the coast of long island.

It was the first,"Jaws is a first class film and nearly everyone I know has the same thing to say about it..... it is brilliant. And they are right, the 3 main actors are brilliantly put together, and I can`t see anyone doing a better job than anyone in this movie.Robert Shaw was a very very talented actor, in the second James Bond Film ""From Russia with Love"".He played Red Dutch with frightening accuracy and he is still one of the most rememberable characters.But when ever I hear the name of Robert Shaw I think of Jaws.He played Quint the shark fisherman with a slight touch of manic.It was probably the best role he took up.I have heard that he made up the USS Indianapolis story.And I have heard that there might be a 25th anniversary for Jaws, and it will be a special edition like Star Wars.It was a tragic shame that Robert died of a heart attack in 1978, he was a great actor.Richard Dreyfuss played Matt Hooper the shark expert who had the job to convince Amity Island that they had a Great White Shark feeding off the bathers..Richard has starred in other memorable films as well such as Close Encounters of the third Kind.And Roy Schneider played the police chief. He would become the hero of the film and the sequel.And the real star of the film was the shark who was named ""bruce"" after Steven Spielbergs lawyer. This is the best film of the series and is the most rememberable film of all, people always say how fake the shark looks but cold they do better?I give this film a 9 out of 10 because of the great actors and story line.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
My All-Time Fave,"Okay, so Citizen Kane and The Godfather are undeniably great films, and I love both of them dearly. But when it comes to sheer enjoyment from a flick, Jaws is my #1 film of all time.The mother of all blockbusters has a very simple story: a great white shark begins feeding on swimmers at an island beach resort. However, the movie is so much more than that. A young Steven Spielberg creates a visually-stunning and suspenseful film; for instance, the zoom/dolly close-up of Roy Scheider on the beach has since become a popular camera technique. The acting is excellent, and Robert Shaw's performance is especially unforgettable. The script is solid, and the dialogue is strong. And, despite what people say, Bruce (the mechanical shark) looks great! This is one must-see that even those who usually don't care for must-see movies will love.

Most terrifying movie of all time.  Here's why:,"As of this writing there are 160 comments for this movie and it ranks an 8.2.  I ask, where does it lose that 1.8 points?  It's perfect, my favorite movie of all time.  If I had to guess why some wouldn't like it, I suppose it could be because Bruce doesn't match the live shark footage in the film. Or maybe people prefer a CGI shark?  I'm stumped.  See Deep Blue Sea if you want that, and you'll see that CGI sharks don't make a movie.  Besides, Bruce looks great in 90% of the shots, especially when he rises up under Brody during the last stand.  I've often wondered- why is it that as the years go by and technology advances, the sharks in the Jaws movies just look worse and worse?Everybody has seen this, so to summarize the plot is a waste of time.  No other movie has terrified the world in such a way.  The most terrifying films of all time don't get into your head like this.  There are few people who are afraid of hotels due to the Shining, and even fewer fear demonic possession (Exorcist), or Zombies (NOTLD).  Now these are among the scariest films ever made and I love them dearly, but they don't get to you like Jaws. I've heard that in the past some people feared the shower after seeing Psycho, but come on, Jaws kept MILLIONS away from the beaches, and people still fear the ocean to this day.  That is true, irrational FEAR, spanning 25 years, especially since it is rather common knowledge that sharks are about as interested in eating people as they are logs.  This movie had the same effect on cinema as War of the Worlds did on radio.  It showed that the entire nation can be profoundly affected by what is on that screen.So see this masterpiece again, and for heaven's sake, DON'T watch it on TV. The edited pan and scan version just doesn't cut it, and you don't even get to see what happens to Quint. As for my feelings about the DVD, I really enjoyed some of the new sounds, but overall the original is still the best.  It doesn't matter though, only people who've seen this film hundreds of times like me will notice the new sounds anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Definitely not as good as people say it is,"I don't get this movie. A giant shark terrorising a beach on a small Island must be killed in order to continue making money on tourism (well, of course it's NOT only to be killed in order to make money on tourism, it just gave me this impression). This is the story? Or did I miss out on something? I'm sure someone could have come up with a better and more original script.I had to see this movie twice to complete the whole movie since I fell asleep the fist time watching. Almost nothing exiting happens in the 125 minutes that it lasted, no suspense at all. Maybe I have a short attention span, but nothing scared me either to keep me awake or keep me interested. This was probably partially because the shark seemed very fake and unrealistic but the score by Williams really tried to cover up for this, and he almost succeeded.There's not much to say about the acting, Richard Dreyfuss did best but he wasn't mind-blowing, though above average. As of the rest of the actors, they were simply average.Some tell me to give it another chance (just saw it again yesterday), but as I do it only gets worse. Surely not a movie I can recommend to any. Maybe I'm being too hard on the movie but it just doesn't appeal to me.6 out of 10",,Anonymous,Adventure
Watch 'Sharkwater',"As a scary movie, this movie fulfills. It did such a great job that, on many vacations to Mexico and Hawaii, as well as to Australia, New Zealand, the Cook Islands, etc., I didn't go in water past my knees. Ever. And I'm not alone in knowing it traumatized an entire generation of potential swimmers, divers, et al.I thought I'd challenge myself this summer and face the fear head on. I took an open water dive course (where I didn't think of sharks once underwater, knowing that my 'buddy' was more of a danger) -- and then watched 'Sharkwater'.If you're terrified of sharks because of 'Jaws', I implore you to watch 'Sharkwater'. Our Stephen Spielberg did a hell of a job in scaring the crap out of people, and I'll give him that. But the world' s shark population has decreased by an insane amount in the last 10 years because people don't care about these animals -- not pandas, not elephants, not cuddly -- but millions killed for fins, and trust me, peeps, sharks are incredibly important to the planetary ecosystem.'Jaws' did a great job in terrifying people, but it's not real, and it's not the truth.",3.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Maybe not Great Whites per say but sharks and shark attacks along with death and near-death experiences are synonymous.This movie had everything in it.

It is a perfect example of pure entertainment... and that's really the best way to put it: pure entertainment.  Among the usual comments about the direction, the music, and the characters, I'd like to chalk one up for the pacing.  The movie flows perfectly, and before I knew it, an hour and 15 minutes went by in what felt like half-an-hour.  That's what I call good pacing, as well as an engrossing story development, and give Spielberg his dues for that one.Nothing more to say other than it is deserving of the label ""classic.""",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
One of the finest movies ever made.,"The initial success of this film is not up for question, but I think that with all the hype that surrounded this film upon release the quality of the film that Spielberg had made was upstaged by the shock value.I like to see this film every twelve months or so and it simply appeals to me more and more every time I watch it.  It has possibly the best combination of acting, dialogue, direction, photography, suspense, humour and plausibility that I think I have ever seen.  Some of the shots that Spielberg got when out on the water are simply superb and obviously took enormous effort to consign to film back in the mid 70's.I'm loathe to mention 'Deep Blue Sea' in the same sentence as Jaws (although it was an enjoyable film in it's own right), but there is a point that can be made here.  The advent of CGI effects means that we can now see more of the stuff that used to cost huge amounts of money, man-power and time to create on film.  However, this is exactly where Deep Blue Sea fails where Jaws so resoundingly succeeds.  We do not need to see the shark in Jaws to know it's there and the film is carried not by the appearance of the shark but by masterful acting (by the whole cast), great cinematography, genius direction and an intelligent and fit-for-the-screen take on Benchley's novel.It's nice to be able now to sit back and appreciate this film for more than just the shock value of the 'shark in the water' formula.  More than 25 years on this film still stands head and shoulders above most other movies (similar or not).",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

I would rather have a somewhat mechanical looking shark thrashing about and splashing water everywhere, than have it drawn in like a cartoon (Sorry, that's a Deep Blue Sea reference). This movie is scary on so many levels... First, the idea of something eating people you live near is scary. Second, the fact that it's a shark (something that really exists and you could actually see one) is scary. Third, there is a possibility that nothing will be done to protect innocent lives.

Great one in the 70s,"Can't believe the movie was made in 1970s. It's even better than some movies made nowadays especially the special effects.

It was cinematically played in 14 countries in 17 different languages and was nominated for 18 awards.

The greatest movie ever made.,"Jaws, directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 1975, is a cinematic masterpiece that revolutionized the thriller genre and set the standard for summer blockbusters. The atmosphere is immediately gripping, created by a combination of John Williams' iconic score, haunting cinematography, and the tension between human vulnerability and nature's ferocity.The story, based on Peter Benchley's novel, follows the small New England town of Amity Island as it becomes the hunting ground for a great white shark. Spielberg masterfully builds tension throughout the film, often showing the shark indirectly. The camera angles play a crucial role in this, using underwater shots that mimic the perspective of the shark and overhead shots that emphasize the vastness of the ocean compared to the vulnerability of the characters. This technique heightens the fear of the unknown and forces the audience to anticipate the next attack, making every moment suspenseful.The narrative structure of Jaws is another key element of its success. It begins with a classic setup of idyllic summer life, abruptly interrupted by the first attack, establishing a sense of normality that is quickly shattered. The gradual revelation of the shark (AKA Bruce) as a threat is handled expertly, with the film building from initial skepticism to panic as more victims fall prey. The storytelling effectively mirrors the psychological tension of the characters, particularly Chief Brody, who not only externally battles with the shark but also battles his own fears and insecurities internally regarding his role as a protector.Jaws taps into deeper psychological themes, including the human instinct for survival and the fear of the unknown. The shark serves as a metaphor for our primal fears, representing the chaos lurking beneath the surface of everyday life. The film critiques the complacency of society, highlighting how denial can lead to disaster. The town's initial reluctance to confront the shark reflects a broader commentary on how communities often prioritize profit and tourism over safety and moral responsibility.Jaws artfully combines atmosphere, tension, and psychological depth. Spielberg's innovative use of camera techniques and storytelling creates a palpable sense of dread, making the audience confront their deepest fears. Its legacy endures as a testament to the power of cinema to evoke emotion and provoke thought, solidifying its place in film history as a pioneer of the thriller genre.The greatest film of all time in my opinion.

I recall walking out of the theatre thinking that this was the best movie I have ever seen. Time has not diminished its impact. I saw it recently again and was amazed by its power.The music, the directing, the acting are all first rate. I had forgotten some of the scenes and they amazed me again. The use of the camera when Brody is watching the shark from the beach is amazing. I never thought of it at the time.And no they don't make movies like this anymore. Now there would be more blood and screaming - from the actors not the audience. Technically the film is so impressive - the editing is just right, not to much is shown but just enough to tantalize. I did find the special effects lacking but this was 30 years ago when Bruce had to be mechanical not CGI. I wish Spieberg would make movies like this again.

My favorite film ever.,"I don't think I've ever been more scared of a shark movie (sorry Deep Blue Sea fans). This movie made me go out about 5 feet into the ocean water when I went there. I swear, to me, this is the greatest film ever made (no offense to Godfather fans). Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss played their parts extremely well, as Brody and Hooper, but the man who should have won best actor was easily Robert Shaw. He greatly illustrated the part of Captain Quint, the salty old sea captain from years back. But the entire last half of the movie was definitely the best I'd ever seen. The scenes from the Orca were great, and the parts of the actors balanced out the movie. Scheider provided the worrier, the easy-to-panic man who's scared to death of the ocean but bravely steps up when he's the only one who can kill the shark [Smile you son of a -----! :)]. Dreyfuss gave the comic bits and the memorable lines, and Shaw, of course, gave the movie the best actor of the decade in my opinion. Jaws was the basic summer film; shark attacks, the chief police officer acts in the town's best interest, the mayor tries to stop it, and before we know it we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis not unlike the 1916 conflict that actually occurred. I give this movie my highest recommendations.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Happy 25th to the scariest movie of all time!,"It's a miracle that it's been 25 years since this film has been released.  I unfortunate didn't get to see this in the theater (I was born a year later), but countless viewings on video, cable, television, laserdisc, and now DVD has made this my second favorite film of all time.  What's rather ironic, is that Steven Spielberg consider this film his ""nightmare"" not because it scares him, but because it was a nightmare to make. With ""Bruce"" (the mechanical shark) keep breaking down, Spielberg went over budget and schedule to complete this film. He might call it a nightmare, I call it a blessing in disguise. Because of not showing the beast until over a hour into the film, it's a Hitchock element that even Alfred himself would be proud of. And the characters, the timid and aquaphobic Amity police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider).  The scary, experienced, and strong-headed fishman Quint (Robert Shaw).  The excited, knowledgeable, and brave marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss).  The community concerned as well as economic minded town mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton).  And also the loving, worried, and tender wife and mother, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary).The story is very complex, from a problem that Mayor Vaughn will continue to ignore, until it swims right up and bites him in the.... well, you know.  The police cheif from New York City, who moves to a more quiet and relaxed community, only to find that he has more problems in Aminity than he does in the big city, not to mention being afraid of the water, and living on a island.  When it's only a island when you're on the water.  The scruffy fisherman that is the town terror, who torments everyone from a child playing the clarinet to the entire town in a meeting.  Plus not to mention the gigantic 25 foot and 3 ton great white beast that snacks on anything that swims. Because of this movie, it has influenced me a lot in life. First, it has open my mind with movies, not to make exciting movies, but also excellent movies.  Second, it has helped me gather research on Steven Speilberg, which I find this to be his best film, above E.T. and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (although those films are also classics!)  Third, to confront my fears, I am like Chief Brody and am terrified of the water, and seeing that bloody shark doesn't help me.  But by watching this film, it encourages to stand up against my fears and face them.  And finally, it is just as exciting to watch the first time just as much as it is to watch it the one millionth time. This is the movie that introduced the world to Steven Speilberg, not E.T., not SCHINDLER'S LIST, and not JURASSIC PARK, it was JAWS.  Because of JAWS, the entire planet has seen this director evolve from doing films that are from the imagination of a child to doing serious films with important meaning.  Countless people label this film the first ""summer blockbuster"" I label it the classic films for the new generation.  From STAR WARS to PERFECT STORM, JAWS was the first film to have big special effects, big budget, exciting action scenes, and a excellent story.

Completely manufactured Hollywood film with monster shark and big name actors thrown in,"This film constantly gets copious amounts of praise for how well directed and well managed it was. Granted the Jaws theme John Williams composed has remained a classic in film score and depicted with aplomb the anxiety and terror of a large predatory shark closing in, and the scenes are decently directed and put together if you assess them with conventional mainstream movie criteria... but this is so far removed from actual shark phobia in any realistic, poignant sort of way and is so completely disinterested with it aside from the very first scene (possibly the only really creepy moment). It never even attempts to be realistic or genuine and only settles for that big production plastic Hollywood atmosphere and basically self-imposed itself as the one good shark movie out there that was legit (all other attempts being cheap B rated rubbish). It had John Williams for the score, Spielberg behind the cams, and Scheider/Robert Shaw and Dreyfuss, all well established big names, to give it the outside credibility it really is all about in the end.And 'Jaws' was even a novel, so they already had their story written for them.Instead of looking to develop psychological triggers of thalassophobia (fear of the ocean), perhaps kenophobia (fear of immense empty spaces), or actual fear of sharks, where they could've shown a lot more footage of the deep dark endless ocean and managed the suspense up to a climax there, built tension of a lurking sea monster which looming presence is felt like its terrifying appearance is imminent, played around between the ominous utter silence of the ocean blue and filled up that silence with a sudden change of pace and horrifying panic... basically instead of doing their job at that with this being the supposed top notch 'fear of the ocean/featuring a great white shark' masterpiece, they settle for the bare minimum in terms of exploring the phobia itself and just go for processing a bland screenplay and script and scenes that are about as superficial and deep as the entrance of a beach.",4.0,Anonymous,Adventure
A cultural phenomenon of the best kind,"The 1970s was a transitional period for Hollywood and American society. Failure to win Vietnam and the shame of Watergate prompted a reassessment of America. The moral certainties of old Hollywood were now irrelevant. In late 60's a new group of directors emerged to fill the vacuum. Their influences were other films. They were the movie brats. And the only one of them to achieve sustained unbroken success was Steven Spielberg. He is the most commercially successful filmmaker of all time, with an unerring instinct for the modern mainstream. He has converted his filmmaking powers to unprecedented corporate power in Hollywood. But while his commercial success is indisputable he has suffered much criticism; chiefly that his films are childish in their viewpoint. He positions himself in the cosy Middle-American ideological mainstream and presented issues in morally simplistic terms. His movies were full of sentimentality, moral certainties and special effects wizardry. He made Schindler's List partly with a view to address the accusation that he was not a serious filmmaker. But to be perfectly honest, whether you agree with this viewpoint or not the fact remains that Steven Spielberg directed Jaws. And that will be something that no one can ever take away from him. Jaws remains one of the most iconic, timeless, suspenseful and brilliant films ever made.It was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon on release. Not only in that it terrified a generation of people from going anywhere near the ocean but it had a profound and lasting effect on the movie industry. It was the biggest money maker of all time on release and it instigated a Hollywood production strategy that has been geared towards summer blockbusters ever since. It ushered in the era where marketing campaigns often cost more than the movie itself; while it was also the first film to be released via saturation booking, forever changing exhibition strategy. For better or for worse, Jaws changed the way the industry did business.But it would be enormously unfair to blame Jaws for the blockbuster phenomena. It was just by chance that this movie about a killer shark was the monumental success it was. In many ways this was a sister film to Spielberg's earlier movie Duel. Where that movie pitted an everyman against a malevolent truck driver, Jaws adopted the same basic idea but made the villain a great white shark. Jaws is essentially a horror movie because the creature in this film does not behave in the way any shark would. Here, the shark is given a malevolent evil intelligence that makes it behave in an almost supernatural way. It operates along the same lines as a maniac from a stalk and slash horror film. Moreover, the killing of the sexually liberated girl at the beginning of the film is very much in line with the conservative ethos of the slasher films that would follow in its wake. The price of immorality is evidently death in the universe of Jaws too.Spielberg manipulates the audience brilliantly by keeping the shark off the screen for a long time. Instead John Williams extraordinarily effective music is used to signify the presence of the monster. There are a series of scenes of incredible suspense where the fear of the unknown are played to the maximum, such as the opening killing and the attack on the two night fishermen. When the shark does finally appear it is nowhere near as rubbish looking as many claim. Despite being clearly fake you always believe in it. This is the power of Jaws.Spielberg's preoccupation with suburbia is very evident here. Amity is a small community put under siege by an alien enemy. This deadly foreign presence threatens this suburban idyll. Does Amity = America? Who can say for sure but there is no question about the parallels to Watergate in the town mayor's repeated attempt to cover up the scandal for his own self-interest. Political corruption was everywhere in 70's American movies, and here is no exception.Masculinity and class is represented in three types here. There is the abrasive and working class Quint, the intellectual and wealthy Hooper and the even-handed and middle class Brody. Despite their antagonistic relationship Quint and Hooper have much more in common with each other than with Brody. They share expertise despite the class divide. But seeing as this is the world according to Spielberg, narrative logic dictates that Brody - the man of the suburbs - will provide the sane middle ground that will ultimately prevail. His motivation is born of concern for the community, he is a family man with self-doubt; he does what he does out of a sense of duty not for selfish reasons. The everyman triumphs against evil.Jaws does crystallise the world view of Steven Spielberg. But where in some of his other films this perspective is coated with a saccharine feel, it is simply not the case here. Jaws is a thrilling film, with three dimensional characters. It terrified a generation of cinema-goers in the 70's and remains one of the genuinely great blockbusters. It never gets old.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
A Movie I Will Love For All Time,"This is a Spielberg classic that I've loved since the first time I saw it in the theater (at age seven)!  Robert Shaw's performance is one of the most outstanding aspects of the film.  The performances of Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are nothing to sneeze at either.  As a mother now, I have a lot of trouble watching the Alex Kintner attack scene...and yet isn't that scene one of the reasons this movie is so powerful?  I own the DVD and continue to watch the flick every couple of months for Shaw's performance and the great ocean scenes.  I will love this movie for all time!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

One of the few perfect movies,"Jaws has been a favorite of mine since childhood.  It is a movie where even though everything during its making went wrong, the final product ended up so right.  From hardly showing the shark, to its wonderful chemistry between characters, this film is both scary and exciting.  The best movie of all times!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Still a classic.,"I watched this film for the first time when I was 8 years old and that was in 1979.  It was playing in a holiday resort cinema at the time.  A real run of the mill movie by the time I seen it, so even though I was so young and on my own, it was ok to go in and watch it.  I ran out of the cinema and back to our apartment when I seen the head scene.  I had nightmares for weeks afterwards.  Since then I've seen this classic countless times and I enjoy it every time.  There's just something about the atmosphere in the film that I find infectious.  The casting is the most natural I've seen. Each of the main characters is so believable, different and interesting in their own way.  A tired middle aged cop from New York, a young rich scientist in love with his work, and an old weather beaten shark fisherman with scars to remember most of his encounters. I've yet to see interaction like this between 3 actors. The love\hate atmosphere on the boat is just gripping. I bought the DVD version for my kids.  I'd rather the original because in the DVD version in the scene before they sing; `Show me the way to go home', the whale sound effect is smudged out and replaced with a more 90's politically correct whale sound.  I thought the original effect added much more to the atmosphere of the film.  But it is cool to see it digitally touched up.  And what about the Score?  Is there a more memorable score for a movie?  Space Odyssey 2001 springs to mind but even that masterpiece borrows from the classical world.  That music was not written for that film. I loved the book too, but I have to say the movie is better.  I know it's strange but it's true.  I love movies but I've yet to get the same level of enjoyment from a movie as I did from Jaws.  And that includes E.T., Close Encounters, Star Wars and so on.  Jaws is a marvel. I'm glad I was so young when I first seen it because it probably wouldn't have had the affect on me that it had had I watched it at an older age.  Ok in hindsight and if you like nitpicking you can find a few things wrong with this film.  Like the missing chair after the scene were they caught something with the fishing rod, or it wasn't really summer when the filmed it.  Big deal!  Movies like this are about imagination aren't they? These inconsistencies had to be pointed out to me before I could see them for myself.  In my opinion a good movie with no directing or editing errors is not what makes it good movie. Jaws is King and very underrated in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Spielberg's original shocker!!!...score 8 (out of 10),"When I first saw Jaws, I was in the front row of the theatre and some teen aged girl threw up on me when the gory stuff appeared on the screen.  I was terrified too.  Now, many years later, I have seen Jaws many, many times.  I have even read and seen how they made the film.  The special effects are considered today to be standard...and one can tell the fake shark scenes from the real ones.  The acting, cinematography, and direction, however, have held up over the years.  All of the characters are still convincing in detail, which says a lot about Steven's directing.  It was the film that made Steven Spielberg a household name.",,Anonymous,Adventure
That was boring,"Ever since I first heard about it I wondered how you make a suspenseful and terrifying movie with a great plot line about a shark. 46 years after it came out I now see you don't, you make a boring drawn out film about a police chief in a coast town that had two shark attacks. For most of the movie you don't see anything of the shark not even a trail of ripples in the water. When you do see the shark it looks like a giant rubber puppet. It's was so close to going to sleep in the middle of it but didn't figuring I would never go back and finish it if I did. When it ended I was thinking I really hope I get to go to the beach this summer that looked nice. In the end it's a two hour movie and there is maybe a half hour where it seems the shark is an immediate threat.",1.0,Anonymous,Adventure
The music number is the reason it's a hit!,"Don't go in the waters! Why? There's a huge man-eating shark, It's JAWS! This movie really puts the fear in Fear Factor! At first I thought it would be in Califorina thats where all the great whites are located, WRONG! A sleepy New England town would have to be the place to be. I would know it would be a fact that sharks would be one of the most feared killer animals we would ever have. I would thought alligators would be the top one. Steven Spielberg has made a success with this movie, it was not only filled with depth, but also intrigue, wonder, and of course horror. It seems that the great white has given a bad rep for its ferocity, but it's our own fear that really does that. In order to give the respects of the shark it to understand them like snakes, the non-poisonous ones, this idea wouldn't get so twisted. However, there has been shark attacks in the past, and this movie is just another scare factor just to keep us out of the water. What a cast, what a hit, this movie was definitely a blockbuster hit, and I would say anything that movie is not a keeper. And that's no fish story. 5 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"""Oh boys, junior's back for his noon feeding""","E.T., Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List all received more accolades and perhaps, deservedly so. But this film is the best popcorn movie of Steven Spielberg's illustrious career. At least in my opinion. Spielberg masterfully has blended suspense,horror,drama and at times humor into a spellbinding thriller. The best mainstream thriller since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The acting is excellent and not just from the three leads but the whole supporting cast. From Murray Hamilton as the disbelieving Mayor to the mother of the little boy on the raft who confronts Brody in a small but memorable scene. John Williams' Oscar-winning score is arguably the most famous of all time. The whole movie is loaded with classic scenes from the opening sequence where Chrissy meets her fate to Quint's horrifying story about the men on an ill-fated mission to deliver the bomb during World War II. Even though most scenes have been memorized by now, this film never fails to deliver. That is perhaps the truest test of any movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

JAWS : See it . . . before you go swimming. No kidding.,"This is my all-time favorite movie. I've both the DVD and VHS version, and it's one of the few movies I can watch over and over in the same day (along with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark). Jaws has it all - great story, great actors, and great film-making. Roy Scheider is great as Brody, making the character the most unlikely hero. Robert Shaw is also superb as Quint, the experienced fisherman who has been through a lot in his life. Richard Dreyfuss is awesome as Hooper, the marine biologist whose high tech equipment is no match for the power of the shark. Murray Hamilton is good as the mayor in denial of the evidence of the presence of the shark, until it's too late. Lorraine Gary is also good as the mother who cares about her family. And as for the shark, unlike others, I try not to notice it's technical flaws. It was 1975. I try to enjoy the other aspects of the movie. I think Spielberg and his team did a fantastic job with this classic. ****/****",,Anonymous,Adventure
the best thriller ever,"Even though I have seen this movie more than 25 times, I still get shivers ever time I hear the pounding bass from John William's brilliant score. The opening scene in Jaws is, hands down, the most guttural, frightening scene in the history of cinema. Unlike other horror/thriller films before or after, Jaws delivers elements of adventure, politics and humor. Spielberg will always remain a genius because of this movie, especially for his tactic of not really showing us the ""monster"" until 2/3's into the film. Brody, Quint and Hooper's unique triangular relationship is another trademark of this entertaining film. If you are one of the few people who haven't seen this movie yet, please do yourself a favor and rent this classic, but don't watch it before you plan to go swimming.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Cemented Spielberg's brilliance,"Jaws is still the ultimate adventure/scare movie ever made. One forgets that this was Spielberg's first BIG budget film (not counting The Sugarland Express), and the pressure he was under was intense.  'Bruce' the shark could have been a phoney looking disaster in the hands of most other directors, but Spielberg adapted to the limitations of his animatronic 'actor' and infused the film with a sense of mystery and forboding by rarely showing the shark, and only in quick glimpses when he did.The acting was first rate with great actors Robert Shaw as Quint, Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. They made you CARE about the characters. Without that we would WANT the shark to eat them, and all tension and suspense would be nothing but chum in the water.Perhaps the biggest negative about Jaws is all the sequels it spawned. The movie was great and should have been left to stand on its own, with the sequels draining some of the reputation that the original created. Imagine E.T. coming back with phasers bent on world domination, it just doesn't work.  See Jaws again for the first time, and remember how great it really is/was/will be.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Jaws,"This was a truly revolutionary film in the film industry. It was really the first time people attempted filming primarily from hand-held cameras. Not only that, but they filmed on the Pacific ocean on small boats with small cameras. In the production of this film their were a lot of firsts. They took huge risks and were successful.In the making of this film the had a mechanical shark that was unlike anything ever made. It was more advanced than any other used anywhere. It was huge and by itself it didn't look like much but with the shooting and editing, the shark was able to scare crowds and bring the added effect of terror to the film. What also helped make this movie scary was the soundtrack. The infamous string noise(DA-na) of the great white going in to attack was what startled me the most. It was unsettling.Something great that the cameramen did was shoot at water level, giving the audience the impression that the great monster was just under the surface ready to strike again. This film was great and truly a masterpiece. The work that went into in and the ""revolutionary"" ideas in filming of this movie really helped pave the path of what can be done in filming if people took the chance to try something never done by others before.",8.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Superb,"This Movie delivers what critics said it would and I was not disappointed. This movie was so thrilling and never was there a dull moment.From the Start I thought that the whole film would be depicted on the beach. How wrong I was. At least 40 minutes of this was spent on the boat and thank Spielberg for that, because he knew that the second half of the movie needed to be better, and it definitely was.The most fascinating tecnique used was how Spielberg and his team rarely allowed the Shark to be revealed. Instead they used the camera to be depict the Shrak's view of what it's thinking.Another enjoyable part is the realism used. I cannot think of a film before this when attacks looked so real, especially when the boy got attacked by the Big White. A pool of blood leaked. Even Movies like THE BREAK UP have less realism in action scenes. You could literally see blood on the side of Gary's Nose, not coming out of it.To everyone who just read this, if you have not seen the film, go and rent it out because it is a timeless classic, which would be very difficult to shoe off.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

"40 Years On, Still A Haunting Masterpiece.","Widely regarded by critics & viewers alike as one of the greatest, scariest & most influential films of all time, Jaws is Steven Spielberg's breakthrough feature that didn't only catapulted his career to great heights but also ended up establishing the modern Hollywood business model by becoming the first blockbuster in cinema history.Set in a fictional Amity Island, the story concerns a town sheriff, a marine scientist & a local fisherman who team up to hunt down a gigantic great white shark which has been terrorizing their small island community but once they set out to sea, they only end up discovering themselves as the ones who are being hunted by the great white.Produced on low budget, the masterful creativity of director Steven Spielberg is at full display here as he didn't only film it with great emphasis on plot & development but brilliantly amplified the tension as well by not explicitly showing us the shark for the majority of its runtime while not denying its presence either and when he did show it, it made many jump off their seats.Also supporting great direction is this film's tense screenplay, honest performances from its entire cast, great use of camera, superb editing and finally, the biggest contributor in turning Jaws into an absolutely bone-chilling experience, John Williams' tense score which elevated the horror to new heights & made the film twice as effective.Nearly 40 years have passed since this fright classic hit the screen & yet, even after countless imitations, it retains its ability to frighten the viewers with the same fervour as it did in the 1970s. A haunting masterpiece that made an entire generation afraid of ever stepping into the ocean again, Jaws has very effectively managed to stand the test of time & will hopefully continue to do so for many more decades.Immortal for its contribution to the genres of horror & suspense and a watershed moment for cinema itself, this unforgettable chiller remains one of Steven Spielberg's finest achievements in the film industry and without a shadow of a doubt comes highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Adventure

Takes your fear of the water and makes it a lot worse...,"This film is the grand-daddy of all action adventure movies. This is the one that started it all. This bad boy is the founder of the genre! Every action adventure made in the last thirty years that has to do with a creature attacking and killing people was inspired by this movie right here!

Speilberg's gem that got him several Academy Award nominations, JAWS was way ahead of its time. The world was not ready for such a movie. But since it came, the people were satisfied and were loving it!Peter Benchly most likely never guessed that 30 years later, people would still be talking about this movie.

"it's scary, it's thought provoking, and it's brilliant","I have this movie to thank for my shark fascination, and also for demonstrating to me, at an early stage in my development as a writer, how successful horror is when it is implied, rather than shown. Of course, the actual shark is fairly terrifying, but it's twice as scary when it just pulls people under the water, or pursues them with a torn off fishing dock stuck on its back (and how about the scene where the yellow barrels become so much scarrier than a dorsal fin). The killing of the little boy (a choice that Spielberg seems to me spending the rest of his career atoning for by having little kids get rescued in all his other movies) is an especially brilliant scene- writing, filming, acting and... oh God!... the pacing and timing!!! Excellent performances from all three of the leads and some of the supportings as well (Lorraine Gary... unsung brilliance sadly tarnished by later appearing in JAWS: THE REVENGE); Shaw's monologue about his pacific experience is one of the greatest movie speeches ever. The writing in general is excellent- they remembered to take the time to develop characters and such, rather than just move from one shark attack to the next- as is the filming (my favorite moment being the beginning, when there's a shot of the sun setting on the water, and you see Chrissie's arm and hand sink slowly beneath the surface). Too bad the sequals were all so terrible, and have more or less stigmatized the first.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
The Original Blockbuster.,"Still remember sitting in my grandmothers garage when my cousin showed me the cover of the Book, Jaws. And how the movie version just came out. And to great reviews. I was like, do i want to see something this scary looking? Well we did. And seeing in the theater back than, when there weren't many mega theaters. Just single, huge theaters where u had to wait online for an hour. And get the real movie experience of seeing it in the theater with 500 other people. And boy, was it scary. Still remember a girl a couple rows in front of me chucking her popcorn in the air when that head pops out in that boat scene. Now many years later, i finally caught in on cable (real cable, not those bs channels that have commercials every 5 min. and there stupid pop up add adv.) And it still holds up. Great acting all across the board. The filming is perfect. I even tried to look for flaws in the shark itself, and it looks real to me, with the one exception of the scene where the shark land on the back of the Orca and starts to sink it. But thats a minor gripe. Whenever i'm down the Jersey Shore, I still have this image of Quint singing the Fair Spanish lady song. For a horror movie, There are funny scenes like that also.

Still a classic!,"The original ""Jaws"" is still a fantastic film, even by today's standards. It positively set the cinema world on it's ear upon it's release in 1975.The story is well known and simple. Somehow a great white shark has made its way to the local waters of a New England town. People start disappearing, and the hysteria begins. The mayor (Hamilton) refuses to acknowledge that there is danger, as he wants to protect the precious revenue the summer vacationers will bring to the town. The police chief (Scheider) enlists the help of an marine biologist (Dreyfuss), and a professional shark hunter (Shaw) to battle the shark out on the open seas.Fantastic scenes include when Shaw recounts the story of a WWII vessel that capsized, dumping all of the seamen into shark infested waters. Nobody can watch that scene without getting affected. There's also the scene with Dreyfuss investigating a wrecked fishing boat for evidence of a shark attack, and the two old men who think they can catch the shark with a thanksgiving turkey as bait. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the opening scene involving the skinny dipping girl and the first shark attack, and of course, the entire last half hour... the true showdown with the beast.Excellent casting, and believable multi-dimensional characters make this a film that is proving to stand the test of time.Lots of people will tell you the shark looks ridiculously fake, but I always though that given the era this movie was made, WAY before even the earliest computer special effects, the shark looks pretty good.

It is a real achievement to build a shark of that size, to get it to move and look real as it does. It makes you think that all the use of CG in films like Deep Blue Sea recently and yet a model shark used in a film that is 30 years old still looks more realistic.After watching this movie I will guarantee you will feel different about going into the water again.10/10 - Scary, Jumpy, Funny, Tense and pure edge of the seat entertainment, especially recommended for shark fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Jaws,"Jaws is one of the films that will forever leave a mark on you. It's terrifying and will continue in generation after generation to keep people afraid of the water. Jaws was pure great adventure/horror film, that will continue to tap your fear against sharks and the ocean. For director Steven Spielberg, this was a huge turning point for him. Jaws is a landmark classic, and started the blockbuster generation, and one of the first movies to reach the $100 million dollar mark. Jaws is one of my favorite films of all time.

Steven Spielberg's terrifying blockbuster is one of the most brilliant, enduring, action-suspense movies of all time.Jaws is a phenomenon, and today it is still one of the highest grossing films of all time. The visuals of the shark will wear of anytime soon, but yet who cares, it's not about the special effects. It was the 70's, and for that time around, the shark looked pretty real. I really hated the sequels to this film. It just killed the the first film, and it just made me sick to look at. All three sequels, especially the four one, were not as close as the first Jaws. Jaws 2 was more of a teen flick, which I thought wasn't a serious film. Jaws 3 (3-D) took place in Seaworld which I thought was a very stupid idea. Jaws the Revenge, a shark stalks a 60 year old woman and takes revenge on her! What is up with that? I mean what was Universal thinking!

The movie starts out in a small people town named Amity. Not much bad things could happen there. But when Chief Martin Brody(Roy Schneider) finds a bloody hand on the beach. He wants to shut down the beach and calls in a shark expert named Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) for help and Matt tells him that it was a shark but the mayor of the town tells him he cannot shut down the beach unless he has proof the beach is not safe. They then team up with a shark hunter named Quint(Robert Shaw) to hunt the shark before its too late. I enjoyed this movie it kept curious as to will they catch the shark before more happens.,10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
One of the few movie's that has inspired me to want to become a filmmaker!,"This movie was terrifying when I was a kid. The music would haunt my dreams, to this day I still love it! The way this movie was made was just fantastic to me and was fascinating to watch all the behind the scenes as well. This is a movie that will keep you at the edge of your seat, feeling the suspense, and seeing that big and beautiful 25 foot shark! 10/10!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Truly Magnificent,"So, here it is: the film that made everyone afraid of the water and gave sharks a bad reputation that they are still unable to shake off.  ""Jaws"" is my personal favourite of all of Spielberg's films, it has it all: humour, suspense, a great story, magnificent acting and, most importantly of all, it grabs your attention immediately and doesn't let go. The film is set in the small seaside resort of Amity, a  peaceful holiday town and to its residents, the summer means everything to their business. However, all is not well beneath the surface of the ocean, for a 25 foot great white shark has staked a claim in the waters.  It begins to pick off some of the townsfolk and the panic begins to spread.  Enter Police Chief Brody (a career-defining performance from Roy Schieder), who tries to close down the beaches to protect the people but is soon met with opposition from the Mayor (Murray Hamilton) who refuses to have them shut down for the 4th of July weekend.  As a compromise, Brody calls in an expert from the oceanographic institute, Matt Hooper (one of Richard Dreyfuss' early roles, and one of his best) who warns the mayor also of the dangers of allowing people into the water when a beast of such mammoth proportions is lurking below.  Predictably, disaster strikes and the mayor finally relents, allowing Brody to hire a contractor, someone to go out and kill the shark. The contractor comes in the form of an old sea dog in the mould of Captain Ahab,  namely Quint (Robert Shaw in fine form as usual) who has had several experiences with sharks on his many voyages.  He accepts the duty (""I'll find him for three, but I'll catch him and kill him for ten"") and so he, Brody and Hooper set out to hunt down the beast.  However, it isn't long before the hunters become the hunted...I don't think I've had as much sheer enjoyment watching a film as I have when watching this 1975 classic.  Everything about it is perfect, the cast, the script, the effects, everything.  Anyone who criticises the shark for being unrealistic ought to have their heads examined, not only was it as good as was available at the time, but I haven't seen it bettered in any modern offerings - ""Deep Blue Sea""?  The sharks in that pathetic excuse for a film are shamefully poor, I am still shocked to hear people claim that that production bettered ""Jaws"" in any way.  Steven Spielberg's offering is far superior to any other tale of the ocean and I doubt it will ever be bettered.I couldn't write a review of ""Jaws"" without commenting on John Williams Academy-Award winning score - the best score I've ever heard.  Just listening to it without the images encaptures the spirit and mystery of the ocean and who could possibly forget the oft-imitated main theme used to indicate the shark's arrival?This is as close as cinema can get to perfection in the action-horror genre, every moment of ""Jaws"" is priceless,  and I for one will never tire of watching this marvel.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
my first fear,"jaws is still one of the most powerful films of all time because it works on every level and is what inspiring film making should be about. i was astonished when i found out that Spielberg was only 27 during the making of jaws. I was only 5 when jaws was released so i saw the film later, the poster is so amazing it has blockbuster written all over it when i saw the film it really delivered. i have now seen jaws countless times and still i admire the acting, the score, the story and of course the shark! and these days i,m a lot less scared of going in the water! and to all the people that slag of the sequels jaws 2 was a worthy sequel and though not in the same class as jaws was still a good film. yes the others were terrible",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
one of the scariest movies ever made,"1975, imagine, your in the water, nobody else around you, it's 11:00 at night, your having so much fun, and then, you feel a tug at your foot, you think its a fish, so you keep swimming, then it happens again, then your scare you look about 40 feet strait ahead, a black fin cuts through the water, you know what it is the second you see it, it's an 17-foot Great White Shark, you scream as your pulled under, and then your spit back out, the shark thought you were a seal and made a mistake, but now there's blood, and the shark can't refuse, this movie puts that fear into all of us, because of good acting, good directing, and the fact that sharks are in it, the very creatures which put more fear into us than ANYTHING. Speilburg is a masterful director, the actors are superb, and for a 1975 movie, the special effects are great. This movie is the starting point for all the crappy shark movies now, don't waste time with them, Jaws or Jaws 2 (6/10) will do just fine.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Sharknado is better,"This movie absolutely does not hold up. Jaws spends too much time on land looking at the politics of a small town, making it extremely boring and overly drawn out. I could care less about any of the characters because they aren't well made, a rarity for Spielberg. I understand this is the movie that launched his massive career and inspired countless others, but nostalgia and influence shouldn't carry a movie score or ranking in an all-time list. For a movie that is trying to be a realistic shark attack movie, the plot is not believable at all. Why do people go in the water on the day the beach reopens when they know what's lurking? It's like in Halloween or other cheesy slashers where you're asking, ""why did they split up? Why not run away?"" In addition to this, the famous score is so laughable. The main theme is too ubiquitous and meme'd that I can't feel scared when I hear it. The rest of the score sounds too similar to other movies that John Williams did after which are happy family adventures, such as Indiana Jones and Star Wars. This is a horror film, not a family adventure so it should have scary, intense music. The best parts of this film are any of the shots in or under the water. These shots are fantastic and truly remarkable. Some other great angles and shots throughout prove that it isn't the cinematographer's fault for this being so bland. The shark was very convincing too and I applaud the animatronics team. A film like Sharknado at least leans into being comically bad, but this is supposed to be taken seriously and actually scary. It is not.",4.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Feedback for The Jaws(1975),"I have always rejoiced watching the movie The Jaws (1975). It is very nerve wracking to watch The Jaws. I appreciate the work done. Every minute catches the eyes of the production that something is going to happen. Truly touched my nerves, and sometimes I was in tears. The direction is stupendous. The Jaws as the name implies, a thriller can't supersede any Shark movie. I marveled at the glimpse of the way the shark attacks it's prey. The predator reminds me of the food chain. The food chain is significant because the shark feeds on human beings. It leaves the spectator heart-broken and maybe in tears. However, then the conscious reminds us that the big fish will feed on it's inferior. This is yet another symbol that the superior will dominate over the inferior and no matter what has been said that showing others as inferior is only for the cowards, juxtaposes many beliefs. Hence, in reality the superior is really a superior. The vicious circle that the stronger will hunt for the weaker continues. I am humbled to write a review for the movie. It is honorable to be a part of the review for The Jaws (1975). I have rated it ten on ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
INCREDIBLE FILM!!!!,"Wow!!! Easily one of Steven Spielburgh's best films of all, however, aren't all of his movies. Anyway, this is just wonderful. Spielburgh uses very little of the shark to create a fear, or tension in the viewers mind. We don't see much of the shark, but the fear of it is heart pounding. I couldn't believe it. A few years ago, I was flipping through the tv channels and came across JAWS being shown for it millionth time. I decided to give it a chance considering I had never watched it before then. Luckily, I came across the part of Cheif Brody (Roy Scheider) chumming, and complaining about doing it. Then, out of nowhere the sharks head comes out of the water to collect some of the chum. My heart stopped for a few seconds, and I turned white. I was absolutly terrified. I feel the blood tingling in my arms as I watched the scene unravel. Absolutly terrifying! Not only that, the story of the USS Idianapolis by Quint (Robert Shaw) is enthralling. The performances by every actor in this film are supperb. The is a classic, and far supperior to DEEP BLUE SEA, or any of the other JAWS films. JAWS 2 is a good sequel, but ultimately, not as good as JAWS. Although, I would recommed seeing JAWS 2, because it is a good film, and it is scary. However, I didn't see JAWS 3, and I bought JAWS: The Revenge on dvd because it was dirt cheap. Just forget about JAWS: THE REVENGE; it's terrible. Most of all, just stick with the first two films. They are great. But JAWS itself is easily one of the best movies ever made!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
still scaring people today,"Jaws was the movie that sent Spielberg to stardom. I was talking to my friend who will not see this movie because she says it will scare her to go into the ocean. Now that seems to be telling you something. It is 30 years later and people are still scared to go for a swim. Well thought out plan because it tackles a fear that everyone has had at one point in their life. My favorite movie of all time because it is very suspenseful and has a really good and simple story line. This movie was voted b the second scariest movie of all time by the American Film Institute. It was also voted by the Bravo channel to have the number 1 scariest movie moment of all time. Why is it so scary? Well, you are going to watch it and find out on your own.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
One Of The Best Movies Of All Time,"THE best movies are more than just a film - they are an experience. Just like watching Silence Of The Lambs, you  are right there with Clarice Starling as she hunts the killer around his house, and in The Truman Show you are in there with Truman wondering what's going on and looking for a way out. In Jaws, this is achieved better than any other film. You really ARE on that boat with Quint, Brody and Hooper as the shark menaces them. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the film is superb, but it's the legendary boat sequences at the end of the movie that makes this head and shoulders above every other horror film (even Psycho and Silence of The Lambs). The shear thrill and fear you feel every time the shark comes near the boat is incredible, and when it throws itself on board and tips the entire ship up, with Brody and Quint metres away from that huge mouth full of razor sharp teeth...well, it makes you hang onto your chair with both hands. The unbearably tense climax ..it's incredible. Spielberg puts you inside the movie, and it's awesome. Odd to think the novel (which is superb, but not as thrilling) ends with the shark just dying inches away from the helpless Brody. ] The true mark of this movie is the impact it has had - all around the World, people still look at the ocean and keep a weary eye out for black, dorsal fins cutting through the water....",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Well we went to the beach the next day and it was packed, oh there were bikinis and people playing beach games and all that. but not one persons toe touched that water. Peter Benchley did not obviously know what kind of fright he was creating. I understand that this story is based on facts but as all good story's, he twisted a few things around to create a horror classic. And Steven Spielberg only 28 years old incredible photography what an eye that man has.

The Best,"JAWS may well be the ultimate horror movie. Made in 1975, it's hard to imagine that it's leanness hasn't influenced the the serial killer/slasher trend of the 1980s, with Jason, Michael and Freddy and their knifes/axes just reincarnations of the Killer Shark's teeth.Man exists of 90% water and some anthropologists have theorized that our original habitat was the beach, with it's easy pickings of seafood, fish and birds. Perhaps a Jungian terror of what lurks just beneath the ocean's surface has seeped into our very genes after lethal encounters with sharks, jellyfish, portuegese warships, poisonous snakes and tidal waves.Water is of course also the spiritual element, represented by the color blue.Whatever the reason, in the year of the Vietnamese Communist takeover of Vietnam, this lean, ruthless, low budget (for Spielberg) gem of a movie was made. Based on a book by Peter Benchley, this movie is at once a metaphor for the power of nature and man's powerlessness in the face of it, and in a strange way a Western, with mad shark hunter Quint as the gunslinger, Chief Brody as the Sheriff, and Mayor Vaughn and the store keepers as the weasly townspeople. Due tribute is also payed to the men of the USS Indianapolis, who delivered the Atom Bomb, and who's return journey was, to say the least, beset with tragedy.When it first came out, it scared me out of going near the local ditch, let alone the beach and later, I had to think twice to even go near the water line. Great use of suspense, great use of music to enhance the expectation and terror, this is a showcase of what a talented director can do with our most existential fears.The movie itself is part monster movie, part guys on a mission movie, part revenge movie and as such is very engaging.Even a quarter of a century after it was made, it hasn't really dated and can be viewed again and again. One of the best movies of all time and possibly the greatest horror movie of all time. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

Here in Amity, your children are safe; or, are they?The third choice as Quint, Robert Shaw, gives one of his best performances and he was not even nominated for an Academy Award.

Horror at its best!,"Steven Spielberg has a long history of successfully adapting books to the big screen, whether it's the Jurassic Park dinosaur adventure by Michael Crichton or the Schindler's List holocaust drama by Thomas Keneally. Jaws is no exception. The movie is based on a suspense novel by Peter Benchley. In essence, this is just a cheesy tale about a killer shark stalking tourists at the beach resort of Amity Island on the American East Coast, but Spielberg manages to make the story into something much bigger! He managed to produce cinema's first big summer blockbuster! He created a film that would make parents tremble when their children were around water. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss make up a unique and lovely trio that adds a lot to the film. Spielberg's creativity and filmmaking is very skillful, but he would never have managed to build up the mystery and horror feeling without the brillant composing of John Williams. He plays on our fear of the unknown and that and it feels property the screen. John Williams succeeds with this score to create one of the most iconic and recognizable film score ever made. I mean, everything from the oldest lady to the youngest child has heard ""Jaws Main Theme"". Ifound the story interesting and the plot was good, but the really beauty in this movies is the impact it had on the reality and the absolutely stunning soundtrack provided by sir Williams!

Every character, every line, every shot, EVERYTHING here is just perfect.The other day I was listening to the JRE episode with Rob Zombie as a guest, and when he and Joe briefly touched on this film, Rob commented about how it was hard to believe that some of the legendary lines were ""just lines in a script at one time."" He's so right. This film is practically an entity of its own.It's a film with no blemishes of age, and I doubt any will develop in the coming decades. Absolutely timeless. Literally every movie fan has a story that goes along with the first time they saw Jaws. For me, it was at my uncle's house who always had a huge film library, only rivaled by the size of his television.

"Truly, one of the greatest pictures ever made.","Truly, one of the greatest pictures ever made.The film is about capturing a killer shark that feeds on humans. It's a spectacle to be seen on the big screen. The first half or three-fourth of the film is about planning how to go about capturing the shark. The last part is all in the sea. It's an amazing film because the way it traverses from scene to scene. The film involves a lot of character build up and a basis for the shark to be killed. It also keeps minimalistic in sound and gets loud only when needed.The sound design and the music by John Williams is a study in itself. The editing is precise and keeps the movie gripping. To be fair, there are hardly any dull moments in the film, even though the end is known. The journey is so interesting that the destination feels like a by-product of the journey.Steven Spielberg grew in stature with this film. I am told by my uncle who saw the film in theater 1970's when it got released that it was indeed a phenomenon and one of his friends does not enter into the water even today that is 40 years after seeing the film he is still afraid of sharks. Though funny, it is indeed true and confirmed by the person itself.It's impactful and must be revered for the change it brought about in mindset and understanding of the sea the nature of sharks.Acting is stupendous and though I don't know any of the cast, they played their roles superbly and are heroic in their own ways.A 4/5 for one the great films ever made, though it lost it's aura a bit as technology got updated, it must be seen for the content.",8.0,Anonymous,Adventure
I'll never put on another lifejacket again...,"""Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies..."" - when I first saw Jaws, I don't even remember the crusty Robert Shaw saying those words, in fact I hardly remember any of the dialogue from the film.  What I do remember, though, was the incredibly frightening fin of the man-eating great white. How it used to glaze on up out of the water like a knife as the ominous thumping of John William's orchestra filled the air with horror.  That was the sign to bury your face into the pillow as the voices of panic began to increase in pitch and power. Needless to say, I was afraid, and still am to a degree, to go into the pool alone. The power and ferocity and terror of Jaws scared me to death when I was five years old, but now it remains on the top ten list of my all time favorite movies. Jaws was something of a problem for me when I was younger.  My parents would say they were going to watch Jaws on the T.V. just to get me out of the living room and into bed.  Now, when I actually sit down and watch the movie (for the thousandth time) it actually is a quite beautiful film.  The dialogue that goes on between Shaw, Schieder, and Dreyfuss is incredible. Shaw delivers an awesome performance - especially in his U.S.S Indianapollis speech.  Dreyfuss and Schieder are both funny and serious and terrified and don't know what to make of Shaw - and my feelings are that the audience doesn't either.  Shaw is not your typical hero, but he is a great character anyway. The real jewel to the film is the score, however.  John Williams, as in all his music, captures the audience in the deadly melody which is mesmirizing, beautiful, adventurous, deadly, bold, and simple all at the same time.  The chase music is especially fun to listen to, but the theme of the music is what everyone remembers. This is such an incredible movie and is not something that you see very often nowadays.  I give it a 10/10 and encourage all who have not experienced the magic of Jaws to get up and go rent it!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure

"Often mimicked, never bettered!","This is one of those films that you can watch every once in a while, even though you know what's coming up. After all these years, Jaws is still a great movie. It's put up with a critical backlash, but only because of parodied rubbish like Piranha, and more recently, Lake Placid.The overall film might appear less than the sum of its parts - that's due partly to the superb performances turned in by Shaw, Scheider and Dreyfus, and their interaction with each other. The other reason is that, despite the wisecracks about rubbery sharks, we don't really see the shark attacking that much; rather, the beauty of the film is about the presumptions we make and the fears we have about what's going on beneath the water, and what's out there in the deep.You should see this film again - bear in mind how old it is, how good it looks, (the locations on Martha's Vineyard are beautiful), and how you'll jump out of your skin in the 'head' scene!

The best movie ever made,"There was never a movie before, and there has never been a movie since that impacted the psyche of people around the world the way that Jaws did. Till this date you can't help but be a bit apprehensive about entering the crests of an ocean break.  You start hearing the deep grumble of the two note score of Jaws approaching.  It is a shame that it has been cheapened by being overplayed on TNT.Jaws is Speilberg's best film by far.  He had to push his creative genius to its edge because unlike his films now, he didn't have a bottomless pile of cash to dip into.  He made you love his characters. It's also beautifully shot.  The shot of Brody sitting on the beach as the Kittner boy is eaten with the camera dollying in and the lens being widened out is used all the time now thanks to this move.Brody, Hooper, and Quint also give us one of the most interesting mismatches of characters ever to grace the screen.  The scene at night in the boat after they've attached the first barrel is the kind of scene that all film makers should be trying to duplicate.  The USS Indianapolis monologue is the kind of speech every actor dreams that a writer could plop in their mouth.In order to truly see if what I say is true, that Jaws is the best film ever,  ask yourself this one question.

Then shark is never shown yet it gives us an uneasy feeling of ""what if?"". What if we had of seen the shark? what gore is it unleashing on this poor girl?  If they had of showed it, there is no way that the scene would have been as scary. Instead Spielberg gives us he IMPRESSION of what is happening.Alex  Kintner's death is much the same.  We see blood although we do NOT see violence.  Our imagination is much worse then the actual truth.Then the Orca scenesThe bad chemistry that is going between Hooper and Quint is very obvious. Then you have Brody who is the common man.  He earns a common salary, being the police chief of a common town with a common wife and common kids.  He is US!!.  The average person.  He has fears, he has family he has a connection to us.  His flash of courage in the ending is very uncommon. When Brody breaks the style from ordinary man to extraordinary man is the key to the movie.  It ends up as a  monster battling (in the end) an ordinary man.The movie of JAWS is not only a definitive point of Steven Spielberg, but the entire horror genre.  The thought of being killed when you went swimming is unimaginable... until JAWS.   After that film people are, and still are today, scared of swimming because of this movie.  If a film of this magnitude has this effect on so many people, then there is no question that you have to see it.**** 1/2",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
Changed the way we view movies,"Jaws is my favorite movie of all time. I loved it as a kid mainly because it had a shark in it and i was in love with them. hahaha. as i have gotten older i have been able to completely appreciate what this movie means to the industry. the first movie as a summer blockbuster, it single handedly gave us the birth of multi-plexs like loews or amc. it broke the 100 million mark, shattering records at the time. people that i know that are younger than i and don't really appreciate what movies were like before cgi complain how the shark looks fake and stupid, but i like that. it gives the movie a sense of ""how did they do that?"" that mystic feeling. and being in 1975 there was no cgi so.. this movie has completely changed movie making and marketing in the US and beyond. i am not saying that star wars wouldn't have done it, but jaws gets the recognition for being first. it is a classic movie with a great story, script, characters, emotions, and history. definitely one of the best movies ever made. and one of few movies viewers can say the movie is better than the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
"You haven't lived until you've seen this, my friends","From the shark's first victim to the compressed air tank explosion, JAWS thrilled me like no other movie.  Steven Spielberg, you're the man! There is no film whatsoever to do with sharks that is more realistic and terrifying than JAWS.",,Anonymous,Adventure
Nowadays often boring,"35 years ago it was awesome. But today the movie has such unnecessary lengths. And the actors still talk to each other like back in the fifties. Well, it is more yelling than talking. Unfortunately this is one movie that didn't make it into the presence without losing most of its power.",4.0,Anonymous,Adventure
And a leisurely ocean dip would never be the same,"I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and was impressed. I had not read the novel but in 1974 Peter Benchley's book Jaws spent most of the year on the best seller list and the film's producers approached the young Steven Spielberg to direct. He was known for the big made for movie hit Duel and had recent success with his first theatrical released film Sugarland Express so he was given the monumental challenge to adapt for the screen a runaway best selling thriller for a summer release. Summer releases were usually relegated to Drive-In movies back in 1975 but because of the film's subject they took a chance on coinciding with the swimming and summer tourist season for maximum effect. The chance of a summer release of a major theatrical release and the use of a relatively unknown director was a big hit. Major summer releases became the norm and Spielberg became a legend. Spielberg would of course go on to direct such major films as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and it's two big Indiana Jones sequels, ET, The Color Purple, the Empire of the Sun, Jurasick Park, Shindlers List and Saving Private Ryan among his big hits. He stumbled with a few misses too but the Spielberg name on any film draws interest and anticipation. Peter Benchley wrote the screenplay of his own novel along with Carl Gotlieb and some contribution from Spielberg. The monologue of the story of the Indianpolis tragedy was drafted by playwright Howard Sackler and screenwriter/director John Milius. One of filmdom's most memorable and effective music scores by John Williams received an Academy Award, one of three the film won including Best Sound and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for Best Picture but lost to One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It also was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, winning one and got seven BAFTA nominations, winning one. Cinematographer Bill Butler had been a second unit photographer on The godfather, Deliverance and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and had been the cinematographer of The Conversation. He only filmed a handful of successful films after Jaws including Biloxi Blues, Stripes and Grease and it's odd that his career nosedived and he was involved with a ton of real bad movies. It's also odd that with the success of Jaw Spielberg never used him again in any of his films. Rexford Metz was the underwater cinematographer. It's basically a simple story of a giant Great White shark who has developed a taste for humans and had began prowling the sea shore of a resort town. It's possesses almost supernatural strength and cunning and the town's police chief wants to stop it but the town's mayor doesn't want tourists to know they have a shark problem. The cop enlists the aid of a young oceanographer, fresh out of college and a WWII Navy veteran who has become a seafaring bounty hunter. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfus and Murray Hamilton star. It's a well done suspenseful drama, well written with shock, horror and a little comedy too. I would give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
One of the greatest stories ever told. Period.,"Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so i'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more.So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, ""We're gonna need a bigger boat"", ""This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propellor, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark"", ""Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!"", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has recieved it has earned.I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a ""making of"", deleted scenes and outakes. Definately money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The ""making of"" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. 10/10 stars, and worth every one! G'night!",10.0,Anonymous,Adventure
