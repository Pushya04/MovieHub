An art-house action flick at it's finest,"I think we all remember hearing about Ryan Gosling right after 'The Notebook' came out. Most men, including myself, neglected the man on his acting ability. It's not a good reason to not really appreciate an actor. But when it comes to romantic flicks like that, i'm not really keen on the subject, or it's actors for that matter. But film by film, this man is starting to impress the hell out of me. Now it's about time to see what kind of chops this man has when it comes to an action film.Believe me when i say this.......it is the coolest damn action flick i've seen in quiet some time. It's not your basic shoot em' picture. It has this slight 'noire' edge to it that makes it shine much brighter than the rest.For starters, let's talk about the pace of the film. Most may call it slow, whereas i call it hypnotic. The lead played by Gosling, is a cold and quiet fellow who barely even speaks, blinks, or give any reference to his emotions. The film is littered with these somewhat awkward pauses by his character........i personally wouldn't call them awkward, because the way the film is presented, it makes them look beautiful. Case in point......in the movie ""Heat"", you know how Dinero, Kilmer, Sizemore, Trejo barely speak to one another. But the overall feeling is just so entertaining to watch? That's the exact same feeling you get when you watch this picture.But as the film rolls on, Gosling's character becomes a bit more vibrant. And by that, i mean more gory. It's not the kind of gore you would expect. Not like Tarantino gore, but more like a David Cronenberg gore. (History of Violence, Eastern Promises). You know, the settle, yet explosive gore that you really weren't expecting......which i love. And then the movie does nothing but climb higher and higher with it's level of intensity. It took this stone cold character, and molded him into one cool ass superhero.But what really sold me on this film was it's overall FEEL. The best example i can give is this........it's a cool mix between ""Heat"" and ""Taxi Driver"", with a very artistic edge. I already said that the movie is hypnotic, and i cannot stress that enough. Once the picture starts, your eyes are literally glued to the screen. The cinematography is fantastic, the musical score is hip and awesome, and the acting is top notch. All these elements were executed to perfection.Bottom Line.......i may go and see this movie again. I rarely ever do that......THAT'S how awesome this was. It's an art-house action flick at it's finest. Both men and women will drool over this movie. If you get the chance, go and see this movie......you will never regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Captivating Mix Of Contemporary And Retro Aesthetics,"'Drive' is a visceral and brilliantly executed vision of art-house action; possibly one of the greatest art-house films to have graced the screen. Nicolas Winding Refn has created a stylised neo-noir thriller that is simply stunning; full of glorified violence and stroking imagery. The soundtrack is amazing, fully reflecting the films mood, whilst attempting to create an atmospheric feel to accompany the gritty action. 'Drive' is a captivating mix of contemporary and retro aesthetics. A stylish and taut thriller that keeps the audience entertained from start to finish with breathtaking sequences, brutal violence and stunning cinematography, a modern masterpiece that has truly redefined the noir genre.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

-Cinema fantastic-,"A truly beautiful and hypnotic film.I've seen the last few Nicholas Winding Refn films, and while I liked both Bronson and Valhalla Rising a lot, they were both ""difficult"" films, in that both structure, pacing and tone were bound to alienate some people, and of course they were both marketed as somewhat mainstream films while being anything but.Part of the irony of Refn's situation is that he makes films about ""Primal"" man- and these protagonists invariably commit acts of great violence on those around them. This violence puts his films into the genre categories that Hollywood recognises and promotes to the public, resulting in trailers for Refn movies that grossly misrepresent the sophistication of the actual film. In that way, Valhalla's intense, slow-burning and almost dialogue-free mythic exploration of our savage past can be repackaged as a ""Vlad the Viking goes to the New World"" action movie.Yet both Valhalla and Bronson were highly ""directed"" films, revealing a very strong hand in control of the material. And so, I was extremely curious to see what Refn would do with the material, and whether he would be able to rein in his sometimes obtrusive style in order to allow the story more room to breathe... I shouldn't have worried. I think the director has managed to balance a genuine artistry with the demands of the genre in a way that is rarely, if ever, achieved. I absolutely loved it. Just stay the hell away from the trailer, as it reveals far too much, and again, misrepresents the film's true ""feel"".Driver has a tone of wry amusement at everything around it, much like Gosling's half-smirk, pivoted on the toothpick perpetually in the corner of his mouth. Schmucky gangsters and mob clichés provide some laughs, but the heart of the film is Gosling's portrayal of the unnamed? main character and his sweet, underplayed romance with Mulligan and her young son.While an ethereal synthesizer-pop soundtrack provides an at-times tender,at-times mythic undercurrent, the car chases and action scenes, when they come, are tense, brutal and brief- far more Eastern Promises than The Transporter. Mulligan plays her character all trembly, wet-eyed, sweet and innocent and is swept away by Gosling's quiet strength and self-assured charm, while Gosling speaks little and remains a mystery to the end, though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature.The seasoned supporting cast are all very fun, except maybe for Kendricks who is relegated to a fairly irrelevant part. Of course, this is really Gosling's film, and he inhabits the character completely, turning what could be a straightforward Hollyood tough-guy role into a complex and contradictory character, self-confident and physical, yet clearly lonely and possessed with a certain peculiarity and stillness, almost reminiscent of De Niro's Travis Bickle.Visually the film is lush and gorgeous. Like Michael Mann, Refn and his cinematographer are able to instill LA with a sense of life and character that most directors just fail to do. Unlike Mann however, Refn opts for warm orange tones over Mann's hard blues, and in one particularly beautiful sequence the familiar LA cliché of driving down the dry LA river is taken to an unexpectedly joyful conclusion.Despite its absolute craftsmanship, Driver is probably not for everybody, which makes me sad. People who prefer bald-headed muscle men slugging and wise-cracking their way into their wallets should of course stay away, as this bears very little resemblance to the standard Hollywood fare associated with the genre, and they might well be disappointed.But for me, Driver was sweet, surreal, mythic, tense, fun, hilarious, revolting, and surprising. See it because it will make you a better person.And so, 10 out of 10, because it deserves it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Best Film of 2011: ""Drive""","At the Theater- ""Drive"" -- This is not an Action film, this is not a ""Car"" movie- It's a character-driven, slow-burn thriller of the first order that features elements of some of the finer works from Directorial royalty like Martin Scorsese, Michael Mann, William Friedkin, Quentin Tarantino, Walter Hill and the late Sam Peckinpah.The film is an electric mixture of beautiful, lingering cinematography, a pulsating soundtrack, lean dialogue and short bursts of graphic, bloody violence. It's tense and involving- almost impossible not to get immersed in. Nicolas Winding Refn is a Director to definitely keep a tab on.Ryan Gosling is the embodiment of some kind of cold fire at the heart of the matter- his ""Driver"" character is a well-intentioned but unstoppable force that will surely end up as a cult favorite for decades to come. Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks and Oscar Issac round out an excellent cast that's pretty much in support but extremely well-utilized.Those wanting to check out a quick and disposable, mindlessly fun popcorn flick need to steer clear- this isn't what you're looking for. This is deadly-serious film-making that's damned-near perfect.It's my favorite film of the year- Hell, it's one of my all-time top faves.9.5 outta 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Film Noir meets Hammer Hardened Hero Maker meets Gangster Heavy Metal,"Ryan Gosling brings down the hammer on that line where logic reason and self preservation become secondary to protecting what is important to you. There are a few moments where he doesn't just cross that line but obliterates it completely.Beautifully crafted pounding action thriller with twisted humor and seriously hard core violence. Compelling tenderness from characters that are unsophisticated in the best sense of the word.This film will go down as one of the best Action films in decades. Car chases that rival and extend beyond Bullitt and French Connection. Violence that bursts out of the screen like a horror film or a bad dream by David Cronenberg. Passing moments of tenderness that are drawn out until you are slowly pulled into the emotional world of the protagonists.Something so powerful, especially when it works, is the use of sharp and dramatic Camera Angles in Drive that mirror the emotional moment of the story drawing you into the characters world.View and angles often extremely low angled and tilted sharply upward, effective at expanding the feeling of voyeurism of being at the dinner table or in the adjacent seat, right in the room with the characters while safely looking up from some shadow or nook or cranny. Very emotionally transcendent cinematography.Night footage was amazingly successful at capturing the range of light and shadows, on a technical level the audio and video were strong and assured. Not only the first robbery but all the way through the film right up to the final resolution of the plot, the night was a familiar environment for major turns in the story (pun intended).I will return hopefully soon to expand on this review, but I had to write something tonight because this film is ten times more badass than any Transporter or Fast and Furious fare that is usually sold in their all too obvious packaging.Drive leaves them all in the Dust.This filmed was viewed on the Big Screen at the LAFILMFEST screening June 17th 2011",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fate? Unknown...,"Drive is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and adapted to screenplay by Hossein Amini from the novel of the same name written by James Sallis. It stars Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Driver (Gosling) has a day job, he's a Hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene (Mulligan) and her little boy Benicio (Kaden Leos), pitching him right into the middle of two wars; one is for his emotional worth, the other with the criminal underworld.Real human being, and a real hero.They cheered at Cannes, it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise, Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables, meaning it wouldn't take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience. Yet Drive is a special movie, the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. There would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to The Fast & The Furious 19, but as its reputation grows, one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.Yes, at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings, where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion, could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. But the material is in excellent hands, with Refn, Sigel, Gosling and co, calmly unravelling Amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. A picture where a look means more than any words can express, a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling, and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence, yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence, beating a mighty heart in the process.Propelling the picture forward is the complexity of Gosling's driver character. He has no back story for us to work from, and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child. He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas (or should that be gris areas?) within the plot structure. We learn just enough to be on his side, a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent, he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles. Helps, too, that he's so cool behind the wheel, where he mines Steve McQueen's effortless charisma. Refn delivers magic moments of car play, from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence, to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit, when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.Gosling is amazing, instantly iconic, soft voice matching his soft blue eyes, toothpick perched between teeth, it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. It's with the calm moments that he triumphs most, be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irene's eyes, Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. Mulligan, too, is wonderful, deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness, their chemistry superb. Isaac does fine work with the ex-con/husband character that is thankfully not stereotypical, Brooks is Colm Meaney like, thriving on simmering badness, while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Driver's garage boss, the closest thing the Driver has to a pal. The only one dimensional character lands in Perlman's court, but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.From the opening pink neon credits, accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack (a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days), it's evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious. Drive is full of classy (yes arty) passages, fluid camera movements, single takes, non central framing of characters, slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted L.A., the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story. He of course is aided considerably by his editor Matthew Newman, and Sigel's photography. The former is dealing in seamless precision, the latter a master of shades (a lift sequence is to, ahem, die for) and colour toning delights. Marking this out as a Blu-ray essential.You can name about ten films that Drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence, and Refn's work here has been touted as an offspring created by Michael Mann, Walter Hill, William Friedkin and Sergio Leone (all viable and all actually high praise indeed). But rest assured, Drive is still fresh and exciting, the perfect movie package. Refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great use of Subtlety,"It would be difficult to write about parts of the storyline in this film, because many expectations change when the consequences of one event folds upon another. A terrific original screenplay defies Hollywood conventions of over-the-top plot convolutions and unrealistic twists. Sure, there are a couple coincidences, but there are many rewards for keeping the story simplified and enhance the characters' arcs. The director borrows heavily from Michael Mann in painting a cool atmosphere with glistening city lights at night and a throbbing synthesiser soundtrack. The film elevates itself above any other similar film in it's drama, perhaps better than the character rich film ""The Town"" from 2010. The editing emphasises the main character's withdrawn persona, hiding his emotions (indirectly hinting at his criminal past) while romancing his neighbour. Moments in conversation where a 'normal' person would express their feelings or be more extroverted, are instead tension filled passages of silence that speak louder than words. With great use of subtlety, the film does wonders in terms of depicting the main character's withdrawn mental state, but still visualising his thoughts and intentions without direct exposition.Another accolade must be given to actor Ryan Gosling in the lead role. We the audience must invest time into this character, which the film keeps in the first person narrative, most activities outside of his knowledge are outside of ours. He must show realistic reactions to danger, even though his past is never quite explained. The right emphasis is given to revealing moments of his capabilities, so when he is set in harm's way, we believe he can stand up to the test. The rest of the cast is well heeled in talent, allowing the sense of naturalism to provide the tone. As you may notice in critical reviews, when a film exposes no obvious weaknesses, the positive rating goes up. I myself am having a hard time exposing any weakness in this film, I felt I was in good hands, and was not annoyed by any plot contrivances. I happen to be a fan of Michael Mann, as must the director of this film, and the right homage elements work for me. I think of this perhaps of the antithesis of ""Fast & Furious"". One of the best films I have seen this year, could even get an Oscar nod with the screenplay or editing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A contender for my favourite of the year so far?,"Yes, very likely. Of a very hit-and-miss year so far, I have seen some gems like Tree of Life, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy(the first two in a way are not for everybody though), Rio and Source Code. And then I saw Drive, which was simply brilliant.Like I said with some of my favourites this year, Drive is not a movie for all. It is a slow-paced movie, but I did not find it ""boring""(a term I hate with a passion, as it is massively overused and hardly ever elaborated upon). For me, just because it is slow-paced, doesn't necessarily mean it is going to be a bad movie, only when other components don't work does it apply to me, which is not the case with Drive.Besides, Drive isn't even the only slow-paced movie around, so I don't know why people have to make such a big deal of it. There are many other movies(Godfather, 2001, Tree of Life, Brokeback Mountain) that are and deliberately so. I feel also that Drive is paced deliberately, for atmosphere.The pauses and the ""sparse"" dialogue to me were just two of many things that made Drive so great. There is such an atmosphere here, one that is very tense and beautiful at the same time. The pauses actually helped to enhance this.Refn does a fine job directing. From his previous work, this director showed promise, and here he delivers all the stops and gives his best directorial job so far here.The story starts off electrifyingly, and then slows down again without ever feeling dull, thanks to the unrelenting violence, that is part of the world that is shown here through the eyes of the title character, and adeptly edited car/chase sequences. The dialogue I also have no problem with, it is memorable without falling into cliché territory. The characters are credible, especially the titular character, whose characterisation is perhaps the most complex of the year.The cinematography is truly excellent, as is the editing, bringing much to the atmosphere and I'd also go as far to say that Drive could very well be the year's most visually stylish film. The colours and scenery are lush on the eyes too. The score is every bit as electrifying as the start of the movie, and manages to raise my adrenaline.Acting-wise I couldn't fault Drive either. Carey Mulligan and Christina Hendricks's roles mayn't be as well written as Gosling's or Brooks', but these two actresses-particularly Mulligan- manage to bring some much needed credibility to them, elevating the characters to a higher level, and Ron Perlman, Oscar Isaac, Bryan Cranston and in particular Albert Brooks are terrific. Ryan Gosling is simply mesmerising, in his best performance to date. It is a quiet, yet very charismatic and intensely brooding portrayal, reminiscent of Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver for characterisation and Alan Ladd in Shane in how the role is conveyed.Last but not least, the elevator scene. Brutal, yet very powerful and moving, I'd say it is a contender for the best scene of 2011. In conclusion, a brilliant film that for fans of films from the 70s and 80s and were expecting a sort of nostalgic throwback in style will appreciate. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tense and Violent but Forgettable,"I think that Ryan Gosling is the new Steve McQueen. That's not a criticism because I really liked Steve McQueen. He was a humble, understated actor who often played roles where violence ensued. This is a movie about getting in over your head through a moral code that requires you to become a protector, even if it's not in your nature. In addition to some pretty incredible car chases and organized mayhem, this gets down to the tussle between the guy who may want out and the guys who won't let him. It's about money and the Albert Brooks character (playing out of his usual element) is a pretty good adversary. He is offhanded in his appearance, but down and dirty in every aspect of his life, and like most wise guys, he doesn't hesitate to kill even his closest compadres. While there are great possibilities, I could never quite understand how one could sit on such opposite poles and keep it going. We are what we do and, of course, Gosling's driver, for all his skill will be made to pay the piper at some point.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Intelligent Adrenaline,"After a summer of cheap thrills, Drive delivers thrills on the cheap. With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising, Refn crafts his most polished, commercial work yet, while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his tough-as-nails art house pictures.Bearing thematic resemblance to Darren Aronofsky's recent output, Drive is like Black Swan in overdrive. The film pins its headlights on the dark implications of unchecked obsession and good intentions gone haywire. That dangerous duality – humanity on the razor's edge of animal brutality – is played to unnerving perfection by Ryan Gosling.Rightly among the most reliable names on the Hollywood marquee, the star of Drive plays a crucible of a character. A friendly, fatherly figure to his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, he's decidedly less so when the two are threatened. A sort of oblique, ultraviolent superhero, the driver leaps to defend the innocent with bloody determination. If the first half of Drive plays as drama, the second is straight up revenge fare.Playing on the juxtaposition of calm and calamity, Refn keeps us on our toes throughout. Quiet moments stretch into suffocating silence, and the explosive violence that inevitably shatters it practically tears the frame in half. The audio is expertly mixed; you'll want to see Drive loud. From its roaring engines and visceral blows to its curt dialogue, the film is an altar to the power of great sound design.In truth, Drive isn't pervasively violent, though its most excruciatingly effective moments leave a memory trail like tire streaks on a sunbaked highway. At the heart of the story is a compelling, surprisingly tender romance. Carey Mulligan has proved herself a similarly reliable talent to Gosling, and has worked in recent years with the likes of Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, and Mark Romanek.Her fragile character's relationship with the driver is subtle and nuanced in a manner atypical of thriller convention. They're not family, they're not even sleeping together. Drive is not a sexy film. Refn fetishizes neither cars nor women; if The Fast and the Furious is the sleek exterior curves of an automobile, Drive is the greasy, undulating pistons. And it's utilitarian at a lean 100 minutes.The rest of the small cast also impresses. Albert Brooks plays against type as a cutthroat crime lord, and a note-perfect Ron Perlman plays his meathead partner. Bryan Cranston of TV's Breaking Bad has a small role too, as employer and confidant to Gosling's character. Their relationships shuffle as lines are drawn and redrawn, but none of them comes away unscathed by the film's end.Drive is either the explosive end to a lukewarm summer movie season or an early autumn adrenaline rush. In machismo, it far outpaces its hundred million dollar competition, leaving overwrought tales of lesser heroes like Thor and Green Lantern in the dust. Its troubled characters, and the bonds of desperation that link them, elevate the film above its genre trappings and shield it from disposable entertainment status.Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is an anomaly. It's like a 1200 horsepower hybrid. And it's one of the best movies of 2011.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"NWR's best film, one of my all time favorites","When I started to get interested into film, I somehow started watching movie reviews on YouTube, and my favorite YouTube movie critic was and still is, Chris Stuckmann. After binge watching many of his videos, I found out that one of his favorite films is Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. I decided to watch it one day, and I was very mixed on it at first. I then watched Chris Stuckmann's Analyzed video on Drive, but after that, I still didn't understand the movie too much. Then, one day, I just had the urge to watch it again. I don't know why, I just did, but watching it the 2nd time was a very mesmerizing experience. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting, and it's complex story makes Drive one of my favorite films of all time. Many people did not like this movie upon its release, and I think it is because of its misleading marketing. The trailers for Drive make it seems like the movie is a straight up action film with the utterly handsome Ryan Gosling in the leading role. The movie is actually a meticulously crafted neo-noir film that doesn't concentrate on the action, but on its complex story. This film is not only one of my favorite arthouse films, but one of my all time favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Less of a film than I had hoped it would be,"It had a lot of elements I enjoyed, and I was entertained throughout - but after seeing it I can't really grasp it's extreme popularity. The very story feels incredibly tiny and insignificant. We meet a getaway driver, he kinda falls in love with a girl, then he gets in some trouble - the end. It was basically like they just wanted to make a movie and threw a screenplay together. A lot about this movie is just plain off.Excluding some odd song picks, the dialog is really plain, at times even cringe worthy. I assume it was mainly by choice, as the acting style is also quite off in an oddly stylized fashion. Gosling and Mulligan makes it work, Oscar Isaac, who plays Mulligan's husband, isn't as lucky and delivers his uninspired lines quite awfully.We get some set pieces that might seem important, primarily the scene in which Gosling, hidden under a prosthetic mask, seeks revenge. However it turns out the mask wasn't needed at all, and very little is done with it, but the visual vibe is unsettling enough. Brooks get a lot of credit for his performance, I find him rather mediocre. Many people in this were way worse than him, and he certainly out-acts Pearlam, who is quite poor.At the end of the day I wanted to like it more than I ended up doing. Though well made enough, a lot of it felt plain ""simple"". Still managed to pull me a long, and it did get my blood pumping a few times, so it's certainly a good enough film - but I wouldn't go further than that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
There is half of a good movie here...,"To be sure, Drive has it's moments. The actors don't let the material down at all, this is a clear case of an editor not knowing when and where to trim. The movie contains a half dozen exceptional set-pieces, but mixed with this is some dialogue ""so corny it would make the pope weep"" and long boring stretches that make the viewer want to yell ""step on it!"".The mortar holding the project together is a unique score by Cliff Martinez that adds an eerie 80's vibe to the entire thing. Bryan Cranston is decent but isn't given much to work with. By the time Albert Brooks waddles into frame for the 2nd or 3rd time I was thoroughly bored. Despite the hype and aspirations to be something greater than it is, Drive suffers from childish dialogue and bad pacing. The opening scene is truly awesome, it's too bad they can't follow it up at all.There are plenty of interesting bits in ""drive"" but the whole is weaker than the sum of it's parts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive through LA,"A haunting movie with a stilted atmosphere reminiscent of Mulholland Drive though in an altogether different genre. The pink credits beginning the movie and the music throughout are pure eighties and set an offbeat tone against the contemporary LA streets and skyline. Great character studies punctuated by violent action scenes keep the audience immersed in this blood bath of a movie. Some powerful performances, stylish direction and intricate plotting complete this strangely understated production. Drive may not deliver box office gold in the short term though will certainly be paying long term dividends as a reference point for future film noir writers, directors and fans.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A genre-defining masterwork!,"Ryan Gosling and Director Nicholas Winding Refn are in for a career best piece of masterwork in ""Drive!"" It is an absolute genre-defining masterpiece, offering limitless set pieces, character development and gritty action. Also, a classy soundtrack and heartfelt presence.Without giving too much away, Ryan Gosling is a Hollywood stunt performer credited as 'Driver.' He is a jaw-dropping presence in the movie, as the main storyline goes into play. With a great performance from supporting leads: Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks, the main plot includes a failed heist and subsequent actions leading to gritty circumstances. Ryan Gosling's mysterious 'Driver' steals the show with his unique portrayal and set of skills.The relationship between Gosling and Mulligan is so melodramatic, especially with his connection to her young son. Though Gosling's gritty approach of his role suggests 'Driver' has a dark and sufferable past, it is seemingly not enough to secure a relationship between the pair - especially when Gosling has one last up front score to settle with villainous mobster Albert Brooks.Nicholas Winding Refn offers a lot of magnificent attributes to being an achievable filmmaker here. He accomplishes this by delivering a unique, questionable, intense and gritty action thriller that will leave audiences on the edge of their seat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Oh My Love,"I'm not going to lie, before I saw this movie I thought Ryan Gosling was just another chick flick heart throb but damn my perception of him is blown.A movie so embedded with the style of classic film-noir and stylish new genre of art-house action. something that's rare in movies, though the plot is so plain, its what makes the movie fantastic, its not complex its not twist filled. May come off a little slow, but it catches you off guard, and that's what makes film great.Poetic yet violent, malnourished yet gruesome. Its a tribute to all those 80s action films with that retro feeling and cool vibe, a tale of a forbidden love and mafia heist. A protagonist which everyone can relate to, a man driven by nothing, a loner on a road with nothing and no one on it, though when something special comes along, his whole world changes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A very cool movie, bound to start a deserved cult following, and featuring a brilliant leading performance from Gosling.","Ryan Gosling is fast becoming one of the most exciting actors working today. It's nice to see him overcome the 'heartthrob' status achieved thanks to his role in the overrated ""The Notebook"" and work on genuinely interesting, and challenging projects like his latest, ""Drive"".The film thrives on his excellent performance. Whether getaway driving or charming Carey Mulligan, he's nothing short of riveting to watch. As an action hero, this guy makes Liam Neeson in ""Taken"" look like a whimpering pussy in comparison. Simply put - he's awesome, and utterly sells this character. I look forward to another quality performance from Gosling in the upcoming ""Ides of March"".I was lucky enough to see this film at its (apparently) second screening in the world, at the Wellington International Film Festival in New Zealand. It was obviously massively popular during this screening, rousing an opening introduction speech (it was the festival's closing night film) and an enthusiastic clap from the audience at the climax. It's not hard to see why audiences embraced ""Drive"". It's both an unpredictable and exciting outing for action fans, but all the same well-observed and gritty, which will no doubt appeal to indie viewers.The film's stunning cinematography envelopes the audience in the proceedings. The adrenaline-fueled car chases are furiously shot and nothing short of thrilling. Director Refn's camera also beautifully captures the Los Angeles skyline and the sprawling lights of the city. It's some of the best photography there's been of this city that I've seen in a film.There are a couple of really well-filmed ""shock"" moments worth mentioning. One is in a car parking building and one a hotel bathroom, both featuring gunshots. Both are jump-of-your-seat scenes at their very best. Refn constantly keeps the audience on their toes, and there's no way to predict what will happen next. That's one of the most refreshing things about ""Drive"".Carey Mulligan could've been utilized a little more, especially in the film's final third, where she sort of just disappears. It's disappointing because she really gives the movie a heart in her handful of scenes with Gosling. I was glad she wasn't reduced to a typical ""damsel in distress"" role (the film actively avoided action movie clichés, much to my delight), but she could've been included somehow.Overall, it's small complaint in a very ""cool"" movie that a lot of people are going to love. Is the movie likely to be a little overrated and over analysed? Probably a little. Is it going to start a cult following and does it deserve said following? Most definitely. It's a refreshingly unpredictable and well-made roller-coaster ride featuring another excellent performance from one of Hollywood's hottest talents in Gosling, who is proving himself to be one of the most reliable leading men in modern cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

to: everyone who worked on this film,"Dear everyoneWTF was this?SincerelyMeP.s.: aside from the first five minutes (seriously, if that part was made into a 2 hours film, I'd have given 10/10) the whole film is terribly boring, sometimes interrupted with unnecessarily violent scenes. The latter is like a question to the audience: are you still awake? No? Then here is something loud for you. The whole movie is just... SLOW!The conversations have some long pauses in them, seriously, I didn't pay to watch two people staring at each other without a word for minutes! If you don't have enough content to make a feature film, don't make one. Even the more action-based scenes (not too many, believe me) were slowed down for sh*ts and giggles. I never used to be the guy who gets off on special effects or blockbusters, but there is little to none actually likable features in Drive.I'm not the one to decide if it's worth watching or not, but if you like movies with actual plot and dynamic action, Drive might not be your film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good Artsy Neo-Noir,Unnamed man (Ryan Gosling) is a skilled LA driver who takes jobs for whoever is willing to pay. He also works at an auto shop owned by Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who books him the driving jobs. He befriends new neighbors Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her kid. Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) gets released from prison. Standard is in debt to Albanian gangster Cook (James Biberi) who forces him to rob a pawnshop. The Driver steals a car to be the getaway driver for the sake of his neighbors. Things go wrong and Standard is shot. Cook's accomplice Blanche (Christina Hendricks) and the Driver escape with a massive amount of money.It's not as fun as it should be. It's not as intense as it should be. Ryan Gosling's stoic demeanor may have something to do with that. Also the twists and turns with so many characters can be very confusing. It's an artsy neo-noir film which is not necessarily everybody's taste.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A master piece of Art,"This film is magnificent. The director combines a quite violent story with an incredibly good film technique that plays with the lights, music and gorgeous photography to build ever lasting moments of deep melancholy and sensibility. The film follows an hypnotic pace that using musics and silences that create extremely intense moments. Ryan Gosling does a superb performance in a role where he is only using 100 words at most to express a varied rainbow of feelings that goes from love to anger, and from tenderness to revenge. I was surprised by how much he was able to communicate saying so little. I haven't seen such an artistic piece since the Black Swan. Regardless of the story, it is a pleasure to watch such a unique piece of art. Nevertheless, the story is quite good so I give this film a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Not very good.,"Interesting to look at, including some stunning scenes of ultra-violence, this movie would best be watched with the sound down. The acting of the lead was sparse, but for the most part intriguing. The supporting roles were weak. Cartoonish mobsters swearing clichés sounded juvenile and not in the least frightening. Bryan Cranston, who I like generally, played a caricature role that reminded me of Burgess Merideth in the first Rocky. The only compelling supporting role was that of Oscar Isaac who brought some serious intensity to his role.A movie can be artistic without being stupid. There are a couple scenes in this movie that are outright ridiculous. If this is a great movie, then the bar has been lowered for greatness.Good looking, hit-and-miss soundtrack, good lead acting, poor supporting acting, and peppered with several amazing action sequences. Wait for streaming. Meanwhile, watch Vanishing Point (1971) if you want to see a great, artsy, driving movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Feels authentic,"""Drive"" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends action, suspense, and poignant storytelling into a mesmerizing experience.At its heart, the film is a character who is never named, he is just referred to as ""the Driver"" (played by Ryan Gosling), a nameless Hollywood stuntman, mechanic, and professional underworld getaway driver. He is quiet, enigmatic, and violent when the occation arrives. He reminds me of the Terminator movie.Director Nicolas Winding Refn crafts a visually stunning and stylistically unique film, with each frame meticulously composed to evoke a sense of tension and unease. The pulsating synth soundtrack adds another layer of atmosphere, perfectly complementing the film's neo-noir aesthetic.Gosling delivers a mesmerizing performance, conveying emotions with subtle expressions. His character's moral ambiguity and simmering violence are offset by moments of tenderness and vulnerability.The supporting cast, including Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, and Albert Brooks, deliver equally compelling performances, fleshing out a world populated by complex and morally ambiguous characters.Really, Albert Brooks, delivers an incredible performance in the role of a villain; I have never seen him be a villain before.""Drive"" is a masterclass in visual storytelling, with its gripping narrative, breathtaking cinematography, and haunting score leaving a lasting impression on me even as the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Violent but stylized flick promoting adultery and Hollywood stereotypes,"Drive is about a couple of thugs in LA, a stuntman turned driveway driver turned brutal murderer, his limping fatherly friend, one unfaithful and confused criminal wife, virtually every one in the movie is in fact mob related and pretty cruel. They live miserable lives, and meet miserable deaths, stabbed in the eye, slashed in the wrists and hands (with artful if disg usting mobster ""compassion""), slaugh tered and left to bleed out, stumped on angrily and repeatedly like a cockroach, heads blasted in minute detail, romantically drowned on the edge of the ocean, all these deaths are seen by the wicked sin-romanticizing director as an opportunity to exercise his cinematic style and hypocritical misandry, and are crafted with love and dedication of a mythical sharkopath. Despite of this gratuitous violence the protagonist thinks of him self as a hero, and that he is a hero wannabe we are reminded by some annoying music through the movie, he even leaves a million dollars behind for no logical reason but don't expect logic when you can have f-reaking-art. Just as director thinks of himself as a great master of style, and not some misanthropic self satisfied Hollywood member that vents his hatred of the world using some over the top film violence that he sells as transgressive, just as the movie was sold by a deeply misleading trailer. He failed at the box office, but his cinematographic trickery nevertheless amount to some pretty amusing shots, that people who think of themselves as f-reaking-art lovers, heroes of their own delusions, but are in fact a much emptier bunch, interpret as beautiful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Simply wonderful,"Nicolas Winding Refn's previous film, VALHALLA RISING, an existential Viking epic with Mads Mikkelsen, was a breath of fresh air for this tired reviewer. I immediately marked out Refn as somebody to watch, and while his prison biopic BRONSON was a little disappointing, I waited with interest to see what his next movie would be. Well, DRIVE was it, and the good news is that it's his best one yet.The story is simplistic, as is always the case with Refn: the hero is a getaway driver by night and a stunt driver by day. Through no fault of his own he gets caught up in a scam involving some deeply unpleasant gangsters, and it all kicks off from there. Refn's gameplan is to contrast moments of serene beauty and tranquility with shots of unflinching and bruising violence and it works a treat; this is one of the best and most memorable movies I've seen in a good while.Everything about this movie is great: the moving soundtrack, the exquisite camera-work, the subtle yet profound performances. Ryan Gosling is a new to me star, but his acting works a treat; he's as iconic as Eastwood back in the day. I don't even like Carey Mulligan but even I have to admit she's on good film, too, as are the various old timers (Ron Perlman, Albert Brooks, and Bryan Cranston).The first half of DRIVE leads you to wondering where it's all going to go, but in the second half it all slots together nicely and becomes more predictable. That's not to say the predictability is a negative though; Refn knows exactly how to handle his thematic elements, leading to confrontations that pay off beautifully. This is a superb film throughout and one I can't wait to see again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great movie,"A really great and difficult film.All the actors incredibly embody the characters of the characters they play, both evil and good.The specific charm of the film lies in the very strong emotional connection between the Driver and Irene, which is pure, romantic and very tender.From the beginning, we root for these good people to succeed in a very difficult environment, but a little bit from the middle of the film we sense that it will be difficult to achieve.Los Angeles, which by its name should be the City of Angels, is actually presented through countless movies as a city of demons, as a city from hell for good people.People who trample on their humanity and conscience and for whom money and fame are the motives to go to some extreme limits, mostly succeed in it.The message in the film is unfortunately this: a good guy who wants to get away from evil can't because he's trying to help the people he's caught; a penitent who comes out of prison can't have a second chance because disgusting and evil people don't allow it, a good girl with a child can't do a normal job because evil people's goals can be achieved through her, a good man like Shannon turns to a horrible villain for help Bernie, not a normal person, and that's for the reason of achieving a successful business, and in the end, two hideous criminals without conscience cause pain to everyone and spoil everything, until their similar end.The bright and good thing in the film is that both the Driver and Irena with their son Benicia survived and at least we hope for a happier future for them, and also most of the negative characters suffered.Great acting by Ryan, really good ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

By saying it I'm mostly talking about those lakes of blood. Some part of me still thinks there must have been a more proper way to do it.The musical score deserves special mention.

"A stylish, deliberate film that will divide audiences.","Drive is the best film of 2011. I'd probably put it a touch above two polar-opposite types of films;The Descendants and Midnight in Paris(both great).Nicolas Winding Refn has an eye and an ear for direction. This is easily the most stylish film since Michael Mann's Early Work, or William Friedkin's ""To Live and Die in L.A."". This is a 'throwback' film. It's deliberate pacing and basic story-line will likely turn- off those in search of a new ""Fast and Furious"" entry, but for those in search of a film that was ""cared for"", a film that oozes perfection with nearly every frame, THIS IS IT!The cinematography is awesome. Angles, lighting and colors that would make Kubrick proud.And the music... my god the music... I'd pay 30 bucks to go see this at the local IMAX tonight if it were there.The story is a rather basic, fairly-good-guy mixing with fairly-bad- people storyline. This is a lead character that we can root for, but the script is so bare that we hardly know him. That's part of the intrigue here. He's the ""man with no name"".. the driver.. that's it. THis is Michael Mann's ""Thief"" all over again, only better(omg did I just say that, OK fine Thief's equal then). It's a hard-edged, stylish juggernaut of a film.It's not perfect. There are some issues with the opening scene(as great as it is), and the film could use a touch more dialog.Ask yourself what kind of movie-goer you are before you watch this. Are you a ""popcorn-movie-person"" that likes the big-budget CGI stuff, or are you a film-buff or a person who really takes in the intricacies of direction and style.There's really no middle ground here - this is definitely an 'art' film.It's also a terribly violent film. The kind of violent that only a European, Aussie, or Scandinavian director knows. I don't know why they do a better job of it, but they do. Blood looks real, knives are the preferred weapon, and realism that is often hard to watch. Perhaps it's that regional-background-edge, coupled with his eye and ear, that push this film into ""elite"" status. This film would fit in any of the last 4 decades and still be considered a masterpiece in any of them. There's a grit to this polished diamond too, and that is what makes it truly unique. It's like Von Trier, Villenueve, and Michael Mann had a Baby and you died and went to movie heaven.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An amazing film with great style.,"When I first saw the trailer to Drive, I instantly thought of Korean cinema. Whether it was the hammer carried by Gosling, or something else, i'm not sure. The influence of foreign film is clear in Drive. The story of Drive is a very simple and perhaps overused one. A silent and reserved getaway driver who doesn't normally get involved with people starts to form a relationship with a woman and her kid, causing everything to go downhill from there. Even though this story has been told before, the way it is told in Drive makes it seem fresh. Drive also has a very 80's feeling to it. The soundtrack is not only amazing but filled with 80's influenced music. It works so well with the movie and will stick out even to people who don't pay much attention to soundtracks. I had heard a lot of good things about Drive and in the end, it lived up to it. Also, I would kill for that scorpion jacket.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

But this guy's world changes the day he meets Irene (Carey Mulligan) in the elevator of the building where he lives. The Driver who lives in an apartment in Echo Park, Los Angeles, has no name and no signs of any real personal life. The driver has the reputation of driving the fastest getaway car around. The Driver works repairing cars and as a Hollywood stunt driver by day and a getaway driver for criminals by night. The cars the Driver uses are provided by his mentor and boss, Shannon (Bryan Cranston) a crippled, washed-up body shop owner. The Driver lives in an inconspicuous apartment complex, in a sparsely decorated room, down the hall from a charming young woman named Irene and her six-year-old son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). One day the Driver helps out when Irene's car breaks down and she invites him back home. Over a glass of water, she explains that her husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is in prison and she is raising her son alone. Some Heroes Are Real !. There Are No Clean Getaways !.

Its's a slow-moving ming but well paced with a good sense of narration and attractive scenes. Nicola Refn, winner of the best director award at the Cannes festival for this film, adapted James Sallis's novel of the same title to film, adding a stirring muscical score by Cliff Martinez with marvellous songs and colorful cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel. This is a dramatic thriller in which the action is subordinate to the plot, There's also a wonderful love story which develops little by little in a sensitive style, without the need for the already very common sex scenes. It is magnificently performed by a great cast with plenty of magnificent main and support cast, such as: Ryan Gosling as the starring guy who barely speaks and rarely shows any real emotions, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks, Ron Perlman and brief appearance by veteran Russ Tamblyn.The motion picture was competently directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Despite directing Drive (2011), Refn doesn't have a drivers' license. He failed his driving test 8 times. Nicolas usually sets his films in Copenhagen, Denmark and frequently uses handheld cameras. The color red is frequently shown throughout all of his films. Winding Refn shoots all his films in chronological order and without rehearsal. Nicolas has made nice and successful films, such as: Valhalla Rising, Bleeder, Only God forgives, Circus Maximus, Bronson, The Neon Demon , saga Pusher, due to the commercial failure of Fear X (2003), he was forced to expand his successful debut feature Pusher (1996) into a trilogy, the sequels became huge successes and saved him financially.

One of Ryan Goslings best performance,"One of Ryan Goslings best movies, not only is it iconic but the film itself is just amazing. Gosling gives a unique performance in this compared to his other roles, he still plays that quiet loner type character mixed with his charming romantic character but he ranges with new emotions with more darker tones and his little dialogue through the film allows for him to be a more intense presence and gives him the opportunity to use his face and expressions/body language to perform. Silence is used a lot in the film to create some really intense sequences. The cinematography was great and the music is iconic and amazing! It's a really intense film that is really violent when it comes to it, the story is very engaging and fast paced to allow this crime thriller to really engross you.

Pop rocks and bloody gloves.,"There's not much to say that hasn't been said a thousand times already. Pop rocks and bloody gloves. From the second the film started I was sucked into the visual style that Nicolas Winding Refn had injected it with, and once the credits began I was convinced the film wasn't going to disappoint. The movie opens with a heist and it's an impressive show of palpable intensity, where Refn gets us to care about this guy that we just met and has yet to say a word. Ryan Gosling sitting silent in the car, the only noise being a police radio in the car detailing the scenario as it plays out without us, it was such an effective technique and immediately draws you in. In this day and age, it's hard to really get taken away by a film, but this one does just that. It takes you to another place and keeps you there for the duration.Another thing that films generally fail to do currently is make you understand the gravity of violence. It's so common-place and jazzed up in film that it's just expected at this point. Drive is one of the more violent films I've seen recently, but it does the exact opposite; it makes you feel every drop of blood that hits the pavement. With a Cronenberg-like approach to it, very in your face and blunt with no musical score backing it up, every scene of violence becomes gripping and brutal. In fact, the moments of graphic violence are the least stylized ones in the picture. With his cool, ferocious stare Gosling really packs them with a punch.I know the main complaint for the film is that the characters aren't very well-developed, but I don't see that so much. Yeah, we don't get a lot of surface development for them, but I think the actors do a magnificent job of really playing who these people are underneath the surface. Driver is that loner who falls into love and it changes his whole life. Irene (played with lovely grace by Carey Mulligan) is the woman who got married and had a kid too young and is getting a taste of the kind of high school crush that makes her feel free and alive again. Shannon (played with surprising vulnerability by Bryan Cranston) is the guy who has been dragged through the mud his whole life, no matter how much hard work he puts in to stop it. The cast is loaded with remarkably talented actors and they all do a fantastic job of bringing what was underneath the surface to our attention.They make these peoples real while Refn creates this vintage, bubble gum on a blood-stained boot sensation that pours through every scene. Gosling's suave exterior is hiding a very enraged, borderline psychotic man hiding just underneath. Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks are an excellent yin and yang of the criminal world, the former being loud and violent while the other is soft and visceral. The soundtrack is one of the best in quite a while, perfectly capturing the tone that Refn sets to achieve and making the whole thing so vibrant and alive. This is one of those films where everything just pulls itself together so well and vibes without a crack in the shell, bringing you into it's unique world and taking you on a wild journey that will stick with you. There are so many memorable scenes and I had to grab the soundtrack the moment it was over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

He has his rules, doesn't want to know anything about anyone, or the crime. In the intro we witness one of those getaways. It's pretty thrilling stuff.During the day our driver works as a stunt driver for the movies and also at a garage. His boss/mentor/handler is Shannon. He dreams of having the kid drive a race car but he needs 400k to make that happen. He turns to a sleazy mobster- a former movie producer- who in turn is involved with another mobster who runs a pizza place.One day the driver falls in love with some ugly kid next door and eventually with his mom. But soon thereafter her convict husband is released from jail. One day he's beat up and the driver gets involved for the sake of the kid and the mom. The ex-con owes some protection money to some guy. To get the money he has to rob a pawn shop. Driver decides he will be the driver for the job. The job goes wrong and ex-con is killed. Now driver has a million bucks in his possession.The universe of this movie is fairly limited so they are forced to create all these coincidences for the sake of the story and to avoid hiring more actors. It turns out that the protector guy is also involved with the two mobsters and the million dollars belong to them somehow. Which means they are going to go after the driver and after the kid and mom if he doesn't deliver the money. Even though the movie takes place in LA, the world of thugs is so small that no one can escape and everyone can be easily found. Driver is now forced to become an ultra violent but suave criminal himself to guard the people he loves.Drive is very well done for what it is. In fact, with another director, this movie could have been unwatchable. The main character and others don't say a whole lot, you have repeated shots of the guy driving in his car at night, and even more long slow motion shots of the back of his 80s jacket embroidered with a scorpion. Sometimes the director overdoes it, too. When the two main characters flirt, they just stare at each other and smile, that scene goes on just a bit to long, and the shots of the jacket get annoying at some point. So does the music. At first it's enjoyable, but then it gets obnoxious when scenes are put on mute, put in slow motion and with loud music. It is a success that with so little, the director manages to make you care about what happens. Acting is very good overall. Brooks in particular is interesting in this role. This movie isn't perfect or faultless. It's an engrossing movie, with some excellent action scenes, some surprising violence, and plenty of weaknesses, the strangest of all being the ending, where our driver shows his heart of gold, I guess, and that he doesn't care for money but only for love.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Wa.. Wait a second. A REAL film... in 21st century cinema?""","They were my exact words after getting a feel for this film.I'll be honest; when I first read, ""A mysterious Hollywood stuntman, mechanic and getaway driver lands himself in trouble when he helps out his neighbour."" I had no interest in viewing this title. I just though it would be too much like Transporter (Jason Statham)and that film bored me to tears; but, boy, was I wrong! Drive is not a movie, it's a piece of art.My friend convinced me to watch it and I've been thanking him ever since. The film is so stylish and has such a 'noir' feel to it. Definitely the coolest film of 2011.One thing I can guarantee is you'll be after the soundtrack once you see this film. Absolutely perfect. It is so strange, yet it works for the movie so well. Nicolas Winding Refn ceases to hypnotise me with his fantastic direction and dedication to detail. Ryan Gosling truly shows his stuff in this movie. I was so shocked by some of his actions and equally shocked by his mental threshold. His character is stone face and so mysterious, it's great; and he is, of course, supported by some fantastic actors, one definitely being Bryan Cranston... that man is a God! This is a very unique film and it can't be missed, I'm glad I changed my mind about watching it. After so many tacky flicks, this has restored my faith in cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A recent cult classic,"Don't expect page after page of dialogue, if it can be said in a look or body movement then that's what we are given. Drive is a taut thriller from director Nicolas Winding Refn. A simplistic story with excellent car scenes and a hefty dollop of bloody violence. Ryan Gosling has never been more cool or indeed handsome in a role with a lot of depth. Gosling masterfully takes us from start to finish. The soundtrack is fantastic and the scorpion jacket has become an iconic symbol for this film. Carey Mulligan has great chemistry with Gosling. Oscar Isaac is amongst the supporting cast with the only downside being his lack of screen time. Albert Brooks has an everyman quality to his bad guy role as Bernie, who is not exactly menacing but dangerous and unpredictable nonetheless. The central love story will of course put off anyone who only expects constant action, violence and car chases but this romance is the reason you want the main characters to survive. Special mention to the editing, sound design, music and cinematography in what surely has already become a recent cult classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Killer Soundtrack. Dark. Moody. Intense til the last minute.,"This movie is incredible from start to finish. I saw it when it first came out in 2011 & just watched it again & enjoyed it even more the second time. It's suspense right from the jump. I've never seen a movie that creates so much from silence. The silent scenes were the most intense. The chemistry between Ryan & Carrie was palpable. The only reason I'm not giving this a ten is I wish I'd seen a little more between them. Everything else was top notch. The music. Nightcall by Krazinsky is still a regular in my rotation since seeing this movie the first time 13 years ago. The soundtrack def gave this movie a flare. This movie was moody, dark & intense. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Highly recommend!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A homage to the 80s that sometimes borders on the farcical.,"From the moment the movie starts there is a sense of the familiar and yet unfamiliar as our eerily calm protagonist avoids capture in a intelligent car chase probably more realistic than anything shown on screen in recent years.The direction and cinematography of the movie is smart, creating a vision of LA that seems familiar from movies such as Collateral and Terminator 2. The scene driving though downtown LA with the synthy 80s soundtrack particularly reminiscent of the Foxx/Cruise vehicle.And yet for all this, the violence in the movie seems to border on farce with way too many visceral over-the-top deaths that don't seem necessary to the plot at all. Perhaps this is also paying tribute to the slew of megakill movies that came out in the 80s (Commando / RoboCop / Red Heat to name a few). Violence isn't portrayed in the same way by Hollywood anymore; it feels cliché, a pastiche.Ryan Gosling does an impressive turn as an almost unfazeable anti-hero. Carey Mulligan pouts a lot in a dreamy whimsical fashion and is believable in a too young to be a mother way. Ron Perlman totally hams it up in a very enjoyable turn as a shady crook trying to make it big. Bryan Cranston proves once again his versatility in a being a mechanic that constantly gets life decisions wrong making him and others surrounding him pay for it.Some tighter editing and this movie could have gone the way of being a classic and will certainly do well in the box office.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Drive, god damn it, Gosling","A good thriller that makes you smile, and to some extent sad. Feels like a small snippet of a life story from a bigger piece that could have been shown, but what it is, is what it is.The soundtrack is memorable, what to say about the acting of Ryan Gosling and the other actors. The character of the main character is conveyed very well. The plot is okay, but not to say bad or great. Pleasantly surprised not superficial context. Everything in general is done well.As mentioned earlier, the movie feels a bit understated, not because of the ending, but because of the possible breadth of the story that could have been shown more if not for the plot based on the book. Despite the good realization of the plot as a whole, the actions that take place are partly incomprehensible to me, possibly wrenching, and somehow everything lies as it happens.Overall, the movie is enjoyable to watch. It doesn't feel dragged out or tedious, but it doesn't feel like a unique movie. This movie is a great middle ground that can be separated from the general mass of average movies for casual and enjoyable viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great thrill ride,"The stereotypical ""White Knight"" appears in many films, but the role of the Driver ranks as one of the most brutal and explosive, while maintaining heroism to date.Drive, directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and released on September 16, 2011 in the United States, is a beautiful art-house film reminiscent of the Tarantino's style in Pulp Fiction. Ryan Gosling gives an explosive performance in a movie that is surprisingly but tastefully minimalist.The film stars Ryan Gosling as the Driver, an unnamed professional driver who holds jobs as mechanic and stunt driver during the day, and has a secret identity as a getaway driver. The Driver meets a girl, Irene (Carey Mulligan), in his apartment elevator and falls in love with her, even though she is married and her husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is in jail. After the two have bonded and everything seems to be going well, Standard returns from jail with a debt to pay, which jeopardizes the safety of the girl and her son. The Driver decides to help Standard repay his debt and keep Irene and her son safe by driving for a heist being pulled by Standard as repayment.The cinematography is one of the main factors why the film is so successful. Refn took great care to create an amazingly real experience. During the tensest parts of the film, where a Hollywood movie would have used music to create suspense, Refn relies on the uncomfortable silence (successfully) to create tension. The film is set in gritty Los Angeles and has intertextual references to Walter Hill's The Driver through similar plots, setting in downtown Los Angeles, and mainly silent protagonists.Drive is a great thrill ride that is truly beautiful, and adds a real, believable atmosphere to the world in which it is set. This brutal but tasteful film will be enjoyably experienced by many.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A driver doing some illegal stuff for making money fall for her neighbor and goes too far for her and lends himself in some deep trouble.,"Drive: I wont say that the movie drives me crazy but yeah you would not often see a movie in which your lead actor doesn't have a name and that is something different. The story is about a driver who is perfect in his Driving,skilled in killing,quiet in talking,and a quiet lover who would not say a thing to the girl but have taken the whole mess for her by helping her hubby and getting into some deep trouble from which he gets out by killing all the bad guys(though the ending is not so good). The plot is that the Driver has fallen for her neighbor who is married to a guy who is in prison but when he gets out he is in deep debt so the Driver decides to make it for him.The movie doesn't have much Car stunts like the Fast n Furious but what it does have is Ryan Gosling who's got a style of his own. If you are a real Ryan Gosling fan, then I'll say you should go for it. Its worth it but one time watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Emperors New Clothes,"Seriously people, don't believe the ridiculous hype about this movie, it is without doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in the last year. My wife and I are huge movie fans and watch on average 5 new films a week, 10 minutes into this film we are both looking at each other with a 'is this movie for real' look on our faces, and by the end we realised we had just wasted 2 hours of our lives we would never get back again.Rylan Gosling is a total joke from start to finish, his total lack of any script is just the start, in fact by the end of the film (and yes we did make it to the end, somehow) I was glad he still wasn't saying much, and the little that did come from it was just clichéd nonsense. This man cannot do the strong silent brooding type at all, especially not wearing a daft white satin jacket with, wait for it ..... a scorpion on the back, and a toothpick in his mouth.The plot, what there was of it, is so old and tired and so overdone, the whole film was completely predictable. None of the characters have any depth or interest to them, probably due to the lack of any script. Even Carey Mulligan, who is a real favourite of ours, was wasted and looked rather uncomfortable in her rather dull character - the single mum at home. And the clichés just continued at Ryan became the child's new 'best friend'.The violence is also completely at odds with the rest of the film. It is extreme, graphic and vicious, which is fine and dandy if the rest of the film demands it, unfortunately this film doesn't and it looks like it's been thrown in just for shock value.I really cannot understand why such a piece of second rate and boring drivel has got such amazing reviews on here and from some critics. Just before this we watched The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly again, now that has everything this movie doesn't but seems to be trying so hard to emulate - characters that aren't black and white, minimal dialogue to add to the tension, and stunning camera-work to keep you captivated.Save your time and money and watch this classic instead, Drive has nothing to offer but annoyance and the WORST soundtrack I've ever heard.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliantely done!,"This is my first review ever because I got annoyed by some nasty comments I've read here.I think humankind has lost its perception about what's good and what's bad in movie industry. With all the Transporters, Transformers, all the Fast and Furious series and the look alike, they give bad reviews about Drive because it lacks all the clichés from the previous mentioned. I feel bad for them because they're blind in front of a masterpiece and cheerful and encouraging to blockbusters made only to appear in cinema just for the money and fame.I admit, I wanted to see this movie because of Ryan Gosling. And once again, he did not disappoint me. I've seen most of his movies and I think this is his best role, yet. I rarely see a performance like his in Drive and when I see it, I know it will be stuck in my mind for a long time. If I wasn't already a fan, I would've become after Drive. The way he plays The Driver was worthy of an Oscar and it's a pity he was not put in the race for the award.I loved everything about it. The director did an amazing job, making this movie. All of the actors were wonderful in their roles and there were some moments absolutely breathtaking. I give it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Everything has a reason in this film, the color, the fable of the frog and the scorpion, the darkness of the protagonist, it's perfect. Great choice if you like Noir films.

"When Ryan Gosling Drives, You Shut Up and Enjoy","You're sitting there, expecting an action flick with gunfire on every corner, but Drive grabs you by the throat with its cold atmosphere, sleek aesthetic, and a hero who speaks as much as a Buddhist monk on Xanax. Ryan Gosling doesn't need to drop Schwarzenegger-level one-liners to get his point across. He gives you icy stares, and it feels like every silence is a bullet to the heart. This guy is a Terminator disguised as a stunt driver. When he drives, it's Fast & Furious-but without the tank tops and cheap pyrotechnics.Ever watched a movie where the opening scene makes you realize you've signed up for pure bliss? Well, Drive is that. The first sequence is perfection, down to the millimeter. You're there, tense as a wire, watching Gosling play cat and mouse with the cops like a kid with Hot Wheels cars. No useless dialogue, just pure, clean, crisp action. Nicolas Winding Refn is a cinema surgeon. He slices your retina with precision, and you're glued to the screen, thinking, ""OK dude, you've got the game on lock.""Ryan Gosling is the quietest action hero in cinema, but when he strikes, it's a tsunami. The guy takes you out with two hammer blows and goes back to his garage like nothing happened. He's John Wick, but the minimalist version. While some heroes spit punchlines, he pulls out a toothpick and lets you know he's about to wreck you without saying a word. And when he smiles, that's when you're truly scared. This guy is a machine, like Neo taking the red pill to become an angry taxi driver.I'm not mentioning the soundtrack just to fill up the review-this one's legit. Drive isn't just a movie to watch; it's something you listen to. The music makes you feel the vibe from head to toe, plunging you into this neon-lit asphalt world. When you hear Kavinsky's Nightcall or A Real Hero, you just want to hit the streets, eyes on the rearview mirror, and foot to the floor. This soundtrack isn't just an accessory; it's a character in its own right.Even the villains in Drive have style. You've got Bryan Cranston playing the lovable screw-up, and Albert Brooks, who looks like a nice guy but pulls off mobster moves. Everyone here is potentially dangerous-from the hot dog vendor to the guy coming out of the garage. It's not the cliché Italian mafia with suits and flashy rings; it's more insidious, more grounded. If you mess with these guys, you're dead before you even say ""hello.""In the end, Drive is a film that knocks you out without exploding. A masterclass in control that proves you don't need pages of dialogue to capture attention. Gosling stares, the camera follows, and you get a cinema lesson. It's beautiful, cold, violent, and most of all, it's a movie you need to watch with the volume cranked up to fully enjoy the experience. In short, Refn brought out the heavy artillery in silent mode, and you'll be drooling over this visual gem for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"I really feel it deserved an ""X"" rating for violence.","Lots of emotional reviews on here, and understandably so. The movie is not complicated - very simple plot of a ""no questions asked"", mysterious driver for hire, who gets involved with a woman, her son, and a husband with serious baggage. The acting is stoic, appropriately, so it's hard to tell if the actors are solid, or are just taking a pass. The script is cohesive and engaging - but simple. The soundtrack is different, but engaging.For me, the real problem was the over the top gratuitous violence. And I'm not a guy who disdains well-placed violence in a movie, nor gratuitous violence in the right movie. But when it's over-the-top AND gratuitous, it's (as my 16 year old son said), ""nauseating."" It was purposefully plot driven, and I get that. But the degree was so shocking in places, it made a movie I could easily have given 9/10, into 7/10. It was so disgusting, the shock value actually pulled me out of the movie. I really felt, of any movie I've ever seen, it deserved an X rating. I really would think twice letting anyone under 17 see this, even with a parent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Soo slow and boring!,"I have no idea how this movie has received such glowing reviews. Gosling appears to be heavily sedated throughout the movie, and the virtual lack of dialogue through the majority of the film just adds to the overall boring experience. Overall it's a movie about nothing with no message at all, and it ends by leaving you with no sense of closure or understanding of why you have been subjected to such a depressing experience. If there was any message at all, I would say it was that life sucks and then you die, or crime doesn't pay perhaps, but overall that's a little bit too Disney for my tastes, but perhaps this will appeal to the masses? Do yourself a favour, and spend your time watching something else, or at the very least take some Valium to get yourself in the correct frame of mind for this slow-paced, self-indulgent offering.

Fantastic and gripping movie,"Went to see this movie last night and i have to say that it was just a brilliant and beautiful movie. First off i have to say that if you are going based on the trailer for this movie you could be disappointed a bit considering that pretty much all the action in this movie is alluded to in the trailer.Ryan gosling did an amazing job conveying the emotions of being a loner who meets a girl and starts falling in love, it's organic and awkward and this movie captures it perfectly. you are able to see pure fury in his eyes during the tense action scenes as well. Ryan Gosling just does a great job here and proves he's an amazing actor.The soundtrack is another thing that adds so much to this movie, as well as the supporting characters. Mulligan and Cranston are great. And even Perlman is able to pull off that mobster vibe.I know a lot of people will think its boring but i found this whole movie captivating, and definitely think it's one of the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Gosling leads the third generation of serious Hollywood talent.,"Something about Ryan Gosling caught my eye when I first saw him in ""Murder by Numbers"". Opposite Sandra Bullock, I was heavily mistaken for underestimating this relatively new actor. After ""Fracture"", Gosling had my full attention. Not only did he refuse to be outdone by the legendary Anthony Hopkins, Gosling vindicated his star power as an up and coming actor with some serious screen charisma. With ""Drive"", Gosling smashes it out of the park. The best part? He doesn't even say much in the movie but gets it done through sheer screen presence.Adapted from a short story of the same name, Gosling plays a nameless Hollywood stunt car driver and mechanic, who also moonlights as a getaway car driver. As the getaway driver, his rules are simple: burglars must finish the job within a five minute window and never contact him for another heist. After helping his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her young son, with car trouble, The Driver starts to spend time with them. Just when an air of attraction develops between The Driver and Irene, her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), is released from prison. From here on, things turn ugly for everyone. Standard owes mobsters money for protection during his time in prison. The Driver helps Standard in what should be an easy 'in-out' heist, but the job is a setup and our hero ends up running the gauntlet with mobsters Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman).There are three names that I think deserve high praise for this movie. Aside from Gosling, director Nicolas Winding Refn does a phenomenal job with almost every aspect of this film. There are flaws, some factual and some due to obvious oversight in editing, but in giving Refn the benefit of the doubt, on a whole this movie is one fine piece of work. What works for Refn is the mood he creates when setting up a brooding atmosphere, along with the 1970s period setting. This is the result of seamlessly integrating an exceptional score by Cliff Martinez with intentionally mute moments. Evidently, Refn also pays attention to cinematography that focuses on a first-person perspective, literally putting the viewer in the driver's seat. Even so, you get a feel of the world surrounding The Driver, but his past always remains a mystery. It is this mysterious past, complimented with a haunting atmosphere that gives The Driver an almost super-human personality. Towards the end, this personality makes him appear unstoppable as a man on a mission.Coming back to characterization, and as I said before, Gosling owns it. He fits snug behind the skin of his character in a way that dates back to the days of a younger and angrier Clint Eastwood. I am not placing Gosling on par with the legend that is Eastwood; rather that Gosling's characterization of an anti-hero is memorable and justifies comparison to the likes of Eastwood, or even Robert De Niro for that matter. When it comes to Mulligan and Gosling in the same frame, the atmosphere shifts to a whole new level arising from just flirtatious eye contact. There is a definite yet restrained sensuality between both characters and even for the few muted scenes they are together, on-screen chemistry is obvious. Another worthy mention is Brooks as the cynical antagonist with a thing for blades. Incidentally, Brooks does it better than Perlman, where both play mafia foot soldiers.I recommend this as a must watch for its style, story, portrayals and artistic visuals. The narration flows at a steady pace but gradually picks up momentum towards the end and includes some scenes of extreme violence when you least expect it. Thankfully, Refn doesn't dwell too long on scenes of blood and gore.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This man is literally me.,"Do you ever look in the mirror and say to yourself: ""Damn I really look like Ryan Gosling"" Of course you do, every self respecting man does. And this movie perfectly encompasses what it means to be a real man.Being a real man of course meaning, that you should become a criminal. And then become the driver for other criminals, but then instead drop everything because you met one woman.Jokes aside. The plot of Drive is captivating yet a little boring, and doesn't leave any room for some actual character development. The events depicted in the movie are quite similar. What happens is really fun, intense, and dare I say it again: captivating, yet the movie does have a bunch of scenes of ""downtime"" that might come across as boring to some viewers.Having said that, I still think that the movie is great!The action and plot points it makes for itself are really good, and I wasn't bored for even a second while watching it.Although I could say that the movie getting padded a bit more in it's runtime department to squeeze just a little bit more of character development in there could possibly make it slightly better, but it's really a small complaint all things considered.What I'm trying to say is that, the movie is worth watching.

Wheelman extraordinaire,"Precision driving can mean the difference between a long prison sentence and a clean getaway. For the right price and with the right connection, those are services you can obtain once and only once and Ryan Gosling provides them.Starring as a character that is never given a name, Gosling works as a mechanic for Shannon (played by Bryan Cranston) who also allows him to use vehicles brought to his garage for servicing for his illicit activities. In addition, he does the occasional bit of stunt driving for Hollywood films. Not to mention the fact that Shannon's (Cranston's) associate Bernie Rose (played way against type by Albert Brooks) is considering a proposal Shannon made to have Driver race professionally with Bernie (Brooks) as their benefactor. Things appear to be going swimmingly until Driver offers assistance to a neighbor being coerced to perform a robbery. The neighbor, Standard (played by Oscar Isaac), was recently released from prison and fears what his associate will do to his family. A family that Driver became quite close to in the time between when he met them and the day Standard was released.The violence is a little gruesome, and the surreal nature of a character with no name is something that didn't actually strike me until after I left the theater.

Drive is an instant cult classic and a career defining film for both Refn and lead man Gosling: measured, memorable and ultra violent. A modern day Taxi Driver with shades of Memento and like a 1970's Scorsese, Winding Refn appears to be a cut above the current crop when it comes to producing compulsive indie pictures with a semi-mainstream lure. In the hands of a lesser director, Drive could've had the facade of a straightforward, pedal to the metal Hollywood action flick. Instead, it has the look, sound and feel of something familiar yet somehow different: the heart and soul of a esoteric European art-house film in the guise of a romantic, idyllic American b-movie. There's a guy, a girl, gangsters, guns, chase scenes, heroes and villains. And Ron Pearlman. And what can only be described as an ""epic"" soundtrack. ""The studios wanted me to use more western, 'radio friendly' music with guys like Kayne West"" snarled Refn in a recent BBC interview, ""which proves they don't know what the hell they're talking about."" Amen.Make no mistake about it, Refn's unruly rendition of James Sallis' noire novel is his own kind of movie. It's not one for the low-brow, dumbed down Hollywood crowd. Nor the squeamish. He's done it his way. This is a character driven tale of good vs. evil and not necessarily the power of love, but the idea of love. The near inaudible relationship between Gosling's driver and the beautiful Irene (a radiant Carrey Mulligan) is more spiritual than physical. It forms the basis of the plot and is simple enough: Gosling's enigmatic mechanic (who's something of a beast behind the wheel) strikes up a bond with neighbour Irene and her young son Benicio. A surrogate dad appears to be on the cards but then jailbird bio-dad shows up and derails the dream. He owes money and favours to the wrong kind of people. They want him to handle a heist for them. Dad needs a driver. You can see where this is going. The job goes tits up and our driver goes to great and gory lengths to protect his new found loves. Escapism. Fantasy. True Romance. Take your pick.Drive is a subtle yet savage masterstroke. A pure dream and Refn's most accomplished work to date and surely Gosling's signature role. He is to Drive what Eastwood is to Sergio Leone's Dollar westerns. A deep and ever present anti hero with a badass wardrobe who just has that look about him. He needn't say much. He needn't say anything. But when he does its compelling. Much like the film itself.Bronson director Refn's recurring urge to explore complex characters with psychotic, ultra violent tendencies to the sound of some killer tunes invite comparisons to not just Scorsese but Tarrantino. Drive is, after all, a cool genre cocktail riddled with crime, revenge, suspense, death and love that's clearly inspired by styles and eras gone by.Ryan Gosling's measured turn affirms his brewing reputation as one of the most gifted leading actors in modern cinema. Expect more from him. Expect more from Mulligan, Refn and expect to hear a lot more about this absolute gem of a film for many years to come. See it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Truly breathtaking if you can stomach it,"Drive is surely not for everyone. What starts out as a mild film evolves into a genuine bloodbath with a quirky, sort of eighties, soundtrack.If you can handle the gore, by all means, see this film. It is beautiful and haunting. Gosling delivers an incredible performance even though his character is unnamed and barely speaks throughout the movie. He brings the character of ""the driver"" a depth that I would not have thought possible before seeing it myself. While watching this movie you to come to respect, fear and love Gosling all at once. Stacking up nicely is Bryan Cranston in his supporting role, which is a far cry from his character on Breaking Bad. Carey Mulligan is not brilliant in this film but the great thing is that she doesn't need to be.Aside from the acting, the film is a beautiful masterpiece. The driving sequences are incredible and the music, though unorthodox, fits in somehow. The directer conveys a story to the audience by using visuals and conveying emotion without heavy dialogue. It truly is what makes this film a stunning work of art.If you're looking for a stereotypical action flick, this is not it, if you're looking for a beautiful doe eyed love story, this isn't it either. If you're ready for something different, beautiful, intense, and mesmerizing, this is what you should see. It definitely deserved more than one Oscar nod.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A rebuttal  of some inane reviews.,"One of my favorite things about really liking a new movie is reading the bad reviews to see why people disagree with me and whether they can make me see flaws in a film by giving me a different insight and allowing me to think it over a little more deeply. I was pretty excited to read the ""Hated It"" reviews on IMDb for ""Drive."" My friend works at a movie theater so he got us in for free two nights in a row. I loved it both times, and that's not typical for me. I guessed that the bad reviews would mostly be about it being too slow for an action movie – a legitimate response from any stupid person. I was right for the most part, but I found something slightly more disturbing in the negative reviews. There is an ASTOUNDING number of people who expected this to be a remake of ""The Driver"" from 1978, and complaints that it wasn't more similar.Okay, so, what the f?These people are actually going to go on to IMDb and write negative reviews saying that the film wasn't similar enough to a movie that wasn't even being remade? I also don't really understand the mentality of people who seem to really love a movie, in this case ""The Driver,"" but want it to be remade. If it's so good, why do we need to fix it? These are the people who are encouraging studios to do nothing but churn out the same god damn movie every three years because they have such a set comfort zone and don't want to see anything outside of it. These people are killing the creativity of the world's greatest film industry.""Drive"" stands on it's own as a great movie. It pays homage to films of the 1980s while still feeling ultra-modern. That being said, it's fairly slow-moving, especially in the beginning. You need to have an attention span. Some people said this movie had no plot, to which I say: You clearly were texting during the movie. Cut that s--- out.There isn't a lot of dialog. I actually read one negative review that said that Ryan Gosling's character probably wouldn't get along very well with people if he were like that in real life. My response to that is, why, exactly, do you think his character gets along well with people? He barely interacts with anyone in the film, he doesn't have friends so to speak, and he doesn't talk very much. Something tells me that being sociable isn't high on his list of priorities.Another big complaint is that Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan spend a lot of time staring at each other not saying anything. This is true, but I don't think it's a flaw. I think it has to do with the fact that neither of their characters seem to do a lot of socializing. They both are shy. They're awkward. They connect with each other in a different way than your typical action hero slickly picking up some bombshell so they can go home and bone. If you're looking for something that cookie- cutter, this movie probably isn't for you, but the good news is that pretty much every other action movie that comes out is. Go waste your money on those. Throughout their scenes of silence I always felt a palpable tension, and that's what I want from dialog (or lack thereof.) Another thing I read a lot of comments about was that Gosling's silence made him seem stupid. I don't know if ""stupid"" is the right word, but I don't think he's supposed to be a genius. He's a stunt man, a mechanic, and a driver. None of those things require you to be great with words. He has a different kind of intelligence, and I would agree that it's not book smarts, but that that doesn't make his character less relatable or realistic. I think we all have our strengths and weaknesses, and the idea of God-like action heroes who are good at everything is really quite boring. Again, if you disagree with that, fortunately for you, most movies that come out are tailored perfectly to your tastes, go watch those so I don't have to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive- A Great Movie,"It is quite hard for me to review this movie. Everything that can be said HAS been said. Why would you even need another opinion? Drive has suspense, romance, great dialogue, and more that will just take up WAY too much time to put into full detail. Even though this movie is very meditative in nature, there are some really cool action scenes. The opening getaway scene may be slow, but has so much suspense in it as The Driver, whose name is never revealed, is a wheelman with a 5 minute window. He starts the clock, listens to the Police radio, and waits for the criminals he is driving for to be done with their heist. One of them gets back while the other is still in the building. This scene causes a ton of suspense. Will he just drive off and have the mission go off? Will the cops arrive? There is also an amazing car chase scene after a critical event in the movie which I thought was awesome.Like the protagonist, the film's actions speak louder than words. There is dialogue, but what is really memorable is the atmosphere, however, the dialogue is also brutally realistic even though I did think it was a bit odd how The Driver and Irene, the love interest, have huge pauses when talking, but that just adds to the mood of their relationship. I think the director described this movie as being Romeo and Juliet in a modern day setting which is true to some part. Even though The Driver is the bad guy and never talks that much, something heart wrenching comes when you see him get sad or get hurt.Drive is a great movie that has care for what it wants to be and executes everything well. It isn't flawless. It does some things that bother me. Sometimes I get the feeling that the film is just TRYING to be too artsy and I just can't stand it when films do that. You know what I mean. The violin/opera music starts to kick in and everything goes in slow motion or super fast. I am probably false accusing the movie and I know a complaint like that is super lame so I wont look down upon the movie for something it never did wrong. I also have a problem that the movie is ultimately missing something. This movie is short. It is a little over an hour and 30 minutes. Some more would have done this movie good and I thought a little more development in the villains would have been nice. However, those are all nitpicks to a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

disappointed,"I had heard a lot of great things about this movie and was looking forward to watching it but was sadly disappointed.Although a little dark and of a similar style to Oscar winning million dollar baby,this film was a little slow and lacked any real tension. Perhaps it could have contained a little more action and the action that it did contain was a little ultra violent for my liking. Maybe I'm a bigger fan of Hollywood than I like to admit. This said it makes it a perfect candidate for Hollywoods biggest accolade,the Oscar.Its hard to judge the acting when there is not enough action or dialogue. Overall,there was some good acting with some good supporting roles but perhaps even too Hollywood for Hollywood. Even the biggest gosling fans might find this one disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Empty, soulless and sadistic with a pseudo-artistic touch!","I believe that the most important element in a movie first is ""having heart and soul in the delivery"" in other words dramatic structure which leads to impressiveness and effectiveness both. Why the worst film I have ever seen in my life is Federico Fellini's Otto e Mezzo? or Why I hated Darren Aranofsky's The Fountain? Because there were no heart and soul in the delivery and believe me especially critics love that! Cinema without heart. Now, let's talk about Drive. What an original and ""never-seen-before"" story! A hired driver who doesn't talk much decides to protect a family, a girl and her child and things in his job go awry! Other than such clichés in the plot and lacking of heart and soul, there were other flaws in the movie. Being a ""driver"" or being a cool hired killer is not that easy! Ryan Gosling's wooden performance and his senseless character are just pointless and has not any interesting or deep element. The violence in the movie was neither artistic nor entertaining, it was sick and sadistic! Also it was pointless! You know Quentin Tarantino makes extremely violent movies like Kill Bill, but it is entertaining and it is artistic at the same time. Drive is not! What about music? Well, oddly, it reminded me Tron, another movie I didn't like, so simply I wasn't impressed by the songs either. Is Drive an action packed? Not at all! The movie has an exciting opening, but then it turns into an empty and dull pseudo-art work with some disgusting violence. The rest of the movie is not a piece of art or an audiovisual feast in contrast with the hype, that's why I was seriously frustrated by the movie! Unfortunately the flaws hasn't finished yet, Drive has an anti climax and pretentious finale that leaves you totally unsatisfied. I am sorry, but the ones who call this as art owe other art house directors an apology.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Huge gaps in the plot and improbable details killed the fun,"There are so many illogical things in this movie that very quickly I just stopped caring about what's happening on the screen. There are big gaps in plot, and there are totally unrealistic details. And if for the plot holes you may somehow justify them saying that characters are stupid or under stress, there is no justification for physically impossible details: a light mattress is blocking the door, car's headlights are working after several hard head-on crashes, and so on.I can hardly imagine an intelligent and thinking person would appreciate this movie. Only if somebody stays in a state of trance mindlessly looking at the pretty pictures and listening to the nice music one can probably enjoy it.I am very surprised by all the positive reviews. Boring and illogical movie, just awful.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Best film of 2011,"From the credit font to the sound editing, this film was a creative mash-up of everything I love about a good suspense/action film. Its minimalistic approach was beautiful. The use of dead silence in this film is simply deafening at times, such a great inverse way to build suspense. I am extremely impressed with Ryan Gosling's method acting ability. Sociopathic, heroic violence at its most primal level.Totally agree with you blackmambamark, I thought of ""Taxi Driver"" too. Stanley Kubrick used silence in The Shining the same way, not many can pull it off with such a seamless cadence.

Loses appeal as the years go on.,"As a young adult, very much into artsy things and low-key films, I remember the day a few of my friends and I were deciding to go see the recent remake of Straw Dogs and I convinced them to go see Drive instead-which none of them had heard of. Not totally knowing what to expect myself we were entertained mildly until the scenes at the motel and the elevator. If you've seen Drive, it is needless to say why. After the watch, it was all we could talk about, especially how great Gosling was in his role-a role certainly made for him due to the lack of speaking and physical language.On a rewatch as an adult, those scenes that put us over the top into loving this film certainly make less of an impact now, but the message concerning Gosling's ""drive"" and what it means for a family to have a man who can protect them still stand. As do the more simpler compliments about the Refn's style and directorial choices.The subtle yet hypnotic 80's retro soundtrack pulls you into a different world that screams cool (possibly a smidge too much). Even the unique retro feel of the hot pink credits add to this art-house vibe we are being induced with.It isn't much, but I think Refn does a credible job tying in character ""drive"" with the main plot of the story and conducts a wonderfully artsy show-offy film (whatever that means!). Carey Mulligan is adorable and plays a woman in a hard place. Bryan Cranston plays a poor, sleezy mechanic who aids Gosling's character. The whole thing is relatively low-key, until those certain scenes I already mentioned pop out you in the ways they are meant to. The greatest compliments for this film go to how Gosling's character harkens back to the golden age of cinema and how the tense romance (between Gosling and Mulligan) is the spark that lights up his meter of tension to do the right thing (in the sense to protect this vulnerable family).In other words, I think Gosling's character goes down in the same category as Travis Bickle in Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver""; a great antithesis/antihero. As I already mentioned, the way Gosling's character shines in Drive is reminiscent to the mysterious desperado from when the greats of the golden-era of Hollywood reigned (i.e. Gary Cooper, John Wayne, Charles Bronson, William Holden, Clint Eastwood, etc.), which we do not get wnough of these days.A film I initially gave a 10/10 has moved down to about an 8.5-9/10 for the appeal it has lacked for me ever since that initial viewing. Dare I say, it was something I overhyped? Possibly, but still worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive,"If it's got wheels, then Ryan Gosling's nameless character can use it. When he is not doing triple rolls as a movie stunt-man, he is being the freelance getaway driver for criminals who need a reliable man to get them out of trouble. His friend ""Shannon"" (Bryan Cranston) fancies himself as a bit of a motor sport aficionado and suggests to his wealthy (and pretty crooked) pal ""Bernie"" (Albert Brooks) that he chip in $300k so they can start a team. Just as that's all getting on track, the driver starts to get the hots for a neighbour ""Irene"" (Carey Mulligan) and so engineers a meeting with her and her young son. She's not without her own baggage - but he (Oscar Isaac) is incarcerated for the moment and so their relationship burgeons. When he gets out of jail her boyfriend needs help with a petty robbery at a pawn shop. That goes pear-shaped and next he knows he has a corpse, a bag of mob money and just about everyone on his tail. He needs to keep her safe and stay on his toes for quite an exciting and action packed last half hour that sees this meticulous man fighting for survival. It's all about Gosling this film, and he owns the screen. His charismatic effort as the wheels works well throughout and as the thing stealthily gathers pace, he delivers confidently. Mulligan doesn't really feature so often to make that much of a difference, but essentially it's a one-man show and that weaves the threads of greed, corruption and romance entertainingly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Thrilling Action and Extreme Brutality!,"Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Drive' (2011) is a crime drama about the mysterious Hollywood stuntman and mechanic (Ryan Gosling) moonlighting as a getaway driver and finding himself in trouble when he helps out his neighbor.This R-rated insanity of a film has a fantastic opening underlined with a great score and showcasing what our protagonist does at night.
I really love Ryan Gosling in this role. I think he did a phenomenal job!The screenplay is pretty good too. There were quite a few things that I did not expect to happen. Sure, it follows some typical storylines, but for the most part, it tells a unique story with unexpected twists and turns! For that alone, I definitely need to commend the film!However I do think that the pacing of the film was, at times, a bit too slow.
There is sort of a romance in this film that I just couldn't buy into.Nevertheless the cinematography was really good and I absolutely adored the soundtrack!Overall, 'Drive' is a action drama with extremely brutal action scenes (unnecessarily brutal for me) that will definitely please a lot of genre fans out there. This film's main weakness lies within the writing of the characters.
At the end of the day, 'Drive' still is a really entertaining and fun film for the older demographic! 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I guess it's about being the cool, quiet, smart guy, but he's not that smart in the end, and we're left with just a dumg guy that drives a car.The story is very boring, simplistic, at times absurd, and it doesn't make any point in the end, being quite inconclusive.The so praised music ended up annoying me.

I like car movie and I expected something better, I thought this movie was going to be like transporter but it was no were near it.

Travis Bickle in L.A.,"Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is utterly impressive. It's not often that our antihero can pull off a satin scorpion jacket while still maintaining his pure awesomeness. Anyone who was thinking about possibly seeing this film should stop ""thinking"" and get out and see it.In the opening sequence it's clear that the main character - only given the title of ""Driver"" and no name - portrayed by Ryan Gosling, is not someone to be messed with. We hear his tag line from the trailers about what he does (""I drive."") The car chase scenes are fantastic but what really makes this movie is the characters that aren't built up to much in the trailers. I went in expecting a good action film and what I got was a modern day Taxi Driver. Gosling's character is a man of few words but that doesn't mean he's ignorant. He knows the slime in his city and how they operate.After a pawn shot robbery goes wrong, Driver is left with a bag full of cash and the top dogs of L.A. after him. All he wants is out, not the cash, not a reward, just out. Unfortunately the powers that be don't trust him and what ensues is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat til the end.Filmed in L.A. the movie is a stunner that has everything. The beautiful scenery, impressive action, beautiful woman (Carey Mulligan and Christina Hendricks) as well as a great cast. Gosling does a great job in this film (I'm still unsure if he was the best pick, I like how he played the role I just think he may be too good looking for this character) but it's Albert Brooks that really brings a whole lot of energy to the party. Perhaps he's why I'm reminded of Taxi Driver, except this time he's the one who's making the treats.See this movie. Go go go.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Passable,"This film was OK. Often slow and understated, it looked good and had some mystery to it because of the main character.Unfortunately he gets less and less believable. He's not just a great driver but also an excellent stuntman. Oh and he's also a natural born mechanic. Oh and he can take out any random mafioso muscle with his bare hands and knows how to quickly grab any handgun or rifle they're carrying, as well as easily grab their knives out of their hands, even when just stabbed and heavily bleeding....Refn's films had a reputation for dreaminess, don't look for realism in this picture. But I did emotionally connect with the neighbours of the protagonist like he did himself. Plus there's a nice atmosphere, nice synth soundtrack but it doesn't fit too well with the brutally violent crime story narrative.After having watched part of Neon Demon I felt this film would hold my attention for longer and it did with some shock moments but it was rather those of the cheap kind and certainly not cinematic splendor.But mostly the film does what it was probably intended to do, to keep you on the edge of your seat at least a little bit like a decent crime thriller, rather than all sorts of raving about the next cinematic masterpiece. If only it had more suspense, a lot of things just went way too easy for the protagonist as if he had been killing bad guys all his life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Solid proof that driving doesn't have to be exploited to be enjoyed,"Within modern cinema, cars have become pornography to the eyes. Warn-out franchises such as 'Fast & Furious' and 'Transformers' milk the parts for the visual candy their viewers need, tossing aside 90% of their cinematic functions to simply excite and explode. Not since the 80's has driving been taken as seriously as it is in 'Drive', a decade well remembered by the film's director which has a clear and distinct stamp on the final motion of the piece.The opening alone is art of the highest calibre. Ryan Gosling's silent Driver simply does exactly that, he drives; but it's the way he drives that so captivates and ultimately enthralls our eyes into a frenzy of sheer wonder. Gosling is so fluent in his execution, so unfazed by any aspect of his role that he's instantly believable and so, we cling to his now legendary white jacket. We cling and we never let go; we never want to let go. Director Nicolas Winding Refn not only creates this longing, but amplifies it and uses it to great effect, forever tugging on our loyalty to Gosling's Driver, forever reminding us of how unimaginably cool and composed he is, and in doing so creates one of the greatest and most memorable characters of all time.Despite being possibly generic in some views, the plot allows room for Refn to truly showcase his uncanny ability to amaze. The story ticks by casually, merely a vehicle to expand The Driver, to test him, to watch him, but always offers plenty of meat for both the cast, the crew and the viewer to chew on. Shocking acts of brutal violence are also sewn into the lining of the tale, but only surface when necessary and only extend to realistic effect, never once do we see Refn get carried away, he's calm and composed just like his star. It is this composure which helps to highlight his true talent as a director. The movie could have been taken in a number of different directions, mostly ending up horrifically uniform and too Hollywood to fully swallow. Instead Refn veers off down a radically different turning adopting heavily tinted night-shots, pumping 80's electronica and hot-pink titling. It is here where 'Drive' finds its true originality, its place amongst the other car-related features; it's an art-house character- driven crime thriller, and never tries to be anything more, or anything less.Although Gosling steals the show, strong and memorable support is handed by the sweetly innocent Carey Mulligan who, despite her lack of input, matches her co-star's innate ability to capture the viewer's attention with a simple eye flicker or facial movement. Long, lingering shots of the two simply gazing into each other's eyes, devoid of dialogue or movement, stand out as a mark of their excellency; never once are we bored, our eyes forever transfixed on every muscle, waiting and demanding movement and so so grateful when it finally comes. Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman all make able and gracious performances, not a foot out of place but far from the same league as the lead.The most fragrant feature of Refn's 'Drive' is however, the very existence of The Driver. Even if he's just simply sitting and staring vacantly out of a muddied windshield, he is demanding your vision and your thoughts; and he always gets what he wants. It is only within the several moments of sheer terror brought upon by the fantastically sickening sound work that we get a real glimpse at the fearless fiend that lies beneath Gosling's pretty-boy exterior. These moments are the ones that truly allow the multi-layered Driver to show most of himself, to show his hidden vulnerability as the beast takes over. Although revolting to some, the violent and frenzied action sequences are hereby necessary and present an unmistakable path to truly absorbing The Driver as a character.Ultimately, 'Drive' is possibly the most originally approached and awe-inspiring collection of celluloid to reach screens this year, and due to one of the most finely tuned and thoughtful performances ever captured (by Ryan Gosling, of course), it will no doubt sit unbelievably high on the list of films considered to be the greatest of all time. Nicolas Winding Refn has created something truly beautiful, packed with nerve-wrecking tension, shocking brutality and simple artistic passion; 'Drive' is in many ways a masterpiece, and solid proof that driving doesn't have to be exploited to be enjoyed",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Above Average,"Not going to be like the 1 * people and act like this is the most boring thing in the world, it's a good action film but it's not a 7.8/10 to me, it's just ""good"". Not really sure how it was nominated for so many awards, none of the acting was bad or anything but none of it was award-worthy either, just regular good acting. Same can be said about every aspect of this film, the technical side of things like directing, cinematography, editing etc down to the story itself. All good but nothing great or amazing. You won't be bored or upset watching this film, but if you're going purely off the ratings on this site, you may end up like me where you think ""how was this rated above American Psycho, Zodiac, The Nice Guys? On par or nearly on par with movies like Nightcrawler, Edge of Tomorrow, both Blade Runners?""
Just not in the same league in my opinion, and I'm not the type of person to give ratings based on genre. Something can be good ""for an action film"", but that doesn't mean it should get bonus points and be rated/compared to only other action films, it should still be compared to comedies, romance, drama etc.This movie is much more of a 6.5 - 7.0/10 than it is to being nearly an 8/10.A good action-drama, not much substance and nothing amazing but enjoyable nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Future Classic,"It's hard to describe this film with any other word than classic. It doesn't have a retro look, but it does have a bit of a retro feel.It also has a brilliant build up of suspense, facilitated with poignant music, insanely smooth camera work, and a perfectly subtle script. Winding Refn is becoming one of my all time favorites quickly - as is Gosling, who stuns here, speaking more words with his eyes than his mouth ever comes close to. The soundtrack, as has been said, is brilliant, although it may take some people repeat viewings to catch why.All in all, probably the best movie going experience I had this year/EDIT: I am upset, but not surprised that the Oscars chose to nominate emotional flubber (e.g., Incredibly Loud) over a real film, like Drive.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Leaves an Impression,"Stuck between genres, what Drive lacks in backstory it makes up for in its production value. Spliced together well, the film's sound, cinematography, and editing create a captivating experience. I just wish there was more character development. Plus, the love story accelerated quicker than Gosling's getaway car.Gosling's limited depth of acting is on full display here as a character who hardly changes facial expressions, but a charming Carey Mulligan allows us to forgive and forget.All in all, it feels like must-see cinema that will be (or may already be) part of film classes everywhere, but it won't make your feel-good, all-time favorites list.Verdict: Watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Glorious Opportunity Missed,"Everything about this film should have pointed towards a classic but its ultimately an opportunity missed. The film is well cast, the soundtrack is fantastic (Cliff Martinez), the cinematography with washed-out neon is great to look at. The problem is at the heart of the movie and the lack of compelling reason for the driver to take the actions that he does at the end. To suggest that he sympathises with the husband fresh out of jail and running with the same people that he drives for is laughable. There could have been a much stronger reason (the son and/ or wife is shot as a result of a failed heist by the husband) that would have resulted in the driver resorting to his actions. Could have been great; is actually average at best.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Real Human Being and a Real Hero,"'Drive' is a triumph of style over substance. However, in this case style is the substance. The unexpected pop music, garishly pink credits and mood-filled lighting, all conspire to create a truly distinctive flavour. Without the flourishes 'Drive' would merely be another languid crime drama. It pays homage to the 80s, and if this was made then, we'd be looking back at it as a classic of its kind. It's made to stand out. And it does.Ryan Gosling is the kid with no name. By day a stuntman, by night a getaway driver. Five minutes: that's all he gives his clients. A minute longer and he's gone. He can afford to be so direct because he's the best at what he does. He uses his cunning to elude the cops. When they're metres away he phlegmatically parks the car and turns off the lights, or drives behind them and waits in areas where helicopters can't track him.The Kid has a past. We don't know that, we assume it. How else could he kill so mercilessly? Maybe that's why he's laconic: it's another way to be invisible. There's an economy of acting on display here, which I enjoyed because Gosling is an actor you can quite easily watch doing 'nothing' and still be entertained.Serving this film is a nostalgic bubble-gum pop soundtrack. I never knew this genre could be made to seem so sophisticated. It's not an obvious score but it works beautifully. It brings out the story's pathos. The slo-mos with 'A real human being' playing (now on my iPod) are cathartic.As Irene, Carey Mulligan is perfect as the love interest. She's The Kid's neighbour. While her partner, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is in prison, she and The Kid are free to flirt. Their chemistry is lovely to behold. It's subtle. They interact mostly through smiles, which reinforces the point that communication is done mostly through body language.Standard's release from prison provides the thrust of the story. Some heavies he owes money to coerce him to rob a pawn shop. He resists and they beat him into submission. The Kid intervenes when Standard's son is handed a symbolic bullet by one of the thugs. But it all goes wrong. Horribly wrong. He intuits it's a set-up, and in the final third, the story becomes one of mutual retribution. I want to tell you more, but doing that will spoil it for you.This is a violent film. Scratch that. This is an exceptionally violent film. But I have no qualms because none of it glorified. It repels you and makes you wince, as real violence should. The few violent scenes are accentuated because they are dispersed throughout a deliberately slow-burning film.The whole cast forms a wonderful ensemble. The principal players are cast against type and are convincing, particularly Ron Perlman's Jewish pizzeria owner, who longs to be Italian, and his partner, Albert Brooks, who is more reasonable but no less minatory. And of course the brilliant Ryan Gosling, as a lugubrious loner.So much thought has gone into every sequence, like in the lift when The Kid kisses Irene to relax her before literally bashing in a man's skull, or the close-up of the scorpion on his jacket when we see his dark side emerge, or the shot of Albert Brooks looking as if he regrets a murder, suggesting that the mobster adage 'It's not personal, it's business' is nonsense.www.moseleyb13.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The brooding thriller that became a cultural phenomenon.,"Drive is a film that effectively, and in an intelligent way, encapsulates and tells a riveting story about what keeps us ticking; the attachment dynamic, and our longing for relationships.It is, with the aforementioned factors kept in mind, no wonder that the picture became a cultural phenomenon in an age increasingly marked by isolation and loneliness among young men. Throughout the film the viewer is slowly invited into the psyche of the driver, as he clamors to his new life, and his newly adopted family. There is an ever-present tension conveyed through the driver's inability to articulate or even express his emotions, as he finds himself getting drawn into a situation that puts both his, and his family's life in peril.Nicolas Winding-Refn and the rest of the team behind the story has created a masterpiece of visual, emotional and intellectual media, that through will both intrigue and touch the viewer. With a perfect cast, a perfect soundtrack, and a perfect balance between sentimentality and grittiness, Drive has become an iconic picture, and it´s sure to stand the test of time.It is worth mentioning that the film is essentially a modern adaptation of 1978´s ""The Driver"", which itself was an American adaptation of 1967´s ""Le Samourai"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A propensity for violence.,"Having seen Barbie earlier today, this was my second Ryan Gosling movie in a few hours. Two wildly different films, to say the least, and two wildly different roles for him.Drive was directed by one of Denmark's very best, Nicolas Winding Refn, and if you have seen Pusher or Bleeder, you will recognize his style and his propensity for violence. Although I was impressed already by these earlier films, I must say that the aesthetics of this movie are even better. While he has undoubtedly evolved into an even better director, I guess a larger Hollywood budget didn't hurt.Supporting Ryan Gosling's protagonist, there are several great actors in this film. Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac and Ron Perlman all deliver in their respective roles.Drive gets a 7/10 from me, and I warmly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

30 minutes of movie stuffed into 100 minutes,"Perhaps rating a 1 is a bit harsh, but currently it has an 8.8, and that is simply intolerable.Over 45 minutes into when the movie says it started, the story actually got going. During that 45 minute prelude, the main character doesn't say much, but then that's the character type. The editor/director are to blame for the horrible pacing - our protagonist says his three or four words, camera stays on him for very pregnant pause, camera switches to his muse, who doesn't say anything (or when she does it isn't much) and lingers on her for far too long, before going back to Mr. Goseling lingering on him....before he finally opens the door and leaves.What the...?? About all it establishes is a tremendously SLOW feeling to the movie, and by the time the action arrives, it feels like it is pedestrian in its pacing.And what a cast to be tied to this turkey. I liked each actor's portrayal of their character, (Mr. Pearlman's character is very unlikeable and is meant to be.) Christina Hendrix is sorely underused, nothing but a transition character who isn't explained terribly well...and doesn't have to be. She can do better.Save 100 minutes of your life by not seeing this movie. Or at best, get it for $1 out of a Red Box.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterclass in movie making.,"They say cinema evokes emotion. That they string together a chord of relevancy or perhaps hold a bigger meaning than what unfolds on a screen. Drive is just that and much more. Staring from its powerful script to the overhead camera shots which capture the very essence of dark LA lanes, Drive is brought to life by its able cast. The presence of their characters says much more than the dialogue interplay between them. With each scene woven flawlessly by the screenplay penned by Hossein Amini (the real hero over here!), Drive revels in the craft of movie making at its peak through its director (Nicholas Winding Refn). Anything more in written wouldn't justify the how effective the movie is. Perhaps, me writing a review after seeing it for the first time back in 2011 shows it has stood the test of time rather effortlessly. Though each one has its own take on the craft of movie-making, I do believe that Drive is worth your time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Stylish and Gripping Modern Classic,"""Drive"" is a cinematic gem that masterfully blends action, drama, and style. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, the film follows Ryan Gosling as the mysterious Driver, a man with few words but a strong presence. He works as a mechanic, a Hollywood stuntman, and a getaway driver, trying to leave behind a shady past. The plot intensifies when he falls for his neighbor, Irene, played by Carey Mulligan, whose husband is in prison. Their connection adds emotional depth to the story, creating a powerful contrast with the violent world the Driver navigates.The film's visual style is striking, with neon-lit scenes and carefully crafted shots that give Los Angeles a unique, almost dreamlike atmosphere. The soundtrack, featuring songs like ""A Real Hero,"" enhances the film's mood, making key moments unforgettable. Gosling's performance is captivating, expressing vulnerability and intensity through minimal dialogue.Supporting actors, including Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks, deliver strong performances that add depth to the story. The action scenes are sharp and impactful, serving the narrative rather than overwhelming it.In just 100 minutes, ""Drive"" leaves a lasting impression, combining style, emotion, and tension in a way few films achieve.

Driving me up the wall.,"It's enjoyable enough for its short runtime, but a needlessly convoluted plot, a slightly bland romance, gratuitious violence, Ryan Gosling's slightly annoying acting that always gives off the faint impression that he thinks he's much cooler than he actually is, and a severe shortage of actual car chases (in a film called Drive!) other than in the admittedly very good opening scene, all greatly drag this potentially quite good film down.

A small classic,"Nicolas Winding Refn's tremendously stylish crime flic is the epitome of neo-noir as Ryan Gosling's monosyllabic getaway driver falls for neighbor Carey Mulligan and then finds himself embroiled in a heist involving her husband, Oscar Issac and some very unsavory gangsters in an Edward Hopperesque Los Angeles. Like all of Refn's films ""Drive"" looks terrific but it also pulses with a sense of danger thanks in large part to the presence of bad guys Ron Perlman and an unlikely Albert Brooks, (brilliant as usual), as well as some incredible outbursts of violence from an otherwise seemingly docile Gosling.Indeed, this is a movie that is perfectly cast throughout. Gosling, Mulligan, Issac, Bryan Cranston and Christina Hendricks are all excellent even if it is the stunt drivers who are the real stars. Also the triangular relationship between Gosling, Issac and Mulligan is unusual and beautifully handled in a way that noirs of the past would almost certainly have ignored. A small classic and one that has already achieved cult status.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"For such a clichéd theme, to handle it with such restraint yet still maintain power is no mean feat, making it a work with a distinct style.","Shooting a crime - genre film in this way is quite unique. The excessive emphasis on form, such as frequent slow - motion shots, unique lighting setups, and the protagonist's consistently handsome look, gives the film a strong sense of style but weakens the narrative at the same time (too much focus on daily life makes it less cool). Ryan Gosling has come across an excellent character, like a volcano beneath a calm sea surface. Externally calm and tender, yet capable of unleashing a devastating outburst. The disco music is really exciting.The development of the plot is within reason, yet it doesn't confine itself like numerous Hollywood car - chasing movies.

Stylish action film.,"An awesome stylish, film with special praise deserved for it's sound design and cinematography. Ignore the cover and marketing, this isn't some dumb cheesy action flick about bank robbing and car chases. The film focuses on an unnamed character simply known as ' the driver' who is unwillingly drawn into a violent world in order to protect an innocent family from harm. His quiet self assured manner channels older action stars like Clint Eastwood and Sylvester Stallone. A cold fury lies underneath their calm surface.The relationship between the kid and his neighbour is very sweet, there's a kind of purity too it and it's all conveyed with minimal dialogue, when he visits the strip club it's to commit an act of violence. The director understands quite well the connection between the two and the kind of story he wants to tell. Ryan Gosling has a silent reassuring presence and was perfectly cast in his role, Bryan Cranston was brilliant as always.The editing of the film is very slick, the lighting is well thought out, LA at night-time looks gorgeous, plus the euro pop throw back music and costume design give it a slighter retro feel, deliberately I imagine. I only bought the DVD of this but was very happy with the picture and sound quality, the film is widescreen rather than full screen. My only issue with the film is that the plot is very very simple and the pacing is quite slow at points but I'd argue without ever dragging.

"A film saved by cinematography, soundtrack and Literally Me!! (Ryan Gosling)","Watched this mainly because of all the ""Literally me"" memes, lol. And thankfully, Ryan Gosling's performance didn't disappoint.The opening scene was great and it built up my expectations, but as the movie went on, the momentum slowed down, and like some people might have felt, I found the script and acting boring (not from Ryan Gosling though; he was consistent in his performance throughout the movie). If I have to point out, it was almost towards the last half-hour mark where it went a little south. I still don't know how I feel about the ending though-not saying it wasn't fitting or bad, but it could have been different or more of what it was.Overall, it is a decent watch regarding the storyline, but as always, Ryan Gosling does an amazing job being the mysterious driver.

a great action movie that isn't just an action movie,"Drive is a really good movie. The plot is interesting and its evolution is exciting, you go from an absurd calm to an incredible action full of violent scenes: at some point I seemed to have changed movies. I really liked the way they mixed love and risk, and then literally incredible scenes of emotion. One thing I value the film so much for is the choice not to make the usual boring action film that lasts more than 2 hours and believes that in this genre the more violence you put the film becomes beautiful, because in my opinion sometimes a movie with low duration can be much more beautiful and addictive than boring and repetitive films with excessive duration. The characters are all well-researched and characterized. For the pilot role, the protagonist, there was no better actor to choose than Ryan Gosling, literally perfect. I also loved Carey Mulligan as Irene, another character I loved. I also really liked Bryan Cranston as Shannon, a great performance. Also to praise are Oscar Isaac, Albert Brooks and the others because I think they have all done a great job. I also loved the clean and quality direction of Nicolas Refn. The rhythm is not boring and is not swinging with super boring scenes and other tremendously interesting. Photography and special effects are also top notch. I also loved the setting and the costumes, like the iconic pilot jacket with an iconic scorpion on the back. The ending is perfectly written with an absurd photograph and a very high suspense, in the end the heart had stopped beating. Drive is a movie that I will definitely want to watch for many reasons.

The light effects were important in several scenes that could have been symbolic, so it has a great visual section that makes it look beautiful. And not only that, its soundtrack I also love it, it has very good songs.Maybe the only bad thing is that its plot is simple, an apparently asocial boy, introverted and with few friends, but who quickly falls in love with his neighbor, and it is in the middle of the film where it takes a turn full of violent action.In conclusion, the movie is genius in both direction and acting, I loved it.

An unexpected enjoyable ride.,"Despite good reviews, good box office and starring Ryan Gosling, I had very little interest in seeing ""Drive."" But, with an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Editing, it finally ended up on my list.And it's a pretty good film! I found it interesting that from the opening of the film, with the old-school electro beats and a title font that is reminiscent of old 80s films like ""The Flamingo Kid,"" my expectations went up. And they weren't necessarily let down.""Drive"" is about a guy, played by the ever-gorgeous Ryan Gosling, known only as, you guessed it, The Driver, who works as a stunt driver on films and as a mechanic...and on the side, he is a for-hire getaway driver for criminals. After meeting his lovely neighbour, Irene (played by Carey Mulligan, Oscar-nominated in 2009 for ""An Education"") and falling for her, when her husband is released from prison and needs help on a heist, The Driver steps up to help the woman he has fallen for and her son by helping her husband. And the heist goes terribly wrong and subsequently puts everyone in his life in jeopardy.With an absolutely amazing soundtrack and some graphic uber-violence, along with a couple of very effective car chase scenes, ""Drive"" is a pretty good action film that has it's moments and is extremely well-written and well-acted. Gosling is stoic but effective as the mysterious Driver while Mulligan continues to impress. However, many speculated that Albert Brooks , nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as a mob guy, would get an Oscar nomination, but I felt the performance by multiple-Emmy-Award-winning Bryan Cranston was far more memorable. Rounding out the effective cast is Oscar Isaac, Ron Perlman and ""Mad Men""'s Christina Hendricks.A very odd story about a real left-of-centre hero, ""Drive"" is a surprisingly enjoyable ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A hero with no name that certainly isn't perfect drives the story with no to little past surrounding him, and his actions are unpredictable and violent.

And while the soundtrack is often good, some of the picks and the frequency of music-video cuts is way too indulged in by director Nicholas Winding Refn. As I've written before in other reviews, Music is very important in movies, and so is the right type and usage. It's a very personal choice and reaction for each viewer. For me, Some movies succeed without it, but I think the best movies also include novel and enhancing music in the right way. ""Risky Business"" has sensational music fitting it's content. ""Drive"" has about I'd guess almost a third to half it's runtime with some music track running. The moody synthesizer and electronic blues are good mixes but not the other cut female vocals. They are whiny and distracting. The dialog of the movie is sparse throughout although the gangsters motor-on with requisite obscenities. The director, tiringly frames Gosling as almost a fashion model constantly changing angles and overusing facial close-ups. What is to like though is a lot of the driving shots and chase scenes. They are very well shot and edited. Pan-in and night shots are beautiful Still this movie is a mild disappointment and a mixed rating for me, moody and visceral at times, but over-indulgent with it's soundtrack at others.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quite a ride,"I've avoided ""Drive"" for as long as I could. Although most of the reviews I've read or what I've heard from friends were unanimously positive, they often mentioned in passing, almost as an afterthought, its rather graphic violence. For a horror movie buff, I have turned rather squeamish of realistic violence in my mature days and ""Drive""'s brutal reputation had made me quite apprehensive about it. After incessant recommendations from my friend Rory (a movie buff by my own heart), claiming loud and clear that it was possibly one of the best films of 2011 and that I was bound to love it, I eventually surrendered, took a deep breath, sat down and watched it...The Driver (Ryan Gosling), stuntman, mechanic and driver to stickups (not necessarily in that order) gets in serious trouble (read Mafia type of serious trouble) when helping the recently released from prison husband of his beautiful neighbour (Carey Mulligan) with whom he just fell in love.Considering the genre its story belongs to, ""Drive"" defies all expectations. This film has a very broody quality, dreamlike almost, with its languid slow motion sequences and elegant but never demonstrative camera work, the proceedings soaked with a beautifully contemplative soundtrack. Although unusual for that specific genre, the style of this film no longer surprised me when I realised that director Nicolas Winding Refn was also at the helm of 2003 psychological thriller ""Fear X"", equally gorgeous and ruminative in its execution.The oh-so-dreaded violence is indeed rather graphic and all the more startling as it irrupts, usually unannounced, in the otherwise narcotised tone of the film. But the violence is never superfluous as it is a necessary part of the plot nor it is glamorised in any way as it casts away our anti-hero from the only person he truly cares about. It did however make me wince a couple of time so be warned.Ryan Gosling is very good as a man who is all introverted emotions and consequently deeply out of touch with the world around, his calm demeanour belying the brutality he's capable of. By contrast Carey Mulligan brings delicate beauty and restrained suffering to her character and the scenes she and Gosling share are tender and discreetly moving, which is to say without being naive nor syrupy.All in all, ""Drive"" was indeed a hell of a ride. And this is a ride I wouldn't mind taking again.Damn! Rory was right!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
life is a dangerous road,"A review or two that I've read call Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Drive"" the best movie of 2011. I wouldn't call it that, but it's an impressive one. Ryan Gosling plays a car repair man sees his life take a dangerous turn after he befriends a woman (Carey Mulligan) whose imprisoned husband (Oscar Isaac) owes a gangster protection money. There are some VERY nasty scenes in this movie.This movie reminded me of Gosling's ""Place Beyond the Pines"", in which he also played a man whose life explodes into chaos. Neither movie is really an action movie. Both would more accurately get described as dramas about how a person's life can change almost in an instant. Probably the most surprising cast member was Albert Brooks, who plays a role very different from the roles that he's usually played (but does so very well, make no mistake about it). Another surprise appearance is that of Russ Tamblyn, who notably played one of the gang members in ""West Side Story"" (he more recently appeared in ""Django Unchained"").I recommend the movie. This look at the underbelly of LA leaves little to the imagination. Definitely not for the squeamish, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The lone hero rides again,"In a time where explosions and CGI dominate the American box-office, we are grateful to have at least one film this year that challenges the clichés and brings it to a style of its own.That movie is ""Drive"", which for my money is a beautifully structured and extremely well-crafted film.For anyone with doubts over whether Ryan Gosling can be a tough guy - the film blows away any doubts of that. Gosling is superb here as the nameless Driver, as his hero character is the perfect lone hero - a stranger who talks only when he needs too, who can exploit whatever he can however he can, and who never loses his cool no matter the odds - his stoic face hiding his emotions and determination. This silent hero is not too uncommon from Clint Eastwood's ""Man with no Name"", or lately George Clooney in ""The American"", but get him mad and the rage flies off from the screen and towards the audience - and he doesn't even do it shouting obscenities or other ""heroic"" rage clichés. He's emotionless and speechless, and that makes him an even more dangerous, unpredictable, and (for lack of a better word) cool character.As for the rest of the supporting cast, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston and Oscar Isaac provide emotional balance to Gosling's calm performance, and Albert Brooks surprisingly sheds his comic image to become a brutal character to great effect. Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks' appearances are somewhat brief, but they are still very good in their roles.""Drive"" is not exactly original. We've seen this ""heist-gone-wrong"" story millions of times in Hollywood and other countries. But you can still make a great movie out of an overused story if you do it well, and ""Drive"" does exactly that, and more. Director Nicolas Winding Refn's calm and focused touch gives the film a very old-school ""noir"" feel that exudes a dark and sombre atmosphere throughout the film - like it came straight out of the 1970's (what with the gritty, sombre thrillers that came out during that era). He also controls his actors wisely, and the action sequences are grounded in reality and unpredictability, making it even more exciting and gripping to watch. Hossein Amini's script also fleshes out the characters well, showing that when they talk less they reveal more. It's these long pauses between conversations that makes a character, so the many instances of silence between Gosling and other characters showcases the best of his acting ability. Amini also is no stranger to old-fashioned thrillers, having already penned the nostalgic ""Shanghai"" years ago - here he shows that he may be the screenwriter which can revive the noir genre.The violence in the movie is bloody, unpredictable and somewhat raw. Moments of silence are shattered with gunshots or the revving of the car engines. The car chases in particular are brief, but they reminisce the good old days of solid car chase movies like ""Bullitt"" and ""The French Connection"". No CGI and no studio back-lot, no annoying music in the background, no shaking camera and no quick-cut editing - its old fashioned and that's the way I like it.""Drive"" is gorgeous to watch. Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography is sublime and crisp, painting Los Angeles in a bright orange tone during the day and drifting shadows and light during the night. Especially in the car scenes when the lights and shadows go past Gosling's eyes and the scene in the elevator with Gosling and Mulligan. His work along with Cliff Martinez's very transcendent and ambient electronic score, combining with Refn's direction and Gosling's mysterious atmosphere all contribute to the hypnotic atmosphere of the film. That, and the film's retro soundtrack makes for a very mesmerizing movie to watch. The film is edited nicely in a slow but moving and intriguing pace that makes one concentrate on a subject all the way without having to experience quick cuts all the time like some Michael Bay popcorn flick.""Drive"" respects the audience and it makes them focus on the story and characters instead of the style that it is being presented upon. It makes you feel the film, and that's something that I don't experience often - you become engrossed in the characters' world and start caring for them instead of just awaiting the next big action scene.In short, ""Drive"" is a great film. It's may be unoriginal in plot but it's beautifully crafted with class, respect and care by Refn, Amini, Gosling, Martinez, Sigel, and everyone else involved. It's old-school noir and it's a sign that the classic style of film-making is coming back. This is one mean muscle car of a movie.Overall rating: 85/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Labored, Clichéd and Boring","I went into this with high expectations as the saying goes, along with my two friends; we even hung around to catch the late nite session because strangely our cinema complex only had two showings a day of this hot new release. Huh?We were three of twelve people sitting in the theatre. Huh? Apparently on opening day earlier in the week, due to all the hype that has apparently infected the IMDb ratings, the admission lines for this film had caused a minor traffic problem. Where was everyone? Regardless we three certainly expected two hours of lively entertainment and hunched down in our seats. We overlooked the first thirty minutes and the awful soundtrack. We glanced at each other as we went into the next thirty minutes: 'Nice camera work,' one of us said. By the one hour mark I was wondering when the movie was going to get going. Yes, there was Ryan Gosling, he's okay for an automaton, maybe that's the character. There's a sort of clichéd love interest - single mother with young son. Yawn. Oh, here's some sort of Goodfellas type character. Hmm, OK. Gosh the dialogue is sparse but maybe that's a good thing because when the actors do speak it sounds pretty lame. Oh, here we go, something is going to happen now. Ah, someone is killed. A scene in a strip club. That's original. Violence and gore. Right. But when is this thing going to take off? Check the watch. Probably another 30 mins to go. Hmm, well may as well see it through. Oh, it's over? That's a pleasant surprise. Great let's get the hell out of here.'What was that?' one of my friends asked.'It was one of those movies where all the good stuff is in the trailer,' said the other.We all agreed.The plot is dullsville. The acting is robotic. The night cinematography is technically excellent. None of the characters are likable. The dialogue is clichéd. The pace is labored. The sound track is awful. Hypnotically bad.At least by the end of the movie I'd solved two mysteries - why there were only two sessions for a new release and why people stayed away in droves after the opening. Obviously people are voting with their feet.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window""","Drive is such a great film that has so many little details that are so beautifully connected to the story and characters of the film. The most beautiful thing too is that these little small details are given in a way that the viewer won't notice which brings me to the only issue I had with the film.I didn't like the way these details were given and felt like if they were given in a way that is a little more clear, it would've given the story and characters more meaning and made them more interesting, because when I read about the meanings behind these details I loved the movie more. But, I understand that the filmmaker might have made this on purpose which I get his purpose and that's why I said that I liked & didn't like that these details were given in an indirect way.The cinematography of this film is beyond great. This film is one of these films that I would call ""visually stunning"". The camera angles alongside the production design created some amazing shots that are stuck in my head. And let's not forget the custom designs especially Driver's jacket that has a scorpion on its back.Finally, the music. Every single song/music that I heard in the film was a great choice especially if you listen to the lyrics that matches perfectly with the story and characters.

The years most successful failure,"There were some good scenes but overall I think this movie could be entitled the years most successful failure.I can actually see Nicolas Winding Refn (who has also directed ""Bronson"", which was great) sitting in the editing room with the editor and thinking: ""God damn, how was I so blind, how could I not see the flaws in the script, how could I make such simple mistakes. Naah, okay gotta make something out of it. Lets put a lot of cool music!""What disturbed me the most: *The Drivers character was dull and lifeless. Even stoic people are real people, but in the movie, I just saw a sketch. *In some places, the music was a bit off or too dominative *I didn't see any real feelings between the Driver and Irene. Romance was made only with romantic music and the implication that usually people in that sort of situation develop a romance. But it wasn't in the actors eyes. *The movie didn't have a culmination. Don't get me wrong, I hate the Hollywood Aristotle 3-act model, but a story's got to have a peak. ""The Driver"" just started rolling, and rolled smoothly till the end. If the culmination was meant to be an inner one, it wasn't played out properly.It seemed Refn was repeating himself and relied too much on the old tricks - stylishness, brutality and cool music.For me, a mediocre movie - 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Gosling proves he really is damn good,"Set in present day LA but with a large finger pointing towards the 70's & 80's, Drive stars Ryan Gosling as an unnamed driver, alongside Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Christina Hendricks, and Ron Perlman. An all star ensemble cast you would have to say. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, of Bronson fame, Drive is an action thriller with a hint of old school movies as an influence. For me A Clockwork Orange seemed to be on show here.Driver works in a car garage, drives cars for movies, and getaway cars for robberies. He is the best driver around and is soon to be the racing for Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks combined adventure into NASCAR racing. However our anti-hero soon becomes distracted when he strikes a connection with a woman in his building, Irene, (Mulligan) and her son. He soon finds out her husband is to be released from prison and when he is the husband is instantly threatened unless he does one last heist. Out of his infatuation with Irene, Driver decides to help her husband in order to protect her from this violent mob, only the job they undertake goes array and Driver is left holding a million in cash of one of the most dangerous men in town. Our Driver must act fast using cunning, speed, and ultra violence to be able to escape these men and protect the woman and child he has fallen for.For starters the acting is fantastic. Gosling is given very little dialogue, very little back story, and very little characterisation. He spends most of the film silent, talking only when he is spoken to. His thoughts and emotions are portrayed through his expressions and his body language alone and this is something we haven't seen Gosling do before. He shows that he really can lead a film and without much to say as well. His character change about half way through is also handled excellently, from the quiet, subtle character in one line becomes frightening when sitting in a diner he snaps at a man, 'shut your mouth before I kick your teeth down your throat and shut it for ya!' This is the moment Driver finally shows some emotion and in one line Gosling has intrigued us into who this character really is. Mulligan is sweet as the girl next door and Cranston really shows how good an actor he is, once again not showing us any signs of any other character he has played in the past. Another star was Albert Brooks as the primary villain. He may seem as an odd choice considering the whole way through you will hear him as Nemo's Father from Finding Nemo. But in some violent actions we realise he certainly isn't a clown fish. The acting really does drive this story that actually has very little substance in terms of plot but delivers in performance and direction by Refn. If I had to criticise a problem with the characters it is that I never particularly felt hooked by them and by the end of the film I didn't feel overly moved I just felt like I had watched some top acting in a good film.The music certainly has to be mentioned. From the opening scene where the music purrs in the background along with Gosling's heart rate and car engine during an eight minute chase sequence through LA, to the booming songs from the Chromatics, Vincent Belorgey, and College. The music gives you a sense of where you are and a big hint to the 70's and 80's. It fits in perfectly with how the film is told and the visuals. Gosling's attire is very thirty years ago and his actions whilst wearing it reminded me of Alex from A Clockwork Orange. Even the feel and look of the opening credits sets the style of the movie instantly, the letters being as if scribbled on and in fluorescent pink. A nice touch from Refn.Overall the film is a must see. It maybe isn't quite as out of this world, like many have said, in terms of story but the acting, music, and vision are things you have to see. The direction of the opening scene alone is also worth paying the money for; the camera never leaves the car whilst Gosling attempts to escape the cops during a getaway. It throws you into the film almost instantly. The slight problem is that after this it does become quite slow whilst we learn the placid nature of our Driver, and his emotional connection with Irene. Here we never feel like they totally connect and I was never drawn into these scenes. When the action kicks in about half way we are treated to a severe case of the ultra-violence, and despite being very well done it doesn't particularly make us care for the characters. That being said you shouldn't see this for the story as it is one downfall in an otherwise very good movie. Gosling alone makes this worth watching, and combine that with the excellent music and great direction and you will be very happy with the film you have just watched.

Too long by half,"How long should it take to tell a story? This film had the potential to be a lean, mean machine, but the director opted for some sort of Euro vibe instead, with lots of long, mood-setting sequences, several of them involving drives where no one speaks. The result was a slow-paced film that failed to build much tension most of the time and, in my view, didn't succeed as a thriller.Nevertheless, the performances were very good, especially the senior criminals, who humanized their ilk the way that Clint Eastwood humanized the characters in Westerns in The Unforgiven. The central character is a type that's hard to build a film around, and Ryan Gosling does an admirable job with the role.Bottom line: Good story, interesting characters, just too slow with too much superfluous material.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not so fast,"Not quite as good as reviews had lead me to expect. Ryan Gosling's almost autistic performance is offputting; he seems more insane than heroic and his pleasure in violence somewhat dilutes the movie's spell. At one point, he even puts on a blank mask before doing a bad deed, and the ref to Jason of the FRI13ers is clear. Possibly a livelier, warmer and less psychotic anti-hero would have been more pleasing and might have jacked the box office prospects a bit. Gosling plays a kind of existential loner with almost off-the-charts car skills, which, alas, the movie loses interest in as it diverts to knife and gun killings of the bloodiest kind. In any event, with a crush on a next door neighbor (English cutie Carey Mulligan), he agrees to help her recently paroled husband do a job, not realizing it's a set up which is run by the same Jewish mob that is bankrolling his own NASCAR sortie (also quickly abandoned). Once the deal goes bad, it's mainly about killing as the bad guys keep sending hitters and he keeps wiping them out. It may stir some jollies to see Albert Brooks (SPOILER) kill two guys with bladed weapons, unleashing a spray of plasma like a broken dam. Then, too, the giant Ron Pearlman head is always a wonder to behold. Plot: a little confusing. Action sequences: well done, as I say, quite bloody. Style: very noir moody, with lots of bleeding red lighting and odd compositions, slow mo overused, in the Euroart (Director is a Dane) trad. If you like this sort of thing, as I do, you'll find it cheaply mezmerising but lacking the depth and passion of true noir.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A round of applause,"I'm gonna do my best to keep it short and sweet with no spoilers. This film was absolutely superb. From the stoic performance of Ryan Gosling to the beautiful direction of Nicolas Winding Refn, I loved it all.Winding Refn clearly worked hard to give this film a very potent 1980's atmosphere with the soundtrack and subtle inclusion of retro cars/wardrobes/etc. At the beginning of the film, I had no clue what the setting was until I saw a modern Chevrolet Impala. I almost got a Grand Theft Auto: Vice City vibe from it which, as a fan of the game, I enjoyed. His techniques in the direction of the film were very new to me and he utilized styles and angles I've never seen before. +1 for innovation.Gosling, Mulligan, Brooks, etc. all give amazing performances and you develop a relationship with all of the characters very quickly, whether good or bad. Although, it is a bit odd seeing Ron Perlman play a hardcore mobster.But keeping it short and sweet, I got a distinct Tarantino-esque feel from Drive with the long, draining pieces of dialogue and short spurts of brutal violence. For this reason, I could understand why people hate the film. It takes a lot out of you and you have to be ready to watch it. That being said, I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and his style of direction. Winding Refn's style is similar but not quite so don't go into this expecting to see a B-version of Reservoir Dogs or something.All in all, the film is beautiful. I now know why it got a 15-minute round of applause from the Cannes audience. This is a brilliant movie and I could watch it over and over again. It gets a 9/10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

If David Lynch directed The Transporter,"Ryan Gosling overtakes Jason Statham as the stoic man behind the wheel. Like his bald-headed rival he gets into trouble when distracted by a woman and is hurled into a plot involving gangsters and hit men. While Louis Leterrier's French thriller tried so hard to be Hollywood, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn's LA-based thriller tries very hard to be European, and takes the viewer on a ride down a lost highway.At the same time it also comes across as a secret remake of Walter Hill's The Driver. All of these films are very, very similar, but Drive is the best of them. It's difficult to comprehensively review the movie as it is very minimalistic and focuses more on atmosphere and the quiet moments in between dialogue rather than action and twists. It's a wonderful movie to look at though, and I do want to complain about how problematic the morals and values of the unnamed 'Driver' are, but if it is the intention to make him morally ambiguous then I guess it is successful. It doesn't make for a great character regardless of how smooth Gosling plays him.The violence is harrowing and brutal, as it is in real life. Nicolas Winding Refn seems to understand that there is no action in real life, there is only violence, and it's brutal and ugly and not something any sane person wants to happen to them. In this respect it is far more grown-up than The Transporter but cannot be praised as being a 'better' film as it is still sold on style and visuals. The substance takes a back seat and the movie apologetically delivers what it wants without feeling the need to scream for attention. I have to respect it for that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Moody, stylish and quiet movie. Weak and unsatisfactory story.","Driver is a story of an unnamed laconic protagonist - all action hero minus the one liners and more than that all the conversations kept to a bare minimum. In fact, the lack of responses and the silence between scenes of immense cartoonish violence drew laughter out of the audience; possibly because there is room left for reactions but we are given none, just swathes of silence. The story is perhaps secondary to the vibe and style deriving it's ingredients from mob logic of why all the cast dies or is slated to be killed.One thing that Driver doesn't strive towards is the standard action fare of Transporter series or the car-mod scene of Fast Furious movies. The few car chase scenes are well done, the highlight being the first one evading the police but really isn't enough of it to be a car chase fan's movie. Most drivings are like videos for pounding 80s-insipired synth-pop soundtrack. It dwells heavily on the brooding and moody ambiance that never leads to any sort of payoff.The biggest fault of the movie is that it doesn't tell a story, everybody does their thing and then it's over. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan look gorgeous all highlighted by the lingering and lengthy close-ups. Oscar Issac manages to exude an unlikeable vibe and Ron Perlman does his thing stealing a few scenes.

But it was also overly-manipulative, slow, and mostly just silly. For what it's worth, the shots are gorgeous and the performances are wonderfully serious considering the ridiculousness of the...and I use this word ever so lightly...plot.

Miles Ahead Of Anything This Year,"The man with no name is a term used mainly as protagonists in westerns, most notably being Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's 'Dollar Trilogy'. We are introduced to The Driver who holds no name and no emotionally attachments, he is there to drive and driving he is. By day his job entails as a Hollywood movie stunt driver and by night switches to that of a getaway driver. He shows no contrast been the two, he drives. Nothing more and nothing less.'Nicolas Winding Refn' recently directed 'Valhalla Rising' and this film feels like a modern companion piece. It features little dialog and focuses on character emotions physically to express their feelings. He has a fantastic sense of directing characters into showing emotion through their body movements. 'Ryan Gosling' sits in behind the wheel as the Driver who is represented as the modernized man with no name. Little is spoken of Gosling as he calmly soaks up the screen with little emotion. A toothpick lies between his lips in which if set within a western setting could be replaced by straw. You imagine he was just placed here with no background, no childhood and no family but merely to drive. A connection is developed early on with his next-door neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, Benicio (Kaden Leos) in which without expressing himself with words we see through long stares, subtle smiles and the occasional touch he has grown close too. But as a sour heist threatens him and more importantly Irene and Benicio his character opens up and shows through extreme acts of violence and his skills as a driver he will endanger his own life to save theirs.We are never given any background detail on Gosling but we see through long focused shots on his calm exterior that a dark past lies behind those pale eyes. 'Newton Thomas Sigel' did a fantastic job with his cinematography his beautifully crafted shots depict of very little happening physically but on an emotional level the characters are shown to be considerably deep and complex. Goslings character reminded me of 'Josh Brolins' portrayal of Llewelyn Moss in 'No Country For Old Men' in which he says very little but he has one clear goal and we are shown it and taken on the path that he follows. However the Driver manages to make us feel sympathetic towards him mainly through the way director has crafted his film. The camera is very rarely detached from Gosling and in that sense, neither are you, his decisions are very clear and because of the amount of screen time we are given of our Driver the way his expression changes, no matter how subtle is clear for us to represent so we can be attached and relate to his motives.At it's heart 'Drive' is an art house picture, it looks and sounds beautiful, a thumping 80's soundtrack plays through the background with it's electronic beats and vibes representing much to the state of a mechanical nature of a vehicle. A particular scene is when Gosling expresses his emotions through driving as he takes Irene and Benicio on an off road experience as the uplifting, 80's tune 'A Real Hero' by 'College' serenades within the background. Though the way the film is shown it's art house style lies within some director choices, imagery which could very well become iconic is shown and each shot is blessed with given care and subtle details like mirrors placed strategically in the background to show other characters out of shots. During driving sequences we are made to feel as a passenger of the car and part of the experience as POV perspectives are shown twisting around the interior and out of windows while various car components are glazed over. It's given a slick, sexy feel and inanimate objects are made to be humanized.'Drive' portrays the dark side in characters and what they will do to protect what they care for and want but even throughout this, Gosling's character remains relatively calm even through intense moments. At times the film hits exploitation film levels as scenes of extreme violence are shown and the film builds up to these moments to deliver them in the shocking and painful vision that they are intended to be. It's much similar to how 'David Cronenberg' uses violence within his films, giving a realistic and emotional depth. 'The Fly' for example used gore to create strong sympathetic values towards 'Jeff Goldblums' character where as Drive uses it to show characters anger and pent up emotions that are built up to brink through slow, moody scenes until it can't be caged anymore.This is not an action flick. There are no CGI set pieces, there is no mindless violence, it's quiet and moody but at the same time it's not an easy watch. Sigel has a created a dark, complex film showing basic human emotions through deep body language and motives. Gosling's uses every part of himself and the vehicles in which he inhabits to cause you to feel sympathetic and engaged towards his character. It's a film that takes multiple viewings and each viewer will have their own interpretation as to what has been perceived. 'Drive' is an example of powerful directing, brilliant acting and most importantly an engaging story line bringing an experience that is miles ahead of anything else this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Different, but not great","If Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction had a kid, this would be the result. Except while each of those was different and great in its own way, this one is not. It's different, but not great.I walked out of this movie feeling like I'd just been punk'd by a bunch of fake reviews in this very site. But no, RT loves it, too.Ryan Gossling plays a mysterious, very quiet person who, somehow, despite not showing any outward charm, any kind of personality, or anything like that which a woman might look for in a member of the opposite sex, manages to woo his neighbor next door, Irene, who, oh, just happens to still be married to a soon-to-be ex-con with debts plus interest due upon release.Carey Mulligan plays his love interest, your typical movie damsel who enters a man's life with the intent of making it better but ends up doing the opposite. I don't discredit her acting here, though, she was one of the two people in this movie that gave a believable performance, the other being Bryan Cranston.Everyone else was basically awful. Albert Brooks didn't even try to get into character. He has the personality of a used car salesman, but we're to believe he's a crime boss? Ron Perlman was an overacting ham. Christina Hendricks was her usual eye candy self who can't act and can't cry on cue, apparently.But the on screen chemistry between Gossling and Mulligan is not believable at all. How could a woman fall for a person who has the personality of a tree?That and the what seems to be total deafness of basically every off-camera person in this movie makes me wonder how much suspension of disbelief the director expects us to have. Despite gun battles being waged in apartment buildings with the front door wide open, despite the survivor standing there for several minutes, nobody comes along and asks ""what the hey just happened here, and who are you?""The fun parts of the movie are when Gossling unleashes his inner Bourne, but those are few and far between, too few and too far to keep the movie interesting.In short this movie is pretty boring and tedious to watch except for small parts, the situations are implausible, the casting choices leave much to be desired, and the director seems to have demanded very little of those casting choices because that's exactly what they gave.It shouldn't be called ""Drive"" it should be called ""Park"" or ""Stuck"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An hold-up going out of control, dangerous girl, impossible love. Every most basic cliché is included.The actor Gosling (driver) is bad at playing desire, or fear, or anger. In fact, being dead, he still acts awfully bad.

Breathtaking Minimalist Thrill Ride,"With a pulse driven soundtrack pumping from the speakers of Ryan Gosling's GT, Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is instantly a contemporary cult classic thrill ride written in blood stains and pink.The color of Drive brings to mind a quote made by Cameron Diaz as the femme fatale in 'The Mask that she addresses towards Jim Carrey during one of their first meetings. It brings to our attention the polluted skies she admires so much for its' accumulation of purples, pinks and greens. In retrospect this quote can now be considered a foreshadowing of what would later become a tradition in twenty first century film.Not only does Refn follow this foreshadowed tradition, but he sets a new bar for it by using this scope to create a new-wave, stylistic action thriller. Drive is a crash collision of vibrant colors inspired possibly by video games like Grand Theft Auto's Vice City, movies like Scarface, and maybe the minimalist script and shot decisions of Andrei Tarkovsky. For those that are unfamiliar with the last name, think of David Lynch or more recent films like 'Enter The Void,' 'Biutiful,' 'Blue Valentine,' or 'Tree Of Life.' The broad pov shot from Ryan Gosling's windshield creates something special. By the street lit product placement of names like rite aid, Ross, and Food 4 Less Refn's Drive puts me in an all too familiar place of oppression. However, seeing it from the perspective of Refn and Gosling illuminates and exposes it for all of its color and possibility. Refin knows how to capture optimism. Its one of those films that makes you proud to be a part of these fluorescent polluted times we are living in.With direction this good, the characters do not need to say anything. Drive's main character has no name. Everyone surrounding him has a name. Some of these circumstantial misfits are titled that way by choice, or just plain circumstances and all of them want some type of favor from our hero. And our hero will do it, no matter how absurd, without any questioning of things like what is in it for the misfit asking this favor of our hero.There are no hidden agendas behind anything that he says or does. Everything he does is done because it is the right thing to do. College's theme 'Real Hero' fits into this so well because it echoes exactly what this movie is all about and that is real people and real heroes. In this way Drive's main character is an example of a cinematic hero that can and should be followed.Less is more in 'Drive.' Their actions in this post apocalypse are what speak volume for their characters. Move over Emilio Estevez and Robert Deniro because Gosling is this years 'Repo Man' and 'Taxi Driver.' And while Gosling is today's hero in film, Refn is our post-modern and apocalyptic philanthropist.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Style over susbstance -,"Nicholas Winding Refn's Drive stars Ryan Gossling as the nameless protagonist (much the same conceit as Ryan O'Neals nameless driver in Walter Hill's The Driver (1976). Critics have fawned over what could be described oxymoronically as an art-house movie; and Refn even received the prestigious director's award at this year's Cannes (nothing to do with Von Trier being persona non grata, of course). All in all, I was expecting a masterpiece. Instead, I was left with a limp, lifeless and boringly self-conscious menage of cinematic motifs, borrowed heavily from Tarantino, Lynch and Walter Hill. The result is an uninspired, embarrassing mess of a movie. It doesn't deserve to be seen in the same league as the infinitely superior Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway, which Refn has plundered for purely aesthetic gains and nothing else. He even had the temerity to use Lynch's ex-musical partner, Angelo Badalamentti, who uses his typically Lynchian sounds to little effect. Intringuingly, at one stage, even Lynch's music from Inland Empire seems to have been deliberately mimicked as some kind of in-joke on Badalamentti's behalf (or perhaps an ironic riposte for not being chosen by Lynch to provide the Inland Empire OST). While Lynch offers abstraction and depth, Drive is all surface gloss and bokeh – there is no mystery to behold or engage the viewer; just the bland, vacuous features of Gossling, who is a blank canvas and nothing else. Critics have predictably lapped up its style and gratuitous violence as heralding a new talent, much like they fawned over Tarantino a decade ago. Take away the violence and uninspiring story, and what's left is nothing. Drive is ultimately all style and no substance. Avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An Introvert's Dream,"Going into this movie as an extrovert I was shocked by the fact in the first twenty minutes the main character says almost nothing. Ryan Gosling is a getaway driver without a name we just see him referred to as the Driver. When a heist goes wrong his past shows back up we never learn about it but from what he does to the antagonists you get a quite a vivid idea. This movie requires a lot of patience, understanding and accepting this Driver character is an introvert. His love story with a single mom with a child shows how much weight is behind each scene in the movie from an introvert's perspective. The visuals are insanely pleasing even nine years later and I'm glad this film did very well at the box office so that films with the same dark Los Angeles vibes like Nightcrawler were made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's narrow minded people like you who shouldn't be allowed to rate films. For those complaining that it was boring and has no noteworthy action, I didn't know a movie had to have jaw dropping action to be good. Once again.The film itself is a masterpiece. The acting, action, and soundtrack were amazing. The plot could have been better but all of the good outweighs the the bad by far. I love how the movie doesn't have a lot of dialog but yet it feels so emotional. The actors do such a great job at getting these emotions across and making such believable characters. The thing I like about Goslins character the most is that he is an absolute bad ass, but you would never know that unless you've made him angry. It's a reminder not to mess with the quiet types that hold in anger at times. Some people would say he's a psycho in this film, I say he's a hero and an idol.

Outstanding direction creates existential study of a driver,"The driver in Drive is just that, he drives. He has no past and even no name. One would guess prison was a part of his past but that is just a guess. The driver only has two distinguishing characteristics, he is extremely adept behind the wheel of a car and he wears a strikingly odd white jacket with an orange scorpion on the back. The scorpion's meaning is somewhat explained and furthers a philosophical undercurrent in Drive which is not apparent in the previews.The audience I saw Drive with on a late Saturday night opening weekend started to laugh at the screen and mock the actors, the direction, and the jacket. Their expectations did not match what was unfolding on the screen. They expected multiple car chases between the driver and the cops, backstabbing crooks, and action sequences just for the sake of action sequences. Well, those clichés are not here and it transforms what would have been just another Gone in 60 Seconds to a film which operates on a different, more introspective plane.The actors in Drive are well known as true actors who respect their craft: Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, and Albert Brooks. Gosling has shown his chops before with The Believer, Half Nelson, and Lars and the Real Girl and might have the fewest lines of dialogue ever by a film's main character. Carey Mulligan, still resonant from An Education, pulls off a sympathetic next door neighbor who needs the driver's help even though she may not know it. Bryan Cranston is assigned a more stock character and Albert Brooks who usually plays bumbling schlubs gets a turn as an antagonist for once. The only sour note is Ron Perlman who just plays an extension of his Sons of Anarchy character.This script requires true actors to flesh it out. Scenes with words are few and far between so that facial expressions say more in conversations than dialogue does, especially between Gosling and Mulligan. There is a reason you will not see Jennifer Aniston and Ryan Reynolds in Drive; there is now way they could just sit in a room, stare at each other, and talk to each other with their eyes and cheek bones.Drive's director, Nicolas Winding Refn, won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival for one reason, necessity. If the film does not need it, it is not there. For example, when the driver is waiting outside while a robbery is going on inside, there is no sound. If you were waiting in a car with the radio off, it would be exceptionally quiet, just like in the film. There is no background noise, no radio on, nothing. The audience was absolutely quiet right along with the film straining to hear what was going on in the building next door. Refn could have extended the car chase scenes with more screeching tires, made the scenes between Gosling and Mulligan more romantic, and turned down the accompanying existential philosophy. By choosing not to do these things is why he won Best Director.Existential is the most apt word to describe the driver. He gives his own life meaning and purpose. His background is never brought up once, but something in his past has shaped his actions. He lives his life sincerely despite the myriad distractions of obviously crooked associates, menacing goons, and the unfamiliar terrain of romantic feelings towards a woman. What truly makes Drive so good is all of the pitfalls it avoids by just focusing the camera on Gosling on Mulligan and letting it go from there. Mainstream audiences looking for standard car chases and fist fights on a Saturday night will not understand Drive; the philosophical undercurrents here make them uncomfortable. Drive is for those who appreciate diving in a bit deeper rather than wading in the cliché kiddy pool.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"If you don't buy Gosling as the lead, the whole film falls flat.","Drive is an interesting idea, brooding, noire and a slow burner, but unfortunately Ryan Gosling doesn't have this type of character in his acting locker in my opinion. Hugh Jackman was originally linked to the role, and I think Hugh's performance in Prisoners (2013) is what Drive needed. Similarly Jake Gyllenhaal's character in Nightcrawler (2014) is another example of an actor with the right range for this kind of movie.Ryan is completely unconvincing in Drive, there's a scene where he confronts another character while pointing his finger at them, and his attempt to be cold and menacing really falls flat, almost comical, to the point where in my head I went 'yeah right'. It's as though him putting on his costume of a cool jacket and leather driving gloves was meant to transform him into the capable badass he wants to be, but that isn't enough.There are some excellent performances from other characters in this film. Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks especially had some great moments, and added some interesting depth.I think this film was too overindulgent in trying to be brooding, and casting the wrong actor for its lead was a huge misfire. Relying on over the top gore in some of the few action scenes comes across as an attempt to keep audiences from losing interest. They feel out of place, almost like an homage to Tarantino's style of gory action.There was potential here, and I'm sure if there was a more capable actor entrusted with carrying the movie then some of its slow pace would be excused, but without that, it's an above average movie thats pretty unremarkable compared to others in its genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best movies I have ever seen!,'Drive' was such a powerhouse of a film from the undeniable amazing acting from Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan to the artistic and out of this world soundtrack this IS what movies should aspire to be. Never in a million years did I think Albert Brooks (the lovable store owner from My first Mister an underrated gem) could be so vicious and actually make for a great ultimate bad guy. The cinematography and pace of this film is top notch it leaves you at the edge of your seat wanting more. It captures you from the beginning and keeps you hooked to the very last second almost holding your breath. Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite actors of all time his dedication to his roles and the incredible talent is one of a kind and genuine.

A Multi-Layered Abuse to the Film Industry,"So I walked out of the movie Drive. This is the first time I've ever done such a thing. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my day but there has never been one that infuriated me to a point in which I couldn't continue. And being a film lover, I sat down and analyzed just why exactly this movie ticked me off so much. What was it about this movie that drove me up the wall to a point in which I walked out before I even got to see the conclusion? It wasn't the acting. It wasn't the music. And it wasn't the lush cinematography. What irked me the most was that Drive was disguising itself as an indie flick when in actuality it wanted to become an action movie so badly.And this strategy while an insult to the entire institution of filmmaking, worked. It got rave reviews at film festivals here and there and got nice reviews from critics, lavishing the acting, supposed tension, and cinematography. I watch this movie because of the rave reviews and literally saw the Transporter movie wrapped in an indie flavor, nothing more. The first half, where we supposedly see ""character development,"" consists of characters engaging in extremely minimal small talk and the rest of the time just staring at each other. I am not kidding. After the tense opening which reveals our main character's secret job (which is familiar to the opening of Transporter), we get nothing for about 40 minutes. Except a lot of pointless scenes.Drive is about a very good stuntman that doubles as a secret driver at night (Ryan Gosling) who silently falls for his new neighbor (Carey Mulligan) while at the same time gets mixed up in a mob scene (which loosely is a Transporter plot). The first half has all the development, only in the second half is when we see all the action and driving you've been observing in the previews. Based off a novel of the same name, the script must have been easy to write, because it barely has any dialogue while the story is pretty much a mashup of Tarantino-like violence with Transporter-like symptoms.The movie is so inconsistent, and amongst the small pieces that don't fit together they are all sparkles of what we've seen before—and what we've seen before has all been superior. The supposed amazing chase sequences? Bourne and Ronin does them better----and to a similar budget extent, The Transporter. The supposed amazing violent tension? I can name dozens of movies that do it better. And the extreme violence that is inconsistent with the theme, tone, pace, and characterization of the first half of this slum? Of course, while it doesn't quite match the plot it's been perfected years upon years ago by Tarantino and even to an extent Robert Rodriguez.But another big reason why I dislike this film so much is because with Drive, we've seen it all before, and yet the critics will not point this out—or choose to avoid it. We've seen these types of movies before (quiet men that has their actions do all the talking), we've seen this type of ultra-action before, and we've seen these stupid attempts at conflicting and blending genres far too many times in the indie and mainstream scene. Drive was originally billed as blockbuster during development so what do they do? Hide the fact that it's the clichéd low-caliber blockbuster that's trying so hard to be a European Tarantino hybrid. They trimmed the dialogue, screen time, and for the Cannes Film Festival nixed the action billing and called it an independent film. They literally were changing the packaging and tone of the movie based off of box office numbers. That's disgusting. They were trying to sway the critics by changing the entire genre.Bottom Line: Drive, you are a pathetic, pointless, stupid, trite, slow, muggy, grudgy, tasteless, senseless, disposable, forgettable movie with abysmal pacing, abysmal writing, and no sense of direction whatsoever from the first second to the last second I watched before deciding to walk away. You don't know what movie you want to become, as you literally spit yourself through at least three different genres that actually repeal each other like a magnet. You barely clock in at 100 minutes, yet it felt like two hours the first half in. I will not blame the acting, for they had next to nothing to work with. I will not blame the cinematography, which wasn't bad either. I will blame the fact that your crew decided to pretend like your movie was artsy, underground, and indie, when in actuality your movie is this ultraviolent action movie that rears its ugly head long after the audience has fallen asleep through the numbing first half.Your movie sucks.Bad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""It's Bad Luck""","Wow. I was pretty surprised. Drive is certainly not your average, fast cheap-shot action film. It takes its time and rightfully so! The pacing is refreshingly smooth and composed, building slowly up to the sporadic and short outbursts of violence or action. There isn't much violence but it is very direct; realistic would be the right word. Especially the use of it is (which is a big plus for me). There is a quite surreal, dreamlike quality to the film. Even though it has a lot of realistic elements, it still doesn't feel entirely real. There is something off, which isn't a bad thing! In that context ""A History of Violence"" somehow comes to my mind.The trailers might give a wrong impression; the film is much quieter than they suggest. There is a clip from the opening on youtube, the getaway scene, which gives a much better feeling for the atmosphere.Anyway, this is really a fantastic production! The cast is very good. They all made up a rock-solid ensemble, great performances! (If you want to see more of great acting by Ryan Gosling, ""Blue Valentine"" is highly recommended) The minimalistic and tense soundtrack is a perfect fit (maybe sometimes slightly on the overly-sentimental side), the cinematography is excellent(!) and the director; well, I certainly have to write down his name.All in all it is truly refreshing to see a film which is simple and minimal but at the same time highly effective. That's the reason I give this film a 10; it doesn't need a much more complex story. For me it perfectly managed to reach what it aimed for. There is real focus and concentration, something you rarely come across these days. For me it's a masterpiece, for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive,"This high-acclaimed black noir of our era has accumulated ""best-of-the-year"" momentum ever since it garnered a Best Director honor for the Denmark prodigy Nicolas Winding Refn (from PUSH trilogy and DRIVE is his Hollywood premier) in Cannes last year.The film exudes a drastically visual flare almost in every scene, from its one-of-a-kind camera angle, an utterly mind-blowing hue (a mesmerizing contrast between warm orange and ruthless shadow dark). The whole script is as corny as any hacks could write with eyes shut, a point-of- no-return road for a lone hero to save his beloved woman from danger. So plot wise, the film could be a thorough disaster, and here comes our virtuoso director to rescue the film and without embellishing the content, fully showcasing his theatrical aesthetics to fend off the fatigue of the tedious characterization (a taciturn Ryan Gosling can only be beneficial to his staunchest followers, while a dainty Carey Mulligan has too little to display her faculty), among the cast, if one doesn't harbor a over-hyped expectation, Albert Brooks will be a fierily menacing discovery particularly it is creepily against his usual comedic strain.Subtlety rules, several remarkable shots and tableaux (to wit: the hammer menace in the strip- club's dressing room, the man with a creepy musk in front of the pizzeria before the slaughter with its consequent beach hunt at night and so on) are jaw-droppingly staggering and the violence showcase is harrowingly stylistic, the elevator scene could be on a par with the Gaspar Noé's groundbreakingly grisly IRREVERSIBLE (2002). The film is going to be a classic cult not the least because of all the Oscar snubs it receives, which is confoundingly a congenial sign of its bright future both for the film itself and Mr. Refn's professional career (the latter is even more uncanny regarding the recent vicious curse upon non-American new directors' debut in Hollywood, Refn and Cary Fukunaga from JANE EYRE 2011 are the only jinx-breakers so far).Ps. the hypnotic soundtrack is the ace, the ending-song COLLEGE'S A REAL HERO is the killing for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I can watch this film just for the soundtrack...,"'Drive' certainly is unlike any vengeance film I've experienced. The film's beginning is seriously short on dialogue. I mean, there are literally moments when characters are together without saying a single word. But the cinematography is so awesome that dialogue are sometimes not necessary.The film's score is awesome! It has a tranquil synthesized mood, resulting in a serene feel, despite the dark theme. The film spends about 40 minutes setting up the scene and the characters (and is never boring), but when the action (and unexpected) arrives around the 45-minute mark, the film really hits you! It grabs you and doesn't let go. Be warned, despite the film's initial tranquility, it becomes brutal and gory - yet ever so stylish and effective.Ryan Gosling is outstanding!! His character is mysterious and seemingly trouble-free (Dan Stevens' character in 2014's 'The Guest' was very similar). 'Drive' is beautifully filmed and will consume you with every frame.

Additionally, style enhances the film to a whole different degree of great. The great music, and lighting of scenes make it just so beautiful.

That Clint Eastwood movie feeling...,"The guy doesn't even have a name. He doesn't speak too much and when he speaks he doesn't make threats, he makes promises that the bad guys gonna get it! Just like in Dirty Harry... The movie has this 70's feeling but in a way that will make true cinema fans to look back with nostalgia. You almost expect Starsky and Hutch to start chasing the guy. And Ryan Gostling - he got the idea and played it perfectly. Really, the atmosphere is amazing and the soundtrack is adding to the amazingness of this masterpiece.

Good Gosling,"Ryan Gosling does a wonderful job in this interesting take on the silent; yet not brooding, character who dabbles in both the criminal and honest world. He's not conflicted, just appears to be slightly less comfortable in the real world where he has to actually interact with others. He does a wonderful job portraying a character that, while not having great multiple depths, does have two distinctly different roles to play; which he does admirably with slight differences in each personality.Some of the crooks are slightly lame; but one or two personify calm, deliberate, malice - as a business requirement almost; definitely not the personification of evil.Carey Mulligan does a fine turn in her pivotal; yet not major role.A good one for home viewing...",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The most over rated film in the history of man kind,"Now I'm no movie critic and don't claim to know anything about film making but this film just amazed me.Picture the setting, I have just got Netflix and remember my friend telling me about this 'amazing' film. Sure enough it has 7.9 on IMDb, so I watch it.THIS FILM IS SO SLOW. Seriously, I counted 43 seconds of when shot of his face near the end just to see him (Driver as he's called on IMDb) blink. His sorta weird relationship thingy girl asks him a question and it literally takes him 10+ seconds to answer. Don't try and tell me this is art, it's just garbage.RYAN GOSLING PLAYS THE WORST TOUGH GUY I HAVE SEEN. What is up with the voice cracks? Could they not re-shoot? Did they not have enough time to get rid of two voice cracks in a minute dialogue. 'How 'bout this. You shut your mouth. Or I'll kick your teeth down your throat and I'll shut it for you.' - Yeah great delivery, I am so scared. Of course, every tough guy takes a bit longer to respond to questions to create tension, but these lengths of time are mind-numbing.However, apart from the zero character development of our driver who happens to be a mechanic, a stunt driver, a get away driver and proficient with a shotgun and some completely unnecessary violence, the chase scenes were okay, mainly because it didn't involve any acting.Maybe I'm just missing something, but this is just the view of an avid film watcher who isn't drawn into the 'brilliance' of emperors new clothes...",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Stylized and beautiful !,"I just watched this movie and wow , i was transported in the world of Nicolas Winding Refn . Did not know Nicolas Winding Refn before this movie , but boy does he have style and finesse , he must have been inspired by Michael Mann , especially the fluidity of the camera sequences , some dreamy like scenes , the colors and the musical score are all the ingredients for a very special art work film , and this movie shines !It has a very mature look . The sure direction assures a sure acting , you actually have the feeling of something special behind this with the start credit . The very first scene feels almost like a video game , trance like (a la Need for speed) ... it's just a synchronized feel with the music and the movement blending with beautiful texture and colors , very 80's look with a modern touch ...i love it !The angles and the camera shots are interesting . The actors game are very controlled and composed especially Ryan Gosling . Perfect !I like the montage of this movie very much . The story is easy to follow and very well portrayed . The time line is well done . I actually re-watched it and boy it was a treat . When you want to re-watch a movie it's a good sign of the production and the coolness of it ,the last time i re-watched a movie was Thief by Michael Mann..loll.It as the same kind of feel as Thief , very similar ?!You feel the human side of the characters .It contains substance and has magic moments as if time stopped sometimes , it's a deep and profound picture . I find movies to be like paintings sometimes , some people like Picasso , some don't , some will love Dali , some wont but art is kind of touchy , anyways if you like realistic smooth cool mature looking with style pictures well this one is for you .I personally loved it so I give it an 8/10 .(for a good suggestion , watch Thief from Michael Mann , James Caan is absolutely perfect in it)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive Delivers: 4 Wheels; 10 Stars,"A seeming homage to '80s suspense movies like Manhunter, Drive is as deliberate and compelling as Ryan Gosling himself, who, ahem, wants to prove to us that he's not a baby anything anymore. He's all grown up, and he wants us to know he's put his ""Notebook"" in his back pocket, climbed behind the wheel, and is all about driving us crazy.What makes a great movie? Simple plot; complicated characters. And Drive delivers. At the end of it all, it's a whole hell of a lot of ado about nothing, really. None of it needed to happen, which is the point. Deciding to become involved, that choice by Driver, is what sets everything in motion.There is not a word out of place in this script, not a moment, not a choice, not a quiet glance, not a stomp or slice or curve or blink that wasn't intentional and rife with symbolism. It's, quite simply, the tightest film I've seen in years. And it stays with you like a dream you can't figure out. It leaves you tied in a knot, but don't expect a ribbon or a bow; Drive leaves you with just enough questions to keep you turning down those mental side streets.Ryan Gosling captures the quiet rage of this character doing a lot of bad things to bad people in the pursuit of doing one good thing for two innocents. Although Driver is a bit, well, lost and messed up, there is something so beautiful and vulnerable about how powerfully he acts out while trying to become ""a real human being and a real hero."" As screwed up as he is, this movie leaves you wanting to be as cool as Driver, even if it means you have to drive all night, alone, both craving and avoiding another honest moment because you know it will send you off the rails again.And then there's that kiss.Boys, let me let you in on a little secret. There's something about leaning and angled shoulders that really gets us. If you can perfect that, you're in. There's this moment in the elevator (which is one of the most perfect scenes ever to grace the screen). That one scene delivers what every movie should: an emotional roller-coaster. It goes from this precise anticipation to a perfect moment of abandon (still filled with the promise of violence and, therefore, a supremely palpable tension) to a startling and gruesome anger. (Well done, sfx crew!) That one scene is a perfectly encapsulated character study of Driver: a troubled, tortured scene for a troubled, tortured soul. The love story goes from maybe to yes to closing doors, shrinking beneath symbolic subtext. An entire movie in a minute: perfection.From every aspect: precision writing, flawless acting (I never thought saying Albert Brooks wasn't funny would be a compliment!), artful direction and cinematography, extremely believable sfx, even down to the costumes and that damn jacket (don't try this at home) that gets better as it gets bloodier, and the seedy LA locations, this movie just Gets. It. Right.The music is as hypnotic as the film, another homage, it would seem, to soundtracks from another era, such as Blade Runner. It has that '80s Casio feel but with an updated groove.You know that a movie's hit you where it hurts when you find yourself wondering if a fictional character is okay. Is he eating? Is he sleeping? Does he need a damn hug? A new jacket? Is he out of gas? Is there fresh blood on his gloves? Is he on the streets–right now–cool and cautious, somehow profoundly capable but equally crippled, a compact explosive driving an Impala?And can I get five minutes?I saw it again, and it's even more perfect the second time around the track. So stop reading reviews, get in your car, and drive to the theater right now. This movie deserves your time, your money, and your respect.The storm inside him escaping like invisible dark matter, trying to extract black and white from those gray eyes, betraying the need to just keep the wheels turningDrive: 4 Wheels; 10 Stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Art house at its best,"It's a rare event when one goes to a movie, expecting to see an action movie littered with mayhem and violence, only to be subjected to an artistic achievement in directing. Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is not only artsy, but is also one of the most gritty and violently graphic films I've ever seen.Drive starts off leisurely, and you're drawn into Refn's creative direction. In one scene, you follow Ryan Gosling's nameless character as he walks into a supermarket and goes up one aisle and down another; it's minutes later when he leaves, and throughout the whole sequence a word is never spoken. Drive is restrained at times, but just when you think the seat belt is a little too tight and needs to be loosened up, you are broadsided by brutal violence.Ryan Gosling gives a simple performance as a stunt car driver and mechanic by day and getaway driver by night; and in both jobs he excels. Gosling's character is very low key, sporting a very 80s like scorpion jacket in many scenes and chewing on a toothpick. Gosling's name slips under the radar when speaking of the top actors currently in pictures. Most likely it's because of his somewhat short resume, when compared to his colleagues; however upon scanning over his list of films and seeing his performances it may be time to start including him in those conversations. Carey Mulligan is enjoyable in the short amount of time she's on screen; the same is to be said for Bryan Cranston. Albert Brooks gives one of the best performances of the movie; his Bernie Rose is a welcome addition to great supporting characters.Drive is more art-house than your typical mainstream thriller. The story is well written, and the cast and director perform at a high level. Refn was very smart by incorporating a riveting high-speed getaway to start off the film, because I think he would have lost a majority of his audience without it. Although the movie moves at such a laid-back pace, I still felt drawn to what was happening and couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen; and this was after having already been sitting in the theater for over 6+ hours for two other movies. If you're squeamish, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a high level of action, this isn't for you either. If you're looking for a well scripted, well directed, wonderfully acted movie that's extremely violent, but all done within reason during the film, then this is a film made for you.Grade: B+Award worthiness: maybe a supporting actor nodAge appropriate meter: 18+ (graphic violence)visit our site at www.twodudereview.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Umm..Watch Drive,"This movie was interesting, having combined an action movie with a plot fairly well, however it kept the viewer drawn into the character, not because of this, but because of his innate ability to hold his feelings so well. Throughout the movie one would think what is this guy doing, just give up the money...what, you're satisfying your own ego for life or death? and why? The mysterious incognito persona of the character makes one wonder what his true intentions are...and at the end of the movie it is revealed to save a friendship. A def of a hero is one whom leaps over the bounds of confined clichae culture clicks. For anyone whom wants a quick blockbuster (which appears to be a movie set in the 80s btw), with a comical style twist and a simple narrative I rec this movie.

"Awesome film, and is actually more influenced by Japanese films then Hollywood action","This is one of the better films that I've seen in a while. It took me a while to figure this out, but in my opinion it's actually quite influenced by Japanese culture. (THIS MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS)You might wonder how I can believe that. A Danish director (Nicholas Winding Refn) makes a low budget indie film about a Hollywood stunt driver (Ryan Gosling)in LA.Well first of all, the music: The entire soundtrack is mainly electronic based music and steams of the 80's music scene. This isn't all that different from most of the animé films I've seen, e.g. The Ghost in The Shell and Akira.Secondly the main character. Goslings character is a nameless driver that rarely speaks and is the best at almost anything he does. He's a great driver, smarter than all the other characters and also overpowers them physically. In addition to these nietzschean features he's also a moral compass in comparison to the other characters, and doesn't necessarily put his own objectives primarily. A nameless stranger, smarter, stronger and basically good. This is the typical main character in many of Akira Kurosawas films (Compare him with ""The Samuraj"" in Yojimbo) *SPOILER* Goslings change in facial expression in the ultra violent elevator scene reeks classic animé.And thirdly, the style and the noire look: The low pace, it's angels, lighting and the dark city feel with a lot of focus on the skyscrapers (especially in the first 15 minutes of the film and the title sequence) is also very similar to many dystopian animé films.So when I've read a lot of reviews on Drive, which are all basically positive, it bothered me a bit when critics said that it's was an homage to the 80's and classical get away films. In my opinion this is just as much an homage to Japanese films and animé.These are just a few examples. I could also discuss the other characters and stereotypes, the acting, the (lack of) dialog, the violence etc, but I hope that you get the idea. In either way, this is a great film that I hope will go down in history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Not bad, but overly self-indulgent.","Director Nicolas Winding Refns' film of the James Sallis novel makes for fairly good entertainment. The basic story is decent, but Refn takes it all just a little too seriously, and his pacing will likely test the patience of some viewers. He really loves to stretch out his moments. He and his star Ryan Gosling work overtime to give both the film and the unnamed main character a sense of cool, but overall the main character just isn't that interesting, despite the fact that he can morph from soft spoken dude to brutal bad ass at the drop of a dime. Still, it's all attractively shot on various L.A. locations, and the supporting cast makes it worth watching. The brief bursts of graphic violence are a little jarring, but this viewer personally doesn't have a problem with that sort of thing.Made sort of in the style of Walter Hills' under-rated 1978 thriller ""The Driver"", ""Drive"" stars Gosling as a young man who clearly likes to keep busy, functioning as a part-time mechanic, a part-time car stunt specialist for the movies, and a part-time getaway driver for hire. Usually a careful individual, he only buys himself trouble when he becomes attracted to Irene (Carey Mulligan), who lives in his building with a young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). Irenes' former jailbird husband ""Standard"" (Oscar Isaac) is in trouble with goons who are trying to force him to take a robbery gig; The Driver oddly decides to do Standard a favour and participate in the robbery. Of course, things don't go as planned.The film does benefit from the kind of pulse quickening action scenes that you would expect from any film titled ""Drive"". Some of the dialogue is punchy, and delivered to perfection by co-star Albert Brooks, who has fun with a good part as a gangster. Bryan Cranston of 'Breaking Bad' fame is also excellent as The Drivers' friend at the garage. Ron Perlman is typically amusing as Brooks's associate, and it's nice to see screen veteran Russ Tamblyn (""West Side Story"", ""The Haunting"") in a brief appearance. Mulligan is both cute and appealing as the female lead.""Drive"" is ultimately much more of a character driven crime drama than action film in the end, and while some may find it too slow and too pretentious, it does adequately entertain with a number of good moments, and the performances help to keep it watchable.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
not worth the drive to the cinema,"I had high expectations of this movie, even talked my wife and adult daughter into watching it too. Actually that wasn't very difficult when I mentioned that Ryan Gosling was in it...they both seemed REALLY interested all of a sudden. Both had recently seen crazy stupid love and were fans of his 'work' there. So what went wrong with Drive? Well a combination of things really, including but not limited to:  Lack of interesting plot  Gratuitous violence that even Tarantino would find disturbing  Gosling's character being undeveloped, his motives unexplained and his behaviour erratic  Disjointed nature of the storyline – the husband? What's his story? Why was he in jail?  Great actors used poorly All in all pretty disappointing really and certainly not worth the hype. How on earth is this movie averaging 8.3!

Drive drifted daringly not daft yet undoubtedly devious.,"There are many negative remarks regarding the pace of the movie. Personally, it disappoints me that so many were turned off and maybe even walked out on this. I too suffered at first, but the movie is nothing but a steady crescendo of intensity. The director starts manipulating time itself with beautifully framed shots and distorting slow motion. This dramatically intense movie is undeniably refreshing from the sequel money maker hell that has been the past 15 or so years.A stunning soundtrack that lyrically fits each scene is still cruising around my head, most inevitably leading to the iTunes purchase of the entire album.

Don't Mess With Stuntmen,"Drive is a movie that's been on my radar for quite some time (especially after it showed up seemingly out of nowhere and garnered almost universal critical praise). After a colleague mentioned in passing that it was unexpectedly dark and well worth a look-see, I set aside 100 minutes this past Wednesday night to finally see what all the fuss is about.The movie follows an enigmatic figure known only as ""Driver."" He's a mechanic and Hollywood stuntman who spends his nights as a wheelman for people pulling burglaries. He's quiet and, aside from the death-defying nature of both his day and night jobs, doesn't seem to have much of a ""normal"" life. He doesn't have any friends—apart from the gnarled shop owner who hired him some years prior—and seems consistently lost in thought. When he speaks, everyone listens (including viewers), because there's something magnetic about his persona. This is due to Gosling's impeccable depiction of an apparently tortured protagonist—I say ""apparently"" because even though we don't get any real back story it's clear that said Driver is constantly trying to overcome his own demons— and the crisp writing and direction. Things progress deliberately (which doesn't necessarily mean slowly), and each frame is saturated with emotional resonance.Much to my surprise, Drive is, at its heart, a crime drama. The plot is fueled by an east coast/west coast mob fiasco that's directly related to a botched robbery attempt our Driver was involved in. There were moments where this nebulous MacGuffin felt a little cliché (echoes of a A History of Violence abound), but make no mistake: the tension is tangible from start to finish. In fact, I can't remember a recent offering within this genre was so methodical while also managing to foster a never wavering sense of dread that something horrendous was just around the corner (okay, maybe The Departed fits the bill, but you get the point).Drive is like an otherwise perfect piece of fruit with a few minor imperfections. And like the bruised pear these are easily pared away, and what's left is one of the more engrossing crime-action thrillers of the past decade. Be sure to check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Classic action film,"Fasten your seat belts. Ryan Gosling stars in the new crime drama ""Drive"". Gosling plays a nameless driver who stunt drives in movies during the day, and is a wheel man at night. He is extremely quiet and quite emotionless; he very rarely cracks a smile.The driver becomes close with his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her son, Benicio (Kaden Leos), whose father is in jail. Eventually, the driver becomes a little too caught up in the father's unfinished business.If you saw the trailer for ""Drive"" and you're expecting an action film like ""Iron Man"" or ""Fast Five"", you'll be disappointed. This film is very different from most current action films. It's classic like Clint Eastwood movies. There is action, but in a much more artistic way. The director, Nicolas Winding Refn, used several interesting and unique camera angles that make you feel like you're in the room with the characters.Even though Refn is known for using an immense amount of gore in his films, it was a bit over the top in ""Drive"". I've had my fair share of violent movies, but this is the goriest movie I've ever seen. If hardcore violence bothers you, do not see this movie. It's disturbing.Ryan Gosling is stunning. Most people agree with me that this is his best film to date. We see a completely different side of him. Everyone was cast perfectly, in my opinion. Some might say that the characters weren't developed enough, but I think Refn left a lot for the viewers to find out on their own or to imagine for themselves.""Drive"" is a unique, authentic film that is incredibly crafted.

Drive - Some,"First, I'd like to say that any review over 2 regarding this movie must be receiving compensation in some way because this was bar-none the worst movie of the year and then some.The previews lure in viewers with a promise of action and thrills. This film was very far from anything of the likes. Nothing could be more slow except maybe watching molasses travel up hill on a cold day.The actors seemed as though they were constantly waiting for a cue to say their lines. One would speak, then a few moments pass, then a reply from the other. This was the norm throughout the film.Our main actor has absolutely no emotion what-so-ever and very little dialogue. The others weren't much different.There are those here who believe this film is intended to be a retro film compared to those of the 80's. It's nothing of the sort. The only thing retro here was the main actor's choice in cars. I'm not sure what the intention of this film is. It appeared to me to be the work of an over indulged amateur.Then there's the premise that this film is about driving. There are maybe 5 scenes that actually involve driving and those are quite lack-luster to say the least.Do yourself a favor, save your cash at the box office or even with DVD. Stay away from this film.If I hadn't been with others, I would have walked out on this stinker within the first 20 minutes. Out of the 5 people I saw the film with, not one of us enjoyed it.

The Evolution of Cinema,"My experience seeing Drive was like that of people seeing something like Star Wars when it first premiered in theaters. From the moment it started I knew I was witnessing something unique and new, an evolved film just a bit ahead of everything else. A friend of mine remarked that it's an ""indie"" mainstream movie, which could not be more on point. Drive has the depth of the most iconic independent features yet has been directed to the masses. It's exciting for me to witness a film like this, defying the rules and bringing everyone something so big with such beautiful restraint. Film is changing. It's mutating into something we've never seen before. But I think we're finally ready for it.Drive tells the story of an unnamed Hollywood stunt driver working for the movies by day and robbing banks by night. He's a getaway driver and he provides his clients, as we are told in the opening lines, with five minutes. After those five minutes he can and will get them from point a to point b. But he doesn't get his hands dirty; that's not his job. He drives. And thus begins this dark fairytale of a simple man with extraordinary talents and how his world is shaken when he falls for a neighbor and ultimately is set up when obliged to help her ex-con husband.The driver, played by Ryan Gosling, is a tremendous character, given such little dialogue, yet played with so many layers. Gosling probably has about five pages of lines and not much else. Most actors would complain that they were given nothing to work with, yet Gosling seizes the opportunity for creation. His iconic character is a quiet, introverted man who is genuinely seized with a storm of emotions he is unfamiliar to during the course of the film. There is one shot, after some particularly gruesome business, when he turns around to look at his neighbor Irene, played with touching sympathy by Carey Mulligan. He is bloodstained, trembling, and frighteningly silent, but he has a fire inside of him that pours out of his eyes, displaying a chilling mix of a savage monster and an innocent child. That is what's so incredible about this performance. He perfectly blends a reserved and even bashful innocence with primal viciousness. Ryan Gosling is truly at the leading front of a new level of acting. His driver is an ode to characters like Deniro's Travis Bickle and Pacino's Michael Corleone but with a heightened humanism those other roles at times lacked. This work is complex and scary and absolutely wonderful.Gosling is supported by an excellent cast, each bringing something refreshing and incredibly truthful to their parts. Albert Brooks' mob boss is a force of its own. Like Paul Newman's character in Road to Perdition, Brooks is a likable villain who will help his friends and take them down without hesitation. He is scary, but not just because he's the bad guy. He's scary because he seems like a real bad guy. Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, and Oscar Isaacs round the rest of the cast out, bringing true dimension to what they are given. So rarely are we treated to a movie filled with such talented people, working so hard to give us something so special.But the acting is only one part of this powerhouse. Director Nicholas Winding Refn has come to form with Drive. His earlier work, Bronson and the Pusher trilogy had flare and incredible skill, but Drive is his real breakout. It's a great example of a director's growth. Everything just comes together in a way that he hadn't done before. The soundtrack, cinematography, even the credits fit so, so nicely. This is film.He opens the movie up with such a tense chase seen that rivals the drama of the opening of Inglorious Basterds, but he does it with so much style. In Drive, he gives us a western, a superhero movie, and a fantasy in just over an hour and a half. And it flows so well. This analogy doesn't quite do the film justice, but he almost shows us a combination of a music video and a feature length movie. It just has that much grace. I was always on board with his work but now I'm fully on the team. He is someone to watch and I am gushing with excitement about his re-teaming with Gosling for a Logan's Run remake.Drive is just special. It's not something a review can sum up. It is beautiful; it is a piece of art. Go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Beyond that, in a realm of it's own (where only Angels dwell) the cinematography, lighting and (most of all) editing are beyond words - inspired, even genius. The film is beautiful in every way. There is not a second of dead space. The acting and directing are subdued to the point of cracking. The script is intelligent, crisp, taut, naked and censored of bullshit. The violence is visceral – most disturbing not in its graphic display but in its contextual presentation. Never gratuitous; never senseless - the violence hurts most because it is exactly what it is and nothing more. Albert Brooks says ""It's OK, it's OK, no more pain, it's over"" an we want to crawl under our seats until mommy wakes us in the morning and tells us it was just a nightmare. Who resurrected Gregg Toland, Robert Wise and Bernard Hermann to photograph, edit and score this film? Who brought the young Orson Welles, Frank Capra, Sam Fuller and Francis Ford Coppola together to direct this masterpiece? Drive should be mandatory viewing for every film student for the next 100 years.

They don't get much better than this,"The Best Picture race has begun ... although I fear this one won't survive the Academy's final cut (I'd venture to say it's ""too cool"" for The Academy). Drive is a wonder to behold and watch.Drive is a film about a driver who is a film stunt man and a random getaway driver for various people who needs his services for a short yet solid five minutes of work -- the film's opening cat-and-mouse scene sets the tone for what's to come. The Driver is played by Ryan Gosling (The Notebook, Half Nelson, Crazy Stupid Love) and he is a man of few words. He appears to drive simply to have a purpose.Driver soon meets a young mother, Irene(Carey Mulligan - Pride & Prejudice, An Education, Wall Street 2), who lives in his apartment building ... and the two become quasi-friends as they both tend to be guarded and rather quiet although their facial expressions and body language tell us everything we need to know about them. Driver quickly befriends her young son ... but their friendship becomes strained upon the arrival of his father/her husband, Standard, (Oscar Isaac - Robin Hood, Sucker Punch) ... a recovering criminal with ties to some total losers who don't want to allow him to exit/leave their line of work so that he can honestly provide for his family.Believing that he has the ability to help Standard obtain a life of respectability, Driver sets out to help him on one final heist ... only things don't go as planned ... for anybody. Albert Brooks (Broadcast News, Mother) and Ron Perlman (City of Lost Children, Hellboy) play some fellow wannabe-thugs and Mad Men's Christina Hendricks shows up briefly as Blanche, a fellow co-hort in crime.With a pulsating soundtrack (featuring some awesome songs!), the film comes alive and becomes ripe with feeling as Driver (himself) experiences a rebirth of feelings that had long been dormant. At times gentle and at time brutally violent ... Drive is an artistic triumph as it is a mesmerizing watch. Layered with metaphor (note Driver's jacket), superior lighting and sound editing, and an ingenious use of character names (Standard, Blanche, Irene means ""peace"" etc.), Drive is one of those RARE films that make you glad to be alive in this time of cinema.Drive is one of the few films I have seen in recent years that remind you of life ... and what it means to feel and have a sense of worth and belonging. It does seem to be a film of few words ... but extra words were not necessary ... as Drive is alive. And thank God I am too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Didn't get it,"I kind of think they wanted a little bit of Transporter, maybe a bit more of The Professional. What I saw was a main character that spoke so little he seemed mentally handicapped at times (no exaggeration). The driving aspect was shot to minimize the ""car chase"" theme but in so doing they took an element of excitement away. Good that they stayed away from Gone in 60 Seconds corn, but they didn't have to go quite that far. He hardly speaks to the love interest, so her interest in himis almost confusing. Anyways. not a bad film but this has to be Goslings most wooden performance yet although he didn't write it so I am not blaming him.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Incredible movie.,"Not only is this movie easily the best film of this year it may be one of the top best movies in the last ten years. It's stylish and not afraid to stun the audiences with filming art that many Hollywood movies are afraid to do these days. I would say the Elevator scene rivals the Rape and Fire-Extinguisher scenes in ""Irreversible"" but at a more emotional level rather than a brutal level. I was loving this movie and was disappointed once it ended not because I was disappointed with the movie but because it ended, I wanted more. Though not entirely a gangster/mob film I would say it ranks up there with the rest of them including GoodFellas, Pulp Fiction and others. If you lack a thinking-capacity or have the attention span of a five year old this movie is not for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece...I guess,"Drive is one of those rare movies I can praise for its originality and its success in expressing its point yet I simply couldn't stomach another viewing. Its audacious and different to be sure but theirs just something inherently rotten about it.Ryan Gosling plays a pensive young man who makes his living as a stunt driver and getaway driver for hire. Finding jobs mostly through his handler Shannon (Bryan Cranston), Driver (yes that's his name too) lives a comfortable and regimented existence. But When a lonely neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son (Kaden Leos) make a connection with him, things start to unravel.The first half of the movie has a meditative Kubrick-ian style that immediately entranced me. The minimalist dialogue was spot on and the spellbinding late night drives through downtown L.A. were zen-like, like visual poetry. The throbbing soundtrack only aided me further in enveloping me in Driver's quiet, cool world.Then heads started rolling. Every drop of blood is painfully exuded from open wounds all for the camera and audience. Both Driver and the bad guys (Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman) seem to have an aversion to guns so they do their killing with sharp razors and blunt boot heels instead. The story then feels like the director stacked a score of champagne glasses into a pyramid then smashed them with a sledgehammer. Its not to say the dramatic series of events wasn't expected but it was done so abruptly and with such vulgarity that, in my opinion, it undermines everything that came before it.No doubt strong visceral reactions were expected by director Nicholas Winding Refn who previously directed the violent yet intriguing ""Bronson."" Both ""Bronson"" and ""Drive"" are grouped with a slew of recent films delving into the nature of violence. Other films include: Best Picture winner ""No Country for Old Men"" and last years Korean film ""I Saw the Devil."" It's a theme worth exploring but not my particular cup of tea.Like the dangerous stunts Driver pulls on his film sets, this film is meant for those who know what they're doing. Passive moviegoers beware; but for those considered film buffs, ""Drive"" is a must see.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Artful rather than Artistic.,"Pretentious and derivative. Overly-stylized violence distilled to its basest essence -- neither visceral nor intellectual -- that, it doesn't so much shock as desensitize.The director,Nicolas Winding Refn, hasn't a creative -- or an original -- bone in his body; mimics Brian De Palma, Martin Scorcese, Quentin Tarantino et al.Ryan Gosling does his impersonation of the remote, existentialist anti-hero. But instead of appearing preoccupied and intense, he just looks 'blank'; not too unlike a damaged adult Opie.

Drive: Tarantino on Neutral,"Drive isn't about action. It isn't about blood, fighting, sex, drugs, or even, driving This new ""Action/Thriller"" movie is an artistic endeavor showcasing a general blueprint intellectually analogous to that of most Quentin Tarantino movies.The film's composition is a fascinating interpretation of film noir and unlike most action recent action movies does not take advantage of new technology for intense, fiery action scenes. Conversely, the film takes advantage of long takes in which movements and conversations are slowly, rhythmically paced; actors are often allowed to react in real time without cuts. With exquisite cinematography and a disconcerting electronica, dream-like score coupled with shockingly brutal and explicit scenes of violence, this film works to invoke the cinematic ideals showcased in Quentin Tarantino classics like Kill Bill, and Pulp Fiction with one notable exception – Drive has virtually no dialogue.Director Nicolas Refn (of not much else) takes an overly ambitious step by excluding dialogue from the film, and, although the silences emphasize the impressive cinematographic qualities of the film, these noiseless moments make the viewing experience alienating and awkward for the viewers. The movie's quiet nature is augmented by the fact that the movie's protagonist, Ryan Gosling, is a nameless mechanic/movie stunt- car driving/robbery getaway driver is monosyllabic for the entirety of the film. Furthermore, the equally whispery co-star, Carey Mulligan, plays a relatively small, nearly forgettable role in the film.The other key misleading point about the movie is that the main character, the driver, doesn't really, well drive. Just as Quentin Tarantino applied the theory in his lesser-known, car-chase slasher Death Proof, Refn's Drive revolves around the idea more than the character himself. In both movies, characters live and breathe in these environments – their cars serving merely as tools. However, Death Proof showcased an intense driving scene riddled with the special- effects, action-laden shots viewers have come to know. With Drive, however, viewers will come to remember the essence of the silent, artistically portrayed driver – not the machines, or even the ways in which he commandeers them.For most Quentin Tarantino films, this disturbingly graphic, nauseatingly artistic film should be a satisfactory respite from the 21st century, Killer Elite action films that have recently roared into theaters. However, for viewers looking for more stimulating, exciting, and thrilling viewing experiences this movie isn't worth the ticket price.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A nail biter of a thriller. Gosling and Refn knock it out of the park.,"I recently lent my attention to Drive, an art-house thriller from director Nicolas Winding Refn. And yes, in case you were wondering, it really is that good. Drive is outstanding.Ryan Gosling plays Driver (His real name is never revealed in the film), a man who works as a car mechanic and Hollywood stunt driver by day, but by night, moonlights as a getaway guy. He gives his clients a five minute window, and carries no weapons. ""I drive"" as he puts it. Across the hall from him is that of Irene (Played by Carey Mulligan), and her young son, leading him to help them out, and forcing him to suppress feelings he's developed for Irene. But Irene's husband (Played by Oscar Isaac) is released from prison, and sought after by criminals who force him to complete one last job for them, enlisting Driver's help, and sending everything afterward into a spiral.Let me say this: There's a reason that Refn won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. Obviously, what he does with actors and story building is quite strong, but the atmosphere and ambient sounds do just as much storytelling as the former two do. He paints a violent, chilling portrait that places an emphasis on tension, and even the sense of paranoia. He does this, along with the lens of DP Newton Thomas Siegel, the interesting cuts and dissolves of editor Mat Newman, and particularly well staged driving sequences, to involve the audience as much as he is involved, none more attention grabbing than a very well handled scene in an elevator.As for the story, - adapted from the James Sallis book - it's also an essential to the mood. Something in the film is always up, something always feels off. Whether it's the action of a character looking over their shoulder, or a bit of improvisation of one actor to keep another on edge and at the ready, the actions feel legitimate.Ryan Gosling gives a no holds barred performance as Driver. His quiet expressions give off a deceptive, perplexing facade to something that's boiling with emotion. Emotion is there, it's just not incredibly obvious. The penetrating glimpse of Gosling's eyes and what his character must be thinking conveys a very fascinating side of him that you might not expect.It's also worth nothing the rest of the cast. Carey Mulligan shines as Irene, as well as flawlessly hiding her British accent. Bryan Cranston, as Driver's mentor, manages to get a sense of warmth across. Oscar Isaac and Ron Perlman do well with their supporting roles, while Christina Hendricks achieves solidity with her small cameo. But let's not forget Albert Brooks, cast as far away from type as humanly possible as crime boss, Bernie Rose. His subtle stance manages to hide a darkly intimidating persona chilling enough to make yours truly gulp.All this praise aside, Drive can be polarizing. Either you'll love it in a big way, or you'll probably be turned off by a lot of it. As for me, I'll be looking forward to giving the film a couple more looks.As expected since the start, I'm giving Drive **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Some Heroes Are Real,"DRIVE tells the story of Driver (yes, that is his name), played by the wonderful Ryan Gosling. He's a stuntman and a ""driver-for-hire"" (think THE TRANSPORTER), but above all, he's good at driving. No, he's the best at driving, or at least that's what we're told, but it doesn't take us long to believe that once the film opens with a car chase that is something that should be experienced. The sequence starts off quietly but builds up in nail-biting suspense with each second. If that wasn't enough, the fantastic soundtrack will suck you in. It's wonderfully shot and cleanly edited, nothing like you'd see in a Hollywood action film these days. And it's clear, DRIVE is nothing like a Hollywood film, defying conventions and deliberate in pace. I'd say it's something like an art-house action flick but on with the story.Driver meets his beautiful neighbor, Irene, played by Carey Mulligan, whose husband is in jail. The two click instantly with a look. Since Driver isn't the talkative type, they don't get to speak to each other much. In a scene where they are alone, they just stare into their eyes, one smiling to the other. It's an endearing scene where the actors' expressions seem more important and effective than dialogue. However, Irene's husband eventually does come home, and that's when bad things start to happen. I will not reveal what occurs because you should just really watch the whole thing unravel. Additionally, avoid the trailer because it unfortunately gives a lot of plot points away. However, I will say it gets very violent and bloody.DRIVE wants the audience to get to know its characters before starting the action, and it's obvious that this is Ryan Gosling's film. Let me just say that I think Gosling is a terrific actor, from his roles in HALF NELSON to BLUE VALENTINE to LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. This guy can act, and his talent remains apparent with his first action role in DRIVE. Even though his character doesn't talk much, Gosling is able to command the camera with a single look. He brings a large presence throughout the film, only talking when he needs to. Carey Mulligan is also very good, and I should say that she is a terrific actress as well and at such a young age! The two definitely have great chemistry with each other. Bryan Cranston is Bryan Cranston. What can I say? If you've seen BREAKING BAD, you know how good he is. He's just wonderful in here. The remaining major supporting actors do just as a great job in their roles as everyone else, including Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Ron Perlman. and Christina Hendricks.With a tight direction by Nicolas Winding Refn, wonderful performances from a knock-out cast, and tense action scenes, DRIVE is quite something. Even though the story may feel familiar, the art-house style of the film makes it refreshing. I can guarantee that not everyone will like it, but it should be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My Favorite Film of 2011,"¨If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place. I give you a five-minute window, anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours no matter what. I don't sit in while you're running it down; I don't carry a gun... I drive. ¨Drive is probably my favorite film of the year so far. I hadn't even watched the trailers for this movie so I had no idea what it was about, but what a special surprise I was in for. The movie hooked me from the very opening action scene up to the very end. Yes, the film is slow at times, but it's also intense and original. This art-house action movie works in great part thanks to a terrific performance from Ryan Gosling. He keeps on surprising me; he is a hugely talented actor and can excel in any role. This time he proved himself in this action film as the lead man. The reason the movie is so slow at times is because it is character driven, and Gosling's character is so quiet and laid back; he hardly speaks and the dialogues he has feel real and authentic. The dialogue in this film was brilliant, everything about it made it perfect. I would absolutely watch this movie over and over again because it is just that good. I couldn't believe the direction the movie was taking. It is one of those action movies that is hard to predict and I loved not anticipating what was going to happen next. Gosling is a star, he is great in this movie and the feel that the movie has is just so amazing. It's hard to get this overwhelmed by an action film these days because we've seemed to have seen it all, but Drive feels fresh and original. It doesn't focus so much on the action and the heists as much as it does on the characters. Gosling's character grows increasingly dark over the course of the movie, and so does the violence in this movie. It really has a Tarantino/Cronenberg feel to it (A History of Violence, Pulp Fiction). Drive was amazing, but many people may be put off by all the violence.The movie focuses on a driver (Ryan Gosling) who's name is never said in the film; he has a part time job as a Hollywood stunt man specializing in crash scenes, but spends most of the time at a mechanic shop working for Shannon (Bryan Cranston) on some classic cars. Shannon knows that this guy is extremely talented and wants him to become a NASCAR driver, but in order to do so he needs to buy a car first. Shannon decides to make a deal with an old mobster friend named Bernie (Albert Brooks) who gives him the money to buy the car. Bernie also has an associate, Nino (Ron Perlman), a New York Jewish mobster who broke Shannon's pelvis in the past for trying to overcharge him for a job he had done. Differences settled however they all decide to put their money on the driver, who is a quiet fellow who spends some nights as a wheelman on heist jobs. He is very professional about it. He soon begins a friendship with a neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos) and the relationship seems to slowly develop into a romantic one until Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) returns home from prison. Standard promises to leave his past life behind him, but he owes a lot of money to some people back in prison who offered their protection in exchange. Now Standard is forced to accept a heist or else his family will be in great danger. The driver finds out about the threat and decides to help Standard, but something goes wrong in the heist and the movie develops violently from that point forward.I can't help but repeating myself when I say this was a great film. Ryan Gosling really gives one of the year's best performances and his character is really intriguing. Gosling is a smart actor, he knows what roles to accept and he makes the best of them. In Drive he was given a really great script that allowed him to show off his full potential. The character is so central to the film that Gosling basically carries the movie, although the supporting cast was also great. Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, and Albert Brooks were great in their roles, and Carey Mulligan also had great chemistry with Gosling. Their relationship felt very real and nothing felt forced. Drive isn't your typical Hollywood action film, it's more of an indie film, and a dark one. There is a lot of violence, some strong scenes, so it might not be for everyone. I really enjoyed it and thought it was one of the best art-house action films I've seen in a long time. Last year I was blown away by Affleck's action film, The Town, but this year Drive manages to surpass it. Gosling's character reminded me a lot of De Niro en Taxi Driver; he is just that good. The action scenes were also very well choreographed and there were some great driving scenes, although the best thing about the movie was the character driven story. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of the film which felt retro. Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (known for The Pusher trilogy) did a great job with this film, and Hossein Amini deserves a nomination for his screenplay adaptation of James Sallis's book. Drive is one of the best films of the year.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Simply Amazing!,"I saw a screening of this film, and it was seriously riveting! I don't remember the last time a movie gave me chills, made me jump or had me on the edge of my seat like this one did. Ryan Gosling truly shows his acting skills in this movie. His diversity in different movie roles is extremely apparent during this one. He plays a sort-of strong, silent type, but when he has something to say, he holds attention phenomenally. Some of it was a bit more gory than I had expected as well, which is not a bad thing in my opinion. Such scenes were done so well and were anything but disappointing! The relationship aspect of the movie was a tad off to me in the beginning but nearer to the end, I fell into it a bit more and grew to enjoy it. A lot of this movie had some ""shockers"" too and some unexpected scenes that caught me off guard. This movie exceeded my expectations, I agree with an earlier review saying it's the best film of the year of its genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Not quite as I expected, and kind of overrated","Well, I'm one of those people who sees the reviews first before watching the film. And when I bought the DVD, I was kinda excited because this film's rating is high, 8,2 that is.Then I watched it. I was so excited seeing the prologue when The Driver's carrying out a heist. I thought it was going to be something like a high-tension chase between The Driver and the polices, and that's implying how I expected this film was going to be. But honestly, for the first half of the film, I was quite sleepy, when it was filled with far-from-action-like plot orientation, but instead a slow, dark and gloomy orientation. But, yes, I admit it went better at the beginning of the later half of the film, when The Driver takes Standard to a heist, I thought the tension was going better until the end of the film, but instead, now it went down again to a gloomy and dark story of violence and vengeance. Not to mention there's so many flaws and weaknesses to this film. Like there's no character development, lots of meaningless scene (ie. the river scene, the movie-making scene.), unrealistic scene (ie. the cliff scene, the elevator scene, etc.), and despite those, would you think it's THAT easy to kill mob people with just a hammer? Aren't they supposed to have guards around them? Too many things left wasted, actually.Come to think of it, this film is the same as Faster (2010) starred by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Where the main character is a nameless bad- ass muscled driver who seldom talks and went around the neighborhood killing people to avenge some problems for his dark past. If you ever watch Faster, then I told you, this film is quite the same with it.So if you expect this film to be an action-packed and filled with breathtaking action scene, you're wrong.Hope that helps.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Probably the most overrated movie I've ever seen,"So this movie was a spin the wheel movie, I spin a wheel where I have to watch the movie whatever it lands on, and of course, I put the movies on the wheel based on interest etc. This was the 13th I spinned: Drive.I put Drive on the list because Billie Eilish claimed this as one of her favourites, so this is the pure reason I put this on the wheel, I don't know why, since I'm not even the biggest Billie Eilish fan, but I decided to watch it since I've seen so many 10 and 9 out of 10 scores, so I expected something crazy good. Now, a 10 out of 10 movie should be something you wouldn't have trouble rewatching, where you can quote from the movie, or put something great into your life that left you speechless, and you just scream: ""This is why I watch movies""Now, Drive have none of those. In fact this movie has the weirdest story-telling and acting in movies, so much so that I pretended to have artist eyes, to look for hidden meanings because I thought I was the problem, but no, this is in fact an OK movie, but the bad kind of OK rather than the good kind.The movie is 1 hour and 40 minutes long and 20 out of those minutes are either still frames, or slowed down moments that happen for absolutely no reason at all, and I had to check if I aciddentally stopped the movie or not, because these scenes could last 15 seconds or longer, then there's the minimal amount of script, it feels like Ryan Gosling turned to the director and said: ""I charge 500 dollars per sentence"", Ryan Gosling's character act cool, try to look serious, and he is not the kind of guy I would've imagined for this role, hell this movie feels and acts like a Liam Neeson movie, but Liam Neeson wasn't available so they were like ""Let's call Ryan Gosling, I'm sure he will pull this off"". Spoiler alert: He didn't.The violence is so sudden, it's heavy gore that looked insane, but because this movie doesn't recquired that heavy gore, it did not make the movie better it just made me go ""Finally, some action"". It's kinda ironic how there's no driving for more than half of this movie despite the title. They didn't do anything with the scenes, they rush, sometimes they take their time, sometimes they do something that doesn't even make any sense for example the ending, and the love interest of the movie.Help me understand how I should've stood up from this, and go ""Masterpiece"" if there's barely any plot, there are flaws in storytelling and it's mismarketed. How did this movie won so many awards while better movies does not even get any attraction? I am mad at Drive, and I don't want to watch this again, so much so that I strongly believed that this movie made my 6 out of 10 score look overrated too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"He is no deNiro and ""Drive"" is no ""Taxi Driver""","For explanation: I did not read most of the other reviews.

I think the current rating of 8.2 is not justified by its merits - I would rate it 6 maybe 7. On a more positive note, I think both actors and direction have a lot of potential for more. That is probably the reason why I was disappointed this time. I would definitely look out for future film in this combination.

Fails on every level. Drive BY the theater. Do not stop.,"A pathetically contrived and derivative pseudo-psychological film-gris that wanted to be noir but realized it couldn't, so it beat its audience over the head instead.The violence was clumsily comical, the characters were unengaging and entirely deserving of their fate, the action was soporific, and whatever he is, Ryan Gosling is not all that. He was certainly incapable of the excruciatingly long dramatic pauses and beats that unsuccessfully attempted to convey empathy and the ""unspoken longing"" between him and Carey Mulligan. I could certainly see what it tried to do, which is it gets a 3 instead of a 1.

It is a brilliant film and surpassed my expectations. The music is amazing, the acting is brilliant and the direction is superb. It is a thriller more on the lines of History of Violence, slow, brooding and allows for character buildup. The plot is predictable but done so differently that it keeps you engrossed.

"Certainly not rated ""8"".","I really have a hard time, in this day and age, when technical details are just ignored and the audience is left to put up with what's left. Case in point: In the beginning, the driver is given a Chevrolet Impala. No manual transmission Impalas have been built for decades. Yet, we are asked to suspend disbelief and, listening to the sound track while the Impala is being driven hard, presume the trans is a manual.While it is true that an Impala can be jury-rigged with a manual transmission, we aren't given any indication that this is the case.Similarly, when the car is a Mustang GT 5.0, at the 53 minute mark, a quick glimpse is given of the trans shifter on the console. Again, an automatic. Yet, the sound track, again, is filled with the noise of a manual trans car being driven hard.Ryan Gosling is great as the ""Very Little to Say"" good guy. Carey Mulligan plays her role well, though the relationship between her character and her husband, just returned from a stretch in prison, is ill-defined and left for conjecture.A good movie, not an ""8"" by any means, but, all in all, if the problems with the sound issue are ignored, a good watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Derivative, but none the worse for it.","No man is an island, and even on some forsaken windswept rock off the coast of Denmark the warm Hollywood sunshine still has the power to bring forth flowers in the spring. Don't take the word ""derivative"" to be a criticism, it isn't meant that way. Its OK to be derivative, when one is deriving inspiration from some of the best there is. I didn't know anything about this film before viewing and for the first half hour I was convinced it was a re-make of Walter Hills 1978 classic ""Driver"" The characters of Cowboy and the unnamed driver are virtually identical, both have an icy cold detachment from the world which only thaws when viewed through the windscreen of a speeding car. Both live in low rent apartments or hotel rooms with seemingly no personnel possessions and both have the same Achilles heel. (is it a co-incidence both leading actors are Ryans? Probably ) The other lead character, LA, specifically LA at night is pure Michael Mann transplanted from Heat and Collateral, the strange 80s soundtrack and green neon title graphics a nod to Miami Vice and later Man Hunter. Mann and Hill were contemporaries, influencing each other, where Hill had his Driver, Mann had his Thief and both clearly have influenced Winding Refn, which is a very good thing indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dynamic and entertaining neo-noir plot trumps Gosling and Mulligan wooden parts and performances,"'Drive' is directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, a Danish director known for films with a violent bent. 'Drive' is no exception, as it emulates some of the darker film noirs of the 40s and 50s as well as the neo-noirs of later years. Refn shot 'Drive' in a contemporary Los Angeles but due to the use of an 80s, synth pop score, the story feels like it's more from the 80s rather than today (sounds like some of those synth tracks with the choppy bass parts were 'borrowed' from one of Hall and Oates' more popular hits).For women who might be drawn to the film due to the casting of Ryan ('The Hunk') Gosling in the lead role, be forewarned that 'Drive' is anything but a 'chick flick'. Gosling, in an unnamed part, moonlights as a getaway driver but has more respectable jobs as a part-time stunt driver and auto mechanic. Unfortunately, Gosling has little dialogue and speaks mostly in a monotone. Even worse is Carey Mulligan who plays Irene, the Driver's next door neighbor and mother of a five year old, who appears to drift about in a perpetual stupor (I seem to recall that when Driver crushes the hit man's head in the elevator, Irene backs off in shock but later never discusses or alludes to the incident at all).Things pick up in terms of action when Irene's husband, Standard, is released from prison but is being forced to commit another robbery by a brute named Cook, who claims Standard still owes a debt to former inmate associates who 'protected' him while incarcerated. A normal guy might feel some jealousy when another man encroaches on his territory, but 'Knight-in-Shining Armor' Gosling is ready to help Standard simply because he's taken a real liking to Irene and the kid.'Drive' soon begins to shine through some neat twists and turns in the plot as well as the introduction of cool supporting players who overshadow both Mr. Gosling and Ms. Mulligan. Some critics have argued that the violence in 'Drive' is gratuitous, but I beg to differ. It might be a bit over the top, but is never cartoonish. In fact, the violence underscores the menacing, ruthless character of the antagonists Gosling's Driver must face.Cook beats Standard to a bloody pulp and the shocks are just beginning. There's the big double cross at the pawn shop, where Standard is shot in the back and later Cook's moll, Blanche, is gunned down at the motel room (there was a significant gasp that could be heard throughout the theater from a taken aback audience when the moll is dispatched). Gosling also gets the chance to be ruthless when he works Cook over. Later Bernie (a mobster played by Albert Brooks, who earlier backed the Driver and Shannon, the owner of the auto body shop where the Driver worked, in a joint stock car racing venture) kills Cook by stabbing him in the face. In addition to the aforementioned 'stomping in the elevator' scene, Bernie eliminates Shannon 'mercifully' by slicing his artery, causing the Driver's former pal, to slowly bleed to death.Who would have thought that comedian Albert Brooks, could actually be so good as an amoral crime boss? Bryan Cranston is also excellent as the Driver's seedy employer. Ron Perlman is always great playing the heavy but I would have liked to have seen more of him, as his character Nino's declaration of his Jewishness, remains wholly underdeveloped.The film's climax, where the Driver cuts off Nino's car on the highway, leading to his death by drowning at the hands of the Driver, was quite exciting. Less exciting and more awkward was the Driver's agreement to meet Bernie in public and return the money. For a person as crafty as the driver, didn't he anticipate that Bernie would try and hurt him at the scene of their meeting place? Or is it that he just didn't care? One other thing I wondered about at film's end. If the loot belonged to the east coast Mafia, even though Bernie and Nino were now dead, wouldn't the Mafioso still come looking for the Driver as well as Irene, who they would have discovered was affiliated with him? Thus, how could the Driver ride off into the sunset, knowing full well that Irene was still vulnerable?When I saw the title 'Drive', I expected the film to have many more chase scenes. Fortunately, director Refn took the story in a different direction, emphasizing the rivalry between the Driver and his criminal antagonists. 'Drive' is a film which doesn't have a lot to say. In other words, if you're looking for great 'meaning', you will not find it here. With the exception of the more complex Bernie, its characters are pretty much one-dimensional caricatures, especially the main protagonists, played by Gosling and Mulligan. Nonetheless, in the tradition of some of the great noirs and neo-noirs of the past, 'Drive' manages to be highly entertaining, due to a dynamic plot, that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
So overrated,"We picked this movie for a movie night with my wife and her girlfriend who both love Ryan Gosling, I could care less about Ryan, but was more interested in the plot as I am a fan of Tarantino and similar directors. Oh man, what a let down. I am one of those people who do not want anyone talking during their movies, but we just couldn't help filling in the lines for the actors during the extremely long and drawn out silences. I can see what this movie was going for, I just feel like it missed the mark completely. I honestly can't believe the reviews on here, I was stunned. I never write reviews on films, and I could understand if I gave it a 6 or so, as the average is 8, but I honestly feel like the 3 was generous. Complete miss in my book. And really.. how could even take Gosling serious? So freaking corny and cliché, and not in a good way.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This is why I love films,"This film is just one of those movies that wakes you up because of its uniqueness and makes you realize that not all movie scenes and plots you can expect. Almost every movie out there, are so predictable. You can judge a movie based on how many explosions there are, or if there's a love affair, how it'll turn out in the end. The fact is, however, the movie ""Drive"" follows more of an unconventional, yet more realistic plot. I won't say what happens, but just know that it's not what you think. In my viewing of the movie, I knew right off the bat that I couldn't expect a single thing to happen. I was sucked into the movie because I had to know what was going to happen. To my surprise, what actually happened was neither what I expected nor what I didn't expect. Up until the end of the movie, the movie itself was playing with my mind, telling me ""this is how it is"" not ""this is how you would have wanted it"". I enjoyed it immensely, and I hope other viewers will do the same, if they haven't already.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drove me the right way,"I wasn't really too sure with what to expect with Drive. People were calling it an incredibly slow art-house movie, which I don't mind at all, I'm quite fond of the odd good art-house movie e.g. ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" is a firm favourite of mine. I also had high expectations however, as a lot of people were raving about it like it was the greatest achievement of film ever! So I went in with an open mind and found myself being very fond of it. Drive is a film which I shall definitely give a second run around the block again.Drive opens fantastically! It perfectly captures the dangers of being a get-away driver. It's a thrilling chase scene with Ryan Gosling trying to evade the police and is beautifully shot. It tries to rely more on realism than go for the cheap quick-cut and shaky-cam thrills which the Fast and the Furious franchise aims to deliver. Drive takes a slower pace and has much more of an interest in character than action, which is a good thing to me. The slow direction perfectly conveys the loneliness of Ryan Gosling, but also shows that he's in control. He's a severely calm and methodical person, who you wouldn't really like to get on the wrong side with.The main show in Drive is the near-perfect directing, cinematography and lighting. Drive is a master-class in these elements as it's obvious that every shot was set up with great care and precision. There's not one piece of lighting out of place and the cinematography is quite astounding at times. It's incredibly easy on the eyes and carries a very cool charm with it. I loved the realism of the film and the shocking violence was used with reason, and almost reminiscent of a Haneke film, with short and shocking bursts of extreme violence. However, like Goodfellas, it is used to show the nasty and unglamourous side of the mob industry.I also really liked the love story told. There's some chemistry between Ryan and Carey, and although they don't really say a lot to each other, the connection between them is definitely there. Things between to hot up when Carey's husband is released from jail and things take quite an unpredictable turn for the worst. The final half hour or so may be slow, but it is still undeniably thrilling and realistic. There a some beautifully shot sequences that will stay with me for a long time. The finale is also very gripping, and you care about the characters involved.Overall, there's something about Drive that makes it unique and different to other films. It has certainly got under my skin and is an experience I shall look forward to again. The soundtrack perfectly engulfs the retro feel of the film and the directing is almost as stylish as Tarantino. Lovers of dialogue may be disappointed but there is certainly more dialogue than what some people say. I was expecting a film like ""Hunger"" where nothing's said for what feels like an hour, until a non-stop 15 minute talk-fest! Drive is nothing like that. It just takes a somewhat different and unconventional approach from the average Hollywood production. Drive's a film of quality and one I won't be forgetting in a hurry!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Man I really want that scorpion jacket now. This Movie is my absolutely favourite of all time! ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,The movie of Drive is filled with lavish imagery and a sophisticated color profile. The Los Angeles cityscape provides a very accessible setting for the ethical and non-ethical jobs the protagonist stunt driver finds himself in. This movies high points are backed by a pleasing sound track filled with lush synthesizers and eerie vocals. The plot towards the back half of the film seems rushed however the lack of closure could be intentional. Overall a very enjoyable watch and pleasant 95 minutes.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

But it didn't work for me. Too many dramatic pauses and poses, stony silences and meaningful looks shot in the half dark for it's own good. An annoying intrsuive soundtrack.

Destined to become a cult-classic,"Based on the novel by John Sallis, Ryan Goslings plays a stuntman by day and a getaway driver by night in Director Nicholas Winding Refn's artsy neo-noir thriller. Oozing style, complex characters, visceral action and an amazing soundtrack, 'Drive' is not your average action fare at the movies.Rather it's a menacing, slow burn which relishes in its love story between Gosling and Carey Mulligan whose chemistry simmers on screen - but it's the films ability to explode into sudden and shocking violence when the stakes are raised that elevates this thriller into a different beast entirely.With a great supporting cast of Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks, 'Drive' is an underrated gem and a modern-day masterpiece destined to become a cult-classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The film is like Marmite ( Vegimite ) you either love it or hate it.,"I can see both arguments when it comes to this film. It's not fair to compare it to Transporter or Leon as it has a feeling all of its own and that is what seems to drive it, (pardon the pun). Its very retro and yet it doesn't feel dated. The action scenes are well put together and the acting is just right. The only thing I found to be slightly annoying was the long silences in dialogue and the knowing looks and smiles between the main characters that made those scenes very edgy. I assume that was deliberate.All in all you need to see the film without any preconceived ideas.

Another error that we ALL picked out is that the newer model Impala that he drives in one of the ""chase"" sequences is making sounds of being manually shifted and we all know that those cars are only available as an automatic.

Not for Everyone: A total appreciation of what a human being is.,"First off, I agree with all the people who reviewed the many aspects of this movie in a positive light: its narration-story-telling, cinematography, soundtrack and the way it is used in conjunction with its pink retro presentation (the beautiful 80s), the settings and character development (yes there is a character development, just not in the spell-it-out-for-you kind of way). I not only liked the movie a lot, I loved it.My review will include an attempt to explain why there is no middle ground in ratings and there are either haters or lovers.1. You need to connect to the character of this movie. 2. You need to recognize the body language of troubled, lost people and appreciate the different kinds of bonds that develop in a story led by such people. 3. You need to either have or have been led to ""where it's dark and have no fear."" and been changed by this exploration forever. You need to be willing to understand what dark is and why it is there at all.So what makes a person love it because it is such a cool ""art-house action flick"" in comparison to what makes another hate it because it is so ""low-paced"", ""dull"", ""pretentious"", etc... It all depends on which side of the fence you are on and hence your ability to connect. If you don't even know and can't appreciate the fact that you have a dark side, how exactly will you be able to do that, connect, I mean? Is being an ""Odyssey"" -I kindly ask you to look up its meaning if you don't know what the word means-, whose slice of life we witness to, not dark enough in itself or is Anakin Skywalker as Darth Vader the epitome of polished, shiny darkness spoon-feeding you on who is bad and who isn't? Do we only connect to those who we wish to become or who leave us in awe because we don't have what they have? Like power?See, that is the thing. This whole question of ""who is bad?"" is a giant illusion obscuring the more real and dreadful question of ""what is bad and when?"" For when we attempt to answer this question in all honesty, we find ourselves trapped in the confinement of our own illusion which is a permanent part of the self-images we started building early on from infancy up until now: we are good, others are bad. In actuality, it is the actions that are good or bad and none of us can be absolved of the awaiting feelings of shame and guilt following the self-image shattering discovery of ""having belonged to/having been of the mundane"". No special treatment? No VIP seat for ourselves in our own skin? Come on, give us a break. Or not.This is the story of a nobody among all nobodies, a nobody whose idiopathic detachment from world becomes the source of his disenchantment with it. We don't need to know why it happened. We are presented the information that it just happened. Character development isn't all about prior knowledge. It's also about the ""now"", as a result of all that once was ""now"".The director makes us stalk the character, peep into his life for a brief time. He doesn't talk with his mouth all that much yes, he rather does it with his eyes and body (Gosling totally nailed it). We are not told why he puts himself through these ordeals that in fact other people need to overcome: So then, we are asked to understand or interpret it ourselves.Some people treated this movie like sht just because they couldn't understand why a man would leave some million bucks in the trunk of a car and maybe bleed to his oblivion. This is as idiotic as assuming those things we don't understand couldn't have happened only because WE are the ones who couldn't understand.Who are we when we have no one? Who witnessed our existence, that we ever happened? What lengths could we go to to know we did happen, to say ""I was here""? What lengths can we go to if we are to lose a new-found feeling of belonging?Sometimes desperation is home to all the desperate and when all else fails, this is what pulls us out of void: It gives us a mirror to see our reflection on and acknowledge that we are there. It does this by a connection to a fellow human being via the recognition of something being shared. By enabling us to give it a name and then maybe, give ourselves a name.So, what happens when you look in a mirror and cannot see a thing?Our primal fears have only to do with existence and nothing else.This is a movie that asks you to keep reflecting on what a human being is and what pushes him over the edge. You just can't sit back and consume this. You have to be willing to wander in the grey areas.So, maybe, just maybe, if you are a little lost yourself, you can then understand what this is all about. It is anything but pretentious. Sometimes being lost itself is our sole motivation because the need to resolve that or reconcile with that, at least, can drive us to do mad stuff with good intentions. This is where it gets dark. Even if you are a selfless person who has also already lost touch with yourself, you can still do things with a good deed whereby what you did helps some people as it inevitably wreaks havoc on others. I don't know if there is any intention-free type of reasoning other than that we find in science but when it comes to human beings, lines are sure all blurred and it would in fact be stupid to anticipate otherwise.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cool - Neon - Noir,"I once read a critic define this movie as ""the coolest of the decade"". At first it seemed like a crude statement, but after watching the movie and witnessing its first scene and opening credits, I fully understood the term and couldn't agree more.
Nicolas Winding Refn's film is tinged with pure style. Pop-eighties style, with lights and neon letters; narrative style, with a fluency of envy; visual style, with planes measured in seconds and millimeters, forming symmetry with the streets, forming proximity with its characters or simple, generating silent frames that hide more emotion than their words.
The film draws from cinema noir in an obvious way, but a modern stylization that gives it an inimitable atmosphere. However, it also influences silent movies and the film itself could be silent. The words lose their relevance and give the baton to the images, turning this film into cinema in its purest state, where images speak and transmit emotions.
In this sense, 'Drive' would not only be ""the coolest movie of the decade"", since its scope goes much further and has become an instant modern classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Amazing movie, but not for everyone","I watched this movie because of a recommendation of a friend, and because I enjoyed Nicolas Winding Refn's Valhalla Rising (which is another movie not for everyone). I really, really enjoyed Drive. The trailer gives you the wrong impression of what you're getting into, but that isn't the movie's fault, it's the marketing team's. After watching it I read a fair amount of the reviews here on IMDb, and on a lot of movies I would just chalk up the negative reviews to personal preference; different strokes for different folks and all. I would say the same about this movie, but don't let the content of the negative reviews here dissuade you. I have never written a review for this site, but I have also never had such strong feelings for the reviews either. Many of the negative reviews criticize the acting, specifically Gosling's, and the plot. Those reviews are correct in the Gosling doesn't say much. Neither did Eastwood in the Man With No Name trilogy. There is much more to acting than dialog, which this movie understands, and excels in. As for the plot, all complaints I've read on this site are dead wrong. There is a key point in the plot that many feel is not explained and that is frequently mentioned in this regard, which I won't spoil, but it most certainly is explained. How people could miss it is beyond me in fact.I absolutely loved this movie, and I will recommend it to anyone who asks. That said though, not everyone is going to like it. It's not an over-the-top action flick, doesn't have flashy special effects or corny action dialog. It has complex human emotion, told not necessarily through word, but through action and expression, facial and bodily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
a remake that pretends it isn't a remake,"Drive was somewhat slow and pretentious but had nice moments, as well, and the gory scenes of violence are not the ones i mean.It was a surprise, though, that the first 15 minutes were almost copy-pasted from the Driver (1978). So, my issue with Drive is that i wondered which movies i haven't seen or remembered that are potentially a part of it.I guess such an approach is good when you want to avoid producing a remake. You simply take the best parts (or the ones you like the best) from favorite movies of your childhood, put them together and claim you're re-imagining all those stories.

"Starts slow, really gets going","Watching this film, about half an hour in I thought I was watching a romantic. No real action of note and the plot was heavily centred around this ""relationship"".

A lot of unexpected gore and well shot action scenes and car chases in abundance.Beyond that, the crime side of the plot is fairly average nothing confusing, which is good. The personality of Ryan Gosling is what will really turn people off/on. For me, I personally enjoyed it. His long silences and introvert personality I really related to and fitted the character and plot well. Maybe a few flaws within this. For someone that doesn't often speak, he manages to bag dates with this woman (I need to learn how he pulls that off). But, that's really me nit picking.Overall though I really enjoyed this film.

Absorbing and surprisingly violent,"It's an interesting idea to create a movie in which the main character, who all the action centres around, has no name and says very little throughout. Strangely though, it doesn't seem to matter, because 'Drive' manages to be absorbing and highly entertaining anyway. The film is slow moving but the air of mystery around the main character is enough to keep the viewer compelled.'Drive' doesn't mess about when it comes to violence. There's plenty of it, and then some. Bloody violence in an 18 rated film isn't that surprising, but I didn't expect just how graphic some of it was. In a way it was refreshing to see in a crime themed movie. I also feel obliged to comment on the music in this film because I thought it contributed immensely to the atmosphere and mood.'Drive' is a different type of movie that takes risks, but they definitely work.

Great soundtrack ~ Script? To Be or Not To Be?,"Studied many reviews & comments.Understand why some moviegoers view this shocker as one of the great movies of this era even though the skeletons of so many greater directors are quite visible as has been oft quoted in reviews (Scorsese, Cronenberg, MMann, John Woo, QT et al. & even more obscure (to action aficionados) European masters like Antonioni & Bresson. Director Refn's parents are both (as my comrade at Paramount used to jokingly say) ""highly paid motion picture professionals"" & this guy went to &/or was kicked out of various film schools so Refn has hadbaccess to & studied all the masters.I mean dang .... he's even from Denmark! <<< (sorry - bad Shakespeare joke)Mr. Refn also claims much vague balderdash as acute lifelong dyslexia so severe he can barely comprehend written words & swears he receives many inspired ideas from his daily deep conversations w extraterrestrial BFF's from various planets so there's that to consider regarding his unique style (as yet to be confirmed by his PR team LOL)Understand why other viewers find his work tedious.

There's no point. This movie is very much like a dream. Something you can't explain very well and very vague and incoherent. The acting is good, but at same time non-existing.

You could skip the first hour.,"When I heard about Drive, and saw the raving reviews about it, I went in expecting something amazing...a really solid, character-driven action/thriller, something like Leon. What I got was a tedious disappointment.When you watch the opening scene, things look good. It's not an explosive action scene by any means, but it's tense and edgy, and already I was gripping the edge of my seat. My expectations were still high. And after that...the entire movie slows down to the most glacial of drips.Now I understand that a good movie needs to take its time. Character relationships need to build, plot points need to develop and so on. However, it just feels like the director's idea of taking time was to just squeeze a five-to-ten-second pause in front of every one of Ryan Gosling's lines. Curiously enough, Carey Mulligan was directed to deliver her lines in the exact same way, so all of the scenes in which they are talking together are just flat-out painful to get through. I know silence has its merits in conveying emotions and building tension, but there's just nothing to convey in these VERY long gaps! Both actors just have hollow, blank looks on their faces, and about eighty percent of the time they're just strangers making small talk, so there's no drama to soak up either. It's some of the most tedious dialogue I have ever sat through.Oscar Isaac is the third actor to use this technique, but he's the only one that gives it a purpose. Especially when he's addressing Gosling in the hallway, there's just an unpredictable, dangerous air about him, like you just expect him to break out shouting. He was a damn scary character in his own subtle way, and I praise his performance.The one advantage of the ever-so-quiet first hour of this film is that when action DOES occur, it hits you like a punch in the gut. It doesn't feel like so much of an everyday occurrence, which makes it all the more pulse-pounding. Also, seeing the stoic Driver unleashing his darker side is pretty terrifying, especially since he appears so quiet and distant for the rest of the film. Is it worth all those long, wooden pauses? No. His quietness could have still been conveyed without wasting so much screen time.The final scenes of the film are definitely worth watching, and there is some superb direction (the scene on the beach was one of the best directed scenes I've ever seen) and some downright chilling moments. I won't spoil anything, but the ending really knows how to play with your expectations, and it was beautifully done.Visually, it's also pretty stunning. The deep, crisp shadows really makes the film feel like a graphic novel at times, and almost any shot in this film could be made into a painting. I have to give it credit for that, it looked beautiful.I won't go into the plot, so as not to spoil anything, but I will say it's interesting, just not really explained with much depth. You almost feel like the story is just a side-plot to something, it never really feels like it's at the foreground until the third act. It also has one of the most hollow screen romances I have ever endured, no matter how much the music and direction tries to convince you otherwise.So, in conclusion...what was THERE was pretty interesting, but there just wasn't much of it. The movie wastes an ungodly amount of time with long pauses that convey nothing, and the entire movie could probably be condensed into a little less than an hour and still not appear rushed. I'm not saying it should have been a noisy, explosive action blockbuster, but I was hoping for more than blank-faced silences at least.Hence, I'm sorry to give it a five out of ten.

Exquisite Noir Cinema...,"For those who gave this movie a low rating... you CLEARLY missed it. Shaw & Hobbs is probably going to be more your speed.Drive is an EXCEPTIONAL noir piece. Ryan Gosling is PERFECT as 'the driver'... the same way he is in Only God Forgives & Bladerunner 2049. He CARRIES those movies... the same way he does THIS one. He never over acts... & does cold-blooded grit with a superb nuance. I can see how many actors would pass on such a violent movie role, but I'm glad we have an actor who steps up to the plate & DELIVERS, time & time again in such roles.Easily one of THE best wheel man movies, ever made.

"The Movie I Always Wanted to See, and Nobody Had Made Before","Drive is the movie I always wanted to see and nobody had ever directed before. It is the story of an unnamed, lonely stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver. The driver falls in love (or at least he seems to) with his neighbor, but an attempt to help her ex-con husband triggers a deadly chain of events.Drive is a great movie because its style is as important as its plot in telling the story. With only a few scattered lines and lots of silence, the extraordinarily gifted director Nicolas Winding Refn is in charge of telling most of the story through his cameras. And he does, and well! Refn's way of framing every scene is exceptionally powerful in conveying the character's emotions. The exchanges between Ryan Gosling and Corey Mulligan are loaded with unspoken emotions. The occasional bursts of violence are intense and explosive, hard and unforgiven, without the cathartic overtones of Tarantino's. The car chases are focused and intense, because they feel what a real car chase should feel like, concentrated on the goal of saving your own life, and not on the roller-coaster's thrill of driving fast.The entire movie's style is based on the tension between the dryness and brutality of the character's interactions on screen, and their emotional world as communicated by the visuals and the movie's score. In fact, Drive's music (sophisticated, nightly, electronic) is the off-screen main character. Its retro style gives the film a dreamy atmosphere, keeping it half-way between the gritty reality of the story and a wonderful and poetic heroism that makes up fairy tales and knight stories. The movie keeps these two distant worlds apart and strangely connected, which is what makes it movie so powerful in the first place.Some commentators compared this movie to ""Layer Cake"" or ""Lock, Stock"". They are seriously mistaken. The only thing in common with ""Layer Cake"" is that the main character remains unnamed. The only thing in common with ""Lock, Stock"" is that the director is European. ""Drive"" is not a crime story, at least not in a strict sense. Drive is distilled movie about an archetypal lonely hero. It is a movie about whether we really have choices in our life, or we are bound to follow our nature. And it is one of the few masterpieces I have seen in many years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I want that jacket...,"Drive follows a Getaway / Hollywood stunt driver, played by Ryan Gosling, as he gets entangled with a mother and son who are in trouble with the mob. He always wears the coolest scorpion bomber jacket you will ever see.This movie has been suggested to me many times over the past decade, and on my first viewing I was definitely blown away. I had to take my brain back to a time where Ryan Gosling might not have been the biggest name in Hollywood, but watching this movie, you can quickly see why he has come so far.Gosling has a very soft spoken performance which creates a sense of urgency and power for every word that does come out of his mouth.The supporting cast absolutely holds up, and also shows why most of them are the biggest names in Hollywood as well.Cary Mulligan is perfect.Oscar Issac has a love able darkness to him which is perfect for his role.For Bryan Cranston this pitiful character was probably a nice contrast to his Heisenberg which would have been massively popular at the time.The first act of this movie slowly burns into a much more action packed and violent second and third act. Don't give up on this movie early.The only thing that felt out of place here was the date montage between The Driver and the mother and son.

Slow for the sake of slowness,"I usually don't mind movies where the pacing is slower, but this is one of those cases where it feels like it's just slow for the sake of slowness. The whole movie felt dragged out because tbe characters often just stare at each other, but hardly convey any emotions. The lack of dialogue makes this movie an even harder viewing experience. It's a shame, because the action scenes are quite good and exciting, but there's barely any in the movie.For me it almost feels like that the creators tried to make an artsy action movie to prove some points and defy expectations (and as you can see from the reviews, many people liked it), but I just couldn't enjoy it and most likely won't watch it ever again. It's fine to watch once, but I can't put my finger on what makes people rewatch this movie multiple times.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"An excellent film, extremely well made, and  filled with great performances . It is a unique and great movie experience. A must see","Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is a movie the likes of which I have never seen before. It has a unique style that I had never seen before. One of the great things about drive is that it manages to work its magic in 100 minutes, which is by no means a long running time. The characters in drive are vivid and feel extremely real. Carey Mulligan is excellent as Irene, a young single mother who falls for Ryan Gosling's mysterious stunt/get away driver. Ron Perlman is entertaining as Nino, a loud-mouth and arrogant mob boss. Brooks is especially fantastic as the soft spoken but vicious Bernie Rose, who is pretty handy with a razor. Yet the most amazing thing about Drive is the performance of its leading man. Gosling is magnetic as ""the Driver"" a stunt driver who moonlights as a get away driver for criminals. The driver is a quiet character who doesn't talk much but this allows Gosling to display his exception ability as an actor. With so little talk, Gosling conveys the feelings of his mysterious character through facial expression and simple looks in his eyes. He is able to convey both a kindness and caring in some scenes yet in others he is a figure of intimidation and brutality.The overall non-verbal nature of the mysterious main character adds to the overall tension of the film. The film is excellently paced and extremely entertaining. The film's marketing suggests primarily action scenes but that is not the case as the film is a character study of sorts, but don't shy away from this film because it isn't strictly speaking an action movie. Refn's film is extremely tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is definitely worth watching. The sound track is also extremely good and fits the film nicely. In addition, the the satin jacket Gosling wears throughout is perhaps one of the coolest things i've ever seen.Drive is one of my favorite films and it has a unique style that makes it a fantastic film to watch. Tense and entertaining, Refn and Gosling mesmerize you from beginning to end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Decent,"The movie was decent, but it could have been a bit better. For example, the first 40 minutes was dull, which I guess was done deliberately due to the drivers personality, but It wasn't fun too watch. The plot gets very intriguing after that with some good action and twists. However, I was expecting something interesting happening in the end, but that wasn't the case for me.

I can't really say the acting was bad, because nothing was asked or expected of the actors, just clichés. I'm trying to think of one scene that someone could point to and say ""that's a truly original scene, I haven't seen that before..."" OK, done thinking, there is no such scene.

Terribly long scenes with little or no dialog, and Gosling as a wooden-faced angst-ridden autotron.Maybe worst of all, with a title of ""Drive"", the so-called car chases are short and predictable.Truly an awful movie.

One of the Most Stylish & Cool Films Ever,"If you are looking for a ""Fast and Furious"" then look somewhere else. Perhaps go watch Herbie Fully Loaded. Drive is way too smartly written and too well acted and simply way too stylish and cool to be compared and Fast/Furious. Let's just get it out in the open. Ryan Gosling is clearly one of the best actors if the best actor of his generation. His performance here as The Driver is so top notch. He's subtle and yet exudes such an energetic persona into The Driver that you cannot take your eyes off him. Carey Mulligan shines radiantly and is the emotional heart of the film. Though an understand and subtle role, Mulligan welcomes you in and you feel her pain and longing when it is all done. Albert Brooks is fiery and a force as the villain. Rounding out the cast Bryan Cranston and Christina Hendricks (fan of Breaking bad/Mad Men)are both solid in glorified cameo performances. In the lesser hands of a lesser director, Drive could have lost its way but in the hands of a true auteur like Refn, Drive soars brightly. Although Drive is not everyone's cup of tea considering the mass violence and the vintage art-house genre appeal, I strongly recommend it for all. Drive is a true gem and the end will break your heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Drive: A thinker's thriller,"Drive is a fabulous film. However, it seems it is drawing some negative reviews from the fact it is not 'fast and furious' type car movie. That is completely absurd. For starters, Drive has a substantial plot and excellent acting, the polar opposite for Fast and Furious movies. Comparing them is like comparing two different films from different genres. Drive is much more of slow paced, tension builder. From the blood- pumping beginning to the exhilarating finale, Drive will leave you breathless. Ryan Gosling plays Driver fantastically well, considering he is rather unaccustomed to this type of role. Carey Mulligan is impressive but Albert Brooks almost steals the show from Gosling. Most famous for voicing Nemo's dad in Finding Nemo, Brooks is transformed as brutal and savage gangster Bernie Rose. The Violence is a little excessive, but provides an emotional link between Gosling and Mulligan.

The acting from Ryan was superb and he was well supported by some quality actors. I could go on but I will just say that if you want a Fast and Furious 23 then don't watch.

Robot Zombie Ryan Gosling sleepwalks through snooze fest.,"WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : DRIVEONE-LINE REVIEW : Robot Zombie Ryan Gosling sleepwalks through snooze fest.RATING : Don't Waste Your Money (Rating Scale: ""See it in the theater,"" ""Wait for the instant download"", ""Don't waste your time."")A Hollywood stunt driver (Driver, Ryan Gosling) works as a mechanic by day and dabbles in getaway car action by night. He lives down the hall from very cute Irene (Carey Mulligan). She has an adorable son Benicio (Kaden Leos) who is befriended by Driver and Driver takes a keen interest in Irene as well. However, Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released from jail and is being forced to rob a pawn shop to repay protection money from when he was in the slammer.Meanwhile, back at the auto shop: Driver's boss is hapless shop owner Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who goes into business with local mob boss Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and partner mob boss Nino (Ron Perlman). They want to employ Driver to race cars and make legitimate money.Driver decides to help Standard and so becomes intwined in a twisted tale of bad guys and badder guys. And we're off...I am always nervous when the title credits for a movie are in fluorescent pink. I believe ""Cocktail"" with Tom Cruise set the standard for me. And the harbinger of bad flicks still works as this movie was the dullest movie I've sat through, ever.I saw Ryan Gosling for the first time in ""Crazy Stupid Love."" I guess he's some sort of heart-throb. I liked him in that movie as a sleazy lounge lizard who has a change of heart. However, the actor that performed that part was nowhere to be seen in ""Drive."" In fact, his performance was so bland anyone, even a cardboard cutout could have played the role. He literally never blinks an eye in this film. He never displays much more than the slighted bit of emotion.And for a movie about a stunt driver, and named ""Drive"" for that matter, there is a shocking lack of automobile action. The movie opens with a car chase of sorts that never gets over 35 MPH. I've seen more car action in children's movies than in this.I believe director Nicolas Winding Refn and writer Hossein Amini were shooting for something like ""Taxi Driver."" There, the lead was a complex character with delusions of grandeur. Driver is no such complex beast. He is as emotionless when driving as when kissing and killing.This is such a non-movie with no substantial roles for any player in it that I recommend you ""Don't waste your time.""",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The timing seemed very slow and awkward... DON""T WASTE YOUR $","My wife got tickets for free (she won a radio contest), and we saw this incredibly bad movie. I mean how do you screw up a movie that is about a mobster stealing from another mobster, with a stunt driver as your hero? I guess they found a way... To start with the soundtrack sounded like it was straight out of the 80's and with the PINK cursive cast and credits I was already preparing for the worst. I still was not ready for this stink fest.Ryan Goslin seems to play a simple minded character, who when asked a question seemed to take 15 to 20 seconds of staring without emotion and then gave a cheesy grin and answered, with one or two words. The movie was so quiet (lack of conversation) for first 45 minutes that I could hear everyone in the theatre eating their popcorn.Finally the heist happens and you think that the movie will start to pick up. Nope, after the heist back to snail pace again. Goslin's character has brief moments of intense violence which seem to be against his characters nature.I finally knew the movie was really bad when he is talking to the female lead, and she slaps him, (which should be a dramatic moment) everyone in the theatre laughs at him.My wife and I actually got up and walked out when one of the mobsters stabs another in the eye with a fork. NOT because I was offended, I love gratuitous violence but it was done with no realism, I mean who kills a guy in their own restaurant in broad daylight? I really hoped that this was going to be a Transporter clone, even a poorly done clone would have been better than this abomination.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
something very very special.....,"Where to start..? Having dragged my poor younger brother along to the local cinema to see 'Drive', we entred the theatre and it was practically empty, i counted 22 people with us included, and i began to worry that this might, just might, turn out to be a turkey of a movie despite the positive critics reviews i'd read... but then the film started and from the moment it began i was hooked. I literally can't wait until this films comes out on blu-ray so i can add it to my collection. Heck.. i might even just go again to the multiplex so i can convince myself that the mastery i'd just witnessed wasn't in my head and was, indeed, a movie that, in my opinion and my hope, will set the tone for other directors/story tellers for years to come.Like i said, there were 22 of us in the theatre at the start and with the passing of the 45th minute i noticed a few leave... and not return. More fool them. They missed, quite possibly, one of the finest films of recent years.The film is a slow burner, as stated in other reviewers remarks on this amazing film. But, with this 'slowness', the film draws you in.... the quiet glances, the long silences, drawn out and lingering looks leave you on the edge of your set waiting, with breath held, to see just what is going to happen next.No, this isn't an all action, driving, gun blasting flick.. its something much much more... and all the better for it. If that's what you are after, then im sorry but this isn't it... its smarter and, in occasional places, graphically and extremely violent, but in keeping with the whole movie. No gratuitous 'Saw' type violence here.Please go and see this film, especially if you live in the UK where this film should be getting far more attention than i fear it is... Its brilliant, simply brilliant.. if you just sit and let it draw in you rather than walking out because there's no Transformers or any Vin Diesels in there...One word to sum this movie up?

The Scorpion and the Frog,"There be times that you want to get behind the wheel, tune in to a cool radio station, and just drive.

Yet even the most professional can make mistakes too, he lowers his guard for a neighbor and they bond with each other as they go on.

Didn't meet expectations,"Drive's beautiful cinematography and terrific sound design allow the film to create a cinematic atmosphere which pays tribute to classic 80s culture. However, this is let down by the fact that this tone doesn't stay consistent. The scenes where Ryan Gosling is driving around or talking are fine, but when he gets into a fight, the tone becomes over the top and almost ironic. The film tries to be dark, serious, stylish and deep, but the level was of violence is ridiculous. Most of the kills Gosling makes are graphic, bloody, drawn out and like something you would see in Kill Bill. The way the story progresses is also bad as the characters relationships don't ever really develop and there is no message or contemporary issue addressed for the audience to make sense of. Some films can get away with having a weak plot and no real meaning because their so action packed that no one notices (such as Mad Max Fury Road). However this film has barely any action and focuses on being moody and dramatic, so the lack of plot is very noticeable. Overall, in my opinion the screenplay for this film is garbage, but the way it is shot, the sound and atmosphere save the film from being garbage too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

To all the negative reviewers...,"...i think it's safe to assume that you were expecting some high-budget, high-octane blockbuster/fluff. And maybe the previews are to blame for that - admittedly, they really didn't suggest otherwise. But within the first 5 minutes, with the music and overall feel of the movie it should have been pretty clear that it wasn't meant to compete with the likes of Fast&Furious. I just hope you didn't sit there holding your breath for it to become something different, storming home to your keyboards as the credits rolled so that you could pan it as a disappointing waste of money.For me, this movie was such a refreshing change from typical Hollywood cash-cow movies made by the likes of Jerry Bruckheimer. All balls, no brains...and definitely no merit. Its actually the first movie i've ever seen that i found myself thinking ""Wow, THAT was a movie that a guy could take his girlfriend to and he wouldn't even owe her a romantic comedy or a drama!"" Yep. Guys, its that good.I've never posted a review before, but reading the negative reviews (however few) prompted me to sign up and say this: If I could hug this movie, i would. Not because it was the feel-good movie of the year, but because it just may have been the best. Definitely the best i've seen in a long time.

Decent Film,"Well I was a bit unsure what to expect with this film, I saw the rating which was high and then I looked at the reviews. There was more hated it reviews than loved it although the hated it reviews seemed to be expecting an action film. The loved it reviews waxed lyrical at its art and talked about film noir feel.Well all I can say was it was a decent Film with good and bad points.The Soundtrack was brilliant and this did a lot of the storytelling, whatever was missing from the dialogue was covered brilliantly by the soundtrack. For this alone the film may get a second viewing.Cinematography was very good, I heard people mention film noir which I didn't really see and art house which again I never saw. For me it was just atmospheric and the shots merely gave you a close feeling to what was going on. You always felt close to what was happening rather than looking in from a distance.The action in the film was good and to the point rather than long drawn out action scenes that I find boring, there are only so many crashes and explosions I can take and to be honest I've seen it all before. If I haven't seen it before then its usually something that is beyond belief and then I lose interest.The acting is decent, the dialogue is rare at times and the film-makers rely heavily on expression and the 80% of how we communicate without speaking, something that film-makers forget about at times.The story is basic so there is nothing new there at all and sometimes you struggle to believe it fully. So there is that added situation where you start questioning things and saying to yourself "" that wouldn't happen "" e.t.c There is at times a lack of momentum although in some reviews I read it seems people have no patience at all, the lack of momentum is replaced by atmosphere and feeling which is a refreshing change for most of it but at times can feel a little contrived.If I'm being honest I preferred the film Bronson from the same director but this was in my opinion better than Valhalla Rising or Pusher. This guy certainly has an eye and ear for the audio and visual experience but I wonder if it only works with a certain type of viewer.Overall I gave it a 7 out of 10, The IMDb rating seems slightly high and then there is a lot of reviewers who gave it a 1 which is madness.If your expecting a high adrenalin action popcorn flick with nitro boosters and lots of crashes in all the gory detail then you won't find it here. If you want to watch a decent film about a stunt driver/getaway driver who has affection for his female neighbour and who gets himself a bit too deep then this will suit you fine. There is a little bit of action a little bit of violence, a little bit of romance, and lashings of coolness but very little emotion.If you do find the first 30 or 40 mins slow then bear with it just don't expect the Nitro's or explosions !!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Overview,"Drive, a 2011 neo-noir crime thriller directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, is a visually striking and atmospheric film that delves into the complexities of love, loss, and the allure of the criminal underworld.

His life takes a dramatic turn when he meets his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her young son, Benicio. Drawn into their lives, The Driver finds himself entangled in a dangerous heist gone wrong, leading to a series of violent consequences.One of the film's most striking aspects is its visual style. Director Nicolas Winding Refn employs a stark, neon-drenched aesthetic that evokes a sense of both beauty and danger. The film's cinematography is masterful, capturing the gritty underbelly of Los Angeles with a haunting sense of realism. The use of light and shadow creates a palpable atmosphere of tension and suspense, immersing the viewer in the film's world.The film's minimalist dialogue is another key element that contributes to its unique atmosphere. The characters often communicate through their actions and expressions, allowing the viewer to fill in the gaps and create their own interpretations. This restraint adds a layer of mystery and intrigue to the narrative, making the film all the more captivating.The soundtrack of Drive is equally impressive, featuring a blend of electronic and synthwave music that perfectly complements the film's visual style. The music creates a sense of both nostalgia and unease, adding to the film's overall atmosphere. The iconic song ""Nightcall"" by Kavinsky, which plays during a pivotal scene, has become synonymous with the film itself, further solidifying its place in popular culture.The film's violence is both graphic and stylized, serving as a stark contrast to the film's otherwise subdued tone. The violence is not gratuitous, but rather serves to highlight the film's themes of morality and the consequences of one's actions. The brutal nature of the violence adds a layer of realism to the film, making it all the more impactful.The performances in Drive are uniformly excellent. Ryan Gosling delivers a nuanced and understated performance as The Driver, conveying a sense of quiet intensity and simmering rage beneath the surface. Carey Mulligan is equally compelling as Irene, portraying a woman struggling to protect her son while grappling with her own grief and longing. Albert Brooks delivers a chilling performance as Bernie Rose, a ruthless crime boss who sets the film's events in motion.Drive is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. Its unique blend of visual style, atmospheric music, and powerful performances create a cinematic experience that is both unforgettable and thought-provoking. While the film may not be for everyone, its undeniable artistry and emotional depth make it a must-see for fans of neo-noir and independent cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Holy crap did I watch the same thing as everyone else????!!!,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in years. The previews on TV were more exciting then the actual film. This movie is not what you think it is or what they led you to believe it was about. It was an hour and 40 minutes of boring(I can't stress this word enough), monotone, drabble that barely had a plot and made Ryan Gosling look like an idiot. I seriously thought he was ""special"" throughout the entire movie. It really is sad if we are headed down the road where this is considered a big crime thriller. $15,000,000 Budget..Is that a joke?This is my 1st review because I had to write something about this mess.Save your time and money.

Excellent,"I absolutely despised Refn's previous film, Valhalla Rising, which was a ridiculous stylistic exercise that exhibited a great eye for photography but nothing else. Well, Drive is also mostly a stylistic exercise with great photography, but this one's a keeper. Ryan Gosling stars as a stunt driver/mechanic/aspiring racecar driver who moonlights as an uber-professional getaway driver for criminals. After getting emotionally involved with his neighbor (the drop-dead gorgeous Carey Mulligan) and her son, Gosling agrees to help her ex-con husband (Oscar Isaac) pull off a heist. It goes wrong, and Gosling becomes a mob target. So, yeah, the story's nothing new or special. And the performances are nothing to write home about, either. It's all in the direction, the cinematography, the sound and the editing. And, man, it's just a beautifully made film. It feels kind of out of place in 2011, more resembling a 1970s auteurist project. It's pure cinema, not unlike the other great English language film of 2011 (so far), The Tree of Life. Not quite as profound as that one, but, still, quite great. Also starring Albert Brooks, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Best Art-house movie ever made, with shi#t blowing up!","Nicolas Winding Refn, the Danish director of ""Art -House"" genre, who already had explored various themes in his films with a beautiful-looking: the Danish mafia in the ""Pusher"" trilogy; a violent prisoner in ""Bronson""; a mute-dumb badass Viking without an eye in ""Valhalla Rising""; all with a beautiful direction and full of metaphors on the subject on study, and FULL of violence. But his greatest critical success and ultimately the public's attention would be with this masterpiece!""Drive"" tells the story of Ryan Gosling's character, a mysterious man with several jobs: one as a part-job being a movie-stuntman making stunts with cars; the rest of the day as a mechanic; at night he enters in the world of crime as a getaway driver. Everything seems to change in his life when thanks to his boss of the workshop, Shannon (Bryan Cranston), the driver begins to approach his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), who has a long nurtured passion. Days pass and the driver gets closer and closer of Irene and her son creating a great relationship. But everything changes when Irene's husband returns from prison bringing with it immense dangers to the only family that the Driver ever had.I know, the synopsis sounds like another cliché action movie with a badass character, but that's where the genius of the film begins. Nicolas Winding Refn is known for putting in his films varied metaphors in the topic to be explored. And what is the topic of the movie? Well, it is simply the action genre (a theme exploring another theme, intriguing right?). Perhaps this is the reason for the poor reception that the film had with the young crowd, the trailers and synopsis sounded like a good action movie just for good popcorn, and ended up going much deeper than that, but all the clichés are here.Gosling's character is the typical movie's action hero: don't talk much and when he speaks are phrases that make you crack a smile on your face and think (wow, what a badass); know how to handle weapons well and never gets hurt after a fight; drive cars as a master engaging in awesome car- chases; and of course, has a soft heart. Nicolas along with screenwriter Hossein Amini try to explore the human side of this type of hero, they are human with its good and pure side, but at the same time dark and violent side. Giving the film a lot of metaphors.Nicolas is known for its intense moments of silent in his films that many consider boring, but serve as reflective moments. Here, these moments are not only reflective but show the reality of the film (come on, ask yourself, how many times have you been in a room with someone you doesn't know without saying word embarrassed? Neither the badass hero escapes this.). And this is possibly the film of Nicolas with more people talking, even the driver (no main character of the films Nicolas almost never said a word), giving the film an excellent, realistic and even humorous narrative to its characters.In technical aspects, the film is almost perfect. As always, Nicolas deliver's a beautiful direction and the right use of lighting and slow motion at the silent and dialog moments, and also the superb action scenes. And the movie contains a varied and beautiful soundtrack; all songs have the same theme, what is to be a hero, also serving as a metaphor.In performances, all exceptional: Ryan Gosling predictably has an extraordinary performance, even not speaking much he shines as the troubled-badass hero in the quest to be a good person; Bryan Cranston, if you ever watched ""Breaking Bad"" knows how great it is here. He also another cliché in the movie, at the same time he is the old mentor he is the comic-relief; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman as the villains Bernie and Nino, both superb but also serve as a metaphor for the story, even the bad guys are human villains with their own problems.Surely, the masterpiece of Nicolas, a magnificent direction, with a great narrative, splendid performances. All together and put into a theme that seemed inexorable, that ended up being an excellent aesthetic and human study of the action genre in perhaps the best art -house movie ever made, with amazing sh#t blowing up.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The movie made me fall in love with Ryan Gosling,"I came across Drive purely by chance when I'm looking for some ultra violent movie and the title Drive pop up a few time but what I got after Drive is much more than what I'm asking forDirected by Nicolas Winding Refn Drive is a stylish crime drama featuring what I believe some of the coolest main character in modern cinema.The Driver played by Ryan Gosling is an action hero that on par with the like of Steve McQueen,Sean Connery or Charles Bronson when he the type of guy who talk very little but get the job done on time.Looking at The Driver the first impression is he a very handsome guy that can't do no wrong but you will not want to get on his bad side cause deep down inside him is a force of nature that waiting to be let loose.The whole movie got this warm and cuddly feeling with The Driver and his new found love interest in the first half but when the stuff hit the fan it make a great""GOD DAMN"" moment.The movie may get a bit slow after the opening getaway scene but again Drive is not an action movie it a journey of a shady guy who want to be the hero of his own story",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Tense action movie, with a compelling plot and well developed characters.","Winding Refn is one of my favorite directors. I liked the photography and the lighting of his movies, the plots are always compelling and engaging. ""Drive"" is no exception and for sure is way different than the average Hollywood action movie. The film takes its time to develop the characters, therefore I cared about them. The action is amazing, with well directed car chases and many graphic sequences. The first few minutes kept me glued to the screen. This is for me one of the best movies of its genre in recent years, and after exactly 10 years since its release, I still consider this as a must-watch. Ryan Gosling gave a lot of personality to the character, despite having a few dialogue lines, his looks and his postures were saying more than a thousand words. This is something that only a very talented person can achieve. I really enjoyed Brian Cranston, despite having a small part, he was able to add a lot to the story.The soundtrack is absolutely stunning. I am a huge fan of the Retro Wave music that is heavily influenced by the 80's and the 90's culture. I loved the music by Electric Youth and Kavinsky. At times it is a slow paced movie, and there are a few scenes that for some might last a little too long, but I have personally enjoyed this approach in this case. This was the movie that bringed Refn to fame, and this is the production that pushed me to watch his cinematography such as ""The Pusher"" trilogy. I am not ashamed to call ""Drive"" a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Origin story of a super hero,"The first scene of the movie and the deceptive trailer will liklely lead you to believe that Drive is just another faceless action movie that is virtually the dame as any other faceless action movies such as fast and the furious and other such lovely titles which names i cannot remember for the life of me, because they are oh so original and unique. But if you know the director of this movie at least one bit, you will know that this isn't your average crowd pleasing blockbuster, but a more thoughtful and meaningful film about the human condition and how to rise above it, and become superhuman. This in fact is the best Punisher film that isn't named Punisher, and best superhero movie in a long time, if you would like to define it as such, because this movie doesn't really have a genre. It is an action movie, a thriller, a pyschological movie, a horror movie and so on and so on. It simply evades classification and is it's own thing entirely, so it is just mine opinion that it is a sort of a superhero movie, but it isn't really that original. The movie feels a lot like Taxi Driver, or Thief, and it certainly feels it's influences on it's sleeve, which isn't necesseraly a bad thing, but it's still worth pointing out. The Atmosphere that Refn crafts is dense and full of emotion, every scene, like a vacum, sucks you into the universe, and you become a part of the world, eventually all characters start to feel like real people and especially the driver. You can exacly understand whats going on in his head even when he is silent,abd he is silent most of the time. Ryan Gosling gave such a wondwrful performance in this film and the character is so damn likeable that you can't help being invested the story. He is a guy who seemingly doesn't have any family or friends, whose silence is louder than words and whose evolution from a robot to a human bean and eventually to a hero is really exhilirating to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brutality with some good performance,A one time watch movie. Its a predictable but a good time pass movie,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best wheelman movie in the genre.,"DRIVE is a white-knuckle, unbuckled thrill ride from the very first frame to the last. Automobile aficionados will savor DRIVE's cinematography, atmosphere and the way Refn's visual style accentuates the inherent strength/beauty of each car Gosling whips throughout the film.DRIVE may have a dozen cameos and a star-studded cast, but it's Gosling who absolutely steals the show with his Gary Cooper stoicness and sparse dialogue. Refn's script is light on lines but heavy on action. It's amazing to see the way Gosling brings his nameless characters' personhood to the forefront of the screen--his most effective scenes in the movie are the sequences where Gosling says nothing while driving/fighting. The energy one sees emanating from Gosling's Driver is palpable and it permeates the entire film. Despite the constant threat and ominous tone enveloping Driver and his love-interest Irene, Gosling emits a cool-as-ice persona that really gives the movie's best moments an extra dimension. Interestingly, I don't think anyone could have portrayed Driver half as well as Gosling did, and it is easily Gosling's singular performance in this titular role that makes Drive an absolute must-watch.My favorite part of the entire film is the very beginning: Driver(Gosling) on a job trying to deliver his clients to safety. The entire sequence must be 10-15 minutes long and it's shot in such a claustrophobic way that the viewer actually feels like they're in the car alongside Driver, if not feeling like Driver themselves. The authenticity of the stunt driving and the way Gosling reacts to everything he sees on the road creates one of Hollywood's all-time best chase/driving sequences on film.I actually watched DRIVE first last night and then watched BABY DRIVER for the first time ever today. In almost every conceivable way, BABY DRIVER was a carbon copy and near identical clone to DRIVE, and not even half as good (despite BABY's massive success). DRIVE's OST of hypnotic Horrorwave/80s Synth sets the perfect tone for what transpires throughout the movie, where as BABY feels nothing short of strained and suffocated due to the overload of music in the background of the film -- most which have no real fit in the modern car scene. When I see a stuntman burning rubber in an 04 ZHP Sport with alcantera interior, the last kind of soundtrack I'm envisioning is Motown. Motown may suit the car scenes of the 50s-60s, but it sure as hell feels out of place in BABY and this alone is reason enough to kill that movie's atmosphere in every way possible. It's also a huge reason why DRIVE is a much better film.I know what you're thinking: a movie about a guy driving sounds pretty boring. But DRIVE is anything but boring. It's a high octane, pulse pounding injection shot of NOS straight to the brain. 10/10 A+; DRIVE lives up to the hype and then some. I imagine I'll watch this movie at least a few dozen more times before I kick the bucket.PS. Don't expect Gosling to eat his cereal here either",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"It is simply too simple, too generic and too boring to make any type of effect on me","Just finished watching Drive, and I basked it in all of its exceptional competence and amazing adequacy. It is simply too simple, too generic and too boring to make any type of effect on me.Ryan Gosling plays a getaway driver who is nearly as robotic as the soundtrack is. His impressive range of acting talent is confined to staring deeply at his neighbour, Irene, or staring deeply at his boss, or staring deeply at the camera, or... well you get the picture. He is a man of few words, and the ones he do say sound like they're written from a ""Write Your Own Movie"" kit- scant and merely functional enough to keep the ""plot"" moving. His character has little to no motivation for anything done in the film, except that he ""loves"" Irene. This point is conveyed through quick shots of them driving together, them having small talk, or, if they're going to be really romantic, staring deeply at each other. When the action begins (and believe me, it takes a long damn time to begin), she is shoved out of the way like the nameless plot device her character is.The plot is about as flimsy as you get, and runs around the film like a 5-year-old with amnesia. Plot lines that seem like the movie's main point get picked up and dropped just as fast (Is his career in stunt driving progressing? No... Is he going to do more odd driver jobs? No... Is he going to be a race car driver?) and when it finally decides to settle on a theme, it kicks characters out just as quickly. Christina Hendricks? Bah- toast her. The boy? He was in this movie? And when it finally ends- well, you let me know. Because the ending that it left us with felt like the writer went for a bathroom break and the director rushed in and grabbed it. Pathetic.With an over 1 1/2 hour run time, Drive ends up being a generic mobster action movie that takes an extraordinarily long time to get anywhere. It overindulges in its night-time visuals and stylistic ""hero"" that it forgets it should be actually telling a story. I can see many people being deluded that it is an artsy deep movie because the main character is nameless and near silent, but it only uses these conventions to cover up the lack of originality the movie has. It simply tries to be a Pulp Fiction without the grit- without the heart.Things I did enjoy was the music, I think Kavinsky was used excellently in the opening, and the visuals. I appreciated the neon lights of the night, and the shots of Gosling driving around at night with the soundtrack bumping in the background definitely set an electric mood.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Boring Drive fails to maintain decent speed.,"This sluggish piece of neo noir featuring a protagonist (Ryan Gosling) in a constant state of comatose cool who assists in LA heists will have you wanting to get out after a couple of miles as it cruises into the slow lane of mawkish pretentiousness after the first twenty minutes. Other than a couple of taut car chases this lemon has to depend on some vivid gratuitous violence to keep the audience awake as it careens out of control.Gosling is Driver (what else?) who beyond giving instructions is a mostly mute dour fellow who looks in need of a good sleep. He don't carry artillery he just drives. Don't get him mad though.The story is needlessly convoluted with Driver becoming involved with the girl and her kid next door whose paroled husband is forced into pulling off a job involving mob money of the same shadowy characters that bankroll a race car (did I tell you he has sure thing Nascar driver promise? ) as well as his loyal buddy who employs him who wouldn't you know it is also involved in the heist that's really a scam to cheat the East Coast mob.Director Nicholas Winding Redfn opens Drive with a sharply edited tense nighttime LA heist raising the tempo to a high pitch almost immediately. But by the time the opening credits finish Redfn begins to stumble with awkward clumsily paced scenes filled with pregnant pauses and pallid posing in the dark by all concerned. Redfn moves his camera without purpose and when he does frame a composition well he lets it linger to a point of tedium. Making matters even more heavy handed are a soundtrack and music score (Cliff Martinez gets the blame) barging its way through nearly every scene of insipid gravity reinforcing ad nausea its tough guy stance to a point of unintentional parody.Performances are uniformly zombie led by Gosling, a clueless Carey Mulligan as the drab, conflicted love interest and Albert Brooks with his usual flat lifeless affect as a surly hood looking heavily medicated. Bryan Cranston as Driver's boss delivers somewhat but the script will only let him expand on his role to a limited degree lacking the depth to make him or anyone else for that matter absorbing or even mildly interesting. Drive is one long meandering ride of strained seriousness. Better you should walk.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A visually stylish and striking neo-noir with an unmistakeable 80's vibe,"The Driver is a mysterious young man who works multiple jobs as a mechanic in a garage and a Hollywood stuntman. While also moonlighting as a getaway driver who finds himself falling for his neighbor. A single mother Irene, whose husband is currently serving time in prison. While he begins spending time with Irene, and her young son, his boss, Shannon is trying to arrange a race team using money from the mob. In doing so he manages to implicate his young employee in the scheme. The Driver's problems are further exacerbated after Irene's husband is released from prison, and he agrees to assist him in carrying out a robbery. Leading to unforeseen deadly ramifications.Described as an arthouse, action/drama although, the word action movie in describing certain movies is bandied around a little too loosely. It was the third English language movie by Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, who had previously helmed the surreal, more artsy historical Valhalla Rising and the unconventional British crime biopic Bronson. Essentially an independent filmmaker, it's safe to say that Refn is not a man to bow to convention, with his work, not one that would appeal to the mainstream market. That being said, Drive, based off of the 2005 novel by James Sallis presented what might be argued as being his most generally accessible movie to date.With a screenplay that was adapted by Hossein Amini, and Ryan Gosling, who made for an inspired casting choice as the unnamed ""Driver."" A young anti-hero who is to Drive, what The Man with No Name was to Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy. Like Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name, with a toothpick clenched between his teeth, Driver is the strong silent type, who says little, but who here is a person with whom, still waters run thoroughly deep. Cutting a morally ambiguous figure, he is a loner who is not the most gregarious of people.In terms of its direction, Refn's gritty neo-noir oozes ample degrees of style, which has very much an 80's aesthetic. Its opening credit sequence with amazing cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel captures the neon-lit skyline of L. A. to the strains of Kavinsy's retro-synth '80s influenced, Nightcall. To say it is absolutely breathtaking would be an understatement, and it immediately encapsulates the brooding, atmospheric tone of the movie. While also establishing the isolated existence of Gosling's Driver. Drive's soundtrack is an inspired collection that captures the appropriate 80's vibe. It's safe to say that the Danish director pretty much wears his influences on his sleeve, with stylistic nods to Brian De Palma's Scarface as well as Michael Mann's Manhunter, and William Friedkin's To Live and Die in L. A. Refn also opens the movie with a phenomenally understated, nerve-wracking car chase sequence that is beautifully low-key and establishes the seedy side of L. A. that the Driver exists in. Drive is not a movie about excess with the director reigning things in and it's more modest, making it that bit better for it.In the lead role, Gosling is given minimal dialogue but still manages to say so much in the way he carries himself. With his eyes conveying an underlying melancholy, while all the while seething with brooding intensity. There is also a volatile side to him as well whereupon when threatened can come bubbling to the surface. Gosling is also brilliantly supported by an excellent cast that includes Carey Mulligan as Irene, who while given little to really do, is able to be suitably vulnerable. Albert Brooks, in a role that is a complete departure from anything he has done before, plays superbly against type as the menacing Jewish mobster, Bernie Rose. While Ron Perlman and Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston offer equally exceptional support.Pivotal to Drive, is the dynamic between each of the movie's characters. The complex nature of Driver's relationship with Irene, and her young son, with there being a pseudo-family relationship, as is that with himself and Shannon. (Cranston). The man who up until meeting Irene, proves to be the closest thing that the young man has to a friend or family. What's also intriguing is the relatively brief friendship that Driver begins to develop with Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel, (Oscar Issac), and one that is doomed to end badly.Needless to say, there are sporadic moments of extreme graphic violence which won't be for the faint-hearted which include, one guy being stabbed in the eye with a fork, and another being repeatedly kicked to death in the head. This leads to where Refn somewhat falters, with the violence arguably being needlessly more explicit than what it needs to be. As well as being overwhelmingly over-the-top. Sometimes it's best to leave some moments of violence to the imagination and was is left unseen can be more disturbing than what is seen.These flaws aside, Drive is a supercharged atmospheric neo-noir with an ample supply of visual panache, well-drawn characters, and a narrative that while simplistic, should keep you hooked. Brutal and unflinching when it needs to be. Although at times to its detriment. Drive is a testament to Nicholas Winding Refn's stylistic verve and ingenuity as a director.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great film with a few issues,"Pretty solid film, although I think this film is pretty overrated. Two things really pulled me out of this film. The first was the sound. For what ever reason, in parts of the film, they put all the dialog and sound effects on the right channel and the music on the left. It creates a very strange effect. When there is a character on the right side of the screen, and you hear their voice on the left, it pulls you out. This is a huge issue if you watch the movie with head phones (Like I did). I actually switched the film to mono part way through so I wouldn't be distracted by it. It might seem like a minor thing, but truthfully, this ticked me off. The second thing that really pulled me out of the film was the gore. It seemed so out of place. I mean, I guess the amount of gore that comes out a persons head when they get shot by a shotgun would be a lot, and maybe it was a realistic amount, I don't know. But it seemed over the top. Not like a Kill Bill over the top where it's to the point where it's funny, but instead it was out of no where and pulled me away. But it should be noted that this isn't the case every time something violent happens. At the end of the film, a characters arm gets cut open and the amount of blood wasn't as over the top as other moments and as a result, didn't distance me from the film. Those are my biggest complaints. All in all, it was a real good movie. But if those two things would have been corrected, it would have been much better in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A friend described this as ""Shane in a Michael Mann skin"" and I'm inclined to agree.","Powered by a superficially tranquil energy, this Western-on-wheels story has much bubbling beneath its sleek, taciturn outer layers, much like its nameless protagonist. The long, subdued stretches that characterise the narrative serve to make the sparse scenes of action and romance all the more savage, stirring, and memorable when they arrive. Although the detached, resolute anti-hero speaks sparsely and softly, a lot is conveyed of him through his barely spoken affection and regard for his lone mum neighbour and the ruthless, brutal lengths he pursues to keep her from the claws of the mobsters he finds himself entangled with. As such, this film works not only as a gritty crime drama and atypically touching love story but also as an engaging character study which relies on the aforementioned elements to reveal the protagonist's (and, to a lesser extent, the support cast's) multiple layers. Is he, as the excellent synth soundtrack suggests, a ""real hero"", a troubled and tortured bloke hanging by a thread, or some semi-integrated blend of both?At once haunting, arresting, and poignant, Drive is the cinematic equivalent of the very best synthpop: cool, celestial craftsmanship punctuated by harsh, pounding beats, both belying the raw, organic heart pulsing at its core.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The film is a bit slow at first, with a lot of awkwardly written dialogue with long pauses between Driver and Irene. I didn't think their romance felt particularly believable because they barely talk to each other, or kiss each other or anything like that. Just a lot of smiling towards eachother with very few words spoken between the two. This was the film's major weakness in my opinion. But! I liked that the story and the movie as a whole is quite simple, with a runtime of 100 minutes which was just right. The action is fantastically brutal, which I did not see coming.

The story and characters are nothing more than sketches that have been utilized countless times before, and the only thing that made the film different, and the slightest bit interesting to me, was the director's cinematic style, which tapped into techniques (including a dash of subtle sensation) that are uncommon to mainstream cinema.Refn prefers minimalist storytelling and slick styling to make superficial associations without providing anything of real substance to sink into or explore, opting instead for the typical Hollywood action pathways.People have called ""the driver"" enigmatic and mysterious, but the truth is, he only seems so because virtually no information is provided about him beyond a few hints, and his strength is only demonstrated in his superhuman ability to out-think and out perform everyone else in battle.The entire movie actually resembled a template for a video game or contemporary action comic book. Just consider what is given import in the film, as well as where, and through what it aspires to take us, moreover how it ends up: Neither story nor character development stray very far from the basic plot, and there is a long, violent conclusion (actually a series of violent incidents, one after another, that end up with nobody left).If you want to see a movie with some similarities that actually develops an authentic story and character, with a real sense of place, try Bullhead, from Belgium. In fact, I would argue that the most interesting cinema these days is not being made in English, though it is only seen and appreciated by tiny minority....Drive does work in several ways:1) because Refn creates his own brand of stylish cinema crossing in elements of mainstream cinema, combining ""realism"" and the ""potboiler"" with touches of Bergman, using an artsy technique that mixes long takes and silence with quick edits, sound, and fetishist action/violence in a way that wows the mainstream movie goer who has never seen anything like it, much less in the context of a genre film.2) as a post modern, deconstructionist take on the genre film, a la Jarmush (think Ghost Dog, or the more deconstructionist Limits Of Control, which I hated), Cronenberg (Eastern Promises and History Of Violence), even early Tarantino and the later-day Scorsese. References to films like Mann's, Thief, are spot on, but there are also numerous references to Peckinpah (and Steve McQueen) in particular (The Getaway), as well as to Sergio Leone, which not only give it support, but make its contemporary take/styling more than just derivative.I wonder what Godard would think of it? After all, Breathless was the first deconstructed ""cool, hard guy"" film to be made, more than 50 years ago.Problem is, there was not one thing about Drive that I have not already seen dozens of times in American movies, beginning with the method-actor characterizations of the 50's and 60's (Brando comes first to mind, but carries right on down through Clint Eastwood, and just about every Hollywood action anti-hero).The driver with no name, who rarely speaks: A toothpick in his mouth tough guy (with a sensitive soul) who looks like a GQ model, and whose only expression other than stone face is a glib smile that's supposed to mean everything he doesn't express... I already said that Gosling borrows a lot from McQueen, but he also uses James Dean and the young Mickey Rourke, who, of course tapped the young Brando.Problem is, with each reincarnation of this archetype the meaning gets diluted until it becomes only a posture and nothing more, effective only in how it conjures up these other actors and their movies, while contributing nothing to the archetype it is alluding to.Driver actually has no character of his own, only mannerisms, and there is nothing substantial about the film. It's only interesting in terms of all the movies and characters it references from Hollywood past, trimmed down and reliant upon familiar archetypes and stories, done up with a contemporary styling that blends art house cinema and Hollywood.At times Refn's postmodern, playful stew works wonders, but there are also times when it backfires completely, such as when the Driver boards the elevator and kisses the object of his courtly love (who's nothing more than the object of a fairytale knight's devotion) for the first time before pushing her aside and not only murdering the hit man standing next to him but stomping him repeatedly as we hear his bones crack. How romantic! Cut to the loving, face of his Madonna as she backs safely into the garage.Bottom line is that there was not enough ""new material"" to really captivate me much less enrich the bare-bones' story, and it ended up being not much different from all of the other movies built around dysfunctional males who can only find their way (and know how to survive) as warriors, by means of repeated acts of violence against whatever ""bad guys"" are threatening them, or some innocent member of society.The only thing I really wondered about in Drive is what made Driver the way he was, or why everyone in the movie had to die except for the girl? Talk about self-defeating.... Half way into the film (once I fully understood what the director was doing) I could pretty much intuit everything that was going to happen scene by scene, moreover how it would be portrayed.For me, despite a few moments of genuine brilliance, this film was ultimately not very satisfying, even somewhat pretentious.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Subpar pacing, still great","Seeing the trailer and plot of the film, I was really surprised with the kind of movie it turned out to be. From the looks of it, I expected a run-off-the-mill heist movie. But ""Drive"" is much more, it is a crime drama, a Tarantino-style pop-culture reference and overall a good movie. But to me, it fails to be one thing: well paced.After a very interesting opening that introduces Ryan Gosling's ""driver"" and his skills, the movie starts to slog through about an hour of exposition, which (don't get me wrong) isn't necessarily bad, but a bit overlong, taking away time from the slightly rushed finale. What really bored me at times was the lack of dialog. I know that the Driver was intended to be ""a character that mostly communicates non-verbally"", but it seemed to me that he doesn't communicate at all. Most appearances of Gosling's character along with Carey Mulligan's Irene are more awkward than romantic or interesting.This is neither Gosling's or Mulligan's fault, who on the contrary did an amazing job. This too can be said for most actors in this movie, especially Bryan Cranston. Most characters are well written and equally well performed.But after the slow start ""Drive"" finally gets to business and shows its true strengths. The remainder of the movie is visually great, the story unfolds and twists nicely and Ryan Gosling gets to show his acting skills. Without wanting to give too much away, the big finale is disappointingly obscure compared to the graphic nature of the film before. But the film ends with a very memorable scene, marking its spot as one of the most interesting films of 2011.""Drive"" may be too subtle for many fans of normal action movies; marketing it as a heist movie certainly didn't help. But anyone who considers him- or herself a movie enthusiast should definitely check out this little gem at least once.

Total waste of time and driving.,"Went to see this movie with my daughter hoping it would be better than the movie I saw the previous day. It wasn't. Drive, should have been about a driver. You know a Steve McQueen type guy who is a stunt driver by day and a getaway drive by night. It should have been sequence after sequence of cool getaway driving or cool stunt driving with an interesting character study of a man who drives and loves cars in between. It wasn't and that's the problem with the movie. Between endless sequences of silence we get bad dialog by stupid, old, white gangsters and stylized violence; which put together produced one boring movie where the only character we actually care about for a second is in the movie for a second. What a waste, this should have been a good movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Destined to be a classic,"I saw ""Drive"" a week after I viewed the British spy thriller ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and two of the adjectives I used to describe that film - laconic and languid - could apply equally here.The script is very sparse: the lead character, an utterly brilliant Ryan Gosling as the driver with no name and no history, takes an age to speak and then says very little; the love interest, superb British actress Carey Mulligan, is a superlative example of less is more when it comes to speech; and for long stretches there is simply no dialogue. And it is often slow, even at crucial times slow motion - but then there are explosive instances of brutal violence that remind me of the first time I saw ""The Godfather"".It's hard to imagine many Hollywood directors being capable of helming such slow-burning dramas and indeed ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" was directed by the Swedish Tomas Afredson while ""Drive"" was directed by the Dane Nicolas Wining Refn. Here superb direction is supported by splendid cinematography from Newton Thomas Sigel who offers us contrasting night-time aerial shots and gritty street-level scenes of Los Angeles. Even the original music by Cliff Martinez enhances the tension in a complementary rather than showy manner.""Drive"" is a kind of urban western with the car as the horse and the Gosling character as either Clint Eastwood personality-wise as The Man With No Name in the ""Dollar"" movies or The Stranger in ""High Plains Driver"" or as good-looking Alan Ladd narrative-wise as Shane in the eponymous movie where a man goes to the rescue of a threatened woman and her child only to find that a man's gotta do what he's gotta do.This is one of the most stylish works I've seen in a long time where even a silver bowling jacket - the constant garb of the driver - can look cool in a tale where the anti-hero's nerves are as steelish as some of the weapons utilised by the low life he has to encounter. This is such a terrific movie that I could see it becoming a cult classic.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This movie stuck with me,"I saw this film once, on a very small screen on a- Not Netflix, about 1,5-2 years ago. Didn't really get it, but thought it was fine. The g o r e was what drew me msot at that time.
But the main themsong of the film, A Real Hero, has stuck with me. The Driver snapping completely in a elevator stuck with me. The girl quiet stares entices me. It was this summer I saw an analysis of it by Chris Stuckmann, and I began appreciate all details that show you how the Drivers world slowly begins to crumble. This is a character study, and a damn good one, at that.
I finally saw it again a week ago. It is now etched into my mind, and in my opinion, one of the great films of the 21st century. Gosling's terrifyingly quiet performance is mesmerizing, as long with all of the others in the cast. Refn unhinching visual storytelling and direction is breathtaking, not only one of the best films, but one of the best made, as well.

A Cult Classic for Good Reason,"Drive is one of those movies where, if you know the characters, you know the outcome - not because it's predicable, but because it's Biblical. It's a study in character, cause and effect.The Driver (Ryan Gosling) is a quiet loner, in the apartment down the hall. He doesn't say much (not even his real name). Maybe that's because still waters run deep. Maybe it's because he's living two lives - one as a Hollywood stunt driver and one as a getaway driver for jobs handed to him by Shannon (Bryan Cranston), who works for Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). Next to his brother, Nino (Ron Perlman), Bernie is practically civilized for a gangster. Then again, if he were everything he seems to be, he wouldn't be a gangster.You know that phrase, ""Get a life?"" The Driver gets one when he notices pretty neighbor and single mom, Irene (Carey Mulligan). She's quiet, too, and lonely, what with her husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) stuck in prison. There's a quiet chemistry between these two that could slice through butter, reminding me of how nice it is when movie people don't tell you everything that's going through their mind every second they're on screen. There's a sense that if you let it, these three would find a way to fill the gaps in their lives.But then Standard gets out of prison, and the dominoes start falling, not necessarily in the directions you expected but with the logic and fatality of a Presbyterian sermon. What's great about this film is that everybody does what they're inclined to do, for reasons that are compelling to who they are and what they want - in the face of what you might predict looking down upon the maze of their lives. They don't see the maze, just the path before them. Each character is firmly committed to it. My mom used to say, ""We can't win for losing."" Maybe there's a reason for that.I love this movie. The performances in it are first rate. There isn't a bad scene. My only regret is that I can't go back in time and see it again for the ""first"" time. It holds up really well. It's one of those movies where, if you catch it on cable, you stop what you're doing. ""I just want to watch this scene."" If you're not careful, you'll end up watching the rest of the movie because it's compelling.And maybe that's what's so compelling about this film. Yes, we get the pun. ""Drive"" is about a driver, who drives by day and drives by night. We all have our inner and outer drives. But every character in this film is animated by a hidden drive - whether it's to make money, please others, have a normal life, live in peace or be, as the song says, ""a real human being, and a real hero.""Film fans will recognize the similarities between this film and the James Caan classic, ""Thief."" There's an early scene, involving a watch, where you think this is going to be Jason Statham in The Transporter, with a virtuoso driver who lives by a Caan-like personal code. But to its credit, Gosling's character is less governed by his head than his heart. This is not a movie about people who think, let alone think it all through before they act. It's a film about people who feel, whether they're acting on fear, lust, anger or love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Highly overrated,"So disappointed.Before heading into this movie I checked the reviews on RT and here. Assumed it would be an underrated movie for the mass market and right up my street.This was definitely not to be the case.The characters were poor and under developed, the interaction between cast dull and without chemistry.Story-wise it was terrible. Logic holes you could drive a tank through, tenuous reasoning, cheap macguffins with no believability about the circumstances of any character.I thought the whole ""less is more"" approach for the dialogue fell flat, and actually worked against itself. I was left wanting so much more from the characters back history and personality. It was as if the script writers thought they were smarter than they actually were.On the positive side; the cinematography was excellent, throwback synth-pop juxtaposed nicely and the car chases impressive.However, these facts alone were not enough to class it in the 8/10 category of films.6/10 purely for the aesthetics - I'd only recommend watching this if you have nothing else to see.

A Gripping Ride That Leaves You Breathless,"One of the standout features of ""Drive"" is its meticulous attention to detail. The cinematography is simply breathtaking, with mesmerizing shots of the city at night and beautifully framed action sequences. The use of lighting and color is striking, creating a distinct visual style that oozes both elegance and grit. Each scene feels meticulously crafted, with a focus on building tension and immersing the audience in the protagonist's world.Ryan Gosling delivers a mesmerizing performance as the stoic and enigmatic Driver. His portrayal of a skilled getaway driver with an underlying sense of quiet intensity is both haunting and captivating. Gosling's ability to convey complex emotions with minimal dialogue is commendable, allowing the character's actions and expressions to speak louder than words.The supporting cast is equally impressive. Albert Brooks shines as the sinister and ruthless mobster Bernie Rose, delivering a memorable performance that balances charm and menace. Carey Mulligan brings depth and vulnerability to the role of Irene, the Driver's love interest, while Bryan Cranston adds an endearing touch as the Driver's mentor and confidant, Shannon.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to blend different genres seamlessly. ""Drive"" is not just an adrenaline-fueled action flick; it also delves into themes of redemption, loyalty, and the consequences of violence. The film explores the darker side of humanity, and the moral ambiguity of its characters adds layers of complexity to the narrative.While ""Drive"" offers an engrossing experience, it may not be for everyone. The deliberately slow pacing and contemplative nature of the film might deter viewers seeking constant thrills. Additionally, the film's graphic violence and occasional bursts of intense action may be too much for the faint-hearted.The soundtrack deserves special mention as well, with its synth-heavy score perfectly complementing the film's retro aesthetic. The music heightens the tension and adds a distinct flavor to the overall atmosphere, further immersing the audience in the world of ""Drive.""In conclusion, ""Drive"" is a captivating and stylish neo-noir crime thriller that will leave you breathless. With its impeccable visuals, mesmerizing performances, and a thought-provoking storyline, it stands out as a unique and memorable film. While it may not cater to everyone's tastes, those who appreciate a well-crafted and immersive cinematic experience will find themselves mesmerized by ""Drive.""

Original take on the classic action hero movie,"First off I want to say, I love this movie. To me and many other reviewers it's an artsy and fresh take on the classic action hero movie. The pace and atmosphere along with the soundtrack completely sucked me in. I had my doubts about Ryan Gosling, but after seeing the film I can't imagine another actor more befitting the role. The acting and execution of this movie is, in lack of a better word, COOL!I've read a lot of reviews about this movie here on IMDb and people seem to either love it or hate it. And that's OK. People have their likes and dislikes. But what annoys me is when people slag the movie off because it's not what they want it to be. I've read many strange complaints. For example, some reviewers don't like our hero's outfit that stays on him for most of the movie or his behavior/personality. As many other aspects of this movie I think these elements are simply an ode to the classic movie hero, as well as an artistic take that we rarely see in action movies. It also helps mystify our hero. Some complain the plot is too thin. Bet you didn't complain about that after seeing the Fast and the Furious!? I agree, the plot is thin and somewhat diffuse, but as stated above the core of this movie is the classic action flick, and so in many ways it stays true to that style. The plot may appear even thinner as the movie is not as CGI or explosion fueled as most action movies.Many of these negative reviewers could just as well say they hate apples because they don't taste enough like oranges. If you bite into an apple but are expecting and wanting the taste of an orange you'll be disappointed, but don't slag the apple off for not succeeding at imitating an orange. It's simply not an orange. If you can't roll with the unexpected, then don't watch this film. With this movie a lot of people seem to have expected it to be a more standard action movie with clearly defined characters and plot. The first few minutes of the movie can be a little misleading as it appears to be a straight forward action/car chase movie. But to my pleasant surprise it wasn't. The base of this movie is the retro action flick with the unchanging and determined hero at the center, but Danish director Refn has transformed this blueprint into an exciting, gritty, modern, and somewhat ambient package.I appreciate many have never heard of Winding Refn (the director) or seen his movies, but what I can say is don't expect this guy to produce a standard blockbuster (at least not yet), expect something different instead. This is without doubt the best new movie I've seen in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Scorpion And The Frog,"This whole movie feels like a fever dream, it brings back retro aspects of the 80s with modern features. Its like a modern film noir, with top tier cinematography and symbolism.The whole movie is a symbolism of the about the scorpion and the frog. You see, scorpion wants to pass the river but he cant swim. So he asks the frog for help. The frog refuses saying the scorpion will sting him. Scorpion says if he does that, they both will drown, so the frog agrees. Halfway through the river stungs the frog. The frog asks why did he do it. Scorpion says he is a scorpion and thats in his nature.The protagonist, Driver, is the frog in this case and the scorpion is his criminal life. Whenever he gets a chance to break loose and be happy, he is pulled back into it, which ends up ruining his life.Whenever he breaks the law, he wears the scorpion jacket, indicating that he is carrying the scorpion on his back, and the scorpion eventually stings him.Its a movie with amazing soundtrack, with retro synthwave vibes. Its visually beautiful and different from the action movies nowadays.Ryan Gosling does a good job playing the protagonist, he is different from the one that we are used to, he is silent and introverted.

Ryan Gosling drives...and silently broods (a lot!),"While ""Drive"" is a decent and occasionally brilliant film, it fails to live up to its rave reviews. The first act of the film (especially the opening scene) is excellent. However, the mood created by the first act quickly turns into an occasionally exciting but clichéd (and unnecessarily gory) bloodbath. I have no problem with graphic violence (it can be used for brilliant dramatic punctuation, like in ""The Departed"") but here it seems unnecessary and distracting, possibly to make up for the film's plot holes and all too familiar storyline. The tremendously talented cast is mostly wasted here, with Ryan Gosling (who probably has no more than 20 lines of dialogue in the entire film) spending most of the movie with the same dead-pan look on his face, staring pensively into space. Albert Brooks does breathe some life into the film as an unpredictably violent gangster, but it isn't enough to elevate the film's inert and meandering script. The film also fails to build on some intriguing premises introduced in the first act, like the driver's unexplained policy of only allowing his customers (usually criminals) five minutes during getaways. While I was initially blown away by the film's visual flair, in retrospect this film seems like a standard issue revenge movie pretending to be an art movie. It's atmospheric and brilliantly shot, but lacking in the deep philosophical explorations and dramatic tension that it seems to promise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Beautiful, slow build, thriller","I can only imagine that the bad reviews are due to people reading the synopsis and expecting a movie with car chases and explosions. No, this is not is Fast Furious.Drive is an excellent movie that exemplifies perfectly how good directing goes a long way to tell a great story. There are many scenes with little to no dialogue where a lot is said or shown to the audience regardless.Gosling - who in 2011 was probably know to most people only due to Notebook - plays masterfully a troubled stuntman / getaway driver who finds in Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benito a comforting he seems to be longing for.When a heist goes wrong and those relationships are at risk, all of the characters are really put to the test and the narrative goes off, explodes. Without any of it being obvious and requiring being spelled out.A great thriller which takes time to build the tension, because it instead chooses to creates deeper characters.Closer to an 9/10 than a 8/10 in my book, to be fair.PS: If you liked Drive, I'd really recommend trying out Nightcrawler (2014)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Driven away with ""Drive""","I thought this flick as being another ""Fast & Furious"" type movie where can get lot of actions to watch and to be true I like the action movies. But even I couldn't see that kind of action here, I was driven away by this film just for it's decent nice plot. The actress Carey Mulligan looks sober and cute. The dialogues are well written and almost every character gives the justice to their roles. Some violent scenes may not spoil the pace of the film and you will never feel, you are getting bored. If you are really looking for heart touching love and action, I'd recommend it strongly and the ratings would prove to be correct!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A tension filled masterpiece.,Each scene had some sort of meaning or tension to it that kept you engaged. The use of violence was awesome and caught me off guard.

I love it!,"Drive is an intense and gripping cinematic experience that combines a classic crime thriller plot with Nicolas Winding Refn's stunning neon aesthetic. The film masterfully captures the unspoken emotions of its characters, creating a palpable sense of tension and intimacy throughout. The Driver, Irene, and Benicio's brief escape to paradise is a poignant moment that underscores the stakes of their tumultuous relationship, while Oscar Isaac's performance adds a layer of uncertainty to the film's most searing moments.The second half of the movie amps up the tension even further with brutal violence and shocking twists that highlight the consequences of the characters' choices. Refn's willingness to delve deep into the psyche of his characters makes for a visceral and unforgettable experience, with stunning visuals and a haunting score that linger long after the credits roll.The final act of the film takes a bold and unexpected turn, embracing horror and slasher tropes to create a thrilling and unforgettable climax. The use of the killer's point of view adds an extra layer of terror, while the hallucinogenic imagery and slow-motion shots add to the film's dreamlike and unsettling atmosphere.Drive is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest films of all time. With its stellar cast, stunning visuals, and bold storytelling, it is a movie that demands to be seen and experienced.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Drive"" - A Riveting and Compelling Ride","Drive is a compelling film. The casting was spot-on. Gosling has presented us with a complex and strange character. He moves with stealth and a determined focus that is highly effective. I appreciated the fact that certain scenes contained sparse text. The chemistry between his character (""Driver"") and Irene was palpable, without resorting to the maudlin. There was a lovely contrast between Driver, Irene (sensitively performed by Carey Mulligan), and her endearing son.Newton Thomas Sigel and his team must be applauded for the cinematography. It was very finely rendered, with deep, rich shadows and subtle bits of light. In my estimation, the lighting in this film stands out as a true character, all its own.Beth Mickle, who was the Production Designer, also did a stellar job. The interiors of apartment rooms had a genuine vibe to them, and her palette choice was wonderful.So, why only 7 stars?A handful of the songs were pumped up in volume, unnecessarily. This not only defeats the purpose of the song, but it is downright pushy to the audience. Don't get me wrong, I do not mind loud music, if effective. But for these songs with their redundant lyrics, I found it distracting.Another bone of contention: some of the lines for the Albert Brooks character bordered on being cornball and unconvincing. Although he seemed to do his best on delivery, I found that several scenes were diffused in tension, because of the text. I trust that this was not the intention of either the director or the screenwriter.Lastly, there were lovely character studies by Bryan Cranston and Christina Hendricks, but they both should have been given more screen time, to flesh out their motivations and nuances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"I will do as south park did to Mel Gibson, and ask for my money back from Ryan Gosling","I'll start that by the IMDb score, this film was promising, an 8.8 is a nice score.I have watched all the Trailers, and i got pumped up and just got up and bought a ticket!I can count on one hand the number of times i wanted to just get up and leave the cinema. This film lacks a plot, Ryan Gosling had about 10 lines and i think all together the movie had about 40 lines. The name can't be more misleading and the Trailers contain 100% of all the action in that movie.So if you take the time and just watch the trailers you know about this movie as much as i do - only you have saved about 1:25 hours of your life.Please for the love of god, i beg from you dear Driver team, make the trailers about the movie and not about misleading cuts.

Oscar Worthy...Gosling is amazing!!!,"Drive...one of my new favourite movies. This film really separates itself from all the crap that comes out of Hollywood these days. First of all, there couldn't have been a better choice in a lead role than Ryan Gosling, because my hat is off to him. His presence made the film definitely worth watching. He didn't do much talking throughout the film, but the mystery of the 'Driver' character was certainly felt in the film due to exceptional acting from Gosling. If he does not get a nomination for best actor at the Oscars, it would be an absolute disgrace. Gosling pulled aside all the romance crap he has been in and pulls the middle finger at the haters with this performance showing that he is not just a pretty boy. The rest of the cast is exceptional as well such as Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, and Ron Perlman, but this is Gosling's film. It is also good how they made this film a perfect fusion between action and drama, with the aspects of an art-house film. The music in the film played a larger part than most would think as well...just watch the movie and you will see what i mean.

Gave Me the Tingle,"Listening to electro pop genre based music has been something I've listened to for a very long time. That specific genre based music has ALWAYS given me a feeling I can never explain. That feeling I call the 'Tingle'.
I saw short clips of the movie before even watching and Ladies and Gentlemen let me just say that that already gave me the 'Tingle' (along with the song of course playing, of course). Doubt that it was going to happen along the whole movie due to Ryan Gosling. I've never been a huge fan of his works neither was I interested in his work. In fact this was a 'Ryan Gosling' movie. Then I had the audacity and went to lay down and watch the movie, never would've knew what was going to happen.
If I could best abstractly describe this movie it would've been 'city lights'. This whole movie felt like looking down over city lights with that electro pop music playing (Sorry in advance of soundtrack references, it's too good). The tension and connection you feel in scenes with Irene and the Driver was just well done. Very glad they've urged to not say a lot of lines, it was worth it. I wasn't warned about the gore I would be seeing and too be fair, I love gore.
This isn't your typical car chasing impala movie, this is the real crap it's a  emotional rollercoaster movie. Not to even mention the excellent cinematography and especially the lighting.

All in all I was left with a sense of emptiness and a lot of questions for the director. Being the first movie by this Nicolas Winding Refn, but from browsing his other titles this brand of gritty uberviolent flocks doesn't seem to be that far off.First off the good. The cinematography as well as musical score is great. It does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're watching a 1980's movie and I absolutely loved that. From the wardrobe down to set decor this is one of the best examples of taking the viewer back in time and making it convincing. The intro scene as well as first third of the movie also carries with it a great sense of building tension. Problem is this continues on until the bitter end of the movie, with scene after scene of mounting tension capped off with gratuitous violence. Many of these scenes attempt to make Ryan Gosseling the coolest most dangerous man on the planet but I had a hard time believing this. I truly think he is a talented actor but I feel like he was just trying a little to hard and the character never really came through for me and was equally difficult to get attached to. Perhaps if I had seen this with rapt attention and been totally focused it would have been a better experience but alas I wouldn't run to the theater to see this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An easily misunderstood otherwise great movie.,"A very slow movie at the beginning, but turns out great in the end.You need to give your full attention to the movie up until the very end, only then you could fully appreciate it.First half shows a calm, quiet, and peaceful side of that driver; the second half, however, shows a different side of him entirely. A good twist.The movie pairs action scenes with slow, new-wave-like songs. A different vibe kind of movie. It's also very tense; there are lots and lots of dialogue-free-but-awkward moments between the driver and that girl he likes. They take their time when conversing. Staring at each other for at least 5 seconds before replying to the each other's sentences. Weird, but rightly placed ""pause"".Halfway through the movie, I make fun of whatever on the screen, but the more we get deeper into the movie, the more I enjoy it.

A Modern Taxi Driver,"Drive is an art-house film that not only manages to keep the viewer engrossed throughout the movie but also manages to captivate audiences by the unexpected violence and the ambiguous ending.It features Ryan Gosling in the lead role as a part-time movie stunt driver.

Overall, the casting is brilliant with each actor perfectly suited to their respective roles. Albert Brooks is a wiseguy and he gives an Oscar-worthy performance in a relatively small role.Unlike most mainstream movies, Drive has major portions of the movie without any dialog. The eclectic, groovy soundtrack perfectly fills the silences and manages to set the mood.Drive is a unique movie and the only comparable movie that I found was Taxi Driver which is considered as one of the greatest movies of all time.

"The Very Definition Of ""Dreadful""","Seriously - there are times when I just don't get this site. I get that people have different tastes in movies - but this movie has a ridiculously high rating. To be perfectly blunt about it - it's dreadful. If you look up the word ""dreadful"" in the dictionary, I'm sure that there will be some reference to ""Drive"" in the definition. It takes almost half the movie before we really get a sense of where this is going - and even then it doesn't become very interesting. It's ridiculously and often graphically bloody and makes terrible use of bad music to try to build suspense.Ryan Gosling is the star of this. He plays a Hollywood stunt driver who also moonlights as a driver for more than a few shady characters. But that really doesn't matter, because ultimately his ""undercover work"" isn't what gets him in trouble. He gets in trouble because he falls for his neighbour - who happens to be married to a guy who gets out of prison owing a lot of money, and he decides to help him out, gets entangled in - something. I tried - hard - to follow along but I spent a lot more of my time just trying to stay awake.One thing I have discovered over the years is that people get caught up in the hype about a movie, and when it turns out to be dreadful, they can't admit that they got caught up in the hype, so rather than calling it a good movie, it becomes an ""artistic masterpiece"" or some such thing.

Found My Self Drawn to It More and More as Soon as I Left the Cinema,"I went into this film not expecting much, just to pass a couple of hours on a subsidized ticketing day. However, I was very surprised, as well as pleased with this film.Although it starts off slow, the story line gradually picks up and even if it doesn't have heart pounding edge of your seat action, it does have a solid story line and some very good acting. I found it to be one of those movies that you could sit back and enjoy, you didn't have to be captivated by pulsating music, people screaming, or nudity (although all of the aforementioned criteria is there at some level). The story line was great, I liked how it somehow reminded me of old great action films of the late 20th century, as well as how the violence wasn't overbearing, but extremely gory when present. I saw my self plainly ""liking"" the movie, but the two or so hours since leaving the cinema, I have found myself thinking that this will be most likely my favourite Ryan Gosling movie and one of my favourite action movies of the year.I found that Goslings acting really mirrored the situation almost to the point of it becoming paradoxical.

I love that film too. Definitely worth a watch",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Hauntingly intriguing,"I am a big fan of Ryan Gosling's unconventional roles so Drive was a must see. The storyline is not very obvious, which makes the action so much more gripping. The 'Driver' (he has no name) is very mysterious and gives so little away from what he's feeling that it leaves you guessing, which is in my opinion the charm of this movie. Don't expect the movie to be action scenes from one end to the other; when they're not smashing each other's heads, the camera focuses on the driver's steel gaze and gloved hand clutching the wheel... you don't know where danger is coming from or if there is any. All in all, I think this movie is very individual. There's nothing that I'd compare it to, which is a big thing for movies nowadays. I do recommend you take care if you don't particularly enjoy the violence. I for one am fine with the concept it's just some of the graphics were very very vivid (e.g poking a guy's eye out with a fork), but I think that's a reason why it was so compelling.

Incredible: 10,"""If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in those five minutes and I'm yours, no matter what. I don't sit in while you're running it down, I don't carry a gun. I drive."" Such are the words of the nameless main character of the film Drive, from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn and portrayed by Ryan Gosling. This is a character without any explanation or backstory. He balances two jobs: a Hollywood stuntman and heist wheelman. Both involve driving. And that's that. On the surface, Drive sounds quite a bit like a typical, run-of-the-mill action film. Car chases, bloody action, hot chicks, and lots of money are common sights in modern films of this type. However, Drive manages to rise heads and shoulders above its contemporaries using three things: direction, acting, and style, employing all three with an artfulness that is all too rare these days. Especially in action movies. The director, Refn, has made quite a few films before this one, most of which involved crime of some type or another. As such, Drive is not entirely unfamiliar territory for him. This is a fact that is apparent in every frame of the movie. In no shot is there any space that is not filled with something unimportant or uninteresting. It has been edited down so that there is no dull moment, no scene that is any less than riveting. In every scene, you know exactly what is happening, and you can feel everything. The quiet scenes are filled to the brim with emotion, with all characters remaining reserved yet strangely expressive throughout the whole movie. These scenes in particular seem to have been filed so meticulously that you can see the dozens of takes it must have taken to find just the right angle. Occupying these sections and others are actors who seem to have been made specifically for their roles in Drive.These include the aforementioned Gosling, Carey Mulligan as the tender and beautiful Irene, Albert Brooks as the profane Bernie Rose, and Bryan Cranston (a singularly phenomenal actor from the equally awesome TV series Breaking Bad) as the Driver's employer, Shannon. Every one of them bring their own flavor to their scenes, in a way making them the stars of their screen time, rather than star Gosling. Cranston infuses his scenes with a hint of desperation, as he is a man struggling to get by with his auto-repair shop business. Mulligan is a subdued, beautiful, and caring woman whose love for her son is her main (ahem) driving force in the film. Brooks is a man of overt menace, who makes you shiver even when showing off his nicer side. Gosling has simultaneously the most and least significant role in the film. He reflects the emotions of those around him, but manages to subtly twist them into his own, and conveys more with a single glance and fewer than twenty lines of dialogue than most stars manage in entire films. Whenever he is on the screen, you might be focusing on someone else, but the Driver will always be making you wonder what he'll do next. The style of the film is ultimately what is the most notable aspect of Drive. Colors are comic-book rich, making each object in a shot instantly noticeable. The alternating atmosphere of the film is extremely, and fittingly, jarring, with genuinely shocking violence preceded and followed by quiet, meaningful dialogue. Refn does not exclude anything: entire conversations are shown, unedited, complete with the long silences in between lines. Concurrently, the violence is unflinchingly graphic. ""Viewers with an aversion to blood and brutality need not apply"" is a good enough way to sum that up. However, in another masterstroke, absolutely everything feels like it means something. Some of the film probably does not mean anything. But it all feels important, a fact that will keep you riveted to this visceral, unique, and emotionally rewarding triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An under appreciated and poignant work,"Drive is a rare success in that it manages to strike a balance between brutal violence and subtle pathos. By being a relatively light on conversational scenes, most of the emotion conveyed is through the exceptional music and shot design. This, in turn, means interactions have more meaning, as well as lending tension to the darker scenes.Do not be concerned that Drive skimps on the brutality: ""Driver"" (Ryan Gosling) is note perfect in his acts of savagery, an unassuming figure but ruthless when required. His clinical nature makes scenes seem cold and calculated, so his new relationship with neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) offers a brighter outlook on his future. Special note must be given to Nino (Ron Perlman), providing the sadistic and brash opposite to Gosling.Drive is an unfairly overlooked work, and definitely deserves more attention than it's been given.

One of the worst films I have ever paid for!,"I'm a car nut!

Thirty minutes into the movie I wanted to leave, but I held out hope minute by minute that the movie would get better. This is the worst spent $7.50 I have ever traded in a long time for some entertainment. If $13 million was spent on this, it was a total waste of someone's money. I was hoping for a better, or well matched, version of the 1978's ""The Driver"" with Ryan O'Neal. The entire length of all car chases probably totaled no more than three minutes out of 100 minutes.

Despite the slow start, it builds up into a fantastic action film, but retains the acting and curiosity of the first act.

I can't say I found it slow. In fact, its stylish pace and suspense work in its favour. I liked its shocking violent moments too, and can't really argue with those who consider it a great unique film. But that's just it, it's an arty film, not an action movie.

Overrated movie,"Not sure why this movie is much overrated. But people has their own opinions. For me, the background music was nothing short than awful, nothing special about the story, there are better movies than this in 80's, average acting performance, good camera techniques handled, overall nothing gr8 about the movie Some users have stated a good adrenaline rush, but seriously I dozed a bit in the middle of the movie. Even had a thought to get out of the movie but somehow managed to watch till the end.

What was that?,"I just don't see Gosling's appeal. Looks aside he's played every role I've seen him in the same. Where is the range? He mumbles through this movie lifelessly and this pretty much sets the tone and tempo for the whole movie. None of the actors and actresses shine, much less bring any much needed life to this film. Story is predictable and uninspired. The whole thing is disconnected and unengaging. I love violent movies but some of the violence here is nonsensical. . . . . look I wasted enough time watching this film - I'm not going to waste more reviewing it in minute detail - this is just a warning, one very very miss-able movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great,"My advice is to go to this movie cold. Don't watch the trailer (it has a lot of spoilers) and try not to watch any clips.This movie is amazing. From the wonderful performances from the entire cast, to the great car scenes to the brutal violence. Excellent execution in every respect. Wonderful pacing. Extremely impressive direction. A hot contender for director of the year. While the actors do a great job, the characters don't give them enough to warrant any accolades. Direction however, must be commended.The good:Everything.Best Scene: Driver is on the beach, with passing car lights in the back- ground. Or the wonderfully tense robbery scene.The bad:Nothing.Worst Scene: The guy in the elevator (bad for all the right reasons!)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Style over substance,"The style of Drive is commendable and has led to its acclaim and its labelling as an art house masterpiece. The minimalist storytelling, silence, retro music and over the top blood are certainly distinctive and add to the bleak atmosphere of the criminal schemes. However, they don't necessarily add as much to the story beyond being an expression of the driver's mental state. His characterisation is stoic and heroic to the point of absurdity as his physical prowess and effortless conquest of armed criminals is so assured that it becomes boring. Not to mention the coincidence of Cook already being involved with everyone else in the driver's life is a coincidence that takes ""small world"" too far. It's a neatly told film but with not much substance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fascinating,"This is a flawed if fascinating movie with ""future cult classic"" written all over it.To begin with, it doesn't look like anything else, only then it does. ""Drive"" shows flashes of prime David Lynch (Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive), spaghetti Sergio Leone (Fistful of Dollars), Hong Kong ultra-violence and 1971 Kowalski, lacquered with the gloss of a sleek car commercial. I'm not sure if director Refn really designed it that way, I'm not sure it works, but it is interesting, to say the least.In such a high-concept environment, the actors seem almost secondary. You'd be hard pressed to call Ryan Gosling the star of this movie; he hardly stars. The script is astonishingly weak. If anybody should win an Oscar, it's sound designer Cliff Martinez.About the score... A lot of reviewers cite its ""80s retro"" sound. I'm not sure if they were thrown off by the opening credits (which are very 80s), but the music has the analogue synth sound which is a hallmark of the 70s. This sound made a comeback in the late 90s with Air and Boards of Canada, but was notably absent in the 80s.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A near-perfect thriller.,"Drive (2011) follows a Hollywood stuntman who moonlights as a get-away driver who finds himself in deep trouble. This truly is a brilliant film, everything about it is great and it's one of my favourites! Gosling's best performance. It's easy to see why this quickly became a cult classic!I absolutely love the aesthetic of this film, and the cinematography was so minimalist which works well. The colour palettes are impressive, and I really liked the use of slow-mo as it massively added to the tension.The Driver is such a well written character who I couldn't help but root for, and Ryan gosling was the perfect fit for his role, his performance is hypnotic. The chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan was so strong and made the film as brilliant as it is. Also, the costuming was great and had a lot of though put into it.The score for the movie was ominous and totally added to the atmosphere. Also, there was a prominent lack of score which helped with the realism and brutal nature of the film. Alongside this was an iconic and fitting soundtrack that gave the film a weird 80s dreamlike vibe which I adored!The film is interesting throughout, and has a rather slow start which is most definitely a good thing as it introduced us to the characters and eased us into their lives very well. The pacing is quite steady for the whole duration, and the ending itself is emotional and quite touching.However, this film does not lack tense scenes! The beginning had my heart racing, and there's plenty of shocking twists and turns. For example, the action sequences and car chases were super thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat. The scene that shocked me the most would have to be the elevator scene, it was so simple yet incredibly horrifying and unexpected!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Film Liquet on Drive,"Driver. A Hollywood stuntman by day and a getaway driver by night (Ryan Gosling). He Does not show emotion, he remains calm and cold at most times; however, he can still feel and help out people in need, like his neighbour (Carey Mulligan), whose husband is in jail. After coming out of jail, the husband is indebted to the mob, so he takes on a job in order to pay his debts, enlisting the driver to help him out. The job fails and now the Driver must risk his life in order to protect the neighbour and her son.Vicious violence, drama, emotional characters and a messed up character ark. This movie has it all. The film elements are perfectly balanced between not showing enough and showing too much, and at 95 minutes of running time it is neither too short nor too long. It hooks the audience right from the very start as our mysterious protagonist explains his work rules, to the very end, as he drives off into the night, making the audience crave more, leaving everything open to interpretation.Beautifully styled, shot and edited, Drive has many miniscule details that the audience will only pick up on with their subconscious. Tiny digital zooms, minor set and shot details, which add so much more to the meaning. The little references to earlier films and intricate plot details leave us wanting to see more, even though the character's end in the perfect position.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Man with autism tries to deal with social scenarios,"An incredible film about a man with autism trying to get through difficult social situations. He also drives cars. Ryan Gosling says about seven words throughout the entire movie, but it's okay really because he is defined more by his crazy, constantly fluctuating emotional responses to everything. Time and time again the driver fails to handle critical scenarios that could change the entire plot, and then somehow make them look deliberate and totally planned. Missing social cues left and right, this is a comedy about a man with an unchecked mental condition trying to pick up a woman. A must watch for all car lovers and quite easily accessible for deaf people as the film itself does not have many lines in it. Why does he drive? Who is he? What is his past? Who knows, all that matters is that he's driving now and he can go really really really fast. This movie contains: - Epic car stunts - Ryan Gosling pretending to be autistic - Film dissolves between almost every shot - Very long stares where nobody says anything during the conversation but it isn't awkward because they always play ""A Real Hero"" over itOverall I rate this movie a 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A lot of the same, with nice violent scenes remembering Pusher (1996) but completely out of order/movie.

A near perfect film,"I loved almost every moment of this film. One thing that really stood out to me was the sound design and how well it matched the highly stylised feel of the film. The music was fitting and the diegetic sound was edited in an unusual way, sounding distant at some points and being loud and in your face when it needed to be.The second act, without getting into spoilers, was much more intense than I anticipated. The exposition in the first act, while being maybe a little bit too simple, hinted towards the second act and sets it up well.Great performances by the actors, especially Ryan Gosling, Ron Perlman, Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks. Gosling absolutely nailed the lead role.There were a few scenes that felt off to me. One that comes to mind is when Gosling and Carey Mulligan (Irene) are at a small creek with Irene's son. The scene felt unnecessarily cramped and the camera placements and angles of-putting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Stylish cinema with nods to David Lynch and Michael Mann,"Sarah Deming, a resident of Michigan, took legal action against the producers of Drive, as she was expecting a Fast and the Furious (2001)- type action movie. Bizarrely she is also claiming that the film is anti- Semitic, but on the former, she has a bit of a point, as the trailer does focus mainly on the driving element of the film, which there is very little in comparison to the aforementioned piece-of-s**t franchise, making the trailer a little misleading. This ludicrous story aside, the film does use many of the iconographic elements that make a good driving/action film: Ryan Gosling's character, simple named Driver, wears the sports jacket made famous by the likes of Steve McQueen, Ryan O'Neal and Paul Newman, made iconic in 1960's and '70's cinema.Driver is a stunt man for the film industry, and makes extra cash as a transporter of people in heists. He meets his neighbour, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son. Eventually her partner is released from prison, and is conned into doing a robbery, to pay back money for services whilst in prison. Driver, having a strong connection with Irene, wants to help him out. As this is a set up, things go terribly wrong. Albert Brooks gives a superb performance as gangster Bernie Rose, along with smaller - but no less brilliant - performances from Ron Perlman and Bryan Cranston (who was the main reason that I ever watched Malcolm in the Middle).Nicholas Winding Refn's first American film, sees him riff on many classic films - of particularly the 1980's. The lush look of LA is captured in all it's neon-lit beauty and reminded me very much of the iconic Michael Mann aesthetic. Also there are some protracted, and audio-specific moments of violence that offered that same kind of eeww- factor that you get in a David Lynch moment of violence. Gosling has to beat a guy in a lift, and the sounds are very reminiscent of the opening scene in Wild at Heart (1990), where Sailor crushes someones head against a stairwell banister.I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of stylish cinema - and fortunately it is not a case of style over substance, that is so prevalent today. This film has strong emotion, even with Gosling's incredibly laconic performance. I had a conversation with a friend about this film. As I was saying how ""cool"" it was, my friend turned to me and said he had started watching the film, but switched off half way through as he found it boring. This brings me back to the first paragraph of this review. He also believed the film to be of action orientation. So, is everything about this film misleading? Well, no.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"DRIVE (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2011) ***","This first caught my attention by its surprise win of the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival; just this week, then, a local friend also highly recommended it and, since the movie has not yet been released over here, I acquired it via ulterior sources. Actually, it appears that the edition I ended up with was not the finished version but rather a workprint which, instead of utilizing the score composed by Angelo Badalamenti (a pertinent choice given the film's Lynchian tone) for the entire duration incorporated cues from the Oscar-winning soundtrack of THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010) – a fact that immediately stood out to me while watching – and did not even feature the end credits but rather a blank screen accompanied by more indiscriminate and intermittent music snippets!Anyway, given the foreign-sounding director's name (of whose previous work I was only vaguely familiar with VALHALLA RISING {2009} and who, coincidentally, has just turned 41!), this could hardly be expected to emulate the Hollywood action formula – so that the ensuing European sensibility that runs throughout baffled audiences not attuned to (or prepared for) it, while delighting those used to movies which employed silence at least as eloquently as sound and speech! Likewise, I had not watched leading man Ryan Gosling in anything prior to this (despite having a handful of lauded films to his name), so I was a bit wary of his supposedly cool demeanor, given the actor's scrawny physique! That said, while I was sufficiently impressed with Gosling's contribution, I still could not reconcile myself to the fact that a stunt/getaway driver should automatically possess the 'angel of vengeance' faculties (though I concede that he is, by necessity, streetwise and quick-witted) displayed by the hero along the way!Incidentally, while the central character has been likened to Clint Eastwood's Man-With-No-Name in Sergio Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy and Alain Delon's similarly enigmatic and taciturn hit-man Jef Costello in Jean-Pierre Melville's LE SAMOURAI (1967), a more obvious model would be Robert De Niro's deranged Vietnam vet Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER (1976) – in which, at least, the protagonist's survival tactics can be excused, and we even get an equivalent here of that film's misguided date at the porno theater (which had naturally alienated girlfriend Cybill Shepard) in the elevator 'face stomping' scene (witnessed by the head-shaking heroine, neighbor and impossible-object-of-desire Carey Mulligan) clearly inspired by the notorious visage-squashed-by-fire-extinguisher opening of Gaspar Noe's IRREVERSIBLE (2002). Other easily identifiable links to the picture can be found in Don Siegel's THE KILLERS (1964), John Boorman's POINT BLANK (1967) as well as, it goes without saying, Walter Hill's THE DRIVER (1978), while the hero's chivalrous protection of a lonely woman and her son is borrowed from innumerable Westernsand, yet, it is amusing to just consider how modern film-buffs who staunchly believe that cinema began with Quentin Tarantino will only ever see his influence – in the form of foul-mouthed dialogue, seedy underworld figures, farcical violence and the non-linear structure of the climax! With this in mind, the finale is left open-ended, though the director reportedly stated that he likes to think the protagonist lived on to engage in further adventures in another city (though this would imbue him with quasi-mythical connotations that are incompatible with the unpronounced but very human love story at its core!).Mind you, the film is one of the best noir-ish thrillers of recent vintage: I was especially reminded of Steven Soderbergh's Elmore Leonard adaptation OUT OF SIGHT (1998) – not least because of the presence (again as a mobster) of Albert Brooks here – even if the Tarantino-worshippers will doubtless point out that he had himself put his stamp on the author's work with JACKIE BROWN (1997)! Other cast members include Ron Perlman (as Brooks' imposing Jewish associate, who gets a great 'exit'), ROBIN HOOD (2010)'s Oscar Isaac (as the ex-convict who seeks to capitalize on Gosling's criminal savvy as payback for the latter's interest in his wife, Mulligan) and, according to the IMDb, Russ Tamblyn (but, for the life of me, I failed to spot him!).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Part Explotation, Part Art House, Part B Movie, A Complete Joy","I had the pleasure of watching Drive for the first time recently, and I have to say that it's one of the few films that I have seen in a while that I've connected with really deeply.Nicolas Winding Refn serves up a masterstroke in film-craft. The way that he has envisioned the screenplay & transferred that to the screen underpins his skill as a director. His choice of cast (minus Gosling as it was Ryan Gosling that chose Refn to direct Drive) cinematographer & use of the film's soundtrack has helped shape Driver as a modern classic in my humble opinion.One key element of of the film is the use of dialogue, or perhaps more so the lack of it. Ryan Gosling's Driver has very limited lines and yet communicates so much through his non verbal nuances. The tension between Gosling & Carey Mulligan's Irene is pure electric and draws you deeper into the film. Despite this lack of dialogue you find yourself emotionally invested in the relationship between the Driver & Irene.An aspect of Gosling's Driver that I enjoyed was his line about the story of the frog and the scorpion. Much is made of the scorpion motif on Gosling's jacket throughout the film and all becomes clear with that one line.Bryan Cranston's Shannon spends much of the film in pretty much one sided short monologue's with Ryan Gosling's character, all the while conveying a paternal warmth & kindness that draws you to the character.Ron Perlman's nefarious & unpredictable Nino and Albert Brooks' equally grubby yet conflicted Bernie Rose are a joy to watch. It's a shame that both characters weren't given more screen time to develop as more could have been made of them.Christina Hendricks' Blanche also delights in her cheap & sleazy character. I was surprised to read that Refn actually auditioned for the role as he was seeking to ground the part in reality.Visually Drive is nothing short of gorgeous. Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography is stunning, and combined with the film's score I found myself mesmerised & immersed throught the full hour & forty minutes.Part explotation, part art house, part B movie, Drive is a cinematic gem that rejoices in the art of fim.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A film for the lonely and the brave.,"Love is a funny thing. It's funny how it can make us feel, what it can make us do. A feeling so complicated but so realistically portrayed in a world full of crime and violence. An unfortunate love story, a talented cast, a director with a vision, and a soundtrack that makes us want to drive for hours.Ryan Gosling portrays our driver, a talented, quiet and to himself mechanic and movie stuntman who occasionally takes on the role as a getaway driver for the daring among the countless and inspirational streets of L. A. A simple life which takes a drastic turn once our female protagonists husband is released from prison.A film where tension builds up excitingly and a climax that differentiates from the traditional ending, leaving audiences forced to face a painful and hard truth about a feeling so complex and beautiful.Drive is a hidden gem which is recognised and appreciated by true movie buffs. It's not your typical blockbuster but it holds just as much value and shows that you do not need a large budget to make a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece in the failing,"Drive is a one hour 40 minutes movie about a part-time stuntman who'll be the designated driver for any robbery, with only one condition ; be out of there in five minutes; a second longer and he's gone. But when one robbery doesn't go as planned, he's left standing alone as he fights back for his life and that of the people he loves most.I have to admit that for the most part I kept holding my breath for Gosling to speak throughout the whole movie, but every time he opens his mouth he manages to barely stutter out a few words here and there. His character was the least likable lead role we've seen for a while. For the most part, he strikes the viewer as a weird lunatic most likely as a result of a rough childhood as an orphan.The movie fails to make us relate to any of the characters in anyway; the plot's a cliché and there is hardly any dialogue in the movie for us to even consider evaluating the non existing script. Carey is as cute as ever here, but every time she comes up on screen she gives us hope that maybe the movie will take an unexpected turn for the better; but whatever hope we have is taken away just as quickly. Throughout this film I couldn't help but ponder on what in the world carey saw in this socially awkward weirdo.All in all, ryan gosling does a good job of acting out this awkward introvert of a character; but even him and his good charms can't save this movie from it's inevitable demise.This movie sucked in all levels and how it got such a high rating on IMDb is beyond me. Please don't let me stop you from hitting your local theatre to catch this so-called ""masterpiece""; but when you come out of it thinking what a waste it was, don't say I didn't warn you.

Stuck in idle.,"This is a movie that aspires to be a great nilhlistic existential thrill ride into oblivion & falls well short of its aims.But maybe I'm mistaken thinking this film has any aspirations. I kept waiting for ""Drive"" to rev up & it never really did. It has one pretty cool chase scene & a couple of other OK ones --stuff we've seen done much better in the ""Bourne"" movies, ""The French Connection"", ""To Live & Die In L.A."", etc. It's like watching ""Vanishing Point"" never arriving at a point.""Drive"" has none.The key problem is its lead. Ryan Gosling zombies through it all focused like a cat staring intently at some phantom object that none of us can see except this film's true believers who praise this movie like it's in the same class as ""Heat"" or ""Collateral"". There is a scene in which he puts on a rubber mask that has no real facial features & it conveyed the same amount of nuances & emotions that a maskless Gosling had been sharing with us all along.A big deal has been made out of Albert Brook's turn at villainy. Like just about everything else here, Brook's is okay. (I'll take Paul Reiser's sleazeball in ""Aliens"" or Robin William's chilling dryness in ""Insomnia"" way over this.)I felt bad for Carey Mulligan. Her soft edges never played off Gosling's blankness the way I think they were intended to. It makes me want to watch ""Never Let Me Go"" again.And a key part of the soundtrack was lifted directly from last year's Oscar winning score for ""The Social Network"".""Drive"" steal from a lot of better genre films & it doesn't do it well.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Almost flawless,"The only issue I have with the movie is the Driver. The main character is just laughable in the beginning of the movie, Ryan Gosling does a great work portraying the mysterious Driver, but he is just so damn awkward. Of course it's obvious that Nicolas Refn wished to portray the character this way, but in the first 30 minutes of the movie (exclude the intro scene) the Driver just seems to be a prop saying things to characters around him.When the movie picks up the pace and the conflict begins, the Driver finds his place in the movie's world. The drama, the thrills, the atmosphere, everything in the movie is built perfectly to support this decadent love story in the life of a man who just wishes to drive.Carey Mulligan as the sole female in the movie is placed like the mediator in the Driver's life, bringing balance to his life.I especially like that in the movie every (male) character is either an anti-hero or a villain.I would like to write much more about the film but I'm tired",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Noirish adaptation is unnervingly good,"The tech writer John Gruber is fond of a Kubrick quote about the truth of a thing being in the feel of it rather than the think of it, a phrase that for me perfectly explains the appeal of Nicolas Winding Refn's noirish adaptation of the James Sallis novel. Right from the first hotel room scene, through a near wordless 15-minute opening stanza, the foreboding atmosphere of an after-hours, back-streets Los Angeles takes hold. The ambient, minimal score by Cliff Martinez blends with deftly selected French electro-pop to deliver a moody, European sensibility that extends through the production design, colour palette and camera work.Flashes of sharp violence punctuate the film but are short-lived, like those in the fairy tales from which the director has drawn inspiration. Comparisons have been made with David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive', but the film is tonally closer to 'Lost Highway', with its mildly existential leanings, transformative subtext and generous use of electronic music in tandem with overpowered vehicles. But 'Drive', to its service, is less weird and more literal than Lynch's entire back catalogue (with the exception of his Disney masterpiece, 'The Straight Story').Ryan Gosling is typically understated, and his scenes with Carey Mulligan provide an effortless chemistry. Albert Brooks, playing steadfastly against type as an embattled mobster, brings both pathos and menace to the character of Bernie Rose. 'Drive' is a lush, cinematic indulgence that by most rational scales would not achieve a perfect score. And yet it seems petty to award it anything less. It looks — and feels — unnervingly good, and sounds even better. It's the film hot-pink Mistral was made for. Pass my driving gloves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Lovely,"It's ironic to call this movie ""lovely"" but it kinda is. ""Drive"" has great performances, Ryan Gosling has very tender and caring expressions on his face, and we can still see his potential to be a violent character. There is chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan and because of that we see some really beautiful and heartfelt scenes between the two.

And why do u get an actor like Bryan Cranston when u have no intention to give him more than 2 minutes in a 95-minute-movie?I was expecting a lot from this movie, after I saw the rating on IMDb.I really have no idea why its rated so good.

The Albert Brooks Show!,"'Drive' is a Good Film. It has some Stunning Moments & Razor-Sharp Execution, but what stands the tallest in here is, Albert Brooks. Brooks delivers an unforgettable performance as the violent & unpredictable villain.'Drive' Synopsis: A Hollywood stunt performer who moonlights as a wheel-man discovers that a contract has been put on him after a heist gone wrong.'Drive' has some stunning moments. However, the excessive violence will surely putt off the faint-hearted. There is just too much of disturbing bloodshed in here. The violence definitely could've been toned down.The Adapted Screenplay is intense & progressive. Nicolas Winding Refn Directs this recent critical-darling, with Razor-Sharp Vision. His work in here, deserves him an Oscar Nom! Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are perfect. Action-Sequences/Stunts, are extremely raw.Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Brooks dominates the show with an unforgettable performance as the violent & unpredictable villain. This is Brooks At His Finest! Ryan Gosling is commendable, as always. Carey Mulligan is in excellent form, while Bryan Cranston deserved more footage. Oscar Isaac is as usual. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Drive' is grotesque, but stunning at times nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Overblown simplistic writer's fantasy,"So this was the movie to watch these days. An asocial hero hiding a heart of gold and ultra-violence under apparent dumbness. He is not even slightly interesting, he doesn't talk, he lives in his little inner world of cars and precision mechanics, an economy-class emotional bubble that can burst into something relentless.Ah yes they brought to life the superhero next door, the kind of monster living only in the brains of writers. Bad writers that is. Writers that will happily confuse nothingness with rich inner substance. You want a specific car stunt for $500? Just ask the superhero driver. He needs no careful planning, it's all in his veins. Have some trouble with the local Mafia? Head-on collision is the solution, the silent boy can certainly write off a couple of big mouths and settle it all. Seems some director found the story compelling and convenient though. And viewers bought that sh*, which is most disheartening given the level of gore graphic and gratuitous ultra-violence.The nihilistic trend sells well as artsy gutsy stuff these days. The Coen bros dood it, and it's now a real consummate genre from Cronenberg's self-inflicted History of Violence to There Will Be Blood. Adding the F-word in movies was an artistic endeavour years ago, now it seems that violence, especially dumb violence, is the way to show off how much more gripping you can do with less substance.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Boring characters but a fairly gripping story,"I was advised to watch this film by my friend who's movie taste I trust most. Maybe it was having such high expectations based off of his opinion, but Drive just didn't pack that oomph that is in any great thriller. It had brutal violence but to no plot progression. The brutality felt like it was just for the sake of realism and brutality, which is fair, but I would love for it to feel more reasonable for the characters. Drive doesn't have a convoluted enough plot or clever enough writing to sit amongst the kings of thrillers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A brief summary of my acquaintance with this film,"It was in 2013. I was thirteen years old. I bought another DVD disc which included action films with my favorite muscular actors: Schwarzenegger, ""The Rock"", Statham with his ""The Transporter""... And then I noticed another film that was different from all of them. It seemed like it had no place among them at all. I left it last, because I did not know what to expect from this film, unlike the others. I finished watching all the films with my action heroes, which received exactly the impression I expected, and finally came to a film like ""Drive"". After watching it to the end, I said to myself, ""What kind of boring nonsense is this? Even The Transporter was better."" But I finished watching another movie collection that was going to my shelf, waiting to buy a new disc.A week passed. I have another DVD with my favorite muscular actors: Segel, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren. I watched all the films on this disc, but something was missing. I had a strange feeling, as if I had missed something. And I did not remember ever having this feeling. After all, I said to myself, ""What kind of boring nonsense?"" Then the question is, why, while watching all the films on the next DVD with my favorite action heroes, did I start remembering the film ""Drive""? And something happened that I could never allow myself to do, namely, watch the same film again. Having watched this film for the second time, my opinion of it remained the same, but not with such a share indignation that was the first one. And I wanted to watch it again, again, and again. Analyzing every scene, dialogue, acting, music, sound design, script. And in the end I realized that I was absolutely wrong.This film, unlike the previous ones, really made me love such an art as CINEMA!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""My hands are dirty...So are mine..""",A journey with people who don't need a lot of dialogue which in my opinion was very refreshing. Its a gentle story until it isn't. The violence and tension happen so organically with so few words that its still impressive to me to this day. The characters are fleshed out enough. A family gets involved with bad people but befriend a silent anti hero that turns out to be as bad or worse than them which is old school awesome. An almost grind house feel it wasn't so beautifully shot with a soundtrack that is as cool as the film itself.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Driven,"A stunt driver's life is thrown into disarray after befriending a lonely young mother and her son in this crime drama directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and starring Ryan Gosling. 'Drive' is a curious to film watch with Refn's subsequent features fresh in mind. With a more traditional narrative than 'Only God Forgives' and 'The Neon Demon', it is little wonder that audiences took more kindly to this earlier film than Refn's follow-up efforts, however, Refn excels when directing sequences that are dreamy, nightmarish and mysterious and there are less such sequences here due to the more conventional narrative. That said, 'Drive' is still very visually alluring with its nighttime shots set to Cliff Martinez's atmospheric score standing out in particular. Gosling is also more compelling here than in 'Only God Forgives' despite playing a character equally as laconic with equally sketchy background details. The connection he makes with the mother and her son always feels very real with little need for small talk between them. A montage of the trio playing by a lake is way too cute, blatant and unnecessary, but generally speaking, the bond between them radiates in remarkably subtle ways. The limited background for Gosling's character (only ever known as 'The Kid') work fairly well too. Of course, one desperately wants to know more about how he ticks, but by keeping him at a distance, it makes it easier for Refn to spin here what could be considered a parable for the chaos that comes into one's life with a partner and child to support.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Wooden....,"This is one of the worst 'action' films i have ever seen.How some of the reviews are giving this 8/9/10 out of 10 is beyond me.Ryan Gosling, is either the best actor in the world or the worst. If he was meant to play this character as wooden, boring and uncharismatic, I give him full marks.Action scenes were OK at best.I couldn't wait for this to end, that was the best part. Pretty much every comment i overheard as I left the cinema was a criticism of this rubbish. Ryan Gosling, bad move signing up to this, you're better than this.Do not waste your time and money on this garbage, you will regret it. The people saying they are seeing this again are deluded...it makes me wonder if they are affiliated with this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An Incredible Driving Experience,"Another one of the rare occasions I will call a film perfect. Drive is absolutely amazing and an amazing take on the most basic concept: a character who drives. Ryan Gosling is the star of this film and he is amazing in it. With minimal dialogue and his cynical personality making him the perfect character to act as the driver. The cast is absolutely stacked: Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Oscar Issac, Ron Perlman. This film in some ways can make you feel more attached to the side characters than the main character. I always look for a particular aspect of film to comment on and for this film it has to be both the cinematography and the sound. The cinematography was astounding, even just a shot of the driver sitting in his car can become an incredible shot thanks to the amazing lighting. All of the night scenes provide opportunity for amazing lighting and it delivered massively. Even the day scenes had some of the best lighting. And the camera movements were so fast and so dynamic it brought a new perspective to all of the driving scenes. And the music had to be the best part of this film. The song choices were excellent, they really did fit the mood the scene, notably the song ""Nightcall"" plays at the beginning of the film during the open credits, showing The Driver after a night call. I think that the music was perfectly fit to the scene. What's really good about this film is it's balanced take on realism and formalism. It uses formalist techniques, such as fast paced editing, swift camera movement, synth music, but the content and the narrative is so realistic it feels like a real story rather than a work of fiction which is something I really liked about it. I think this is only the second occasion both in writing and verbally I have called a film perfect. Everything about this film is perfect and makes it easily rewatchable.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tour de Force,"Drive is the best crime flick of the last ten years. Gosling's wonderful and painful portrayal of alienated outsiderness is balanced by a very humane and worthwhile Carey Mulligan. Very cool combinations of sound and picture. Exceptional casting, wardrobe, photography and production values overall. Drive is also exemplary in Its tightness - only 100 minutes long, no time wasted, no time to get bored. In my book this film belongs to the same league of modern crime classics as Heat and To Live and Die in L.A.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A true Masterpiece (I'll explain why I'm not exaggerating),"Drive is probably one of the best films ever made. Do not think I take those words lightly. From plot, to script, to character building, to direction, to acting, to cinematography, to sound design, everything in this film is painstakingly thought out, developed, and executed. Unfortunately, in it's brilliance of execution, it's made to look so effortless, that I couldn't make up my mind almost until the end about whether the fact that it seemed that every last thing had been thought about, was intentional and genius to the extreme, or just pleasant coincidence. Indeed, some viewers, who would approach this film without an ability or desire to appreciate the intentionality of every last detail, would be forgiven their opinion of the film as boring and slow. Nevertheless, Drive is a masterpiece.Reminiscent of the lone cowboy films of the mid century and later, Refn's modern take on the theme, is a beautifully portrayed artwork with a neo-noir feeling to it. The excellent cinematography, lighting design, sound design, and art design, all led masterfully by the direction of Nicolas Winding Refn, make this film one of the most multi-sensorily absorbing and satisfying feasts you would get a chance to experience. The tension is artfully built and maintained, and released in sudden bursts, in gorgeously choreographed high intensity scenes. But what I, personally, cherished the most in this film, was how it has a multitude of layers, which are skillfully peeled back by the director as the film progresses, all the while being stunningly underpinned by Ryan Gosling's powerful performance. Refn has always had a penchant for working with method actors, with Tom Hardy in Bronson, and Mads Mikkelson in Valhalla Rising standing testament to that fact; and Gosling is no different. He portrays the dichotomy of the strong but silent, ruthless but caring, powerful but gentle, and criminal but good-hearted lead character adroitly. Carey Mulligan, does a wonderful job portraying his sweet, timid, and lovely opposite number. With a support cast, including Mulligan, of Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman, the film is carried on able shoulders.What impressed me the most was the sophisticatedly evolved level of restraint in storytelling, which enhances the film by understanding that what is excluded is equally important to the storytelling method, as what is included. Every character has been fleshed out to a fault, and the viewer is navigated on a journey through the complex web of motivations and decisions of every one of them. The viewer is made to constantly engage with each character as a result, and update his/her opinion on them with every passing scene in an attempt to understand them correctly. The film treads the fine line of the moral grey area with ease, where the viewer ends up rooting for the enigmatically complex lead character, despite him showcasing bouts of extreme violence.A rivetting lead performance by Ryan Gosling, and an artistically talented and skillful film-making crew ensure an instant cult classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive review,"Drive is a rare film that succeeds in all levels such as, character, costume, and cinematography, coupled with great directing by Nicholas.

I loved everything about this movie. There are a number of scenes which require you to squirm.What this movie lacks in dialogue, it makes up for it with sheer style. Think less is more. It takes a superb director to pull off a movie like this. What a great job. You really need to give it your full attention as every scene is worthy of your appreciation and understanding. The storyline in itself isn't that unique, but there's something about this one that really hooks you in. The soundtrack is very stylish too!!

Love the story.  Hate the violence and the vocab.,"I really wanted to like this movie and wanted to recommend it to others because the story and the actors are so great, but the violence and the vocab make it barely worth watching or sharing.I watched the DVD version and the TV version and neither works well. The violence in the TV version is still horrific and the dialogue given to cover the foul language is usually pathetic. Why not just write decent fierce vocabulary in the first place? Definitely appreciated that the edited TV version exists though. It would be great if all movies were readily available in their edited forms.The story of Drive is great though. If you love having someone to root for and hoping that the baddies get their comeuppance, then you find that here.Some complain about the pace of the film, that wasn't a problem. I understood and appreciated the artistic genre behind it. But intense stories have been successfully told and loved for centuries w/o the need for graphic violence or foulness. Those I'll watch and re-watch and recommend to everyone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
BRILLIANTLY CAPTIVATING! VIOLENTLY SEDUCTIVE! HAUNTINGLY ROMANTIC!,"(2011) FILM: ""DRIVE""
Director: Nicolas Winding Refn
Lead Actors: Ryan Gosling/Bryan Cranston 
Any genuine film buff like myself would sadly agree that looking back (2011) was absolutely a horrendous year for the film industry. Only director Nicolas Refn's ""DRIVE"" and Gavin O'Connor's spellbinding attraction ""WARRIOR"" were even worthy of ""BEST PICTURE"" and both of them were disgracefully snubbed by the 83rd Annual Academy Awards. The unconventionally chaotic (2011) film ""DRIVE"" is a cinematic masterpiece that's absolutely astonishing frame to frame. Director Refn's unforgettable epic drama pushes all the right buttons and with the exceptionally soothing trance-like musical score, polarizing imagery and mesmerizing blend of attitude and violence it successfully finds its way onto my remarkably distinguished list of ""TOP 20 MUST SEE FILMS BEFORE YOU DIE.""
Ryan Gosling's riveting performance as a mysteriously obscure Hollywood stunt driver is slickly enchanting and even though the character himself is a man with very little to say, his actions speak immensely louder than his words as he magnificently delivers one of the most remarkably rewarding and uncommonly intense vengeance sequences of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Nice presentation yet it lacks a big deal,"The story is nice and intriguing. There's not much of the classic heist crime movie being done well in recent years. Al though I should also say that after the great initial thriller sequence, the movie kind of pace down very much drastically. The entire pace of the movie kind of walks in that way, disorderly switches from fast to slow to fast to slow again. The soundtrack manages to make this movie a one of a kind. It can emphasize the other aspects capable of being of interest such as the artsy lonesome indie movie feel, I like how Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan acted here. They can withhold the overall calm, not so much into talking feel for their entire performance.

A magnificent masterpiece,"A perfect motion picture. It's not about a serial killer, it's about a mysterious man who gets involved into a crime that makes him to a (very brutal) serial killer. This guy seems abstracted, somewhat even retarded, but Ryan Gosling plays him condignly human. These moments when he stares into blankness are stunning, just because of the beautiful cinematography and the awesome soundtrack (this is one of the best movie scores of all time, for what it's worth). Drive captivates you ab initio and doesn't even stop after the movie is finished. It makes you think about beguilement and the craziness of people and that gets exhibited radically explicit. But on the other hand the movie isn't specialized on character sketches or telling long rigmaroles, it only shows you what is absolutely necessary. Oscar nominations for cinematography, production design, score, original song and maybe also editing would have been just. And not to forget the acting, which is also great and absolutely fits the film. I personally love Drive and I can't find anything that disappoints me with this movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The best 80s flick from 2011.,"Drive is the best 80s movie released in 2011, and I include the remakes of 80s films Fright Night and Footloose (which I have not and will not ever see). From the cheesy opening titles to the uber-serious pop that dominates the background of several 'drivin' and thinking'' montages, Drive is an 80s throwback all the way. I'm actually amazed the film didn't end on a freeze frame high 5 (if that isn't a special feature on the DVD they missed a golden opportunity).Hell, even the unnamed Driver (Ryan Gosling) spends the entire film dressed as either the Marlboro Man on his day off or an onlooker at a break dancing exhibition, with a haircut so sharp it must always be school photo day to him.'Driver' is a bit of a dabbler, he spends part of his time as a Hollywood stunt driver, part as a gun mechanic and part as a 'no questions asked' courier, where his only rules are essentially be prompt and don't keep me waiting.Driver is an odd type, he seems dispassionate and removed, and operates in a clinical manner. In the getaway that opens the film his car is pursued from the get go, but he doesn't just blast away 2 Furiously with his pedal to the metal, he nurses his car along until the Need for Speed arises, then Top Guns it until he loses the tail, before promptly vanishing as just another in a crowd.Driver is 'managed' by the enterprising yet slightly pathetic Shannon, a man who openly acknowledges that he is short changing him considering his immense talents, and a man who sees bigger things on the horizon in the form of Nascar racing. But he doesn't have the funds to start a team, which necessitates the need for a meeting with Small Time Crime figures of Bernie (Albert Brooks playing against type) and Nino (Ron Perlman playing exactly to type). They green light the project and get to constructing a car to be piloted to victory by their protégé, who, like Rain Man is possibly an idiot savant and really is an excellent driver It was at this point I was sure it would be just another fast racing movie with a mildly retarded guy behind the wheel to root for, like that Sylvester Stallone movie a few years back.But that all changes – sort of – when he meets a young woman Irene and her 5 year old son Benicio. Irene is a single mum of sorts (as her hubby is in prison) that lives two doors down in Driver's apartment building, and the two strike up an 80s friendship with the boy Benicio taking a special shine to this new Father figure. When Irene's husband Standard is released from prison and moves back home the dynamic changes, but never Driver's expression or demeanour.It soon comes to light that Standard hasn't left all of his problems behind him, and fearing for the safety of Irene and Benicio Driver volunteers to help.There are consequences for all Drive is not the best film this year, and despite the undeniable 80s flavour that permeates proceedings it is one of the more original and different films that you will see this year. I can certainly see how it has both struck a chord with critics and conversely why the mainstream have stayed away. Fans of The Notebook (including my wife) won't find much joy here.The director Nicolas Winding Refn is a creator of offbeat uncompromising cinema with a decidedly non-mainstream bent, in only the last few years he has made two of the more striking and non-conformist films that I have seen in Bronson and Valhalla Rising. Both were at times difficult to watch but impossible to switch off, and both remained with me for a long time after I saw them.Drive is slightly more accessible than the aforementioned – with the smouldering Gosling no doubt helping the marketing somewhat – but Refn has become notorious for the violence in his films and while this film starts a little sedately he certainly indulges himself more than a few times in the second half of the film, leading to my wife watching as much of my armpit as she did the film for a while.I can't recommend Drive to everyone, the violence is too sudden and realistic for many and the pace too deliberate and unexciting for others, however I think fans of modern era David Cronenberg will find much to admire with this film. While I can appreciate the ferocious originality and vision of Bronson and Valhalla Rising I think Drive represents a decent compromise for director Refn, if he decides to work this niche for a few more films I will definitely go along for the journey.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Not always easy to watch but certainly one of the more singularly powerful films of the decade so far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It was like gravity was pulling me towards the ground. Thats when I saw Ryan Goslings face look right at me through the screen.A bright beam of light started to pour out of Goslings mouth and engulfed my entire body. The energy was overwhelming. My eyes saw time-streams and dimensions that no mortal had ever seen. I saw infinite choices, millions of ways the world could turn. Some of the visions I saw were prosperous and society grew more and more powerful... other visions were of chaos.The entire theatre around me was engulfed in bright fire and their faces all melted around me.

"Dark, hypnotic thriller","This is a film that pretty much screams ""cult movie"". It tells the story of a mechanic / movie stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver. Soon his quiet, ordered life is thrown into chaos when he is pitted against the mob to protect his neighbour and her young son.This is a quiet sedate film, that ratchets up to full gear with sudden, shocking bursts of violence, accompanied by a pulsating electronic score. Ryan Gosling turns in an iconic performance as the mysterious unnamed Driver, although Carey Mulligan is kind of wasted in her role as the struggling young mother. The style of the film harms back to the neon drenched 1980s action films, but the story-line harks back even further, and can be seen as an updating and relocation of the classic Western with Ryan Gosling as the Clint Eastwood Man With No Name.Some viewers may be put off by the slow pace of much of the film, and the graphic violence, but if you are willing to go along with it, it's a striking experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
El fetiche del Anti-héroe,"De acuerdo a las palabras del mismo Refn, Drive está abordada como un cuento de hadas, siendo el conductor el príncipe azul e Irene la princesa en apuros que espera a que el primero venga y la rescate para hacerla feliz para siempre. Por supuesto que es un cuento de hadas, pero la visión es del príncipe, o más bien, del hombre hipermasculinizado que utiliza la violencia para resolver sus problemas pero que aun así tiene sentimientos. Qué lindo suena. O más bien no, es de hecho, Refn diciéndonos lo idealizado que está este arquetipo, el conocido meme del nerd pensando para sí mismo ""es idéntico a mí "" frente a personajes como el Conductor (o básicamente cualquier personaje interpretado por Gosling), y de como lo utiliza para mostrarnos su visión del mundo, un lugar lleno de violencia y donde la comunicación no siempre es con palabras. Drive resulta ser la cuasi obra culmine del danés Nicolas Winding Refn, una obra repleta de violencia, ritmo lento, diálogos concisos y sesgados, y principalmente, ésta idealización y admiración que parece tener Refn por el lobo solitario, el anti-héroe que los hombres desean ser y el que los hombres creen que las mujeres desean tener. Porque de eso trata al final, de éste fetiche que tienen los hombres con ser capaces de salvar a una mujer en apuros, de enfrentarse a un villano imponente y salir victorioso, pero aún así, seguir solo. Ese héroe inalcanzable tanto por hombres como mujeres. Y por qué con el anti-héroe, porque sólo el puede ser tan violento como a Refn le gusta.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Beautiful, but shallow","I didn't know much about Drive before I watched it, other than it had been acclaimed in Cannes and that it was one of the iconic roles played by Ryan Gosling, one that is very often mentioned when talking about this actor.Now I've seen the movie, I've enjoyed it, but I don't think it's going to stay with me very long. There was nothing in it that would make it memorable to me.I'm not going to deny Nicolas Winding Refn his Best Director Award. The direction is certainly exemplary. There isn't one shot of this movie that doesn't look good.Drive is, in fact, a very ""artistic"" movie (as opposed to a ""commercial"" one, if these distinctions mean anything). It has a dreamy soundtrack, stylish and moody lighting, a slow beginning, long shots, few dialog.

"A really good drama, but too slow to fully enjoy it and with a misleading trailer","The way I learned about this film is quite strange: a video about trailers which are completely different from the films they advertise, and this was the absolutely worst case; in fact the guy who did this video explained the trailer of this movie was 3 minutes of Ryan Gosling killing everyone in a cool way. And I'm a person who gets easily influenced by trailers. Therefore I decided not to watch the trailer, to avoid expecting something different, and I watched the movie without knowing anything. The 3 minutes of Gosling beating the hell out of everyone in the trailer are actually the 3 total minutes of Gosling beating everyone condensed, and in reality the first part of this movie is really slow, so I couldn't get fully involved, but I still think it was a really good drama with some really interesting parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazing movie,"I'm not the biggest fan of Ryan gosling, but this gave me a whole different perspective. This movie is about a stunt driver for movies but also drives for runaway criminals while also finding love. This movie has the perfect amount of gore, swears and it has booba, what more could you ask for!?I wouldn't recommend this movie for people under the age of 13, it does have nudity but not a lot. This movie is also great for people who like John wick or hit man or other movies like those, this movie is an action packed joyride of excitement, drama and other good things, the only thing I didn't like about the movie is the long pauses between each sentence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Stuck in second gear,"I am always suspicious of movies with nameless characters. It seems an unnecessary contrivance. Unfortunately, ""Drive"" proves no exception, by adding this annoying detail to a slightly schizophrenic plot. Our anonymous hero, played by Gosling, is a stuntman by day and a driver of heist cars by night. Complications ensue when he falls for his neighbor Irene, a young mother with a criminal husband.Our driving hero is moved by love into protecting Irene and her child, so he gets involved into a spiral of violence. At this stage ""Drive"" could have taken a turn as a romantic movie or taken the pulp fiction route. Unfortunately, it does not develop fully in either direction.The romancing angle is played subtly and delicately. After having watched a couple of Gosling's movies and disliked him intensely, I actually liked him for the first time. He plays remarkably well the star-crossed lover.The violent part is an unbelievable mess. Turns out that there is only one criminal organization in all L.A. and all our characters are mixed up with it. The gentle driver turns into a bloodthirsty creature and physical elimination of all members of the cast ensues – needless to say, in the most graphic manner. Of the seven main characters (+child) only two make it to the end of the movie. Not difficult to guess who; however, do not expect a ""happy ending"".Besides the above mentioned ""split-personality"", ""Drive"" suffers from other problems:1. Our driving hero is a bland cypher, a mildly likable guy, not a super-cool hero of Steve McQueen proportions. His long silences and mysterious aura are just annoying2. The plot moves at snail's pace. Although I am not a fan of fast editing and deafening soundtracks, here we are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Long silences, pauses and minimal dialogs sold for ""intensity""3. The soundtrack is abominable. A mood-destroying collection of easily forgettable, third-rate songs. I sorely missed the witty dialogs and the brilliant score of Tarantino's movies4. Finally, ""Drive"" takes itself very, very seriously, so forget fun.Sometimes when I watch a movie like this I wonder if it is the same one so many critics are raving about. How many movies titled ""Drive"" starring Ryan Goslings are currently out there? Because for sure, the one I watched does not seem to deserve much praise. Not bad, but a masterpiece it ain't.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Already a Classic,"Golsing is outstanding. The soundtrack takes you over. The love interest is subtle yet powerful. The editing also adds to the experience.I knew Gosling was meant for greatness.I first saw him in the doll and the addict teacher movies, and thought he had some great presence. It was just a shame these films weren't for a wider audience. I hope Drive gives him that deserved recognition.Carey Mulligan was also very restrained in her role. It complemented perfectly with Gosling's character.The car sounds were also highly engaging. Reminded me of Ronin with De Niro.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Stunning Movie,"Drive is a stunning movie. It is violent, action packed and has a quality of depth to it that makes it unique and engaging. Ryan Gosling is superb. He plays a man that is disconnected, who involves himself in things above and beyond what is necessary. An intriguing character who we know very little about, save his willingness to live on the edge of control. Ryan is the main man but the supporting cast all deliver excellent performances that make this movie a cult classic. For me, Albert Brooks is absolutely standout - his no frills portrayal of an unassuming criminal controller is raw and hard hitting. There is an intensity and unconventional quality to his performance that makes it sobering and real. There are vital visual moments that coincide with a fitting soundtrack to make this movie, quite frankly, unforgettable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Full-speed existentialism,"The Driver (Ryan Gosling), it shall be noted, drives. Doesn't matter what for, what the odds are, if it's immoral or illegal, it's what he does. Perhaps that's a metaphor for his life, where he sees himself with one purpose and an incentive to be the very best at his vocation. We're led to believe that he exists to drive.He seems to split his time into three jobs: Hollywood stuntman, mechanic, and getaway car driver. One pays better than the others. He works with people with whom he's had little to no prior contact, and he has some rules. He gets his way, because he truly is a terrific driver with pinpoint reflexes. He says little, listens much, and does his job. Sort of the perfect employee, except for the times when one of his little rules is violated. But if they aren't, he will deliver your package on time.The Driver's life experiences no real bumps until he meets one of his neighbors, Irene (Carey Mulligan), who's apparently a single mom/waitress. They become friends, but nothing more. He helps her when her car breaks down, and she - what luck! - brings it to the garage where he and his boss Shannon (Bryan Cranston) work. Irene confesses that she's not single; her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is in jail for reasons unknown. It is giving nothing away to mention that in short time Standard is released and confronts The Driver. But then they become friends, because why not? The Driver likes Irene, and she digs him, as does her kid, but he intuits that Standard, although full of bluster and machismo and probably running with the wrong people, isn't a terrible person. The Driver has no real need to rescue Irene. But, as he quickly learns, Standard does need to be rescued.It appears that The Driver does more than just drive. He cares. He's deadly with his hands and other objects. He can break into cars and elude police. He's tough but reticent. Very reticent, willing to let others dig their own holes before he dives in. He acts without telegraphing his move to everyone, particularly the audience. He's still wildly existential, but now it seems he exists as a man playing by rules of which only he is truly aware.Gosling is really something. Rather than giving us the impression that, because of his silence, he is dim witted or vulnerable, he shows us that there is much beneath his handsome exterior. We never know his motives other than a desire to help Irene, Standard, and their little boy - in fact, that motive alone seems to a new one on The Driver himself. Does it enrich him? Yes, but only because he mentions it himself; otherwise, he's the same cipher he's always been. Gosling's Driver isn't just a blank-faced object of desire; one can tell he's thinking about something, forming a plan, keeping it hidden deep within. I kind of wish he'd garnered an Oscar nom out of this performance.But he's not alone. Mulligan is excellent as the haunted, torn Irene - much better than she was in the ill-fated Shame from last year or even from An Education. She's sweet and cute but not naive and not the proverbial sex bomb. Cranston and Ron Perlman have showy roles as good and bad guys. But stealing the show - almost the entire movie - is Albert Brooks, yes, the comedian who has dabbled in dramatic acting in the past, who is unbelievable as Cranston's mob contact. He's terrifying but methodical, a horrifying combination if ever there was one.Drive is a work of art in many ways. It's meticulously edited by Mat Newman, and the sound is blended perfectly by the team of Lon Bender and Victor Ray Ennis, with the latter two earning Oscar nominations for themselves. Nicholas Winding Refn's direction is crisp, unyielding, confrontational, and engaging, particularly for one's first Big Movie.There's much to like in Drive if you're a fan of adrenaline-enhanced experiences that don't bludgeon you with CGI and other fakery. The level of realism is just right, both in the action scenes and in the person- to-person scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Absolute Perfection!,"Drive is what all other movies should strive to be. A movie like this reminded me that Hollywood still does make good films. This film is about a Driver, simply known and credited as 'The Driver,' that is a stunt driver by day and a getaway driver for hire by night. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but I didn't know he had it in him to be this kind of lover/friend/maniac. That is, what I feel, is the jist of this film, regardless of a plot or a love story, is the overall driven emotion Ryan Gosling has for every person he interacts with. Whether its the friendship he has with his boss, played wonderfully by Bryan Cranston. Or whether its the budding romance developing with his neighbor (Carey Mulligan). Or finally, the violent, maniacal man that interacts and swiftly responds to the perceived threats of danger he or any of his friends or loved ones encounter. The Driver isn't just a driver, he is every emotion that has ever existed to every extreme you could possibly imagine, played PERFECTLY by Ryan Gosling. I hope he isn't ignored again this year by the Academy, because its about time this man receives an award for making every film he stars in shine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good movie, not a great movie","I liked ""Drive"", it was well written and had a good amount of emotional weight and action. While not showing a lot of emotion, we started to understand the Driver character, but not empathize with him. He is obviously very violent, but thats the world he is part of. The car chases are good, but not overbearing in the scheme of the film. I was expecting a stellar movie, and I wasn't disappointed; just not floored.If you would like to see a tense crime thriller with emotionally complex characters, go see ""Collateral"" or the masterful ""Heat"". ""Heat"" is a great movie, ""Drive"" is a good movie, and no sane person would disagree with that distinction, star power not withstanding. I liked it and recommended ""Drive"", but it isn't amazing as some people have said. Go see a few more movies, and then we'll talk. Sorry.Last thing I have to comment on is the song selection. Not music, that's fine; but the songs. They are absolutely terrible, end of story. You can make it '80's noir without the stupid pop from the same decade. The songs felt out of place, and too warm n fuzzy. How about something more somber and introspective? Something that reinforces the mood, not distracts. I was distracted by the songs, and they made the movie just feel ""okay"" rather than a truly polished gem.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Transformations,"DRIVE is a fascinating character study, one that uses a minimum of words to define a complex character in a manner than seems terrifyingly quiet and mesmerizing. Based on a book written by James Sallis the screenplay is the minimalist yet secure writing of Iranian writer Hossein Amini (Wings of the Dove, The Four Feathers, Jude, Shanghai, Kill Shot, etc). Nicolas Winding Refn is the sensitive director who takes advantage of the pauses in the storyline, allowing cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel to bring this mysterious story to life.An unnamed young man referred to as Driver (Ryan Gosling) is a loner, holding down several jobs as a Hollywood stunt driver, a garage mechanic, and a getaway driver who participates in robberies as a silent, by his own rules driver. He works for garage owner, the crippled Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who in turn works for criminals Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman). Driver meets his apartment house neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos) and while there seems to be a chemistry quietly building between them, Driver is told that Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) has been in prison and will be coming home soon. Driver, Irene and Benicio bond and when Standard is finally released from prison Driver learns that Standard owes a huge protection debt and to befriend the only people about whom Driver cares, he agrees to help in a getaway car that turns very wrong. From this point the normally gentle and quiet driver transforms into a brutal man and the rest of the film is full of terror.Ryan Gosling is splendid in his role as the driver, saying more with his eyes and his body language and his silences than many actors say with a full script. Carey Mulligan is likewise strong and the supporting roles by Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks, James Biberi and even Russ Tamblyn (!) are superlative cameos. This is a tough film, full of graphic violence, but it is such a unique story and is so well acted and directed that it is one of the year's most surprising quality movies.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An interesting ride,"I have to say that I was surprised at what Drive turned out to be (but pleasantly so). I didn't know much about it. Driver. Bank robber. Stuntman. That was basically the premise - not that original, but well done and suitably different to be very watchable.First of all, don't expect wall to wall action. The action is subtle and certainly not the central focus (Transformers 3, it is not). And there is violence. Not a lot, but when it happens, it does hit you.The thing you have to know about Drive is that it is SLOW. That may sound like the wrong word to use to describe a film that uses fast cars as a main element to it. However, it's not the car chases that are slow, it's the dialogue. No one says that much. Words are replaced by looks and some slightly obscure shots (any more and it may almost be considered 'art house.' If you've seen David Lynch's 'Lost Highway,' I couldn't help but draw comparisons. Drive has a very similar look and feel to it (minus the supernatural element).If you're looking for fast paced action and snappy dialogue, you probably won't like this film. However, if you're in the mood for something a little different with underplayed performances, interspersed with some violence and car chases, then give it a go.A pleasant surprise.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Horribly overrated.,"One of the worst movies i have ever watched.Awkward awkward dialog. There are 30 second pauses before and after every line from Ryan gosling.

No don't worry. it's just the ""arthouse"" effect.no chemistry between anyone in the film. storyline is mediocre at best.the only reason you would enjoy this film is if you are a pretentious enough critic that you can get by via the nice soundtrack. oh and some nice camera work. But yes. lets all go spend 2 hours to admire camera work. if this movie was rated 6 then i wouldn't be so irritated, but giving it a 8 because it has 1 or 2 nice qualities? i really want my 2 hours back that i lost because i let the hipsters on IMDb fool me into watching this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A cool masterpiece,"This movie from 2011 directed by Nicolas Winding Refn is one of the coolest movies ever made. The story about a stunt driver who fights for a lonely mother doesn't sounds great but it's not the story which makes the film so cool it's the style from ""Drive"". In all the movie has the spirit of a 80's movie: a wonderful electronic soundtrack, a cool main character and in view of the ""Driver"" a extraordinary clothing style. But thats not all! Ryan Gosling doesn't only play the ""Driver"". He is the ""Driver"". But also the other actors in supporting roles like Carey Mulligan, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks play very well. It's good that Nicolas Winding Refn had the courage to make this movie. I think this is a movie for everyone who wants to see a different type of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Refn does it again PLUS we get best Michael Mann film in 16 years,"""DRIVE""Want to see the film that Michael Mann should have made between ""Thief"" and ""Manhunter"" instead of the mess that was ""The Keep""? Well here it is.After the triumph of ""Bronson"", and the at least interesting and delightfully brutal ""Valhalla Rising"", Nicholas Winding Refn delivers this astonishing modern 80's throwback that delivers absolutely everything you could hope for.Anyone who has seen ""Thief"" will recognise the night time cityscape stylistic flourishes and cool, smooth take on the old 'honourable man on the wrong side of the law' plot and anyone who has seen ""Manhunter"" will recognise the laid back, dream-like, constantly backed by ethereal synth, dialogue exchanges. Exchanges made so compelling, even when dialogue is minimal, by the acting and that perfect synth accompaniment, that the slowish build-up becomes a dramatic triumph in of itself. So much is owed to, and hinges on, this score and its use.The modern but throwback electro songs and 'Tangerine Dream"" style original score by Cliff Martinez (and pink, neon, silk on steel, title graphic and opening credits) all scream prime era Michael Mann too. This is not only a stunning movie in it's own, 21st century, right but the best Michael Mann film not made by Michael Mann in 16 years.That's not to say that Refn's own mastery of the art is not in evidence, or to say that it is anything but (well perhaps along with Gasper Noe) Refn's own lashings of astonishingly brutal and graphic violence on display that superbly punctuate this, what he himself has called, urban fairytale. Nor is it without note that this is very much another Refn study of a singular, driven, coldly brutal at times, man living in an unforgiving world. But, and despite traces of Melville and 70's U.S. crime films, at its heart ""Drive"" is without doubt the offspring of 80's Michael Mann.Ryan Gosling gives a fascinating, multi-layed, performance of a fascinating, multi-layered character (known only as Driver) who is the chivalrous knight one moment, and the gore drenched barbarian the next. One can not exist without the other in this man's world...not if the pure princess and her innocent child are to be saved.The support cast is also superb with an almost unrecognisable (who stole his eyebrows?!) Albert Brooks as a measured but ruthless crime boss, Bryan Cranston as Driver's friend, Ron Pearlman as a thick-headed, uncompromising heavy and Carey Mulligan does a beautiful job as the barely reachable purity in Driver's life, who belongs to another.Poignant drama, multi layered characters, simple but clever plotting, excellent (and excellently utilised) synth soundtrack, gorgeous cinematography, crisp nighttime city dreamscapes, exciting and unapologetically cool car sequences, superb acting and truly brutal and gory action are the gift to the audience...and the pitch perfect 80's/Michael Mann thriller stylings are the its wrappings, all brilliantly crafted by writer Hossein Amini and director Nicholas Winding Refn.One of the best films of the decade at the very least and an essential purchase.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Stylish, Tense and Thrilling","I walked into this movie expecting a typical ""Fast and Furious"" no-brainer. I was caught off-guard and was completely mesmerized by the pace, the suspense, and the European-style direction. The minimalist dialogue and the ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" violence knocked my socks off. Ryan Gosling plays the lead as a conflicted, tortured, possibly Aspergian protagonist who falls for his neighbor, but resorts to extreme violence when he feels threatened. The only caveat is that Carey Mulligan is under-used. She is a terrific actress and her few scenes are powerful and wrenching,Albert Brooks is a revelation. Remember him in Broadcast News? Lost In America? Mother? This is a whole different actor. He's menacing and terrifying and may be getting an Oscar for this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Most Must See Movie,"If someone asks me ""What are the movies I have to watch?"", with no doubt and definitely I recommend this, Drive. This is a masterpiece which fights for 2nd or 1st place in the films I've ever watched.This is a crime movie. Gosling acts a man called Driver who is in daytime a stuntman and in night a driver preparing a getaway for criminals. He meets Irene,a young woman and a neighbor, and as the relationship with her becomes deeper, he gradually involves in a big trouble.With  its visually and violently beautiful directions,the atmosphere of this movie becomes unutterably brilliant. That's why I do love this movie. From beginning to end everything is cool. Music is marvelous. All songs used in this movie aren't loud but quiet and softly make a moving impression. For the first time,I bought a soundtrack involuntarily. Especially, I'm fond of ""A Real Hero"".Camera-work is skillful.  The scene of city from the night sky is a good example. Tone mainly using orange and picture using light and shade are admirably beautiful.There're many violent scenes. Some people say it's too much but for me, it's not. They're stylish and  gap between quiet atmosphere of this movie fascinates me.Most of all, actors are magnificent. Among other things Gosling's performance is perfect. I'm  wondering why didn't be nominated for Oscar. He doesn't have much lines but  his face deliberates feelings like anger or sadness. I am amazed by this. Through this movie, I became a big fan of him. I went to watch ""A Gangster Squad"" and ""The Place Beyond the Pines"", which both of them are good movies.Other actors are also excellent. Perlman and Brooks's way of acting villains are great. And Isacs's character  he's a bad guy and  I don't know why but I can't dislike him. I think perhaps it's because of his ability of acting. Cranston's atmosphere which is attractive and elegant is exquisite. For example, the scene he introduce driver to Irene is one of my favorite scenes. What should not be forgotten is Mulligan's acting as men want to protect her.I think it's the story of angry man. Usually driver is taciturn and lonely but after meeting Irene, he starts to change and decides to fight for her and Benicia's happiness.I like the scene driver drives with them while the sun is setting in. ""A Real Hero"" the song I said before is playing in this scene. Beautiful. I also like the scene in the elevator driver kisses Irene and beats a pawn.Most of all,last scene is stunning. After watching, lingering sensation came up and I felt goosebumps break out and couldn't do anything for a while. Impressed by image of driver, I almost moved to tears. This movie tells me about protecting loving person.Brutal but beautiful. Violent but quiet. Don't miss this outstanding crime movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Digging everything about it except the soundtrack which is abominable.,"Love how the mystery and suspense subtlety build up but the mood is shredded every time it degenerates into a music video with the worst '80's ballads that had the decency not to be written in the '80's. I can't remember really liking a film only to get continually whip lashed out of it by inserted songs. Well, speaking of the 80's, there was the overrated ""9 1/2 Weeks"" with that song ""You can leave your hat on"" by who cares, suffocate me in cheese wiz. I can only conclude that this music is the result of inbred nepotism. It's so bad I had to stop watching just to write this review. OK, going back and hoping the music director was fired at the point I paused.Can't vote yet but if it goes where it feels it is, might be a 7 or 8, if the music doesn't make me indifferent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very cool movie,"It's unfortunate, but it seems that despite this film's deservedly high ratings on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, the raving action junkies have come out of the wood work to scream at this film and all who liked it. Any page that you may find concerning Drive most likely will be filled to the brim with messages along the lines of, ""They talked too much! There weren't a lot of car chases and explosions! Why wasn't this movie dumb and actiony like I wanted it to be!?"" The problem seems to be that nobody knew that this was NOT Fast and Furious 6 being released simultaneously with Fast 5, and thus nobody was prepared for a beautifly filmed throwback to 80s noir films. Luckily I actually read a review of this film before going, and so I had the advantage of being informed of just what I was in for. The other two people that I went with were not, and though they didn't hate it, they were surprised.If only more people looked into the movie before hand. But then again, I would have liked this movie anyway. It was very intense and successfully channeled a bit of Quentin Tarantino's style. Everything that these people bashed the film for, like Gosling's character being predominantly silent and wearing a satin scorpion jacket and the soundtrack consisting of cheesy 80s pop, were exactly what made the movie great for me. It was slow to begin with, but knowing that it would pay off (and it DID) made it all the more tense during the first act.I highly recommend this movie, just as long as it is clear to you that it is not all about car chases, and that is not what you are expecting. The title refers more to the character's emotional drive, if you get what I mean.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
HK Neo Reviews: Drive,"The only reason I watched this film at the cinemas, is because it won Best Director at my favourite film festival at Cannes. In fact, Drive is by no means an outright good film, as the opening 20 minutes is quite simply a bore fest. Fortunately, this is the kind of film that finishes strongly and even saying that, this is clearly an understatement. Drive finished with a blast of a big bang! Ryan Gosling is one of the best and versatile actors in Hollywood today and once again he does not disappoint. In the role of a soul-less driver who simply drives for a living, Gosling is able to portray a character in a middle of a dilemma when he meets next-door neighbour, played by the uniquely talented face of Carey Mulligan. The film really do pick up from the 30 minute mark and never stops from there. The killings and bloodbath goes from soft-core to eventually hardcore. The scene at the lifts, allows Gosling to release his emotions by continuously bashing the victim with great effect. All in all, Drive may not be worthy of the hype nor the Cannes Award, but it is certainly without doubt, one of the strangest, unique, yet good movie experience of the year. In fact, if you can get past the opening bore-fest, you will be pleasantly rewardedNeo rates it 7.5/10.www.thehkneo.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Beautiful, visually stunning, romantic, suspenseful, thrilling, tragic - a masterpiece","""Drive,"" directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and starring Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite films. I've seen this movie more times than I can count, and every time I find something new to appreciate, admire, and fall in love with.""Drive"" is, at its core, an action film - but it's also so much more than that. The movie follows Ryan Gosling's character, a nameless loner who works as a Hollywood stunt driver by day, and a getaway driver for criminals by night. After a particularly thrilling job that is followed in the absolutely riveting five minute opening sequence, Driver notices his apartment neighbor, Irene, played by Carey Mulligan. The movie continues, building up their relationship, and the wrench that is thrown in it when her husband, Standard, gets released from prison. Sound like a plot you've seen done before? Maybe, but never done like this.Nicolas Winding Refn truly directed one of the most dramatic, romantic, and tragic thrillers ever made; the opening scene alone is five minutes of pure tension, coupled perfectly with the nighttime visuals and euphoric score by Cliff Martinez - and the movie only gets better from there. Refn steeps this movie in cinematic fantasy - the bright, divine lighting that casts a heavenly glow over many sequences; the score that permeates through every scene; the long takes and deliberate editing style - the movie truly feels like a hypnotic dream, each piece of Refn's puzzle combing perfectly to draw you in it. This is an arthouse movie, but one that stays plot focused, using the surrealistic cinematic style to enhance the story.This movie has some of the most romantic scenes ever put to film - watching the Driver and Irene's relationship build through subtle facial expressions and wide smiles is so sweet and heartwarming, making the inevitable violence all the more tragic. After all, ""Drive"" is an action film, but its strong focus on character only elevates the action, adding an emotional resonance that hits and sticks with viewers. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan were incredible here. Carey Mulligan is not only gorgeous, but plays the role of a woman slowly and clearly falling in love to perfection. So much is said between these two characters through facial expressions and actions rather than dialogue - ""Drive"" is the premier example of show, don't tell. You don't need them to express their feelings for each other through words because their actions toward each other tell you all you need to know, and frankly, it's beautiful. I mean seriously, this is one of the best romance movies ever made, and it's not even a romance movie.When ""Drive"" turns into the action movie it is, it is thrilling and tragic. You almost don't want to see the action take place because of how sweet the romance is, but when the action does happen, you can't take your eyes off the screen. Refn frames everything perfectly, making horrific violence look gorgeous to watch. Yes, ""Drive"" is an incredibly violent film, but the violence isn't frequent, and doesn't linger, and most importantly, move the plot forward. Take, for example, a scene where Driver fights a man in an elevator - this scene conveys so much emotion, so much character information, and not a single word of dialogue is spoken. Ryan Gosling has such a unique and expressive face, and you can sense Driver's fear, panic, rage, sadness, love, all through Ryan's expresions. It's masterful acting.Refn chooses style over substance here, and it works marvelously. Refn's gorgeous directing style combined with the fantastic acting and the beautiful music melds together perfectly, making ""Drive"" an emotional experience from start to finish. Nicolas Winding Refn truly crafted a masterpiece here, and if you've never seen this movie, I urge you to give it a shot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I feel very lonely,"After watching this God-awful movie, and reading the rave reviews it received from critics and movie goers alike, I'm feeling very lonely.I had no idea while I was watching it that it was a Cannes Film Festival favorite and was up for over 80 awards.I thought I was watching a trashy mindless grade D movie, with almost no redeeming qualities. I still do!Incredibly slow, pointlessly violent, with slow speaking, boring and completely unappealing and clichéd characters, and a story that is all over the place. Ryan Gosling somehow becomes a super hero about half way through the story, which seemed quite silly to me.And the music, incredibly inappropriate to the scenes, and as amateurishly applied as possible, rounded out this total disaster.I must live in a parallel universe with the people who liked this flick.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive is a fantastic experience that works in a visual and intellectual level,"So I had been highly anticipating this film ever since I saw stars from my two favorite current shows Mad Men and Breaking Bad. I was even more excited for it when I saw some of the reviews. I can definitely say that this is the stand-out film of the year and as of now the best.There can be good blockbusters, good action films, good mainstream films. Many films have proved that. But watching Drive really makes you wonder where real patience in films have gone. This is definitely not a crowd-pleaser, and as I heard people getting restless and start yawning in a movie theater I got a little upset. It just really got to me how restless people can be. The pace in the film was established from the start, so that throughout it remained consistent and flowed smoothly. In fact, this is probably one of the most quiet 'action' films I have ever seen, if not the quietest. The silence and the hypnotizing pace all works brilliantly, with the incredible synthetic soundtrack in the background. It all works because of the director. The screenplay is simple and great, but the director was the one who really gave the film a tone unlike any recent film I have seen. The basic vision and style he gave the film makes it work from start to finish, even some really incredible slow-motion scenes (coming from someone who hates slow-mo). He is helped by a brilliant cinematographer who captures some of the most memorable scenes in years.If anything, Drive should be analyzed from a technical stand-point because in that department is is incredible. Here the film has substance, but its style also becomes part of its substance. I don't want to discredit the performances though, which were all great. Bryan Cranston and Christina Hendricks really played to the most that they were given. Ryan Reynolds was able to play this character completely serious and completely sympathetic, and Mulligan was as charming as ever. I really can't see any other film being able to pull of the tone that this film gave, in that of a neo-noir and art-house film put together with a retro drama/action film. A stand-out, yet simple, film that really makes you wonder about the real ambition and respect that other films don't have.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A man of mystery in an aberration of LA,"This film resonated in my mind long after viewing it for the first time. At first I didn't know what to think of it. The plot is simplistic yet told in a way which is quite powerful. Through relentless violence and clever camera-work, the film perpetuates into new territory. The story was told in a way that seemed more like a fable than a realistic occurrence. It reminded me of a cocktail mix between Peter Yates' Bullit and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver. This cocktail may be hard for some to swallow. I, however, found it to be one of the best action flicks to come out in a long time. An art-house picture that packs a bloody punch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Does some things really well,"Let's start with what I thought this movie did very well. Its very well shot, the cinematography is great, the music choices and the synchronization with the film is excellent. Based on these things alone, I recall feeling like I was watching a really really well done music video, at certain moments. At times it feels like the movie goes a long time without dialogue, and music is playing, and there's slow mo, and interesting camera angles, the whole 9 yards. And it all looks and feels really great.But on the flip side, nothing else is really happening. Its a standard revenge story. For me personally I don't know if that's enough for me consider a movie great. The movie definitely leaves an impression though, which is more than a lot of movies these days, and that says something for the film. I liked it even though it felt like I didn't want to like it.

This is a very underrated gem and one of my favorite movies,"Drive (2011) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows an antisocial mechanic who is also an excellent driver. He is hired to be a driver and get his big shot at becoming professional when life takes him for a curve. His neighbor, who appears to be a single mother, needs some help with her car and life in general and the antisocial man is happy to help. However, when her husband returns from prison with a debt he owes that puts him and his family's life at risk, the driver may need to put his future on hold to help his neighbors now...This movie is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson) and stars Ryan Gosling (The Notebook), Ron Perlman (Hellboy), Carey Mulligan (Shame), Albert Brooks (Broadcast News), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) and Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi).This storyline is very entertaining to watch unfold and contains well written characters and a brilliant soundtrack. The acting, especially by Gosling, is out of this world and maybe his best work (yes, better than his Notebook performance). The cast chemistry was excellent throughout the film and the dialogue really tied the scenes together. The circumstances were very unique and the violence was sudden and intense. The ending felt realistic and the perfect way to end the movie.Overall this is a very underrated gem and one of my favorite movies. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Tarantino, Mann, and ostentatious 1980s references","The plot: A getaway driver gets involved in the lives of his next door neighbors, when they run afoul of mobsters.I'm a big fan of Refn's Pusher trilogy, but this film failed to live to the enormous hype. I'm a fan of minimalism, art house films, exploitation films, and electronic music, but there was something that was just off about this movie. To some extent, I think it's because it was constantly reminding me of Michael Mann and Quentin Tarantino.It was moody, atmospheric, and just as violent and nihilistic as I was expecting, given that it's a Refn movie. No complaints there. I was also impressed with how much Refn accomplished, given the minimalist style. There's very little dialogue, and almost none of it comes from the protagonist. He seems to communicate almost entirely through nonverbal cues. However, the story just didn't really grab me. It's easier for me to get behind a minimalist story like Halloween (disturbed man tries to kill his sister), Assault on Precinct 13 (crooks siege a precinct), or The Thing (monster hunts down researchers), because they're properly minimalist. John Carpenter knows how to prune down a script to just the barest essentials until there's absolutely nothing left but the high concept pitch he used to sell it. When it comes to Drive, it seems like Refn wants to have his cake and eat it, too. It's got complex neo-noir elements mixed in with the minimalist style, and I'm left wondering why he didn't just commit one way or the other.Maybe with repeat viewings I'll come to appreciate it like all the raving fans. As it stands, I liked it, but I don't think it was the best movie of all time. I don't even think it was Refn's best movie. The Pusher trilogy is what made me a Refn fan, and it seems as though he might be moving away from that style (inspired by Dogme 95).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Surface Level,Look- I liked this movie a lot but it felt very surface level and shallow.The plot was rather basic- a bunch of guys fighting over money and doing whatever it takes to get it.Also this movie is built on coincidences which makes it overall less compelling.I liked it a lot and the overall vibe of it was great but again- pretty basic in lots of aspects and rather shallow.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive on,"Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn's Bronson was an attempt to do something strange which came across as depressingly ordinary, whereas his latest – starring a stolid Ryan Gosling as the nameless ""Driver"", and Carey Mulligan as his angelic neighbour, Irene – seems to be something very ordinary made quite strange, mostly through the use of slo-mo in the emotional bits as much as the action.There isn't all that much action. Certainly very few car chases. When it hits, the violence hits hard, but it's all mired in long stretches punctuated by wordless glances, pregnant with nothing but beauty and elegant framing. It's like some crawling period drama for angrily repressive mechanics. Thankfully it is accompanied by Cliff Martinez's delicious ambient score, so you could just close your eyes.The plot is first-rate ""meh"": a one-last-job affair with sexless damsel-in-distress underclothes. The Driver gives his clients a strict five-minute window (the reason for which, even after he's explained it twice, is never entirely clear), before he bails out – but five minutes is all he needs. He doesn't carry a gun; he'd prefer to force-feed his enemies bullets.We know that Driver is our hero because he's the only man who doesn't shout all the time. Bernie (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman) are particularly perturbed. Their over-the-counter barneys are strongly reminiscent of those Grand Theft Auto cut scenes we tend to skip. In fact, the whole italicised neon credits thing and the 80s-esque synth score is pure Vice City, except without the fun.At least Mad Max had a reason to be mad. From where does Driver's psychotic streak stem? Valhalla Rising suggested that Refn positions man's capacity for violence somewhere deep in his soul, so I guess a backstory isn't necessary. Bryan Cranston puts on a good show as the half-crippled Shannon, who might as well have an enormous glowing target on his forehead.Comparisons with Michael Mann are inevitable, particularly the neo-noir nightmarescape of Manhunter, and the homoeroticism of Heat. Difference is, in both cases Mann was shooting a screenplay of quality and distinction. Drive, by comparison, is about as distinct as a cigarette flicked from a passing car.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"An effective, engaging and stylish neo-noir that uses stillness and sudden violence really well","I watched The American recently and I wasn't particularly taken by it. It tried to blend a standard thriller plot with a silent and arty reference to European cinema that just didn't really work. This came into my mind while watching Drive because, not only does it have a reference to a film being potentially called European, but it also manages to deliver an effective thriller within the skin of a 1980's modern crime noir skin. We join the action at the start where everything from the character's jacket, the theme music and even the typography and colour of the credits sets us in one of these films and it is a style that really sets the tone for the film.The style is important because a lot of the work is done there in terms of making this film what it is. The stripped down and silent delivery adds to the cool feel of the driving sequences but it also creates a stillness that translates really well into tension in the scenes where nothing happens, but something could happen. This becomes more obvious when the film becomes violent (and a couple of times it is very violent) because the realism of the situation is then always just beyond the stillness. The plot is fairly straightforward and could easily have been made as a direct-to-video crime movie with lots of shouting, lots of stunts and an ending where everything is tied up neatly. It is to the credit of the film that this very plot is turned into something that the majority of people would not have made.The story held me because of the manner of delivery. The score put me right into the frame of mind for a neo-noir type crime thriller and it held me in this state for the duration. OK some of the music is a little over used (the ""soft"" music I have heard other places and it reminded me of them) but generally it is good. Refn's direction is equally cold and stylish – he sits back off his subjects in the main, giving them room in the frame, again adding a lot of visual silence which still looks good. He is helped by having a great cast because, as this is about delivering in the construct, presence is important and you need people who can do work with less. Gosling is getting lots of praise but personally I wasn't blown away – although he was good. He is cool and easy to like but brings out his darker side well (albeit rooted in kindess). Mulligan also does well because the two of them together convince of an affection that we have to buy into even though little is said. Cranston is a solid turn but perhaps suffers from now being too famous for his current TV role. Brooks and Perlman are both enjoyable tough and mean in different ways, their screen presence benefits their roles. Hendricks is in a small role but effective.Drive is a great little film that gets by on its style and delivery to make for an engaging and cool film. I watched Transformers recently and didn't like it for the same reason – it was all style and nothing of substance, so what is the difference? For me the difference is that with Drive the style informs the story and the characters, rather than just for the sake of it. Drive will not be to everyone's tastes (go to the message board for tales of those expecting something like Fast & Furious) but it is an effective, engaging and stylish neo-noir that uses stillness and sudden violence really well.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

'Drive' Review by Heavy Metal Mouth,"Drive combines several unique stylistic elements and excellent character performances in a rare art-house thriller which stands among the very best films of 2011.Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Pusher Trilogy) and based the book of the same name by James Sallis, the story follows an anonymous central character played by Ryan Gosling, known only as 'The Driver'. Working as a Hollywood stuntman by day and getaway driver by night, Gosling begins a close friendship with his sweet neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio, while her husband is away in prison. However their blossoming relationship is brought under threat by a job gone wrong involving small time mobsters Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Pearlman).Gosling plays the unnamed protagonist to perfection in a reserved performance which slowly reveals the true nature and identity of his character over the duration of the film, exposing a composed, sensitive yet highly explosive figure capable of extreme action when forced by circumstance. Mulligan is also exceptional as the gentle Irene, conflicted by her devotion to her marriage and her growing feelings toward her protective new love interest, while Bryan Cranston puts in a strong performance as the Drivers manager, mentor and friend.However the real highlight of Drive is the wonderfully stylish direction by Refn, creating a 1980's like vintage setting which is perfectly complimented by the atmospheric, synth driven soundtrack, composed by Cliff Martinez. The late night L.A street shots combined with spontaneous, extreme scenes of violence throughout the film suggest a likeness to a hyper-stylised version of Taxi Driver, a bold comparison perhaps yet a justified one; Gosling seems obsessively consumed within his character, much like Robert De Niro's disturbing portrayal of Travis Bickle in the 1976 classic.Ultimately, the blend of fine character acting, Refn's slick direction and Martinez' outstanding soundtrack makes Drive a unique work of art and an instant cult classic. A must see film for this year.Find this review and more at www.hvymetalmouth.blogspot.ie",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

total disappointment,"I heard about Drive some time ago and wanted to watch it right after I saw the trailer. Finally got to see it a few days ago. It starts well with a very nice scene. The first 5-10 minutes were very promising. However, as it progressed I was wondering where is the real movie? How can this be rated 7.9 and be such a crap. This is my first ever review and I created my account just to write it. Drive is full of clichés, no dialogue at all, stupid and undeveloped characters and almost no enjoyable action scenes.

Gotta see it yourself to understand.For the masses who just wants to see an exiting heist thriller, this movie could disappoint, because it is made for an arthouse audience and not for a Transformers and Captain America audience.

The soundtrack was solid and plot could have been good, but I just couldn't get my head around the ""driver"" character and his weird personality. I expected so much more but felt like I'd watched a movie that has tried to be something special by doing something different, but failed miserably by adopting a poor story line and lacking any real emotion, or empathy for the characters. It's certainly watchable, but I won't be going out of my way to watch this again....not for a few years anyway.... This film feels like it has no real point to it and for that im giving it a 6/10.

"A ""Mann"" Driven","Here's the deal.Drive is an unapologetic riff of pretty much every loner crime revenge story ever made and total line descendant of Michael Mann's Thief from 1980, . So much so, that thanks to the bubbly soundtrack, it seems they might as well have filmed it in 1980 too. Drive is a small-time crime story told with great restraint on characterizations and great explosiveness when it comes to violence. As far as modern influences go, Drive is a sort of crazy hybrid of Paul Verhoeven's Spetters and Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard Eight (Sydney) throw in the last few Cronenberg movies while you're at it.While I don't quite understand the negativity so many haters seem to have for Drive, I understand why some people could be so frustrated by it. Drive is told with Nicolas Winding Refn's European eye for detail and tone. Drive is the definition of character study with a heavy emphasis on STUDY. There is very little quick cutting between camera setups and absolutely zero sitcom-esque axial cut dialog scenes. It is the antithesis of the way most American movies are made. We have been conditioned as a society to watch boxes of talking heads broken up with pointless jabber and largely bloodless violence.Now how you interpret Drive's way to tell a story is largely a question of style and sensibility. Drive is not for every taste and probably not something you'll be in the mood to watch 24/7, but it is very well done when you have the time to invest in it. While it breaks no new ground - and if you think it does, you must have been born yesterday - Drive is a really immersive odyssey of moments and music. It's essentially the cruise through LA crime movie Michael Mann tried to make with the Hit-Man centered Collateral.Drive is better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Driving a slow and thoughtful character study into a full-on violent crime thriller,"Ryan Gosling is a driver. During the day, he's a part-time Hollywood stunt man and a part-time car mechanic. During the night, he seems to spend most of his time helping out with criminal activities. All of the time, he's a leading man. He has a quiet and unassuming charm about him that can drive girls wild, and grateful bosses (like Bryan Cranston) since he's so trustworthy and capable.The girl is Carey Mulligan, looking much older and more experienced than her 16 year-old Jenny from ""An Education"" (2009). Again, sometimes girls fall for the wrong guy. But sometimes, the guy isn't bad, he just makes some wrong turns. For the few questionable choices that the driver made, every choice the filmmakers made was perfect. The film has such an artistic appeal to it with interesting transitions and scenes where the characters might just sit silent for five minutes, but we still know what's going on.The driver may drive at high-speeds and flip cars in Hollywood crash 'em up action movies, but ""Drive"" is anything but. It's actually not so far-fetched for Gosling to refer to it as a ""John Hughes superhero movie."" There's a background feel to it that makes it seem like an '80s chick flick, even though it's nothing like that. It starts with the speed of a minimalistic character study, but we don't even learn our hero's name. I'm glad it started that way because it got me more interested in the crime and money-stealing plot.""Drive"" is slow, thoughtful, and interestingly shot and paced. Oh, and it's violent.

Heavy hitter in a sea of remakes and failures.,"Praise the rarity of a modern film that once started we are compelled to see through to the end. Drive is one such film.I'l be honest, this film knocked me for 6 as after watching the trailer I was expecting to see a transporter 'esque action film but in reality the film is so much more.At the start, scenes with hardly any dialogue are inter-spliced with silent, richly detailed scenes which in some ways tell us more about the characters than a 1000 spoken words ever could. As the film progresses more characters are introduced and with them a lot more dialogue, it's by no means a bad thing just there is a stark contrast between the first and second half of the movie.The film develops from the calm into a full hell bent storm, fast paced ultra violence happens after scenes shown in slow motion, the violence may be few and far between but it really stands out, maybe because we don't expect it, maybe because it goes too far.The acting is fantastic and everyone plays their part outstanding, especially Ryan gosling who portrays the hero as a dark,calculated, man of few words who's ambitions and motivations elude us.There's not a lot more i can say without giving away specific plot details.

"Never conforms to its genre, instead bending it to fit its stoic, tender yet explosively violent story.","Nicolas Winding Refn's calmly tender yet explosively violent crime thriller never conforms to its genre, instead self-assuredly bending it to fit its stoic story while perhaps somewhat stubbornly maintaining its relatively laid-back pace and less-is-more mentality, and it's undoubtedly a much more memorably nuanced affair because of it. While The Driver himself may seem somewhat of a blank slate, he's actually an incredibly deep character who's lack of overt outward expression is matched by an interior complexity rarely seen in pictures of this kind (if any) and it's his unspoken connection to the other characters that roots him deep within his newfound reality, while establishing his longing to escape the criminal world he has unwillingly come to call his home. His brutality is presented in an honestly visceral way that refreshingly shows the consequences of such actions and never condones them even if they ultimately save the people that the protagonist cares the most deeply about. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An piece of art.,"How many movies you remember out of all movies you saw in last 1 years ? This would be surely the one.This is more then a movie, its an piece of art. This movie is like a mesmerizing song sang for 100 minutes with a hint of of action , revenge, drama , fatherly love , violence. I write this post after almost six months of watching this movie, however there are scenes I can still playback in my mind. It was a master piece of love and romance at many moments and a classic portray of violence.Hats off for director Nicolas Winding Refn, to be able to put these scenes with so little words. Like character and their silence were shouting out loud with their eyes and actions. The audio was exemplary, I am pretty sure that audience who watched it loud enjoyed it equally who watched it on low volume.I don't see any one else other then Ryan as Driver. This is certainly going to be one of the best movie for next few years until Refn and Ryan comes with something even better.If you have not watched this movie and have sometime, go guys and watch it right away.

Very good movie....no regrets !!!,"I found this NOT to be your normal movie type with the title "" DRIVE ""... No its not another F5 or Toyko drift..Far from it.. Although while watching it I did have some expectations of its type but found something far more different. and different in a good way... Without indicating too much of the film, I do highly recommend it. I did find it rather STUPID some woman actually tried to sue a theater regarding misleading trailer.. Yes I do admit the trailer does give off the wrong impression but lets all face it, that isn't the first nor the last trailers will mislead us... But with that said as for me that setup for me the enjoy the movie even more.. I got out of it more than a muscle car case and a robbery.....Bottom line..GO RENT IT !!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A modern classic,"This review has taken me a long time to think out, and even so I don't think I'll be able to do it justice, but here goes.Since Drive has been premièred at Cannes over a year ago it has been heaped with undying praise; during that première, it received cheering and afterwards, a ten-minute and rapturous standing ovation. Then came the reviews upon release: unanimous praise; I was hooked when a few critics compared it to The Driver and (the brilliant) Vanishing Point. Even my favourite critics - Roger Ebert, Mark Kermode and Philip Molloy - all sung its praises. Notably most critics spoke of its influences - John Hughes, Walter Hill, Gaspar Noe, Michael Mann, Alejandro Jodorowsky and even Risky Business. Influences, which if you have no knowledge of or appreciation for you may not 'get' the film. Because, make no mistake, this is a film which embraces cinematic nostalgia to its brilliant benefit; something Refn's fifth film, Bronson, also wonderfully utilized.Then there's that cast; not just the obvious star, Refn has a truly impeccable troupe of actors before us. Gosling is truly a marvel in it, making the difficult role of 'the mysterious man' magnetic, mesmerizing and utterly convincing. For me, his performance evoked memories of Clint Eastwood's The Man with No Name or Alain Delon's protagonist in the classic Le Samourai. Carey Mulligan is reliably great, perfectly portraying the love caught betwixt two men; Bryan Cranston is fantastic (what else would you expect from the best actor on TV?) in a small, but vitally significant role; Ron Perlman is predictably a joy to watch as the ""Jew running a pizzeria""; even those with less screen time, Oscar Isaac and Christina Hendricks still manage to impress and make a strong impression on the viewer. Even Kaden Leos is good as the young son, Benicio. But then there's Mr. Albert Brooks - an undeniably brilliant performance. All the more impressive when you take into account his largely comedic background (""A psychotic Woody Allen"", as Refn remarked). He is sinister, dangerous and fully-fledged; deserving of all the praise and awards he picked up.Newton Thomas Siegel's cinematography is a thing to behold; beautiful, enticing and authentic; which I found somewhat reminiscent of Paul Thomas Anderson's favoured use of grounded and firm shots or Peter Suschitzky's cinematography in Cronenberg's Crash. The pacing also, is a wonder; it is slow, yet hypnotic, and even as things intensify in the latter half, nothing feels out of character, thanks to the brilliance and naturalness of the pacing.Then we have the euphoric 80s tinge: the ultra-cool music stylishness of Cliff Martinez, Desire, College, etc; the clothes, especially that now-iconic satin jacket; or even the architecture, which was actually cheap stucco and mirrored glass, carefully edited to leave out more contemporary buildings. Refn has stated that the chaste romance at the heart of the story was partially inspired by the films of John Hughes, which is beautifully and aesthetically evident, to the effect where it is one of the most nuanced, convincing and human love stories I've witnessed on screen. This love also marvellously plays out in one of the most tender, brutal and flawless sequences I've ever seen on screen.This film blew me away, I hadn't seen a new film that impressive since Inception. It really is a modern classic as many of the critics hailed it, anchored not only by Gosling, but by Refn's impeccable and incredible direction. I eagerly anticipate Only God Forgives.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Understated, intense and surprisingly poignant","...just got back from seeing ""DRIVE""...Loved the performances from Carey Mulligan and Ryan Gosling. The things that they said with just a look, or a shifting of the lips, or even the touch of a smile.... One of my favourite on-screen romances of the past 5 years.Great soundtrack. Great direction. Great cinematography and great performances all the way around (Albert Brooks gives a great turn, as does the always impressive Bryan Crantson!) Add to that some of the most intense, brilliantly shot car scenes that i can recall seeing.What else could you ask for in a movie?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An overwhelming movie with a subtle undertone,"If taken at face value, Drive can seem overwhelming to most people and leave one with a nauseous feeling at the end. Drive is indeed an incredibly bloody movie, however, it is not very hard to come away from watching this with a feeling that maybe all this completely wrong? Sometimes, to provide a critique of something, one only needs to present the thing in all its reality and the critique appears all of its own. This can be said of the latest movies from the likes of Tarantino, in whose movies, blood and gore are pretty much the order of the day.In Drive, Ryan Gosling provides an average, unemotional performance as the anti-hero: he is a sociopathic young part-time criminal who gets into a ""contract"" to commit a crime to help a neighbor's ex-con husband and realizes that the ""contract"" has more than what appears on the surface. Carey Mulligan, in my opinion, proves to be the saving grace in a movie whose characters all appear to be stereotypes and provide mostly average or poor performances. In scenes where she meets Gosling for the first times, she provides a real on screen charisma and chemistry similar to the performance provided by Gosling and Michelle Williams (whom Mulligan uncannily resembles) in Blue Valentine. Though Drive does not get onto the level of Blue Valentine's sublime story lines and acting, taken from the perspective of just this pair of actors, this movie is a very good successor to Blue Valentine, providing what might very well be the next tragic stage in the lives of Dean Pereira and Cindy Heller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Well crafted movie...Spoilers,"Exceptionally well done film, loved every moment of it!From the opening scene, music, cinematography, directing, acting, all blended to create a deeply interesting work of art.The characters are so skillfully developed, some have a minimum of dialog, others have much more, but each has a unique ability to express themselves. It is easy to be quietly drawn into them.Upon a second viewing, the scene of momentary, wishful hope he expresses to Irene, his voice softly humble as he stares at the floor is exceptionally poignant - and overlooked - considering the very next one which destroys everything. The look on his unveiled, stricken face after wards is powerful.First viewing is great, second is even better since many scenes are so meaningful after understanding each character's nature. Great directing, cinematography, editing, acting, music, a great great film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive,"Nicolas Winding Refn creates an engrossing crime-drama based in Echo Park, Los Angeles that makes you rethink how an action based movie should be made. The location of the movie plays a big part in understanding what is going on. Echo Park in Los Angeles is a two and a half mile area that is one of the most crime-stricken and densely populated areas in LA. Refn creates characters that develop throughout the movie into people we can all relate to. Drive manages to isolate itself from other movies through the acting of Ryan Gosling, the plot of the movie itself, and the screen writing of Refn.Ryan Gosling never was given a name and barely said more than a couple words at a time, which played very well into the character he was portraying in the movie. Gosling's character was a professional stunt driver for movies and ran a side business of a get-away driver for criminals. The driver was soft-spoken to say the least, an example of this is when Gosling goes on a date with his neighbor, Irene. The date consists of very few words but the audience can feel the emotional tension between the two actors. Even though Gosling is soft-spoken he still manages to get his point across, this is prevalent in the scene where Irene's husband Standard Gabriel gets beat up by mobsters who Standard owed money too. Gosling finds out about this and gets straight to the point by demanding Standard to tell him who beat him up and why.The plot of the movie plays itself out throughout the whole movie and keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. Although it comes off as a typical, run and gun, save the girl action movie it is much deeper than that through the use of different movie-making techniques. The director Nicolas Winding Refn keeps the audience on their feet by introducing new characters such as Irene's husband Standard Gabriel who had been in prison, tying old characters from the beginning of the movie back in at the end, and creating twists right up to the end.Nicolas Refn did an incredible job with the screen writing, every single character in the movie is very easy to relate to and the setting plays along with the characters. This plays into the plot of the movie revolving around crime. Refn created a fantastic character in the driver which is played by Ryan Gosling who plays the role perfectly and makes the character even better. He also created a very relatable plot through the relationship between the driver and Irene, the screen writing was very relatable also and the two complimented each other very well. In the final scene where Gosling leaves the money, he finds himself driving along an open road with a stab wound. Even with the stab wound the driver seems to be in no pain, he is just enjoying himself driving, and waiting for the next step in his life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Style over Substance,"I feel I have to write something about this film that so many are going crazy about. Having looked forward to this film, I have to say I was not a little disappointed. I don't want to spoil it for people so I'll try an describe my feelings not the plot. It is well shot and it has a feel of an eighty's pop video, which reminded me of a Madonna video, perhaps it was the electro pop soundtrack. Much has be said about Ryan Goslings performance, and does play it with aloofness and has a cool Estwoodesque manner. Its called Drive, but it is not Bullet, so If that's what you expect forget it. The film is mainly very long still shots of Ryan Gosling, doing not very much and saying even less. As I said it is well shot and the director borrows heavily from Michael Mann in Heat, and Ridley Scott in Blade Runner. There is violence, some unseen, some graphic. But not totally believable, it is not just that Gosling just doesn't quite manage to pull it off. He try s to portray some kind of dangerous psychopath and, for me, it didn't work. The lack of much dialogue was also very irritating. On the whole I feel this film is way overrated",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Intriguing visual-sound experience, even beautiful, even perfect ... and good script.","Sound editing brings the audience into a movie whose visual style will end up captivating, intriguing them. Regarding these resources (sound and colors) it is a 10/10.About the script, I must say that I liked it a lot, the scenes of greater intensity left me on the edge of the seat (several times), my only problem is the little depth that it gives to the protagonist, and do not get me wrong, he is a good character built, but only that, just ""good"". I mean, if the script had given to this serious man more depth, the lead performance could have been much more appreciable, and then the script could have been as good as the sound-visual experience.For this I give this movie an 8/10.

A Breathtaking Masterpiece,"This is a rare piece of cinema. Often hypnotic, occasionally brutal and always beautiful, Drive is a huge accomplishment and a master class at achieving thrills on the cheap as apposed to cheap thrills. Drive's estimated budget was $15,000,000 which suggested that Nicolas Winding Refn was always going to have to rely on solid storytelling and fine acting. The film follows a Hollywood stunt driver (Ryan Gosling) who at night, occasionally works as a getaway driver for the mob. As the film progresses, we are shown exactly what our protagonist is capable of doing when the ones he cares about are threatened. The results are harrowing, with some of the most horrific violence ever shown in a film. Ryan Gosling is superb as a modern day 'man with no name' who is surrounded in mystery. His past is never mentioned, his motives are never mentioned and we as an audience can only guess what his character has witnessed/been through too arrive at this point. He's cool, calm and collective and he only speaks when necessary but despite this rough exterior we are shown a softer side too Gosling when he falls for the 'girl next door' who is expertly played by Carey Mulligan. The car chases are explosive and put The French Connection too shame. The soundtrack is pumping (Kavinsky's Nightcall being a real stand out). If you are looking for a film with huge explosions, gun fights and over the top protagonists then look away. This is the thinking mans action film, with an absorbing story, told through the eyes of the perfect anti-hero. Refn truly has created a masterpiece and whilst it may not have grossed as much as the 'summer blockbusters' of 2011 it sure as hell deserved too!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Reminds me of movies from before the industry gave no credit to the viewer,"I don't really review movies much, but this one stood out in such a way that I was compelled to write one.Right away I brace myself for the mediocre, a movie that relies on flashy gimmicks, fast cars and big boobs and slick names, much like what you would expect from movies such as the ""Fast and the Furious"". Instead the main character doesn't even have a name. I was shocked to find a movie that had such emotional depth and so much suspense, and I mean FULL of suspense. That's saying a lot for a movie where the central character barely talks.That's another thing, Ryan Gosling's character has so few lines the viewer is left wondering what he's about to do next, with no hint or suspension for the upcoming.There is a lot of violence in this movie, done very stylistically.Overall a decent flick, I recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
best film of the year....so far,"After reading reviews (both the best and worse) i had to see this film. This film had a great retro vibe to it from the word go. Ryan gosling is absolutely superb, I enjoyed his performance in the notebook (I'm proud to say that) but this put him on a new level. The supporting cast was also great, especially Ron Pearlman. Not only was this film visually stunning, but it also had an incredible soundtrack to go along with it.After reading what people were complaining about it was all so stupid. Either people were complaining that they thought it was an attempt of a remake of some old driving film. NO clearly it isn't so why have an issue with it?? Also people are complaining that they thought they were ready for some type of fast and furious movie. Well no because this is an art film, not some stupid cars going fast for 90 minutes. Or people complaining that it is slow, or Gosling being awkward, or the action scenes being to fast. Well this film is a bit slow paced but it suits it brilliantly, and gosling isn't awkward but he just portrays this closed off character stunningly and the action scenes aren't quick but just laced well in the film to add to the plot.This is easily the best film of 2011 so far (although I'm still waiting to see 50/50, Warrior and Tin Tin) and this is a pure masterpiece. Refn has clearly hit the scene hard while gosling should have easily earned an Oscar nod. The perfect film for me and I'm sure for those who love a great piece of cinema, but for those blockbuster who cant stand story lines or character development (e.g. fast and the furious, anything by Michael Bay) this will probably not please you at all. 9.5-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A treat in every sense,"Despite having a reputation of a rather violent and action-packed flick, which it partly is, Drive excels in its magnificently distinctive portrayal of Los Angeles and the characters swarming inside it.The story focuses on a driver (the exquisite Ryan Gosling, whose elegant performance revs the film from start to finish) who is a stunt driver by day and a getaway wheelman by night. His isolated, oppressive world finds light when he gets to know his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio whose father is in prison. Human instinct creates bonds between these characters which ultimately triggers a chain of events that one has to see to believe.Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn orchestrates the ensemble of editing, cinematography and set design impressively, leaving little for the viewer to whine about. Luscious color correction and ingeniously assembled retro-ish soundtrack make the film feel like a hot dog time-warped from the 80's. You just want gorge the whole thing. Seeing it only once won't do the trick.Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and Oscar Isaac (just to name a few) provide fire support for Gosling and together make for a stellar cast that might just be the best of 2011.Hossein Amini's script isn't revolutionary in any way but gives each character a moment in the spotlight. Drive's protagonist doesn't get to blurt any Oscar-baity one-liners but his refreshingly bold dialogue is full of soul and meaning. It reflects on the whole film's atmosphere where a look in the eyes is worth of a million words.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
West-side Taxi Driver,"I'll get it out of the way quick: Drive is the best movie of the year. And while the new decade is young, it definitely belongs on the ""Best of Decade"" list too. Drive mixes quality filmmaking and modern flair, which reflect off each other perfectly. Drive has it all: action, drama, romance, suspense, and charisma.Drive follows a man who lives around cars. He works in a garage, does stunts, and is the getaway driver for criminals. We never learn his name. Ryan Gosling is the Driver, and he's great. Driver is quiet, and content to be quiet. A true professional, thinking only of his work. For the most part, Gosling is subtle. His getaways are done plain-faced, and he doesn't show emotion when meeting new people. But we see a more emotional side of him with Benicio, and every so often a violent side, but more on that later. Down the road, one could see this as Gosling breakout role/performance.The plot is fairly conventional: crime gone wrong. In the middle there is a bit of noir, with too much information exposed. But everything wraps up well- it doesn't close off his story completely and we can make up our own minds about what happens after.This film has many parallels to Taxi Driver, and originally I wanted to expand on that, but it would contain spoilers so I decided against it.If you expect an action film, turn around. Drive is a drama with action scenes. As other reviews have said, action happens when the story calls for it, not because the story needs action. There aren't many chases or killings, but the chases are heart- pounding. And the violence is brutal. Like the Godfather (always a comparison you want a film to relate to) the violence is sparse, but when it comes it comes BIG. Two scenes in particular are jaw dropping, and *minor spoilers* the elevator scenes will become known as ""that scene in Drive"", in my opinion the highlight of the film, with juxtaposition of the two extremes in the film, love and hate *end spoilers*.Speaking of love, Gosling and Carey Mulligan share a nice romance. They speak with small movements, and barely speak. Body language is the name of the game here. Add in Benicio, the son, and you have a family here that is tender to see.Drive is backed by several great supporting characters. Bryan Cranston, a favourite of mine, is the good- hearted but cash-hungry Shannon, the Driver's friend and partner. Ron Perlman is the hilarious Jewish Italian gangster wannabe, whose description of a nice car is unbelievably funny. And Oscar Isaac is great as the ex-con who actually isn't a caricature.Include a few sweet synth songs and great cinematography, Drive is a fantastic modern film that is necessary viewing. I hope it receives some Academy love, it deserves it. You'll probably love it. 8.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Timeless, Charming, Brilliant, Witty","This is a moralistic message movie if ever there was one. I, for one, was left mortified and unimpressed. Its flaws could be easily spotted by a cheap robotic drone flying over my native Pakistan.The picture begins with a bland interlude, a tone poem, if you will, a-la-Joel Schumacher, wherein we are plopped squarely in the middle of a second-rate heist that goes unfinished: interrupted by a nauseatingly 1980's title sequence, replete with a centered hot-pink Casmira 72 point font.Ryan Gosling uncreatively reprises his role as a Disney television matinée idol, namely ""Young Hercules,"" as he attempts to right the wrongs of the world in one or two fell swoops, using many props, including a hammer, a bullet, a slim-jim, a pair of dainty pleather driving gloves, a watch, a rubber mask, a pair of tap-dancing shoes, and a continual five-o'clock shadow.The movie evolves from a sweet and tender bildungsromance into a full-fledged remake of Mommie Dearest, wherein Gosling mercilessly torments those who dare to cross his unpredictable moral boundaries.But if his behaviour is unpredictable, the film is not. On more than one occasion, we are treated to the blaring electronica of a soundtrack of which Giorgio Moroder would surely approve, since he composed the nearly identical score for ""Midnight Express.""Suspiciously, none of the characters ever seem to use the restroom unless they are about to get shot in the head. Perhaps they were too constipated with their internal monologues and preoccupied with how their mannerisms would look in slow motion.Albert Brooks does a grave injustice to his own weak repertoire. While I would agree that ""Taxi Driver"" was tepid and effeminate, Brooks fit the bill there perfectly. But in Drive, he has re-cast himself as a leading alpha-male mobster and dying patriarch of a now-defunct cinema empire. It is most unbecoming, and his shameless audacity hurts the film tremendously. Brooks has taken the punch out of what could and should have been an Oscar winning character had the role been performed by, say, Penny Marshall or Austin Pendleton or Robin Williams.How this film ever managed to get a green light without Golan-Globus is anyone's guess. Had Miramax's precursors been around today to offer much needed guidance toward this project, it surely would have been a far better movie, instead of a simplistic infomercial for muscle cars and monster trucks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
cinema paradiso,"What can I say, what has'nt been said here already. Only to read these reviews here gives an example of how many layers and levels this movie has. Through different reviews there are so many different focus-points, approaches etc. And most of them fits perfectly with this masterpiece.I just cite some of them - considering every single on of them absolutely true: - This is a man with no name film. He is an old fashioned (action) hero. - intelligent adrenaline - For starters, let's talk about the pace of the film. Most may call it slow, whereas i call it hypnotic. (and from time to time it accelerates as if it had gotten a turbo boost.) - But what really sold me on this film was it's overall FEEL. etc.Reading the reviews one can understand, that whole lot of people simply did not get this film. It's not for everyone to recognize something truly remarkable at once. But 80% did. And it is really hard to understand, why Drive was candidate at only ""best supporting actor's"" category at Golden Globe. It's probably movie of the year. Actually the best movie I've seen since ""The Hurt Locker"".and some of my own thoughts: - This movie is beautiful. And it's beauty has a tremendous power in it. - Humanistic, yet stone cold character with noble ideas and methods, that put him right on the same line with his enemies. And he knows it. One may call it as an ultimate sacrifice. And the coolest thing is - he does not pity himself for that.

"Awful first half, awesome second half","For a movie to have a 1 hour and 40 minute run time where the plot doesn't kick in until the 50 minute mark or so is always grating on me. Its even more grating for the film Drive, which has an awesome plot crammed into its second half, forcing me to sit through nearly an hour of Ryan Gosling Looking Intently At Things.There's not much to be said for the first half. Boy meets girl, boy meets girls' son, they all bond and he grows attached to them. Given the ease in which this happens, you'd think that this might have happened at least one or two times in the past. Drive is way too coy trying to conceal the Driver's name - Bryan Cranston's Shannon calls him ""kid"", and everyone else seems to get by saying ""hey"" or ""you"". It found it irritating after a while, rather than mysterious, and I was nearly shouting at Mulligan's/Isaac's/Brooks' characters ""YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE MAN'S NAME WHY ARE YOU TRUSTING HIM"".Gosling stares a lot in the first 50 minutes, but in the second act he shows a lot more acting talent. He's cool and collected behind the wheel, but there's also emotion keyed to a fever pitch in later scenes. I sometimes wish Hollywood would stop trying to make Ryan Gosling happen and leave him in romcoms, but I can't deny he's got talent. In Drive's stellar supporting cast is the incredible Oscar Isaac, who moulds the jealous husband character into something novel and keeps showing the incredible depth that makes him one of the greatest actors of his generation. Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks also hugely impress as a pair of Jewish mobsters - Brooks in particular is amazing. Bernie Rose is ruthless but surprisingly honest. A pivotal scene with a razor blade speaks volumes about his performance. I didn't like the end very much, but as a climax for the incredible crime thriller that was Drive's second half, I'll tolerate it.There's some incredible action (read violent) scenes in this film, and I feel that the film would have suffered without it. Director Nicolas Winding Refn certainly knows how to direct a superb action sequence. A scene in the lift with Mulligan, Gosling and a hit-man is beautifully executed as an action sequence and a piece of drama. The cinematography on this film is absolutely breathtaking as well, on normal shots as well as exhilarating car chase scenes. I found the film's score to be absolutely disgusting, especially that awful techno song that plays over the opening credits.The camera-work, action, Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks are best in show, but you could just as easily find entertainment in another movie that doesn't circle the block aimlessly for fifty minutes of your time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Someone give this guy an Oscar...,"Drive was an insanely wonderful break away from these over-hyped macho blockbusters that rely only on explosions, using 1,000 rounds of ammo per minute while keeping a babe on each arm (and not a great aim on the target). Goslings' character to audience bond strengthens at the same time his plans are coming undone. The ability for this guy to be silent for most of the movie is what proves how great of an actor he is. When the momentum builds, there are scenes where no matter what is going on in the background, you cannot take your eyes off his face. The violence is almost beautiful as it gains speed, spirals out of control, and takes your breath away. The casting is superb, the soundtrack is spot-on and could not be more perfect. It has cars, girls, muscles, and fights. This is a REAL macho movie like you've rarely seen, and do you want to know why? These actors can really ACT! Imagine that. From the lead roles to the people you've never even heard of on this cast, every one of them has it right.

From an inability to chew on a toothpick to the over the top skull crushing violence, his character seems to jar with his appearance and not in an ironic way. The film has been described as 'Noir', its not but it is trying very hard, unfortunately failing in the process. All this would have been forgiven but for the denouement of the film which was simply illogical. The title could have described a fast paced petrol head 200mph thrill-fest, its not that. Or it could have referred to intricate character development where we get to consider the drive and motivation of the characters involved but that never really happens either, all we get is a leading man who says very little and a loose plot that never manages to grab your attention enough to give a damn anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Most of the story happens in the second half of the movie and only a few scenes can be considered good. For a movie titled drive and for the main character to be a stunt driver the two or three ""chases"" are your super basic weave in and out of traffic or run a guy off the road sort, nothing new or even entertaining. Ryan's character is written as the ""im so cool I can only say two words at a time!"" kind of guy.I swear the a lot of these ""user"" reviews are people that have been paid to praise it.Just because a movie is filmed in an older style, in this case 80's style, doesn't make it a good movie. Even in the 80's this movie would have been trashed by movie-goers.Im being generous with my 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"All the Elements Were There, but...","With such an impressive cast and a budding director, with such works as the Pusher Trilogy, which was a piece of epic dark edged gripping drama that I won't forget. I must say it left me expecting a lot when Drive came along.Waiting for the pace to pick up, and for some emotionally gripping performances, i found myself not being able to connect with the characters, with the sound seeming to fill in the exposition for them, giving the acting a lack of breathing space.Musically, Drive contains some flavors of some of my favorite pieces of music in recent years. The sense of nostalgia with some 80s infused moods were there, with some tastes of 28 Days Later, Risky Business, the Social Network and Miami Vice. I was left utterly confused though why they hadn't sent these songs to a composer to do an original soundtrack instead of making references to other emotional moments in other movies and passing it off as its own. This aspect of the movie seemed totally overlooked.In terms of acting, some pivotal scenes in the movie ended up coming across a bit flat. Bryan Cranston had an underwritten part that could have been so much more to the drama, while Gosling gave away so little that he seemed a bit unreal to me. Albert Brooks seemed a little miscast in the part. With acting in mind though, I thought Oscar Isaac brought an intensity and tension which lacked in the rest of the movie, while Carey Mulligan was is softer more tender opposite. They were well matched, and they provided the movie with a depth of realism that seemed to lack in other areas.With all of that in mind though, my expectations were perhaps quite high after Refns earlier work, and I'll be looking into more of his work with anticipation but this one wasn't quite the throttle fueled punch that I was expecting.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive - It's one Hell of a Ride,"Drive is one of the most gripping movies I've seen in a long time. It combines some of the greatest car chases, gut wrenching scenes of violence and brutality, humor, and loads of cash in a heist gone bad. Oh yeah, and brilliant acting by Ryan Gosling and his beautiful neighbor Irene played by Carey Mulligan.This movie starts out with Ryan Gosling making a living as an auto mechanic, Hollywood stunt driver, and you guessed it one bad ass getaway driver. Ryan Gosling portrays swagger while remaining grounded with his nonchalant edginess. Things go sour when his Irene's boyfriend comes home from prison. That's when things hits the fan. Gosling is required to try and save Irene and her boyfriends family, their son that's 8 years old.Forced into a heist to try and save Irene's family. Which goes very very wrong.This is when the calm cool collective Gosling turns into a pseudo psychotic maniac driver from hell, yet still remaining his poise. But develops such a gruesome edge.After this things become very intense, and some of the most brutal scenes of violence ever recorded will be imprinted into your brain. Imagine a fork to the eye, and then 3 stabs of a butcher knife to your neck, blood squirting profusely from your arteries.This movie has everything, I could sit here and type out everything and why it's such a damn amazing movie. But I would be here forever. Incredibly deep, amazing cinematography, world class acting. Deep storyline, best movie of the year?

Truly Unique Film that's likely to become a classic,"""Drive"" is just one of those movies that wakes you up because of its uniqueness and makes you realize that not all movie scenes and plots you can expect. Almost every movie out there, even the good ones, are so predictable. You can judge a movie based on how many explosions there are, or if there's a love affair, how it'll turn out in the end. The fact is, however, the movie ""Drive"" follows more of an unconventional, yet more realistic plot. I won't say what happens, but just know that it's not what you think. In my viewing of the movie, I knew right off the bat that I couldn't expect a single thing to happen. I was sucked into the movie because I had to know what was going to happen. To my surprise, what actually happened was neither what I expected nor what I didn't expect. Up until the end of the movie, the movie itself was playing with my mind, telling me ""this is how it is"" not ""this is how you would have wanted it"". I enjoyed it immensely, and I hope other viewers will do the same, if they haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Style, pumped through your veins","This film had 8.5 rating on IMDb last year (which ranks it just outside the top 100 films of all time) I'm disappointed it's dropped to a 7.9 and hope it will be seen in time as a great film. When this was first arriving on our screens it had an amazing action packed trailer and I thought this would be a good film too watch.The phrase that comes to mind is more style than substance, usually this is a bad term for a film but in this case the style is so powerful this film pulses through you. For instance a fight scene towards the end is filmed just looking at the shadows of the two men, this is evident of the effort of the makers to make this more than a film. Honestly every shot is brilliant with fantastic use of light and each scene drips with gorgeous cinematography and the score is the best I've heard this year. Also the tension developed in these magnificently portrayed scenes is very good and keeps you on edge and makes you feel the characters as there looking out at you.The story is not bad though and holds the film well to stop it from curving too far into an art form. The writer has put a few smart lines in it as well to keep things fresh.I must say though my mother would not like this film as it has several overly violent scenes which I originally dismissed as being pointlessly too gory but actually there quite stylish in a ""kill bill"" sort of way.Overall with a small budget and some not bad acting added to some amazing cinematography, my words cannot describe, they have made a fantastic film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An unforgettable Drive!,"I am going to quickly put it in first gear and off-the-bat mention that Director Nicholas Winding Refn's ""Drive"" is sure to be the #1 badass movie of 2011. OK, maybe many of you reading this feel that I put it in overdrive with that statement, but you have to trust me on this one. Ryan Gosling stars as (he pulled one out of Clint Eastwood's ""man with no name"" spaghetti westerns) because his name is never mentioned throughout the movie, he is just simply Driver. How cool is that? Driver is an orthodontist, brace yourself. OK, so he is not. Helloo! What do you think he is! Ryan Seacrest eat your heart out because Driver has more Hollywood gigs than you. Driver is a Hollywood stunt driver for movies, a mechanic at an L.A. body shop, and a contract driver for thieves on their robbery hits. He is tacit, conscious, and of course driven. He befriends a cutesy apartment neighbor Irene and her son Benicio. When Irene's husband Standard returns from a prison sentence and hires Driver for a forced robbery , ""Drive"" is taken to another gear altogether, and shifts more to an ultra-violence speed. The Standard operation heads to a dead-end zone and that is when ""Drive"" moves up to top cool control. Refn's mastery of the movie's guise, unpredictability, and stylishness are key factors why this movie rocks! Refn is very deserving of a Best Director Oscar nomination. I will be refn mad if that does not happens! Hossein Amini's staid screenplay is limited in wordage but unlimited in deftness. Gosling does not take a back seat to anyone with his stellar starring performance. 2011 is looking like the year of the Gosling, so I think he is on the right route for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Carey Mulligan was solid as Irene. Albert Brooks delivers a menacing performance as the antagonist Bernie Rose. Looks like Brooks' comeback is heading in the right direction. Give The Brooks a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nom! Some other nice turns were thespianly delivered in ""Drive"" by Bryan Cranston as body shop owner Shannon, Oscar Issac as Standard, and Ron Perlman as Rose's partner Nino. Cliff Martinez's perfect score was musically ""up to speed"" with the film's pace. So go and drive to see ""Drive"", it is a ticket to movie supremacy. ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good typical broody dark Gosling performance with a few interesting casting choices.,"Good surprise flick I had sitting around for a while without watching, saw it on a preview a few days earlier and remembered I had it kicking around so pulled it out and watched it. It started out quick enough and settled in nicely to the Man with No Name premise, the silent reserved cool character that you know just is going to do the right thing and when you cross him you'll be surprised at his violent responses, he really doesn't make sense as the tough guy but when you look at Brad Pitts character in OUATIH you get the drift stunt men are a different breed, the whole nice guy, tough guy, mans man who isn't scared or threatened by most situations before him. Albert Brooks does very well as a bad guy, Beauty and the Beast guy/Hell Boy/SoA dude is his normal tough guy annoying self and in character. Mulligan is ok at portraying the misshapen innocent mom to Benicio, some of the movie is a bit here and there but overall, a good revenge, gangster type shoot em up with a good dose of new ways to do somebody in if that's your thing. Watch if you like stylish neo noir or broodish moody action, Gosling has that down lol. Plays the same guy in every movie except Blue Valentine and La La Land.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"First review, New favorite movie!","All that needs to be said is that some people will hate this movie ( because they only see the preview that makes it out to be a Hollywood action movie, which if they did a little research before hand would find out that it is anything but) I on the other hand happened to love this movie and is now at the top of my list of all time favorites. Just go see it and decide for yourself. All of the negative reviews of this movie have been from people admitting that they were expecting an action packed blockbuster. Do your home work people and you wouldn't have to ""waste"" the price of admission. Great acting, great cinematography, and very fitting over the top 80's music.

"Drive (2011) Review: Scorpion Jacket, Leather Gloves & a lot of Retro Music","If you're planning to watch this film I'd recommend going into this film not judging it based on the trailer because it absolutely does not represent the film in its real light. Here's the short synopsis as listed on IMDb, ""A Hollywood stunt performer who moonlights as a wheel man discovers that a contract has been put on him after a heist gone wrong."" The film has a pretty impressive cast: Ryan Gosling (Blue Valentine, read my review here) as the ""Driver"", Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) as his boss, Shannon and Carey Mulligan (An Education) as his neighbour/love interest, Irene. Also starring in the film, is Ron Perlman (Sons of Anarchy), Albert Brooks (The Muse), the beautiful Christina Hendricks (Mad Men) and Oscar Isaac (I'm a new fan after watching him in Ten Year at TIFF last month).The acting was superb in the film. Ryan Gosling delivers yet another strong performance, playing the lead role as the quiet and calculated skilled driver. Carey Mulligan is almost perfect for these serious, melancholy, strong yet fragile roles (I'd highly recommend watching her in An Education for those who haven't seen it yet). The two of them worked very well together even though with so much screen time, there wasn't too much dialogue between the two but you still felt the on screen chemistry. The few scenes with Ron Perlman were a treat (especially since I'm a big fan of Sons of Anarchy), Oscar Isaac did a great job with the handful of moments he was on screen, loved the scene where he gave the second chance speech and it's always great to see Christina Hendricks, she made a very memorable exit. Overall, great acting from all the main stars in this film.The opening scene was very well shot, with the Driver explaining his 5 minute rule to the clients and demonstrating his very calm, calculated and cool skills. The whole sequence was very intense and very enjoyable. And we get a good sense of how serious he is about his rule when he turns into the underground parking lot and so non-nonchalantly walks out of the car, flips his jacket inside out and puts on his hat—freaking smooth. I almost feel bad for his two clients who are sitting in there asking themselves ""where the hell did he go?"" holding to two giant black bags and just waiting to get caught. BUT than the opening credits begin and we get our very first (of many) very, very retro techno-rock tracks and it was my turn to ask ""where the fu*k is the director going with this?""Why did the film only get a 6 out of 10?...Continue reading the full review here: http://goo.gl/h49PY or http://www.thetvsamurai.com/search/label/Movie%20Reviews",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Awesomeness with Style and Heart. Beautiful film.,"Everyone must see this! This is one of the coolest movies (coolest being the operative word here) I've ever seen, and probably one of the best this year. As everyone has said, the film looks beautiful. Some of the cinematography and style reminded me in a way of Wong Kar Wai's ""In The Mood For Love"". The subject matter, however, is obviously different. I should also mention the performances. All perfect. Carey Mulligan as Irene and Ryan Gosling as the lead, the Driver, are amazing with their subtleties and quiet exchanges. Both very good. On the other hand, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, and Albert Brooks were all very loud and/or outspoken, which makes the film perfectly balanced. The music!!! My God, the music! Odd and bold choices, but add so much to the images shown. What I like most about this film, though, is the silent tension throughout many of the scenes. There is one particular scene I love which inter-cuts between a dinner conversation and events that happen earlier that day. Also, that amazing kiss scene in the elevator, followed by a Gaspar Noe-inspired gore fest beating, which will, without a doubt, prove to be one for the books. I'm sure it will be talked about for ages, shown in film schools and inspire many aspiring film makers to start making movies. Probably my favorite of the year, along with ""The Tree of Life"".Unfortunately, some critics might say (some have already said) it is style over substance; that while the film looks beautiful, it has no emotional support to sustain it or make it transcendent. I completely disagree. Mulligan's character provides all the heart the film needs. Her vulnerability and deep love for her son changes the Driver. She is what ""Drives"" him to do what he does. She turns the average joe into a hero, or maybe anti-hero. Even though he is very stoic and not really effusive, he unveils himself to her near the end, and this is the true heart of the film. See, the title might not only refer to steering wheels, shifting gears, and speeding, but perhaps most importantly to the DRIVE that Irene introduces into The Driver.This film is truly a spectacular achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pulsing,"This movie was great. It was unusual and felt more like a theater space being filmed instead of a movie. That partly made it great. These set pieces felt so unique and singular. Action sequences flowed like liquid onto film accompanied by a spectacular. I repeat, spectacular soundtrack. The sound acted as dialogue in a lot of the scenes which I enjoyed very much. It never felt like a music video; it felt like an internal monologue for the characters. Each track lined up so well with the blocking and direction it was almost scary. These 80's pop punk beats fused with synth made for one hell of a ride and a vicious one for certain. The actors did very well. Each actor had their set and sometimes the music was their partner. There were times when their expression and beats made each scene because I remember the feeling of the scenes more than the dialogue. That feeling propelled throughout and was amplified by the cast and sound. It wasn't a movie about what was being said. It was about what was being done. This movie drove up my spine with neon lights and grit. Great job to the cast and director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fantastic Voyage,"Let's get one thing out the way from the get go: While I do like the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise for what it is (I'm not really a car person), do not watch this expecting something similar. It's tough making predicaments and telling people to watch something or to steer clear of certain things. But I knew when I told a friend to stay away from this, that he would hate it. Sure enough, he told me later he didn't like the movie at all. How'd I know? Because he thought ""Being John Malkovich"" was bad too (I'm not comparing those either, just trying to convey, that this is more a ""head"" movie, than a ""gut"" movie).While terribly overlooked by the Oscars (and the Globes for that matter, only one nod each), this is superior filmmaking. Refn will be known to his fans for the Pusher trilogy, but also for the movie ""Valhalla Rising"" (which btw. was hated by most people in the video store I work ... goes to show you what taste they have. And I don't mean that in a negative fashion, they just like their Blockbusters more).Ryan Gosling is superb in a role that has him talk as little as possible. I almost thought the entire beginning was ""voice-less"" until I watched it again. Also the title ""Drive"" does not necessarily stand for driving per se. It can also mean the motivation, the inspiration in ones life. Something that makes us continue on our ""journey"".I haven't even touched the surface of the movie yet. One of the greatest things (besides the acting, the story, the cinematography ...) is the soundtrack. The electro pop is fitting as is Goslings outfit. While not original (and therefor the only category I'm not mad the Oscars didn't nominate the movie) the score almost elevates the movie onto a new higher level.Don't get it twisted though.

I had no idea...,"This movie showed me again, that even today is possible to see marvelous piece of art of movie-making, and I didn't have any idea what's this is going to be all about, in other saying: no trailer have been seen with my eyes.The production set us Back into the 80's, well, I haven't been even born at that time, but the music, the character of city, and cast, mostly talking' about the ""Scorpion"" (*to miss any Spoilers*) Brings up the tone from that times.

My favorite,"What can I say? I love this movie. I was first introduced to this movie threw the video game named ""Hotline Miami"" which credits ended thanking the director of the movie ""Drive"". Since I absolutely loved this game and wanted to play or watch anything similar to it I decided to watch it. I was expecting a normal mainstream movie that I was used to seeing on TV, boy was I wrong. This is one of the only movies I consider to be perfect, everything from the cast, directing, acting, atmosphere, and soundtrack. This movie probably holds a lot more meaning to me than most movies as it introduced me to a different kind of movie genre that I didn't even knew existed,and also the soundtrack in the movie has introduced me to my favorite genre of music too. I wouldn't have ever discovered a lot of my favorite movies and actor if it wasn't for Drive such as: The Place Beyond the Pines, Bronson, Lars and the Real Girl, Only God Forgives, and Valhalla Rising.

Good. Not great.,"Drive is that kind of movie that you'll either like it a lot or not (cause if you were so - so about it, you should've stopped it when you started getting bored). The plot is interesting and harsh. It makes you want to see what happens next.The music is unbelievable and it runs all over the film. One thing i liked about it is that, even when i was paying attention to a conversation, the music would stick to the background. You can listen to a whole track! The photography is amazing. Warm and cold colors blend beautifully.The performances weren't extra-ordinary in this movie, in my opinion. Ryan Gosling is very talented and he's making a major break through these last few years but i didn't see something special. He also seems to already have a leading role in another film by the director of Drive, Nicolas Winding Refn, in Only God Forgives that's in pre-production. Nice supporting performances from Carey Mulligan (Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps) and Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad TV series, Contagion, The Lincoln Lawyer).Be prepared for some slow rolling movie rhythm. Don't get caught up by the title. There is some good driving in it -and i've always wanted to see a Chrysler 300 chasing and bumping on a Mustang GT 5.0- but that's just about it.

A Unique and Stylish Film,"This neon drenched compelling narrative is not only better than something like it should be, but is masterly crafted to be so. Ryan Gosling provides a rather good performance as his often silent character, with Bryan Cranston providing a well supporting performance as always by his side, as well as Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan. The film is brutal, but isn't so without a sense of purpose, the film knows exactly what it is, and does itself justice by being so and doing it so stylishly. The film is beautifully shot, with a great soundtrack, and a by far interesting script. In the end, Drive is not the best revenge action thriller out there, but it certainly is quite out there, and in the best of ways.

"Rent, don't buy","Wow. Not. After reading a few reviews and all the 4 syllable adjectives used to describe this film, I decided to buy it (boring weekend). Mistake. It's entertaining but it's not Bullitt, folks. CrispyCrunchy says: ""See it because it will make you a better person.""? You've got to be kidding ...Not particularly impressed with Ryan Gosling - in anything yet. Always seems to come across as the silent, smooth-as-silk tough guy (he doesn't even have a name, just ""Driver"" ... sends shivers), but I think it's more like Ludes with Wild Turkey and forgetting his lines.Albert Brooks is great, but he usually is. Took me a minute to recognize Oscar Isaac from Robin Hood, and he's definitely got the role(s) of a weasel down pat. But Ron Perlman? C'mon. Stick to Hellboy sequels and Red Lobster commercials.Let's also not pretend this is an original. Written by? Screenplay? Please. See Ryan O'Neal's 1978 ""The Driver"". Add ""The"", remove the R and we've got ourselves another movie!Frankly, I think Chris Pine's attitude would have made it a better film. Save your money and wait for it to come out on TBS.

Restored my faith in Hollywood,"Let me start by saying that Drive is one of the best films in recent years and certainly the best that 2011 had to offer.I've seen some comments on here criticising Drive for it's lack of dialogue or the 1-2 minute pauses between some conversations. The irony of course is that it's exactly this element of the movie, the driver and Irene's characters ability to express their thoughts/feelings through simply eye contact, stares, smiles and other facial expressions and body language as well as the beautiful camera work that sets this movie apart from the usual Hollywood blockbuster nonsense.The Driver(hero) character is an introverted individual hence he why he says very little(again not like the usual Vin Diesel style lead role) but he is supremely cool at the same time, note the carm collected pauses. The pauses between dialogue from the Driver are majestically done, Goslings timing and performance here is exceptional, they manage to deliver a feeling of tension, passion, happiness, excitement, comfort and coolness personified to the viewer. Its a lesson in how an audience can be captivated and intreged by nothing more than two people, so comfortable and happy in the each others company, simply enjoying the silence/moment, who needs CGI, guns and explosions. The short but shocking violence that breaks out in the movie along with THAT mesmorising and beautiful lift scene, of course perfectly completes our mysterious driver character. That then brings me on to the soundtrack, which is nothing short of mindblowing and the perfect accompaniment to Drives exceptional acting, lighting and camera work.An instant classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Like an art movie without an interesting story to tell...,"I heard good things about this film from a couple different sources. After a fairly well done opening, I was geared to like this movie. But then every scene following the opening... just... very... slowly... gets... sorta somewhere. We'll get to why in a moment.The cinematography is beautiful to look at. Everything looks fairly well composed.The acting. I don't see any flaws here. Every actor is on top of things and delivering.Action (any scene with action-like elements, whether fighting, or bank robbing, etc), for the most part, this stuff is all good, what there is of it. No complaints here. This probably comprises 20-25 minutes of the entire film.Then what's my problem? The story. It is such a simplistic story stretched out over its running time and almost all the dialogue scenes are slowly paced. Meaning, an actor says a line, seconds pass, and then the other actor responds or makes some kind of facial reaction. A few seconds later, another line. And this accounts for most of the dialogue scenes, stretch that across the hour and 38 minutes, and the film drags. What might have made a really killer 35-45 minutes is agonizingly boring at 1 hour and 38 minutes.The pacing reminds me of maybe an art-house film, but without an interesting story (with preferably weird moments, even better if they are preferably weird wtf moments) to back up the slower pacing, what am I being rewarded with sitting through all this? I want to clarify one thing, before anyone thinks I'm just one of those action junkies or MTV generation types who can't stand slow movies... not so. I absolutely love Road to Perdition, which is full of well composed shots, beautiful cinematography, superb acting, and actually has a lot more interesting and emotional things happening through its length. It has many slow moments, but these moments add life to the canvas. Drive, on the other hand, is just boring.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Moody, atmospheric, stunning","From the beginning, it's clear Drive is not a standard-order action film. It takes its characters as seriously as its chases, shootouts, and fights. Neither aspect is short-changed, and the music and cinematography are used to establish and sustain tone. This is a moody film, with moments of understated, dark humor and bleakness. Most importantly, it shows that movies can generate a testosterone-and-adrenaline cocktail without requiring viewers to undergo a frontal lobotomy to appreciate the result. Perhaps Drive is an action movie for those who don't ordinarily like action movies. It's also an action movie for those who crave them like a drug. Employing unusual camera angles and a unique sense of style, director Nicolas Winding Refn takes us on a journey that gets us to feel something for the characters while still receiving an adrenaline rush when the speedometer races into the red zone.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A perfect match for a Sunday night,"It's not just a classic action movie, it really is a masterpiece along with its soundtrack. The principal characters are stunning. Carey Mulligan, unexpectedly branching out from her usual typecasting, plays the part of a young mother and an inmate's wife so naturally that one could hardly imagine she has never had such an experience in her real life. Ryan Gosling as an extraordinary and poised stuntman in the beginning has turned out to be a man of principle by the end of the film. The main thing is that nobody tries to tie you up into a knot by telling two or three parallel stories, nevertheless the plot is intense and makes you feel truly involved in every situation the characters have to face.

Given this summary, you would expect exciting chase scenes, a dumb plot and probably some likable but slightly sleazy characters.The film is nothing like that, though. There are action scenes, certainly, and some of them are quite exciting, but the focus is very much on the human drama, and especially the relationship between the (unnamed) main character and his single-mother neighbour, played by Carey Mulligan.All this is filmed beautifully by the rapidly rising director Nicholas Winding Refn. It's visually quite a stunning film, and the main character has an underlying innocence that sometimes bursts through his near-autistic social awkwardness.

It also seems so, if you think why he helped the man, and how it turned out (do not help, do not be a hero in this cruel world, it won't pay back).

Drive did. why is that? because it is such a refreshing breath of fresh air from most everything else around. this is my first review on this site, and the reason i've been compelled to time in on it is because there are a lot of people out there that missed the point on this film, as you'll see in the boards. they complain about the lack of action and sometimes dialogue. this is not an action movie, by any means. that's not to say there aren't very well done action scenes sprinkled tastefully throughout , or that it is a straight out drama. this a slow-burning crime thriller and is obviously VERY reminiscent of the 80s, mostly through it's synth-pop ""theme song"". this is a film that takes its time, builds up the suspense of a scene or sometimes throughout multiple scenes and then finally explodes in a magnificent, often very graphic, act of violence. there were many beautiful scenes and all the actors gave great, memorable performances. I highly recommend you see it if you're into that sort of thing",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
For sure worth seeing..... but,"I would definitely recommend it, especially for the performances. The stand out is Albert Brooks. He was and always is amazing. I normally don't like Ron Pearlman, but he did well here.My only criticism is that it is a little slow at times and relies a little too much on tone. I.e. Music driving scenes, rather than cutting down and getting to the point quicker.Overall I think a good 15 minutes could have been cut and you would have had an even better film. It's nice to have a moment in a film, but we don't need 30 of them. I refer to the slow-motion moments with music. They lose impact when overdone.Having said that, I still think it was good and much better than a lot of films coming out. Likely one of the best of 2011.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
DRIVEL not Drive,"They got the title so very wrong on this one....it should have been DRIVEL.This would be the most overrated movie of 2011.Hopefully Gosling got paid per word spoken.Yes, there is a story and yes there is action but they could have cut the first hour off and you would still have the entire story.Sorry I'm ranting but there have been many more enjoyable movies this year that have had scores way lower than this.2 mins of Driving and 58 mins of Gosling trying to look cool, then the film starts to actually get better",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Return of the Action Hero,"Previous to watching this movie the name Nicolas Winding Refn may mean very little to you, but after establishing himself as a master of atmosphere in his direction of Drive we may see the name much more often. It's easy to link elements of this film to some of his previous work like Bronson, especially in the way the characters are established, But this film being on a larger 'Hollywood' scale it packs a bigger punch.I think the main aspect of this film's originality is the unique 'dream like' atmosphere that's created. The films score in particular helps this with the use of mainly electronic and synth music which gives an 80's vibe to the film and creates real depth to the scenes. A big surprise was the quality of acting provided by Ryan Gosling who gave an powerful but low key performance in which his character was enigmatic and secretive. In-fact the lead role known to the viewer as ""the driver"" acted as the main reason for why i compare this film in many ways to the 1976 title Taxi Driver. Both these films contain a similar narrative structure and lead character personalities with both being played as inconspicuous but deadly under the circumstances of the plot.Drive certainly gives us a return to action films of the past with the focus on atmosphere, plot and emotion rather than on the exaggerated special effects that we have become used to over the past 10 years. It also gives the Director an increased reputation and also spells the end of a good year for Ryan Gosling with both Drive and the Ides of March set to give him a new direction in film.In conclusion Drive is an atmospheric and interesting thriller that provides decent acting quality and a return to the heyday of the old action hero a must watch film of 2011.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An unexpected pleasant surprise,"This is my first review for IMDb and I have to say that I've decided to do so because this movie has made me feel something I haven't felt with any other movie in the last few years.As an overall, the words which would better describe this feeling are ""strangely beautiful"". Lots of people have criticized the long pauses and silents from the actors, and even though they have transmitted me more than dozens of spoken dialogs in other movies. Looks are self-explanatory, vibrant and full of emotions and unspoken things. The main character is completely awesome, one of those who will stay in your memory, full of details and with a meaning for everything he does, says or doesn't say. And the music is really good, with an 80's flavor but not being completely old-fashioned. I can still remember the songs in my mind.Anyway, and I think this is the source for all the bad feedback this movie has got, you must be aware that this is not one of the latest kind action movie. You won't see spectacular chases, nor long shooting scenes, nor even explosions. This doesn't mean it is not violent; I can assure you it has some of the more violent scenes you could watch in the last few years.As a summary, I recommend this movie as a whole product. It may not be a great action movie, nor a romantic one, nor a noir movie and at the same time, it is all together at once. I would dare to say that if you liked Leon, you will like this one as well as both movies are more about the persons and their relationship than the action itself.

"""Drive"". The Masterpiece of 2011","Never wrote a review on IMDb before, but since i have been reading all these negative reviews regarding the so called ""slowness"" or lack of dialog, i felt it was necessary to share my thoughts about, in my eyes, the masterpiece of last year.To begin with, if you haven't seen this title, do yourself a favor and watch it.You definitely have to see it without expecting a ""Fast & the Furious"" fast action fix type of movie. It's the whole vibe of the movie, including the amazing score that will leave you thinking as if you were in another world.And while the casual moviegoer might think of it as a slow film, its the raw emotion (or lack of) of Ryan Goslings' character that makes this movie a masterpiece. The pauses between conversations, scenes where Goslings' character is looking out of a window, zooming in on his shadow, just add to the whole style of the movie.I think its a really hate it or love it affair, once you sat through a viewing you will either be feeling you saw the most immersing, beautiful film in years, or you will think of it as tedious & boring.If you belong to the latter, i have lost all hope in humanity. I seriously think that the people who gave this movie a bad review, are either wishing this movie was directed by Michael Bay, or have no perception of raw emotion.I missed the opportunity to see it in the theaters, and boy do i regret it. The movie was nominated for the Oscar in sound editing, and that was more than deserved. The score was absolutely amazing, and made the movie so much more immersing.And trust me, after you sat through the movie, you will be wanting to buy the soundtrack to immerse yourself back into the dreamy atmosphere that it offered.I saw ""Drive"", with high expectations, and it totally lived up to them. If you are in for a serious, at points gory but most of all immersing masterpiece, you can't go wrong with ""Drive"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I didn't know what they meant when they said Gosling hit it out of the park,"But it doesn't take long to agree completely. I hadn't really enjoyed his roles until now. This one features a very low key guy most male viewers will admire as coming from the cool guy side of the movies. What's surprising is that Gosling gave no inkling, to me anyway, that he could handle or seem appropriate for this kind of role. And that makes the fact that someone did see it in him, almost as impressive as his performance. But enough of that. You'll form your own opinion, I'm sure. Let's just say you'll have fun doing so especially since this is not a role that tries for something that couldn't actually be.Another surprise for me was the direction in this film. I haven't seen this kind of treatment in a long time. It's reminiscent of spaghetti westerns but really it's its own style. I especially liked the sense of being in the main character's car and this director's sense of timing. All, like a spaghetti western, enhanced by well selected music.There's violence, more than I expected, but nothing that I can't believe could actually happen given the story. However, this might turn off female viewers in particular, as it did my wife's friend. And it's why the film is rated R.There are a couple of small points I could quibble about but I thoroughly enjoyed myself, so enough said.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Slightly above average action, drama carried by Gosling's great performance","Not the best Ryan Gosling film I've seen but not the worst I've seen either.Before watching this film I heard soo many good things about it and I have to say after finally watching it I thought it was a bit overhyped.Ryan Gosling gives a great performance as the Driver and he conveys a lot through his acting rather through dialogue which really goes to show his acting ability. Some great action scenes with a surprising amount of blood which I did not expect. But other than that there's not much else here, a great supporting cast featuring the talents of Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, and Oscar Isaac.The story is solid enough, the subplot with Driver's neighbor/love interest never really captured me I understood the point of her relationship with Driver but I just didn't care about her. My biggest problem with this film is nothing really happens as well as lacking any sort of depth. I would've been more interested in seeing Driver take on more jobs and more driving sequences, which were really well done.Can't say I'm disappointed as I never really had any expectations for this film. Putting the issues I had with it aside it was a solid drama film and Gosling carrys, I just would've wanted more to happen.IMDb: 6/10

Worst (or one of) Movie of the Year,"This has to be one of the worst this year. After reading some of the other reviews I had to wonder just what movie did the other reviewers see OR do they just not get out that much OR have they never really seen a movie before.I went to this movie thinking that it was a remake of the 1978 The Driver with Ryan O'Neal, which was just a great movie (which I'm going to have to purchase after seeing this lame want-to-be imitation, that didn't even come close).To start:The music was horrible and for the most part just drove me and my son to want to leave within the first 20 minutes. You know how you can sometimes tell how good (or how bad) a movie will be just by listening to the music in the opening (and throughout). Well this was clearly one of those movies. I stayed because of all of the great reviews on IMDb thinking that the move would redeem itself in the near future, but it never happened.The cast was okay and their performances were, eh... But Gosling's character was for the most part a sociopath and was in NO WAY like the Steve McQueen characters of old. Very disappointed in the other reviews making this comparison as I am a huge McQueen fan. It just wasn't there.The action:There was none really. And there definitely was not any driving and what ""was"" there was very poor. I kept waiting on some cool chase scene or trick move that would happen and of the three driving scenes that I remember, but I think there were only two, they just fizzled. Nothing to watch there. Even the opening driving scene was just lame. Nothing cool. Nothing clever.Do your self a favor and don't go and see this movie. Wait until it's out on DVD and rent it or wait for the TV version.

Modern Noir,"""If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place. I give you a five-minute window, anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours no matter what. I don't sit in while you're running it down; I don't carry a gun... I drive."" Driver (Ryan Gosling)I can't believe it! Driver is a suitable companion to The Debt and Point Blank, two outstanding thrillers of summer 2011. Maybe it's because I just co-hosted a Western film series with heavy doses of Eastwood. While this film features a lone hero, Driver (Ryan Gosling), in the taciturn mode of Westerns and Scorsese urban tales, it also is a study of small time hoodlums trying to get along.Drive is a blend of action and psychology as we try to figure out how this Hollywood stuntman drives for crimes, survives, and quietly loves his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her son, Benecio (Kaden Leos). Protecting those two is the clue to seeing the other side of his robotic mien, the entrée into his humanity. Alas, that care is the source of losing his independence and safety. With the likes of criminal kingpin Bernie Rose (a surprisingly effective Albert Brooks) hanging about, no one, not even our ultra-competent hero, is safe.Director Nicholas Winding Refn has jumped to the head of the line for cinematography that matters (see the reflective shots), elevating what may be a classic thriller into a study of marrying sight to meaning. Wait! Wait! The original music by Cliff Martinez has vocals so well wedded to meaning as to make even me, a screenplay-loving critic, take notice.When I began seeing Robert De Niro as I watched Driver's lonely odyssey, and when I thought of Steve McQueen driving the hills of San Francisco as Driver careened through L.A.'s mean streets, I knew I was in the presence of a modern noir with the trappings of a classic.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Best film of 2011.,"87/100The movie did its homework because:1. It understands camera language and how to use it in its favour, especially at some scenes that people would catalogue as pacing-screwing, having some long, beatifully shot sequences that completely take advantage of the wide-screen aspect ratio -unlike other films-2. It knows what the spectator wants to see and really takes its time to give it to us whenever it wants to and for as much time as it desires.3. It recognized that every line delivered, no matter how long or short, should have a purpose in the film, again, no matter how big or small, not even a specific period of time needs to pass.4. Ryan Gosling, once again, strikes with another subtle yet clear-cut performance that keeps on proving why he's the biggest nitpicker on Hollywood when it comes to choosing roles.5. The movie has a clear sense of editing -for the most part- that specially helps at those car-chase scenes and a fantastic soundtrack that'll sure stay in my mind -and playlist- for a long time.Even when the tonal shift might be a little abrupt to some people, especially considering the fact that the film pretty much doen't mind giving much of an explanation to it -which would support the movie's own u-turn it makes to really have it feel even more hasty-, Drive just has so many layers to it that it almost feels impossible to take all of its good things for granted.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Gritty character drama that is unfolded with grace and nuance.,"""Drive"" reminded me in many ways of another excellent mobster film entitled ""Eastern Promises"" - both are made with a noticeable level of maturity, in that neither are afraid of moving at their own pace, and both tell a very intriguing character driven narrative which, by chance, happen to revolve around drivers. Events unfold, not slowly, but methodically; there are bursts of violence which disturb us, but it isn't played for entertainment; characters interact with one another realistically, and they get to know one another in ways which we find plausible and inherently satisfying.""Drive"" tells the story of a youngish man, played by Ryan Gosling, living in Los Angeles who works as a stunt man in the local film industry and moonlights as a getaway driver for the common crook. When driving for some petty criminals who need someone to get them out of dodge fast in the dead of night following a warehouse robbery, he is in his element avoiding accidents and dodging the police - as a stuntman, his job under the bright Californian sunshine consists of getting involved in ORGANISED accidents. Perhaps symbolically, he must don masks in order to look like the character which ought to be doing the driving.The opening warehouse heist itself is a piece of work - untypically for the genre, the film decides to teasingly hang back in the quiet confines of the car as the actual theft happens - it cleverly utilises a two minute shot-clock countdown radiating from the car stereo blaring out a basketball game to crank up the suspense. We have already had it confirmed to us in the opening scene that a smart looking sports car in a sea of old 1950's relics is ""very"" our lead, inferring an air of modernity in a man otherwise operating in a world of older models.These particular 'models' consist of borderline acting heavyweights Bryan Cranston; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman, who are dead-on the right choices for their respective roles when it may have been tempting to merely cast the likes of James Woods; Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Each of these particular characters come to occupy important, yet dangerous, places in our lead's world: Shannon, played by Cranston, is a film director who employs Gosling's character to do all the stunt work - his limp and twitchy mannerisms, in what is a wonderful performance, exudes a kind of nervousness where there doesn't seem to be the need for any.Bernie (Brooks), meanwhile, looks to employ Gosling as a stock-car racer - director Nicolas Winding Refn places him above Gosling when they first meet, and lingers on Brooks' outstretched hand as they go to shake for a little too long for it not to mean something. Nino, played by Perlman, runs a local restaurant - he clashes with Bernie, but they are evidently equal in general stature. At home, more importantly still, is Irene (Carey Mulligan), who lives down the hall in the apartment block with a young son and a husband in prison. It is through his interactions with her that Winding Refn tells the story of his lead becoming somebody else, juxtaposing her softly spoken demeanour with the other character who will play the biggest role in this chapter of his life in the form of Bernie, a tough-talking tough guy.One particularly impressive stroke from the film lies in how Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), behaves upon being released from prison. We sensed the film may have gone down a route of depicting a budding relationship between the lead and Irene, only for the husband to re-arrive on the scene and have something to say about it, but it doesn't unfold like that. Moreover, Standard is not merely some psychopath - he appears weak, and is even mired in some money trouble. It is then though these debts that the final act of the film is propelled wherein Gosling's character become more heavily involved than he'd like.""Drive"" is full of various feats of film-making which, for me, places it above most films of its genre. Certainly, the manner about which everybody seems to get along with one another during the opening act is incredibly deceptive in one sense, and I think if the film appears overly-violent; shocking or even completely unpredictable, then it is for the reason that Winding Refn does not unfold the second half of his film with characters behaving symptomatically of how they interacted in the first half.Additionally, and without giving anything away, what occurs during the raid on the pawn shop catches us totally off-guard because Gosling's character had already been established to be the ultimate professional in getting away from robberies. The opening heist was more complicated; unfolded in a larger building and was at night in the dark, so we expect the pawn shop robbery to run smoothly. The film then goes on to subvert heist genre norms by revolving the last scenes around a character wanting to RETURN the spoils of a theft to its rightful owner as they hunt him down anyway.Chiefly, ""Drive"" is a character study with Gosling's nameless driver at the heart of it - he is transitioned from being robotic and somewhat faceless to being someone who cares about somebody else and their predicament. When he agrees to be involved in the pawn shop robbery, he is doing so out of compassion for Irene and the family rather than strictly for the cheque - the traffic rushing by in opposite directions in the background, as he sits in a diner realising this, seems to signify the scrambling his core outlook has just begun to undertake. With its performances; direction and story-telling on top of this, ""Drive"" is very easy to recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive moves slowly with lots of violence,"Trailers made Drive out to be a car heist, action-type movie (probably to attract a wider audience), but the trailers were misleading.Drive is a slow-moving, violent drama. Ryan Gosling's character spends much of the movie listening or thinking, often while driving, which tends to really stall the movie (especially with the recurring slow-motion camera work). But, Ryan does a good job with an introverted character who tries to help out his neighbor. He makes you want to root for him.Ryan's awkward love interest is played by Carey Mulligan. She didn't do much with a rather lifeless character.After an hour to setup the conflict, the movie quickly devolves into a series of very violent encounters which are at odds with the first half of the movie. The stark contrast heightens the violent feel of the film.Overall, I enjoyed the movie, though it was not what I expected.

"Get Ready to Be Played Like a Piano. And Pounded Like One, Too.","The first time we see the Driver, he's the wheelman for a getaway car, who evades police pursuit not simply with speed and force but by taking calm advantage of the street landscape and outmaneuvering his chasers. Its up there with some of the best car chases I've ever seen. By day, he's a stunt driver for action movies. The two jobs are no contradiction for him: He drives. As played by Ryan Gosling, he's in the convention of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name and Alain Delon's Jef Costello. No family, no past and ostensibly few feelings. He's an existential hero, It would seem, characterized completely by his actions.That would meet the criteria for the hero of a tedious action movie, but Drive is an utterly graceful implementation of style, and its feelings may be submerged but they resonate intensely. The mystery of Gosling's wheelman is surrounded by a fertile balcony of tangential actors who are clear about their plans and suspicions, and who have either reached an understanding with the Driver, or not, yet another example of the old Hollywood noir tenet that a movie breathes not merely through its hero, but from its shadows.The Driver actually lives somewhere. Somehow that seems amazing. Played by Carey Mulligan, his neighbor is a model for defenselessness. She has a young son, Benicio, who appears to motivate warmth in the Driver, though he isn't a demonstrative sort. They become friendly, but soon, her husband Standard is sprung from prison. Counter to our almost certain expectations, Standard isn't resentful or antagonistic toward the new friend, but evaluates him, sees someone formidable, and find they can help each other. That will supply the locomotive for the story, and as Irene and Benicio are threatened, the Driver unravels intense feelings and allegiances, and suffers massive peril at little real advantage to himself.The film is populated with characters who bring volumes to the screen, counter to the Driver, who brings nothing but pure presence. Ron Perlman looks to be a major operator working out of the petty frontage of a strip mall pizzeria. Albert Brooks, every bit as formidable as you'd never expect, plays a producer of the sorts of B movies the Driver drives stunt for, one of his business ventures as a powerful local mobster. These people are cold-blooded. More benevolent is the great Bryan Cranston, as the sort of guy the Driver has to have backing him, a whiz at car repairs, and supercharging.Drive appears to have little CGI. Most of the stunt driving seems authentic, with cars of mass and heaviness, instead of ridiculous animated fantasies. The whole movie, actually, is incomparably more genuine than the typical action-crime-chase fabrications we've become bored with. Here's a movie with deference to writing, acting, technique and well-informed moviegoers. The crucial feeling you want to experience during a chase sequence is participation in its intent. You have to worry. Almost always nowadays, we're just watching fast machinery.Ryan Gosling is a magnetic actor, a modest one. He exemplifies aura and unaffectedness. For as long as we've been seeing him in movies, he's demonstrated a knack for discovering striking, commanding characters. An actor who can make us believe he's become smitten by an anatomically correct doll can realize practically anything. Drive looks like one kind of movie in the ads, and it is that kind of movie, but also a rebuke to most of the movies it looks like.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Perfect Heist,"This movie should be called ""The Perfect Heist"" NOT Driver. Ryan Gosling played the perfect get away driver. Unfortunately this movie came short. Like in most heist movies, you can figure out the plot, well this is it. Small time thugs committing robberies and ended up in a jam, everything snowball afterward. Ryan's personal life has caused chaos to everyone around him. What I was hopping from him is to get out before it's too late. Most career criminals don't know when to bail out. These situations leave you with only three options jail, dead, or retirement.This movie seems to drag a little, him falling in love with one of his partner in crime wife and others chasing after him. At one moment where the driver seems to be out smarting everyone and other times he seems to be too violent. Most of these movies seems to leave a message. The only thing I got from this is how one person's life seems to ruin a lots of lives. The plot was obvious and action kept me on the edge of my seat. However, if the story line had a meaning behind it, a little twist to the move, it would've gotten a better review from me. I was hopping it falls into the classics but it's still a great movie to see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

best film ever,Drive is the best and I'm gonna leave it at that. Trolls probably don't agree but that's just because they are so jealous that they couldn't have seen it first. People like Quentin Tarantino he was just mad because he didn't make it first. And another thing is in all of his movies the characters talk too much i know he likes dialog but he has taken it to far. And he hates inception and drive and we all know i cant be having that. Drive was the best how much do you a ll wanna bet he was high as a kite that day? If I had a dime for every time i said i loved it i would have over a million dollars. Its true i love that movie hecka bad. I think its time Quinn came out of his shell and said the same. If he knows it why does he never admit it? Good question right?

I guess they'll ignore it.,"""Drive"" with no doubt is one of the best-made-movies of the decade. it took u back to 80s. the music, Original Sound Track, cinematography, directing, screenplay, etc. are all amazing. it has just 2 or 3 driving scene, because it's not a driving or action movie, it's about characters.These characters have been written really deep. Ryan Gosling & Carey mulligan have actually done nothing special! And that's great about them in this movie. They both are so believable. I'd say Gosling would receive the Oscar if DiCaprio hadn't played in J. Edgar!But, what made this movie masterpiece is the directing and the screenplay. Nicolas Winding Refn (director) & Hossein Amini (writer) have done an unforgettable job. don't miss this movie, it's flash of a genius.

"A dark, stylist and tense neo-noir film","Drive was seen as one of the best films of 2011, so much so that fans were angered and upset that the Academy Award ignored it. It is fast becoming a cult classic and oozes style in what is a very brutal thriller.Driver/Kid (Ryan Gosling) is a young mechanic and part-time stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for heists and bank robberies. He is a quiet man who lives alone, but he has a cool menace underneath. Driver soon befriends his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos). But when Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison, Driver ends up having to help the man with his protection debts and runs up against two powerful gangsters, Nico (Ron Perlman) and Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks).Nicolas Winding Refn is certainly showing why he is a hot young talent as a director, creating a dark, constantly tense film, amplified by the dark visuals and the 80s like soundtrack. Winding Refn knew how to build up scenes and develop characters even with a lack dialogue. The action and crimes scenes were quick and well shot, particularly the day light car chase and the shooting in the model. Some of the violence was a little over the top, which made the film deserve it's 18 rating in the UK, but it did add to the brutal nature of the film. There was always a constant brooding feeling about Drive, with it at boiling point all the time.The cast is great throughout. Gosling as already mention was a quiet character but felt like he can be really threatening when he did turn. There was a lot of mystery toward this character, we don't know his name let alone his past and Gosling brought that to live and making him seem like a character you do not want to mess with. Mulligan is of course a very talented actress and she shows it again here as she plays a regular, struggling lone mother and Brooks' character seem to have a lot more depth then just being a ruthless gangster, that he there is a real character and moral duality about him.Winding Refn certainly does not make out that they there is any glamour in this life of crime, Driver lives a lonely, isolated live and even when he does get close to someone he still tries to put some distance between them and unwilling or unable to love. The main gangsters were still just thugs, they did not live the high life, they dress in unflattering clothes and do not have legions of followers as they have to be very hands on in their profession. The crimes themselves are quick and the driving was explained by the fact that Driver is a stunt driver.Drive is a truly tense, stylised crime film that is filled with brutal violence yet still has a subtle feel about it. It really is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Actions speak louder than words,"This is one of those films that targets a niche audience. If your one for the mainstream flicks that Hollywood endlessly feeds us, than there is a high chance that this movie will not satisfy your taste. But if your one for enjoying a grind/art house and or foreign picture, or simply something a bit outlandish, you may find Drive to be a very enjoyable and rememberable film. Its concoction of 80's throwback and modern ambient score meshed with ultra violence, the substitution of body language for words and a traditional crime noir genre picture wrapped in the structure of a fairy tale/super hero story, is what makes this tale unique. If you are a well rounded cinema goer then you most likely will recognize the pastiche of work borrowed (e.g. the man with no name Clint Eastwood character, korean style action pacing, Miami Vice/Bullet/Driver Esq crime plot) This interesting mix is what makes Drive so refreshing.Contrary to the cult following's love for this movie, numerous people have stated that Drive was god awful. But it's not that the movie is poorly crafted, but rather the greater audience simply cant be entertained or understand a film I would classify as introverted. What Gosling and Mulligan share on screen is a strong connection that is shown through action not words. This may not equate to the type of entertainment most Americans are accustomed to and that is one common reason why Drive falls short in the eye of the masses. Other's say the premise is cliché, I will admit I thought the same... but it's the near flawless execution of such common material that makes it so refreshing.Many critics and film enthusiasts love this picture because they don't watch films strictly for entertainment but rather for the craft of filmmaking and the deeper meaning behind the stories and character interactions; Drive is very much a film for the deep thinker. Im not saying it's an intellectual piece of cinema, but rather a movie where you must understand and enjoy the nature of passionate introverts and visual symbolism to really LOVE IT.Drive is easily in my top 5 films of 2011, top 50 of the past 10 years, and top 100 of what I've seen. If you're wondering why I only gave the movie an 8 out of 10 then, its because no movie in my eyes deserves a 10 or a 100% because no movie is perfect and it wont receive a 9 because although I love this film, due to its withdrawn/introverted minimalist nature, it lacks the ability to convey a wide range of emotions that the majority of truly outstanding films deliver.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Does the film really deserve the hype?,"I got to know Drive through various clips on the internet and quickly got the urge to watch it. I did this quite quickly and I have to tell you that I imagined him differently...
The opening of the film is really cool and is accompanied by an incredibly fitting song, which should be obvious if you've already seen the corresponding videos on all possible platforms. The song is by Kavinsky and is titled ""Nightcall"". I don't like the robot-like voice in this song, but I definitely like the feminine sound more. This coolness, which is conveyed right from the start, runs through the entire film and gives it its very own ""vibe"". Ryan Gosling, who plays the lead role, rarely speaks in this film, but he doesn't say many words since the plot isn't really complicated. The cast is really great and includes Bryan Cranston and Oscar Isaac, among others. From the beginning I had the image in my head that this was an exciting action film. In this regard I was a bit disappointed. Although Drive is often an exciting action film, it often becomes a love film because of all the scenes that deal with exactly this topic. In my opinion, there were far too many romantic scenes and far too little action, which could certainly add a lot of tension to this film. This film is supposed to be 18+? I'm laughing my ass off! Action and exciting moments are present and are often depicted in a very bloody and violent manner, but an age limit of 18 or more is not true. Nudity can be seen and insults can be heard as well, but it is not as extreme as other films in this classification and is therefore one of the reasons for me that this work was unfairly given this restriction. My opinion regarding the current age restrictions can perhaps be seen a little from this. The story is solid and, as I said, not totally complicated, which I completely agree with. The implementation is super stylish and I actually really like it. There are illogical moments that make no sense, one happens at the end and is related to a mask. Up to that point I actually thought the film was great, but I would have liked a much better ending.Drive is stylish, has interesting scenes and shines with its brutality, which is showcased (unfortunately a little too rarely). The romantic moments don't ruin the whole film, but they could really be more reduced. Sometimes this film is illogical and sometimes it is sublime.Despite a lot of criticism, this film is entertaining and often just cool!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drive,"Apparently, Ryan Gosling is much more than a pretty face. Being a girl who's mooned over him since I hit puberty, it's hard to accept he's so much more. I knew this of course, the minute I saw Half Nelson or even Lars and the Real Girl, but this is the first role that actually shocked my system. He has very little dialog in Drive and that doesn't drag the film in any way as far as I'm concerned. Ryan's fantastic ability to easily SHOW the audience that this is how he he feels, this is how he's going to handle it, was great and unnerving at times.It was not just an action film either. There weren't obnoxious clichés or stupid, unbelievable fight scenes because the driver somehow knew karate. It's realistic and a had an actual plot. It felt like this gritty place and this rough character were part of a world I could have lived in at some point. I didn't feel like I was watching some green screen on some sound stage.I haven't left the theater feeling this satisfied with what I sat through in a long time. Will it be overrated, over analyzed and over discussed as time goes on? Oh I'm sure it will. Does it deserve bragging rights and the cult following I can only hope it garners? Hell yes. From what I saw, Ryan Gosling deserves the praise. He even made me believe that Carey Mulligan was something worth fighting for (which is hard because she strikes me as blah) but I believed it and I rooted for him. Hopefully, the next person to see this movie will feel the same!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

As exciting as watching grass grow,"A stuntman whose greatest skill besides driving is the emotionless staredown befriends his harlot neighbour and her fatherless spawn, the ""baby daddy"" being in prison. (To make matters more unrealistic, she's white instead of black). Meanwhile, the stuntman gets involved in some dealing too boring to remember. Mr. Ex-Con daddy soon comes out of jail and, surprise, the bug-eyed, swarthy fool involved with some bad dudes whom the stuntman knows. Because the stuntman has an entirely sexless interest in the at best average-looking single mother smurf girl thing, he tries to get the bad guys off the lovely ""family's"" back.Nothing happens in this movie. The first half hour is a bunch of pseudo- '80s synthpop songs while the stuntman and the ugly single mother chick just stare at things. The stuntman's interactions with every other character consist of him staring. Just staring. Sometimes his mouth creaks an eight of an inch, I think it's supposed to look like a smile.The film has a few violent scenes, but they come so randomly and you have to wait for them so long that you're asleep by the time they happen.A totally pointless film that could've been edited down to forty minutes or so.

Simply one of the best films ever,"I have given a few 10 out of 10's before, but this movie was defiantly different. I like to think of a perfect 10 as a movie I'm going to watch again and again and be blown away every time. This movie fits that category but it just serves more. I love noir type movies and this was simply the best noir film ever. I wont go into the details of the film, rather give my thought.The characters all across the board were perfect and all roles given were done extremely well. Casting was perfect and I couldn't think of any other actors/actresses that could fit the roles that this cast did. Outstanding work on their part.The soundtrack was superb, it really fits the tone and give the film the noir feel. One of the best soundtracks in a film out there.At first when I heard about the story I thought it would be another transporter movie, all action and chase scenes. I was pleasantly surprised that it was nothing like that at all, the story was well put together, and written great.To keep this short, this was a fantastic film and is in my top 10 favourite films of all time. It was just clever and was a nice change to all the superhero and over-the-top action movies that we are all use to seeing. Its just too bad that its not getting on top of the box office and its not doing that great in the revenue category.

Makes you want to get in a car and just drive.,"3 1/2 out of 4 pointsLike a lot movies now a days, DRIVE belongs in a genre that has been done so many times. Ryan Gosling is a driver by day and a driver by night. He is a Hollywood Stuntman during the day and a getaway driver during the night. He has no emotions until he meets a special woman that lives next door to him who has a kid. Almost immediately they bond. He then pulls off another job that goes wrong and now he is marked for death.However, what is great about DRIVE is that it is a fresh take on the genre. Yes, it has car chases but not a single moment is CGI which is a nice break. The action of the chases is plausible and the director understands geography very well. But it is the character study of The Driver as well as everyone else and that is what holds the movie from falling apart. Otherwise it would of been all style and no substance. Ryan Gosling and its supporting players are colorful in their roles. Especially Ron Pearlman but its great to see Albert Brooks out of his comedic roles into a role that is serious and scary.The director is Nicolas Winding Refn who made only two films that I saw, BRONSON and VALHALLA RISING. I didn't finished VR but it was excellent so far as well as BRONSON. He made more movies prior to the two which I would love to see. He is a great art house director and DRIVE does not hide away from that. In fact, bringing the art house style is what help this movie. Any other way would NOT work.Overall, an excellent film that refreshes a genre that is dated and maybe...just maybe Hollywood will learn from this movie and make more movies like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Silently Awesome,"Like this film, I'm not gonna' do the same tedious review rather do it straightforward.Everyone in this review box has exhausted all the praises for this acclaimed film, which it rightfully deserves.I even doubted it was that awesome til' I actually saw it myself.I never heard anyone of my colleagues ever mentioned this film before for they were still preoccupied with movies commercially bitten by its franchise.I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you love cinema at its rawest form, you have to watch a film this caliber. If you love cars, especially with better drivers on it, very interesting drivers i might add, what's the wait for you reading this. If you tend for films that draws emotion through hypnotic score and brutally honest dialogue, go watch this now. And lastly if you can handle violence and love your suspense palpable yet still thrills you unexpected stop right here, call your local cinema and tell them you want a secured seat.For this film, Nicolas Winding Refn proves himself to be a wonder - craftsman with utter taste. Putting artistic perfection on such a commercially appealing hence relatively known plot.Speechless for Ryan Gosling as he's equally and effectively quiet in this film. He's mostly silent, but on his face is the summary of the scene.Drive didn't create much talk til' later half of this year but I'm certain it'll in the coming days after its wide release.It has reasons why I love going into theater without second thinking of paying.

Not 'Drive Angry 3D' - Pheeewww!!!,"As soon as we commence with 'Drives' quite brilliant opening, a cool but not so frantic getaway; it is clear that you don't mess with 'The Driver'. Ryan Gosling simply oozes class, cool and intimidation with a soon to be seen ruthlessness that, although not coming as a surprise (there is a clear, deep simmering, primal instinct beneath the calm exterior) is no less stunning.The prologue opening is simply awesome, calm yet tense, a cat and mouse hide and chase that gives us a stylish glimpse of the night blue metal cool of a Los Angeles to come; the same reflective, cold, hard LA seen in Michael Mann's 'Heat'. Held; up close shots, slow aerial pans and zooms add extra tension to Gosling's already smouldering, unflappable driver. Twinkling, grand cityscapes act as a backdrop to Goslings night crawling, flowing seamlessly into the superb 80's electro, thudding, iconic, pink neon title sequence.Stunt driver by day, wheelman by night, the driver is 'a man with no name' and of few words. He lets others do the talking, but he is forced into action when he starts up a tentative and restrained relationship with his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan). He agrees to help out her paroled husband to pay back a debt to an LA gangster by doing a small time heist, which goes badly wrong. In order to protect his neighbour and her son he has grown fond off, he embarks on a spree of ultra-cool violence which provides an insight into the true capability of our 'Driver'.Mulligan's and Gosling's on screen show radiates tension and is charged, owed to the subtle unknowing smiles and long silent gazes, both of them uncertain and equally tarnished.The definite quiet and the slow developing relationship of the opening play of 'Drive' is a purposeful device used to build tension for the inevitable second acts fallout of events, glimpsed at with 'Driver's' first tell of what lies beneath in a chance encounter with a previous associate, showing that he is as equally as brutal and intimidating with a few very measured words as he is when he is about to put a nail in someone's head. When he chillingly asks, often throughout ""Do you understand"" – you understand!The true tension that 'Drive' crafts from the off is all down to the fact that we are just watching and waiting for it all to escalate, and escalate it does. Responding only to aggravation, more passing triggers come as events unfold, 'Driver' will strike and decisively, symbolised no more so, than by the scorpion insignia on the back of his stunt jacket.Violence IS ultra, and often the mashed melon reveals someway detract from the style and methodical cool, what you don't see and the build from the pre-emptive slow-mos is often more foreboding and gripping than the imminent outburst of violence. Providing the calm before the proverbial storm of when gosling explodes into shocking action, gives more impact to 'Drive's' violent episodes. His interrogation of gangster's moll Blanche serves as a terrifying warning and an example of pure intimidation without violence, but we soon see what he is prepared to do, if the answers needed are not so forthcoming.Support is given by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman. Perlman is slightly disappointing as the token middle man goon Nino, but bigger boss Brooks is superbly malevolent as Bernie, who too shows a will equal to the 'Driver 'and will act with unflinching brutality.Christina Hendricks (Blanche) is underused and her appearance is borderline cameo. At only 100 minutes 'Drive' may have spent a little more time to flesh out these ancillary players some more, adding a greater character study that could have made it epic, especially when no back story is given to Goslings 'Driver'. Making Gosling's driver a 'man with no name' works and is the premier performance, adding greater mystery and allure, making 'The Driver' an Icon for any era. Gosling has already provided some memorable and brilliant performances in 'Blue Valentine' and 'Half Nelson' but 'Drive' is his iconic role so far.Nicolas Winding Refn's dynamic direction and a supreme soundtrack make 'Drive' a brilliant instant classic; an early entry as a great movie for this still new decade, comparable with 90's classic 'Heat', not as epic but on less lacking in style and cool.Drive is brilliant!

Driving has never been this cool...,"In the briefest of moments, especially as the summer starts to slowly dwindle away from our eyes, the cinema theaters can offer rare moments of vividness and intensity. Not so often, a film will come through, set the screens ablaze, and become an instant classic for years to come; Drive is this year's film. Academy Award nominated actor Ryan Gosling portrays the principle character, a stunt driver for movies who moonlights as a getaway driver. ""Driver"" as we will affectionately call Gosling's character, encapsulates the very being of a tortured soul with a heart of gold. What has lacked in our day of cinema that can leave much to be desired is simple character development. Not sure if it's the studios just going for a quick buck or if its writer/directors not giving the audience more credit than it deserves, but Drive remains both puzzling but equally satisfying in developing a character that shows nearly nothing and convinces us in a single moment like we've known him our entire lives. Nicolas Winding Refn, who jumped on the beat in 2008 for the British hit Bronson (2008), helms this film with precise and utter command. Refn's stylistic approach to directing is in the near top of films I've witnessed this new decade. His choices are luminous and sheer brilliant and stand next to the greats of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and even Alfred Hitchcock. He lets scenes speak for themselves as he holds onto silence, shadows, and music like armor on top of a bullet proof vest. It's the most worthy turn of Oscar consideration I've seen this year. He covers all his bases and coaches Ryan Gosling into developing one of the greatest performances of his career yet. He's subtle, subdued, and nearly unavailable for us to engage with but he speaks volumes, yelps poignantly, and gives us a peep hole sized view into the real ""Driver. The adaptation from James Sallis' book written by Oscar nominated writer Hossein Amini (The Wings of the Dove, 1997) is pitch perfect in pace and while the narrative isn't as wrapped up as tightly as one would hope, it's still an impressive feat for any writer. While Drive is owned solely by Ryan Gosling, the film's ensemble turns in outstanding work particularly Academy Award nominees Carey Mulligan and Albert Brooks. Brooks brings in an almost 'can't recognize him' type performance as he completely loses himself and transforms into a vicious and terrifying character. He takes his dark side to a whole new level. Mulligan is sensuous and electrifying holding her own against Gosling. Bryan Cranston is charismatic as ever. Ron Perlman's idiosyncrasies and commitment to the character is some of his best work to date. Oscar Isaac delivers fiery magic in his brief screen time. Drive acts like an 80's movie that got raped by A Clockwork Orange and this was the result. It inhabits a wonderful narrative that may seem familiar but translated as a film haiku of sorts that by movie's end, you won't realize the ride you've just endured.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Ron Perlman ('Hell Boy') played a stand over man in this film, and he did that well too. Some of the action shots were well done (there's a great slow-motion shooting scene) and the gore factor would put some so called 'horror' films to shame. The story (although not original) was done well and the cinematography was great. I heard the movie was made for 15 million dollars, well spent in my opinion. So I give this movie an 8 out of 10. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A breath of fresh air,"There were few films in recent years that I enjoyed quite as much as Drive. The main reason is that few films managed to surprise me as much: Drive managed to create expectations and then avert them several times over. It constantly straddles the line between genres - clearly channeling the action films of the 80's in its first half, then turning into a violent, character-driven crime drama. It also straddles the line between past and present, lovingly embracing the romanticism and energy of the classic action flicks, but contrasting it with dark, post modernistic nihilism.More importantly than all that, Drive dares to avoid the border that divided almost the entirety of American cinema in the last thirty years, the border between art and entertainment. Like some of the best films ever made - The Godfather, Silence of the Lambs, Pulp Fiction - Drive attempts both. And while it's not on the level of a masterpiece, it manages to be good art and good entertainment. It's well-paced, constantly intense and thrilling, and doesn't overstay its welcome - offering the viewer only glimpses of the characters, leaving us wanting more. It's also beautifully shot, with a moody and unnerving color scheme, and boasts a wonderful cast of top character actors (Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston and Carey Mulligan are great; Ron Pearlamn and Albert Brooks play against type and do a wonderful job) playing a group of fascinating and intricate characters.Drive is an action film, a crime thriller and an art-house drama rolled into one, but don't expect it to fulfill whatever expectations that description gives you. It's a simple film with a simple story, which immerses the viewer in completely and never lets them lose interest. Might not be a classic masterpiece to be remembered fifty years from now, but a damn good movie by any standard.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Oh My!!,"I would have to say it's going into my favourite list, because this is one of the most unique films I have watched this year. I left the cinema completely immersed in the characters world.It's a compelling action thriller with a sound track that is oddly perfect; it radiates an 80's twist. It just hit all the right places! The intensity of Ryan Goslings character was dominant though out the film, it bounced off the screen. Goslings character portrayed a strong, silent, and very dangerously manly.. Yet there is a quality of gentleness about him.The chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan was intense. I loved the dark romance of it. The tortured soul meets the sweet doe eyed girl. I want to say more but I'm afraid I would give it away for those who haven't watched it.The story line was brilliant, not at all predictable. The only down side was the build up was a bit slow in the beginning, I literally thought it was a drama movie at first, however I promise you, it makes up for it...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Go for a ride!,"On the surface this is an action-drama, heist-gone-wrong film. Beneath the surface in the night time of down town LA, we meet a driver. The scene opens with a man (Ryan Gosling) dictating his terms over the phone with a calm assured tone and we can gather from this he's a no-nonsense, no questions asked type of guy. He, is a getaway driver. He is highly intelligent in his field and in constant control of his emotions even when under pressure. By day, we see the protagonist again driving a car but this time as a Hollywood stunt driver and this is all we really get know about our lead. No name, no family, no explanation of why, where, when and how he is what he is; he's just a driver who becomes an enigma with the more we learn about others and the less we learn about him.The film is a slow burn. By this I don't mean it takes a while to get good, i mean that the pace is not rushed, there is the constant intense heat throughout, ensuring that the finished article is cooked to its fullest. This, is Drive. By the time the end comes you will no doubt say wow. Nicolas Winding Refn has topped his game with this picture and it's the recipe of Hossein Amini adapted screen play, the cinematography and a superb lead actor which produces a beautiful meal for the audience to enjoy.When The Driver finally rests he goes home to an apartment block where he instantly catches the eye of his neighbour, the beautifully innocent Irene (Carey Mulligan). They connect, and after helping Irene with her car, it's her young son who wants to bond with our usually impassive lead only this time some emotions are displayed as he takes a shine to the boy. Unfortunately after a week, her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison and rather than being violent towards a man who has been helping his wife, he weighs up The Driver and quickly befriends his new neighbour. Although Standard is out of prison he is not out of debt and when our protagonist spots him beaten up, his deep feelings for the family take over he agrees to help in a £1 million heist by being the man behind the wheel!To describe any more would ruin the movie, but the rest of the cast are all important. Bryan Cranston plays a surrogate father type or is the batteries of our Driver, if you will. Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks are your day time 'friends', night time gang members. Carey has a strong on screen connection with Ryan; however this is Ryan Goslings film. He embodies everything great about this movie. He is always cool, he picks roles that are challenging so he can produce his best and more importantly becomes the role rather then acts the role. If he wasn't already a wanted man, he is now.What's great is the film feels real, real time, real characters and no CGI in sight. The cinematography plays with lighting, initiating moods and emotions with panoramic shots while the mise en scene provides a 1980s atmosphere filled with 80's style music within a gloomy LA.The real kudos of this film lies with Director Nicolas Winding Refn. He has created an elegant, stylish movie with deep emotion which is subtly shown. He achieves this by utilising specific camera angles which speak volumes so the actors can say nothing and the scenes be incredibly powerful. Images and relationships that are transcendent, it's a film that gives and deserves respect. Drive may not gather huge main stream success but it will be a cult classic.(my ratings are based on 6 average, 7 good, 8 v.good, 9 superb, 10 epic)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A great film which surprises right up until the very end.,"When I recently saw Drive I went in with not much of an idea of what it was about, just that it had Ryan Gosling in it, he's one of my favorite male actors so I was happy to watch a film with him it. The storyline is something very different than what you'd imagine, once the plot gets going it's certainly a story you are interested in seeing unfold.Mr Gosling plays a tough as nails and confident as he'll Hollywood stuntman who doesn't say much, but in trying to help out his friendly neighbor gets himself caught up in a crime ring, and let me tell you these crime guys are people I'd never want to be associated with. The are read badass guys. But like I said, Mr Gosling is a tough bitch.I found the film to be quite beautiful to watch, it has a stillness too it similar to someone like Sofia Coppola or David Lynch, the use of David Lynch's composer is a mega plus also. The female characters is the film are somewhat underused which is a tad disappointing because Carey Mulligan and Christina Hendricks are great talents, Hendricks has a bit more if a gritty role but both the females are fine with what they have to work with. Another great thing about this movie is the slow techno soundtrack.So if you're after an intelligent film that isn't just car chases and race scenes and more of a quiet study of humans, this one is for you. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
25 years too late,"Drive is a movie that is full of film noir and tense scenes that are stitched together to tell a semi-interesting story about highly UNinteresting characters. Think the Transporter meets Risky Business without any of the redeeming qualities of each. Back in the mid-80s, this would have been original and creative. Perhaps new movie goers will find this exciting and edgy, but for anyone 30+ they will wonder why did they choose to go back to this format of movie producing. The acting (besides the performance by Al Brooks - not a personal favorite of mine, but someone who did a nice job playing the bad mob guy) is poor - more accurately almost made me physically ill. No one says much, but I felt like the writers were stretching a 30 minute story to a 90 minute feature. As for the main character - I liked him much better in Crazy, Stupid, Love (I think of him as the stupid part, but did his role well) but I believe he'll have 1-2 more good years and then fade into the abyss. What should have been 'tough' and 'sensitive' came across as 'catwalk model-like' and 'low IQ'.Summary - I was looking for an exciting mob/heist/action movie and got stuck watching a mostly boring movie with a bad theme and mediocre acting. I would not watch this again if it was playing on a long airplane ride and I had nothing else to do - my lowest rating.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A drive to nowhere...,"Drive is the type of film that just is. It didn't illicit any real reaction from me or offer any surprises. It's atmospheric, zoned out and trippy, but that does not mean it's good. If you watch lots of movies then you'll be sure how it's gonna end by probably the midway point. The acting is good, but there are a few characters that are miscast and feel out of place in the film. The film has very little momentum and lots of tension which by the end feel like it's squandered. I think this film is one of those cases where people call the director an artist; it has A-list actors---so it must be good right? I kinda disagree. The movie on the whole just left me feeling lukewarm.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A worthwhile film,"Drive was a very good movie. The main character, who looks like Daniel Craig on the movie cover, but is in fact Ryan Gosselin, is a quiet, 20 something stunt driver for movies, and a mechanic on the side. He doesn't say much; this stoic mask adds intensity, intrigue, and a certain degree of unpredictability. The soundtrack is amazing; so much of the movie's tension is built on the music, and it really hooks you. The basic idea is that he gets involved with a nice girl and experiences some very bad aftermath after dealings with an unsavory person from her past. It seems to be a remake of a an earlier film, and there was definitely a somewhat retro feel to the parts where he was driving, with the soundtrack bridging into some 80's hits. This film carried a unique flavor; perhaps I would discard this view if I'd seen the original, but that aside, it's really a great film. Raw and powerful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Hypnotic, odd, engrossing, puzzling...","All of the above accurately describe 'Drive', one of the most unique films that I've seen in a long time. From its sparse dialog and quirky soundtrack to its dreamlike atmosphere, 'Drive' puts the ""un"" in ""unconventional"", and the end result is likely to be a bit polarizing.If you go into this film thinking 'Action' along the lines of 'The Fast and The Furious', you're in for a crushing disappointment. 'Drive' is really more of an extremely violent--and I can't stress this point enough. This film is gruesome at times--fairytale. That's right. Fairytale.If you can keep an open mind and just let your self get swept up in it, 'Drive' is an off-beat experience that you won't soon forget.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Ultra violence with exquisite style.,"I've managed to miss every single one of director Nicolas Winding Refn's previous movies (Bronson being perhaps the best known) and typically his scores are mediocre on IMDb, which suggests his perchance for violence (he cites Texas Chainsaw Massacre as an influence) has divided his audiences to date.Not so in this one.At the time of writing Drive is recording a whopping 8.4 on the movie bible score meter.And with justice.Refn now sports a Cannes Best Director gong on his mantlepiece and it feels justified because this movie has been crafted to within an inch of its life. This is a real director's labour of love; from The Michael Mannesque, super saturated, ultra crisp LA at night cinematography to the uber mannered acting, fantastic casting, sparse as Ebeneezer Scrooge's pantry script (he wrote it) and ASTONISHING soundtrack (surely the Oscar winner already ).It's languid, propped up be very little dialogue but driven by the aforementioned score that oozes class, from the opening and closing songs to the underscore by Cliff Martinez that builds tension relentlessly. It's a tribute to the 80's with echoes of Moroder, Kraftwerk, Eno, early Human League and more recently My Bloody Valentine and Mogwai. Astounding. That gets a straight ten in my book.But of course that's not what everyone's talking about.They're talking about Ryan Gosling as the unnamed, unblinking, unflinching eponymous driver.Ryan Gosling is amazing in this movie and while there are brilliant supporting roles from the touchingly understated Carey Mulligan as the love interest, Albert Brooks (nasty as the lead baddie with a tiny little bit of a heart) and Ron Perlman (neanderthal, wicket, compelling...gorgeous in a way) it's Gosling all the way. The performance of his career surely (great as he was in Blue Valentine, and I've not seen him in the much lauded Ides of March yet, but I will) he commands the screen with not a blink of his eye from start till end, well actually at the end there is a wee blink. This is a tour de force performance and I loved it.The violence is excellent. Slow to come to the boil but shocking and visceral upon arrival.The driving is not overdone. Chase movies (except Ronan) are so tedious.The love story is well developed but never gets in the way.And the moral? Heroes come in all shapes and forms because this is surely a hero movie wrapped up in a complex web of antiheroes.Very strongly recommended. 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Beautiful shy French Bolero,"In a nutshell, Drive is like Bolero, but at the end you send away the drums and you replace them with a triangle from France. Voilá, climax. Can't believe that after an incredible, methodical, beautifully written and acted tension buildup, the camera literally shies away from showing the climax (filming the shadows of the two fighters instead) and then, all we get is a hero blinking once to show us that he is still alive, yet unfortunately unchanged emotionally. Maybe I'm not French enough to appreciate the minimalism, but I just expected more of an inner breakup not just a hero driving into the sunset with a vague idea of how that spells justice. Isn't running away what he's done all along?But even though I feel cheated out of a true emotional learning curve, the poetic stillness of this slow soul food movie still made for an extremely satisfying viewing experience which for me bordered if not crossed into great art many times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
(very) overrated,"There are people giving this 10/10. Seriously, these people should first watch some movies that truly deserve these kind of ratings. For example, ""Seven"", ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""Shawshank"".Then re-rate ""Drive"". The flaws are obvious except for the viewers that have been living under a rock the past ten years. The plot is ridiculous, filled with coincidence upon coincidence upon coincidence. Character development is non-existent. The movie is filled with unnecessary violence. The soundtrack is often quite ridiculous. There is nothing to take away from this movie. After you have seen it the main feeling you are left with is: ""what was the point of all this?"".Look, it's not the worst movie of the year, but it's really not worth more than a 6/10 or a 7/10.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Give Me A Time and A Place,"Wow... I had no idea Drive would deliver a beautiful poem of love,violence, and death into a terrific movie.

Now don't get mixed up by the title Drive, it's not a racing movie nor your typical action blockbuster movie. The pacing of Drive is very slow ,but it builds towards a great,shocking, suspense thought-out wanting to know what will the Driver do next? Ryan Gosling performance was great being the chillest wheel-man keeping his cool out of danger wearing his white leather jacket automatically a bad-ass.

Slick and stylish thriller,"Ten seconds in it grabs you: less than a minute more you know what you need to about the protagonist. The rest of the opener is a get-away scene so slick you don't notice the exposition. After that the pace of the film slows down some.Ryan Gosling's performance is understated giving the Driver an air of someone who is sufficiently self-possessed that he doesn't feel the need to prove anything. But the Driver is perhaps not wholly self-possessed. Whether his appetite for extreme violence is down to simply being ruthless or anger issues isn't clear. The central character is an enigma. He certainly doesn't have an appetite for talking much. There are brief, but lingering silences where you expect him to say something, which eventually he does but only speaks a few words.Cary Mulligan does a decent job of playing the damsel-in-distress. Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks are off the shelf mobsters but their performances are solid.This is an action flick whose spectacular stunts at times give an artificial feel to the film. The hand brake turn in the chase sequence is eye-popping but how does it help shake off the pursuers?The violence is brutal without warning, always popping up out of nowhere to make you wince. In a country where guns are widely available there are a lot of sharp objects used instead. The violence of the antagonists make you wince more than that of the Driver perhaps to make the bad guys badder and thus making the protagonist more sympathetic. The music adds to the ambiance and moods of the film, especially the tension and menace at the beginning.Overall, a good balance of drama and action with spectacular, if jarring, stunts. The drama is more convincing than the stunts. The violence will put off some people.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The sound of silence,"After watching this movie, a friend of mine commented that it was kind of boring as the pace was so slow and there were less conversations and less action. Well, that was his impression. He was a bit surprised when I told him that I really liked this movie. The slow pace, the less conversations, is exactly what this movie is all about. I believe that this movie focuses on the aspect of one man's silence, inner thoughts, and conflicts as he tries to cope up with his social responsibility. The main character didn't talk too much because his actions spoke for himself which were interpreted well by the other characters in the movie. What is so good about this movie is that it is able to communicate its story to the viewers even with less words. It was so generous enough as to provide attention to one of the misunderstood means of communication: silence. The story line was good. The cinematography was great. The characters were so perfect. Ryan Gosling proved once more that he is his generation's greatest performer. Kudos to director Nicolas Winding Refn for doing a great job.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One Of The Best Contemporary Films,"I heard a lot about this film either being really great or boring as hell. After watching this, I definitely belong to the former camp. Drive is not an action film but rather it is a stylish executed drama that contains intense action. So if anybody who has been sucked in by the title, poster and trailer thinking that it's a thriller action film; change your perception of the film before going in because it may ruin your experience with this film.Drive's screenplay was written by Hossein Amini and was based off the book by James Sallis. Amini's screenplay is not exactly the most unique piece of work in Hollywood at the moment but he was working with such a great story and a character that people can immediately love regardless of his personal qualities. I'll start with the film's plot; the plot definitely feels like a thriller and if it was written or directed by someone else then it would definitely feel generic and bland. The film has it's moments that stick with you and if watched enough become iconic. It's not the plot that makes me want to revisit this film but rather the portrait that is being shown of the protagonist. Straight from the start we feel detached with the character as he doesn't show much and is closed off with his emotions, until he meets Irene (Carey Mulligan). Immediately from the start, I have this attachment to this character as I want to be him. Ryan Gosling's character is so cool and the moments when he does show a side of him that we didn't see in the first half of the film, it doesn't push me away but rather make us admire him much more. A lot of the audience may be annoyed with this film as it takes it's time to show the main complication of the film as the first half of the film establishes the character and his relationship with Irene and his career, both night and day. I felt that this approach was very effective as it allowed me to care about his problems and his decisions later on the film.The film was directed by Nicolas Winding Refn who has made notable films before Drive, Bronson and Pusher, but I have yet to see those films as this is my first experience of his work. This film definitely grabbed a hold on me from the minute it started and I give most of the credit to Refn's direction towards this film. Refn has definitely made an action film that was stylish and explored more of the characters and story rather than creating adrenaline fueled set pieces that are commonly found in mainstream action flicks. The film's action may not be as wow or extraordinary as The Transporter or the Fast & Furious series but instead Refn approaches it in a much more intimate level. Without Refn's vision, the film then loses it's unique and stylish touch.The film's cinematography is handled by Newton Thomas Sigel who is more commonly known as the director of photography for Bryan Singer's films. Sigel definitely did fantastic work here with shots that look beautiful, in particular night scenes and the ending of the film, and shots that are patient and allows us to take in the image even if there is nothing much happening on screen. The beautiful moments of the film are the moments when the lighting are intimate or hyper-realistic, these moments are the parts that I adore most about the film's photography and makes me want to watch it again just for those scenes alone.The film's musical component is very 80's driven, but the songs and the score are not from the era but rather taken major influences from it. The soundtrack of this film is the highlight and feels sweet and catchy. The songs that play throughout the film are definitely by indie bands or artists which fits with the film. The songs are synthesizer driven which I think is a great choice and adds on to the unique style that the film show off. Cliff Martinez does the score for this film, though his work doesn't outshine the soundtrack choices, it does follow the style of these songs and make it his own therefore it doesn't feel out of place when it comes on.The film's cast is great even if their parts aren't large. Though the film has a size of a cast, the film doesn't shift it's focus from Gosling's character which is very center focused on him during the first half, exploring the relationship between him and Irene. The chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan was great as it didn't feel too dramatic and repetitive. When they first converse with each other and build upon that during the next few scenes, feel like a relationship that must be established. There was an elevator scene between the two which in my opinion is their best scene together. The supporting cast of Perlman, Brooks and Cranston was great. They brought their all to the roles, Brooks in particular, and their hard work paid off.Drive has an excellent cast, shot beautifully, amazing synthetic driven score, and a story that was delivered with style and flourish; making this one of the best contemporary films I have ever seen. Cannot wait for me to watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Unique and beautiful movie,"I gotta say, I've seen this movie three times already. But not for the reason you would think. I thought it was terrible the first time around, then mediocre the second time around. But only the third time did I understand this movie. I'll admit I went into it the first time with completely different expectations. I expected a cool blockbuster type action movie. I guess I didn't research it enough. Some of my opinions still haven't changed - There were mad throwaway characters. The story wasn't the best and was sloppy. The plot was rushed but the scenes were carried out soooo slowly, if that makes sense. The driver was a pretty unique character though. The music was far from what you would expect from this kind of movie, but in a good way. There was a bunch of ambient noise, which reminded me of The Social Network. There was also some great catchy electronic pop, which is the last damn thing you would expect in this movie. There was no dramatic over the top music. The tension was built up fine by barely any music at all, which movies rarely do. But visually, it was over the top; you wouldn't expect this much over the top violence in this movie. I didn't know it would try to be an artsy and stylistic type of movie, but it definitely succeeded in those aspects if you paid attention. It was really just a quiet, slow type of movie. But I realized that was the intention. I guess you could say his character didn't really develop much, but he was meant to be a quiet lonesome badass all the way through. Some scenes were silly at first, but not in a way where they were terrible. Like Ryan Gosling threatening a guy while a bunch of topless girls silently watch. Or when he wears a prosthetic head and watches his next target. But he managed to show so much by saying so little. I don't want to say this movie is one of the 10 best movies of all time, cause it isn't. It doesn't get a free pass for the plot just because the style was great. But it was definitely worth the watch and one of the best movies I've seen this year. I've actually never seen anything like this and it's probably one of the most unique movies I've ever seen. It's one of those movies where you really need to pay attention. If you take your eyes off for too long, you're gonna miss some great subtle, beautiful moments.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Literally Us?,"Once upon a time there was a frog. This frog had very good intentions. He used to take those who wanted to cross a river across. One day a scorpion came and asked the frog to take him across. The frog replied, ""No? You are a scorpion, you will sting me."" He said. The scorpion replied, ""Well, if I sting you, I will also die in the middle of the road. Don't worry, I won't do such a thing."" He assured the frog. The frog was convinced by this idea and took the scorpion on his back and started to cross the river. In the middle of the river, he felt a pain in his back. ""Why did you do that? Now we are both going to die!"" said the frog to the scorpion. And the scorpion said: ""I know, but what can I do, I am a scorpion.""
Although the connection between the movie and this scorpion story is controversial, we see that this story is not far from the movie. There is a proverb that says, ""A person with a bad temper does not give up his temper"". People are like scorpions who sting the frog even if it means death. No matter what the cost, they will not give up their habits. So how can we adapt this to a movie?I don't normally read other people's writings before writing these articles, but I started reading them a few articles ago in case they might be useful, in case I missed something. But these articles are really strange to me. Those who deify and worship the movie, and those who trash the movie unnecessarily alongside them. People who don't understand the movie at all. And so on and so forth. It's like people are judging movies for their own purposes and not for the purpose of the movie. ""I think that's what this movie should have been, but it's not, it's zero then"". Or this movie is about my life. It's the best movie in the world. And there are so many comments like that. It's really upsetting, but I'm not going to respond to such criticisms here unless they are very intense and precise. But before I talk about the script of the movie, I want to talk a little bit about the ""literally me"" that people often talk about.I think there is no need to talk at length about what these characters are and who they are. We already know who they are in which movies, but usually Ryan Gosling is a very good actor for these characters. These characters are generally silent, they are lonely. Not only they don't talk, but the amount of movement on their faces is very small. So they seem to be trying to communicate as little as possible. Besides that, they are usually criminals and they are very good at their crimes. They act within their own moral compass and although they normalize their crimes, they are very strict and sharp, especially in protecting their loved ones. And just like the scorpions we described at the beginning of our article, they cannot give up their habits. Although we cannot be sure, it is possible to see that they are struggling with some mental health problems. We could talk about this at length, and it may take a lot of research, but to summarize, Driver is a person who has not found himself in this world. Like other ""literally me"" characters, he is experiencing a crisis of masculinity in a capitalist and consumer-oriented world, and he ""self-realizes"" at night. He is a goal-oriented person and is ready to do whatever it takes to achieve his goal. He needs to always be superior in every position, so he does not compromise his controlling and cold-bloodedness even for a second. Although he numbs himself as much as possible, his feelings for his neighbor remind him that he is a human being who belongs to this world. From this point on, even though his purpose changes completely, he is still a scorpion and as the lines between his two lives disappear, he embarks on perhaps the most interesting and challenging adventure of his life in this movie.It is possible to summarize the story of the movie in this way so that we don't go too far and give spoilers. The focus of the movie is what our driver will do in this situation, how he will get out of this chaos. Basically, most ""literally me"" movies already show how such people struggle with their ""scorpion-ness"". I think the script of the movie is not bad. It's not very special, but I think it conveys what it wants nicely. I think it's a bit too superficial (especially compared to Only God Forgives) but no movie has to be full of layers. I can say that the movie, which finishes its story in an hour and a half, didn't leave much of a narrative gap for me.The movie has a unique (I think?) shooting technique. By dividing the rectangle in which we are watching the movie into four other rectangles, it is possible to understand that the movie is shot on these new rectangles. The technique used in this movie, where one half of the screen and the other half of the screen tell very different things, is really interesting. They used the right and left halves of the screen, the top and bottom halves separately. And it is possible to go even further and watch a different scene in each quadrant of the screen. Here, we can actually see that the driver separates his life and these lives gradually intertwine as the movie goes on. A successful shooting technique. In the rest of the cinematography of the movie, I didn't notice much, to be honest. I don't remember any extra good shots. I can leave the opening scene out of this because it's a scene that has become very iconic with its music and image and has been the subject of internet memes. The soundtrack of the movie is really good, a lot of work was put into it. They can be listened to separately. The songs are already good, but the instrumental ones are absolutely great as well. I think people who are not going to watch the movie but like the synthwave genre can sit and listen to it. I can't comment on the sound effects because I'm still not very competent. Maybe I should watch the best movies when I'm the most competent.It is very easy to talk about the acting in a movie with so few actors because there are only a few. The most important one is Ryan Gosling, who really does justice to these roles. It's like he was created to play these roles. If you ask me, he doesn't have a face suitable for these roles. Seriously, he looks a bit ""silly"" handsome. We have recently seen him in the role of ""Ken"" and I think he is more suitable for this role, but we have been able to watch this brother, who we now see as ""Ken"", in these roles in his time. Even though I see him playing only one role, I think he is very successful in these roles and I hope that he can show the same performance in other movies with characters that are not of the same type. There is not much that I remember from the characters other than that, to be honest, the movie has already put all the spotlight on Gosling (ironically, his character in the movie never wants this).It's an iconic movie. However, I don't think everyone will like it. Although I don't understand the history of cinema at all, I think it's normal to see that easily consumed products attract the attention of the masses while attracting the hatred of old moviegoers. For me, Only God Forgives is much better than this movie. They are actually very similar, but this is a more easily consumable movie. Whatever kind of viewer you are, choose between the two movies and watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pretentious,"Positive: nice soundtrack, nice picture (but is it really necessary to repeat 4 times the same slow motion shot showing the actor face on a dark background?)Negative: complete lack of rhythm, no dialogue will be remembered and actors have no expressions or psychological depth. The (weak) plot is messy and based on several coincidences. The end is easily expected and the love story is dull: new neighbors, car broke and strangely he is there to help, best-friend of the son, ... As somebody in the previous reviews has already pointed out:""I know what the creative intent was, that the character was just something of a ""blank canvas""... The biggest problem here is that Gosling can't tone down the smart and charming enough for us to believe that he's as socially isolated as his character really should be. And, again, he tends to try to substitute blankness for intensity. It doesn't work."". ""A man of few words but who looks smarter than anybody else.

Electric nights,"I don't rate Refn as a particularly bright film mind, but he is film-literate and savvy enough to take from places that makes him look good, but that I also love to visit which ensures my interest in a new film by him. In Valhalla Rising the transcendent ritual was from Tarkovsky, Malick, Herzog only tweaked a little to be about non-transcendence; here the silence of a mock Zen, anonymous wandering is from Melville, of course The Driver, the electric nightscapes from Mann, Friedkin, the idea of man as this car orbiting outside the traveled life from Two-Lane Blacktop. The added appeal for me is the particular niche of a European filming, looking to unveil the American heart pumping blood across the world; usually centered in Los Angeles, the Mecca of ephemeral dreaming, we get Zabriskie Point, Chinatown, Paris Texas, etc.So maybe Refn appropriates from where he would like to but cannot envision, or maybe recognizes a world whose axis he understands and therefore can transport to. Once again it's about man alone at the far precipice of civilization, here transferred in the middle of it, the neon heart of the big city.It's fine as this journey through urban deserts but with space and silence simply elongated, so what else makes this worth seeing? A lot of viewers, and Refn seems to abet this by dressing him in a brooding demeanor, view this man as a soulless product of alienation - as much from the drifter genealogy of Le Samourai as from The Terminator and Anton Chigurh - which raises a single question; will this drifter out of orbit manage to ground himself where life is meaningful again, where he can be a name and a face.But if we inverse our negative idea of emptiness, we have a man, as the Zen koan goes, as the sound of one hand clapping; so an emptiness expressed in form and silence, always possible in form, and revealed by the perfect discipline of that form, here impeccable driving.So not a thought and not an ontology, but an awareness from which flows a life that is no longer fractured but whole, simply sentient; a man who is capable for both kindness and terrible vengeance - but not evil, and therefore not good - who has embodied what it means that the gate is a gateless barrier; and so passage is possible everywhere.This requires we throw away the story about scorpions and frogs; but which Refn evidently expects us to interpret from. The man though of as the scorpion, but only because he wears the jacket - a costume, a face he can take off and wear at will, and so a false face - but who radiates an essential purity of heart that is plainly visible; the kid takes to him, the woman, even the rival. Life as this theater, a painterly arrest of ceremonial gestures - the man kissing the woman, shielding from horror, then when the dark face is revealed elevator doors sliding between them, the scorpion to the camera.Ryan Gosling is exceptional, he understands the scorpion must be dancing around the eyes.We are meant to understand that this is the true face, but we know better by then. This is actually the most powerful part of the film, the ritual with faces; this is where the great filmmakers would soar from. Refn doesn't know quite how, not yet. So instead of uniting vision with a search for the true face, whereby this man is neither scorpion nor frog, he gives us disparities to play with.So I agree with others who say it's a confusing film to decipher; only the palm of a master hides nothing while meaning everything. Refn is still a filmmaker who revels at the sight of blood - brains splattering in glorious slow-motion is a horrible blunder on his part, this is stuff I expect from Tarantino. But he also has the ability to evoke moods that Tarantino simply can't.It's not a very bright lesson, this effort to soothe us into accepting as inevitable the worst in us. How about in its place the first among koans, Zen Master Joshu's soul-deafening aphorism when asked if dogs have Buddha-nature. But then we would deviate too much and be doing Refn's work for him. Or alternatively, Refn showing wisdom, the film is about the spiritual struggle from the enlightened removal of the hermitage back into the waking world, of course greeted with anomy and violence. I doubt it but it'll be something to keep in mind upon a rewatch.Still, Joshu's answer riddles this; ""mu!"", the Chinese character for ""non"", ""nothing"", ""nonbeing"".",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
awesome,at first when i saw this movies's trailer i thought wow i am definitely going to see this movie. when it released in America some people said it was stunning an immaculate film.but then they were others who complained it was to slow. so i was trying to decide should i go? then when it released in Australia i thought it is probably a great movie what is it doing in IMDb's top 250 movies? When i came out of the film i thought wow this has got to be one of the best movies i have ever seen.they balanced it out very well. it had action but also had a story which some movies do not have as they focus more on the action sequences and forget about the story.i cant believe anyone would think this movie is slow. it is a classic cult film and it should hold up well over the years as it is a great film. please do not hesitate to see this film it is truly a masterpiece. 10 out of 10,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Drive as Film Noir,"Film Noir is a cycle of movies exploring the darker aspects of modernity and usually set in a criminal underworld or exploring the consequences of a criminal act; these films are usually low budget thus focusing on the character development. This helps the director to portray a character from a different light. Film noir can be beautifully portrayed to the audience using techniques that Hollywood blockbusters would not even consider using. Expressionistic lighting and unique camera angles define this film into the category of film noir. Drive is a perfect example of film noir in the modern age as it depicts a story in modern Los Angeles, where the main character is a Hollywood stunt driver and a getaway driver who meets a mother and son that captivate the story, the iconic anti-hero in Drive is known only as ""The Driver"". Drive is all about character development, we are not really sure what kind of character the anti-hero is until the story unfolds. The Antihero is someone with some of the qualities of a villain, up to and including brutality, malice, and ruthlessness, but with the soul or motivations of a more conventional Hero. The character is depicted with a toothpick constantly in the corner of his mouth while he speaks little and remains a mystery to the end, though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature, he has a surprisingly light, even boyish voice that can seem to be escaping his throat, rather than being sent forth from it. The cinematography to Drive is a masterpiece as it completes the cliché film noir genre, from the soundtrack which portrays a seemingly old LA feel to it but in a modern LA setting. From the very opening scene this is clear as it there is no music just the intense feel of the moment we see the main character on a getaway mission till the moment he gets away the soundtrack begins and we get a sense of unique storytelling about to unfold. The camera angles used here are beautifully done as we get a sense that we are in the car with the driver. The street lights hitting Gosling's face as he drives are all mixed to give a dark feeling. The cinematography and the soundtrack are so important to Drive, they are almost characters. They are intertwined and tonally aligned and it makes for a really absorbing experience.All in all this is a must see film and well deserves an 8 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Disappointing out of Ten,"After seeing Refn's Only God Forgives, I was pumped about this movie. I enjoyed Refn's extreme violence and his unique visual style, especially with the lingering shots. And here? Well... I'm in the minority here, but I think OGF is a better movie than Drive. It didn't have the same visual flare and the long drawn out pauses that worked in OGF felt awkward and clunky here. Drive showcases some top-notch performances from Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan and some amazing visual composition by Refn. But, Only God Forgives did it better in a much more spectacular way, even it was far more vague and strange. I also found myself being bored at times, even though I am well-accustomed to Refn's slow burn style. I also found the ending to be a bit flat and anti-climactic. Overall, a good yet disappointing Nicolas Winding Refn film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Is Ryan Gosling the new Ryan Reynalds?,Or is he the new Josh Hartnett? Is Carey Mulligan the new Mia Farrow? She seems miscast since in the trivia notes it says the character was originally Hispanic. There are no sex scenes in Drive but there are plenty of scenes of violence. Plus a few car chases. The pacing is deliberately slow & moody. This is a movie that knows it's a movie. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. The dialogue is minimal. The direction is minimalist. The music is subliminal. The night photography is washed out & watered down.

An Artsy Take on The Man With No Name,"The Man With No Name was popularized in Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, although there've been other iterations before and since. The archetype is a laconic, stoic, and deadly loner. Drive is a self-conscious examination of the trope: the main character literally doesn't have a name in the script and he barely speaks at all. Add in a ponderous pace in the first 30 minutes or so and it seems like this movie is well on its way to being an artsy, pretentious disaster. I almost turned it off; but I'm glad I stuck with it because the action gradually amps up as the movie blossoms into gritty, spasmodically violent thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
2 hours of my life wasted,"I decided to watch this movie after looking at the reviews on IMDb. Firstly, how on earth can someone rate this movie more than 1 out of 10? This is by far the slowest ever movie in existence. And never before have I seen a movie with no meaningful storyline what so ever.The acting was diabolical, the plot is as dry as a southern Arizona prune plucked in the prime of July, the suspense... what suspense? How this movie received such positive ratings by reputable critics, let alone the laymen, has left me dumbfounded! People like AK have commented on just how brilliant this movie is, but honestly, take it from me, it is a waste of two hours of your life.In my honest opinion, a slug race is faster than this movie, and if you truly value your time, then steer clear of this movie!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Well, at tonight's pre-screening, 90 of 100 people were disappointed","Though there are some good (not great) performances here, the car chase scenes are surprisingly lacking for a movie about a stunt driver. Three total, come on!! The love interest is also a non interest as the relationship never really even develops. It begins, it stops, it begins, the movie ends. Too little time is spent on the character development of Driver and the plot NEVER thickens, then the movie becomes a bit humdrum and predictable. Truthfully all the action is in the trailer. How about we give these guys some actual dialogue and see if they can pull off a riveting scene? I would bet that you can't quote one line back after seeing Drive. Maybe use more than 2 camera angles and we can pay attention. There is nothing EPIC or Gripping here, just a great story, poorly underperformed.

Far Beyond Driven,"Jaw-dropping piece of cinema from Nicolas Winding Refn, there isn't a weak link in the chain from the top-billed performances of Gosling and Mulligan down to the knuckle-dragging henchmen, everyone brings their A-game. Refn has a unique voice as his previous work (including Bronson and Fear X) ably demonstrates and this must be his strongest outing to date. Gosling's performance is beautifully empty, the epitome of 'spare' while Mulligan effortlessly illuminates the screen, making it impossible to tear ones eyes off her in much the same way as in 'An Education' (or anything else she's been in).These two performances alone would make an excellent film, but it is in the 'supporting' roles that 'Drive' is elevated from a good movie to a definitive piece of modern cinema that will stand out for years to come as a beacon of what can be achieved with total belief in a good project. Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks know how to captivate an audience. Hendricks owns every one of her scenes in the peerless 'Mad Men' and Perlman is the godfather of the twisted soul, but thankfully is given the chance to play it straight up here and does so to brutal effect, whereas Hendricks delivers a nicely judged if brief appearance transitioning from bravado to a much truer, baser emotion.These four performances are to be expected from the individuals in question, but the standouts are those ones that come from left field. Albert Brooks was for so long the straight man in funny movies but who knew he had this in him. His turn as Bernie Rose is every bit as menacing as De Niro at his best/'worst', but Brooks' foil is possibly even more surprising. Brian Cranston, for so long delivering howlingly funny slapstick comedy as Malcolm's dad, in 'Malcolm in the Middle', turns in a beautifully nuanced performance as Gosling's mentor Shannon. None of the main characters is entirely good or evil, with the probable exception of Mulligan's 'Irene' and Perlman's 'Nino' and it is perhaps that facet that makes 'Drive' as enthralling as it is.'Drive' could be seen as yet another demonstration that so much that is exciting in modern storytelling is coming from Scandinavia, however I think it is actually a vivid illustration that the best cinema comes from the melting pot, with no barrier preventing directors, actors, writers and all the other creative fields from coming together. It's strong stuff in places, but if you can get past that you are in for one of the most memorable films in the last 20 years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece,"I wish I could give this movie a rating of 500/10 in hopes of balancing the bad reviews. It's startling to see how many people missed the point completely with this one. It seems as though the current state of the movie industry has conditioned the movie-going public to simply want more: bigger, faster, louder and sexier. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good car chase or gun fight as much as the next guy when I'm in the mood for something with a little less substance to pass the time. This is not one of those movies.Drive stars Ryan Gosling as a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for hire. We don't know anything about him; not his history nor even his name. We get hints throughout the film that he's not exactly innocent, and the opening scene seems to suggest that he drives more for the thrill and challenge than for money. When he meets his neighbour Irene, played by Carey Mulligan, and her son he becomes instantly attached, and will do anything to protect them. This includes helping Irene's husband, who was recently released from prison, do one last heist in hopes that the mob will leave him and his family alone. Through coincidence and misunderstanding, things go wrong, and nobody is safe. The driver's commitment to protecting Irene propels the last act and turns a drama into a revenge flick of the highest order.Everything is top notch. From the performances to the cinematography to the much talked about score, which gives Drive an undeniably 80's feel, this film is extremely well executed and engaging. Even the quick flashes of brutal violence are well done and serve as jarring punctuations against the slow and almost surreal movement of the film.This movie seemed to go over a lot of people's heads. Perhaps misleading trailers are to blame and people were expecting something with more cars and more action, but to dismiss a movie when it doesn't live up to a two minute trailer is just not fair. This is not a movie in which every detail needs to be explained, or one that needs to be wrapped up in a neat little package by the time the pink script of the closing credits appear on screen. This is a movie in which we step into a world created by an extremely capable cast and crew, and we watch a story unfold against the backdrop of stunning visuals and a pulsing score. We don't enter at the beginning, and we don't leave at the end; we absorb what's shown to us and are left to appreciate the mystery of the driver and art of a perfectly crafted film. It's a movie in which a small stretch of silence can say so much more than 10 pages of dialogue. And to those of you who say Ryan Gosling does nothing here other than look cool, he's a stunt driver by day and getaway driver by night with a mysterious past: that is the definition of cool.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A perfect modernization of an ancient concept.,"Drive(2011)I watched 'Walhalla Rising', Nicolas Winding Refns previous film, a few years ago at the Rotterdam Film Festival and left with a great feeling. This piece about a mute viking(one-eye) made a big impact. Yet, I never expected the director to make the leap over the ocean himself and make a more mainstream film. Well he did, and I'm thrilled.The film starts off with a blast. We see 'driver' (Ryan Gosling) driving an escape car and outwitting cop cars in a way which reminds of a computer-game. The tension and pace of the scene is very strong, straight away the main character is portrayed as calm, cool and collective. Nobody can hurt him, as we will see in the rest of the film.The main character possesses a few characteristics 'one-eye' in 'Walhalla Rising' also possessed. Whereas one-eye never spoke, driver speaks the bare minimum. One-eye was relentlessly violent, as is driver. Ryan Goslings character is a present day viking/hero. Rules don't apply to him, he and his car are untouchable.The film is divided in two parts. The first part obviously introduces the characters, but in a very calm way. A 'standard' type love-interest is also introduced. We take a look at drivers life. The story eases by and can very well be an homage to eigthies B-movies, also thanks to the fantastic original score which has an eigthies synthpop feel to it.The second part of the film takes the viewer to a completely different direction. The story evolves into a crime/thriller where everybody is inter-involved in some way. When things start to go wrong they really do. The film becomes a personal quest by our ""hero/viking/driver"". He has to protect his love-interest and her son. Suspense is also fed with great ease by the director, the build-up to the 'gore-like' scenes is very elegant. Driver goes about with amazing coolness and confidence. He's got everything to become an instant cult-hero. The hero is dead, long live driver.The cinematography is amazingly well adapted to the story, the scenes where he flies around the city in his car for one are mind-bobbling. The direction is very smooth, time flies by when viewing this. The 'gore' is great and unexpected and reminds of David Cronenberg; realistic, hard, but not too much of it which gives a great impact.The casting is spot-on. The stubborn loner driver is perfect for Gosling. Carey Mulligan gives the single waitress-mom a new dimension and is as sweet as she is hardened. Bryan Cranston as the likable opportunist friend Shannon who has known hardship is easy to relate to. The 'gangsters' play roles they're familiar with. Ron Perlman as Nino stands out as a very convincing hatable character.The score is wonderful. The 80s synthpop goes perfectly with the lonely dark nights of LA, it also adds to the softness of the subtle love story. The stylist scenes combined with the suspense rising sounds give a great effect and keep the viewer on the edge all the way through.There aren't any major twists and turns in this crime-thriller, it's not needed though. Drivers quest for justice is a familiar story set in modern day Los Angeles about a man with morally high standards and the skills to go along with it to make the bad guys pay. A perfect modernization of an ancient concept. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Another Gosling Smash,"After Watching Lars and the Real Girl, I gained a new hobby: Watching Ryan Gosling develop mental disorders.It was fantastic to watch him slide into a schizophrenic dystopia but now, with Drive I can see into the mind of Gosling as he gradually slides down the autism spectrum. Running from dedicated aspie to full-on nonverbal murdertard, this performance was one of the most wild rides I've ever been on.Christina Hendricks was an odd but fitting choice for a throwaway actress, because usually her rack gets her a recurring role but in this case I think Refn just wanted to remind us all that there are times in your life when a huge pair of jugs bounces your way but you have more important things to focus on even though you always have them in the corner of your eye.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Drive"" (2011) - A Stylish, Hypnotic Neo-Noir","Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is a visually stunning and emotionally charged neo-noir thriller that blends minimalist storytelling with bursts of visceral violence. With its hypnotic atmosphere, striking visuals, and a mesmerizing performance by Ryan Gosling, the film has earned its place as a modern cult classic.Ryan Gosling stars as the unnamed Driver, a quiet, enigmatic stuntman and mechanic who moonlights as a getaway driver. His life takes a dangerous turn when he becomes entangled with his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, and agrees to help her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) with a heist. When the plan goes awry, the Driver is drawn into a spiral of violence, betrayal, and retribution, revealing his darker, more primal nature.Gosling delivers a masterclass in subtlety, portraying the Driver with a quiet intensity that makes his sudden outbursts of violence all the more shocking. He speaks sparingly, allowing his body language and piercing gaze to convey a world of emotion. Carey Mulligan provides a grounding warmth as Irene, her vulnerability contrasting with the Driver's stoicism. Supporting performances by Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, and Ron Perlman add layers of complexity, with Brooks, in particular, delivering a chilling turn as a ruthless crime boss.The film's aesthetic is a standout feature, with cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel crafting a moody, neon-soaked Los Angeles that feels both dreamy and dangerous. Refn's meticulous direction uses long, contemplative shots and deliberate pacing to draw the audience into the Driver's world. Each frame is a work of art, capturing the stark beauty of the city and the loneliness of its characters.Cliff Martinez's electronic, synth-heavy score is integral to the film's atmosphere, perfectly complementing the visuals with tracks like ""Nightcall"" by Kavinsky and ""A Real Hero"" by College & Electric Youth. The music not only enhances the mood but also serves as a thematic undercurrent, reflecting the Driver's duality as both protector and predator.Drive is as much a character study as it is a crime thriller, exploring themes of identity, isolation, and the search for purpose. The Driver's actions are driven by a code of honor and a desire to protect those he cares about, but his propensity for violence raises questions about heroism and morality. The film's sparse dialogue and ambiguous character motivations leave much open to interpretation, inviting viewers to piece together its emotional core.The violence in Drive is sudden and brutal, contrasting sharply with the film's otherwise serene tone. Refn doesn't shy away from the consequences of bloodshed, using it to heighten the stakes and emphasize the stark reality of the Driver's world.If there's any critique to be made, it's that Drive may not appeal to those expecting a conventional action film. Its deliberate pacing, introspective tone, and emphasis on atmosphere over plot might alienate viewers looking for fast-paced thrills.Drive is a cinematic tour de force, combining style, substance, and an unforgettable soundtrack to create a film that lingers long after the credits roll. It's a beautifully crafted meditation on loneliness, love, and the lengths one will go to protect what matters most. A must-watch for fans of neo-noir and anyone seeking a truly unique cinematic experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A stylish ride.,"A stunt-man/mechanic who moonlights as a getaway driver lands himself in big trouble with vicious gangsters after helping out his neighbour.It's hard to believe that any film centred around a character who drives really, really fast for a living could move so slowly, but don't take that as a negative Drive's deliberate pacing helps to separate this tense thriller from many of its contemporaries, lending it a leisurely air of cool that is sorely missing from much of today's Hollywood output.Gosling's deliberate central performance also adds immensely to the film's distinctive mood; his Driver is classic anti-hero material—a man of few words, calm and collected in even the most stressful of situations, but capable of extreme violence when provoked, proving just as capable in a fight as he is behind a steering wheel.Excellent performances, a gripping plot, and several shocking outbursts of extreme violence make Drive a thoroughly absorbing and entertaining ride, with only the very ending—in which I felt Driver uncharacteristically lets his guard down— detracting somewhat from this viewer's overall enjoyment.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Geeky Randy's summary,"Gosling plays an LA stuntman who moonlights as a heist getaway driver in this wittingly modest thriller.

Unfitting soundtrack works surprisingly well, and even has a haunting effect that may not be intention but is still perfect.

I tried to compare this movie to others. I can say that some scenes may not be seen by kids or sensible people, like me, I turned away at some parts. But it only added some more charm to it. Somehow all those head blowing moments reminded me of Sin City. I should also say that the whole story was a little bit like Next Day Air, I mean all that confusing money thing. And that jacket.. That jacket is going to be a legend, maybe not as huge as red Rebel's jacket, but still. Cast was brilliant, I think it was literally the best Ryan Gosling's role ever. Even though he didn't talked much, he did an amazing job. And finally he's not only a drama and comedy actor. And Carey Mulligan is just precious, she's amazing at everything that she does. Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks, Oscar Isaac, everyone was brilliant. I loved the soundtrack, too, but I only noticed music at the end of the movie. It's just because I was so into it and music was blending into scene so perfectly. This is probably one of my favorite movies now and I highly recommend it to those people who love action movies and to those who don't as well. It's not a typical action movie, watch it and you'll see why.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This movie used lighting very cleverly.,"There was a creepy point when Ryan Gosling, a Canadian like all the nicest people as Meryl Streep said, used violence with an expressionless face.This movie used lighting very cleverly. Thanks to this, mise-en-scene can be felt even in the ordinary-looking composition. The editing was also clean.I'm a bit opposite to the casting of Carey Mulligan. She's a good actor but doesn't seem to fit in with the role. Besides, I doubt its Best Director Award from the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. Maybe, there is a gap between 2011 and now.The movie leaves room for the epilogue and prologue, but I'm not curious about them. I guess the movie didn't suit me.Not long ago, in Korea, it was running in the theater for re-release, and I repeated to reserve and cancel it. Anyway, it's fortunate to see it before the end of the year. If I hadn't seen it now, I'd have put it off again and again!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Not the masterpiece it has claimed to be, but still an enjoyable watch","The film is good. Defiantly not 8.0 or as good as everybody says but still enjoyable. There are a few plot holes and inconsistencies but I still enjoyed watching it. As I said before it had a few plot holes and inconsistencies it was also riddled with very obvious dialog and scenarios which doesn't really make it a masterpiece as everyone is calling it.I don't normally like Ryan Gosling but he was good in this, and he suited the character, although the character didn't really have much depth I still enjoyed watching his life as it went up and down and spiraled out of control. The character just felt flat, he felt lazily written. And with a film like this you need to connect to the character, much like Taxi Driver and A Clockwork Orange.Overall, I enjoyed it and I would recommend it. But the praise is undeserved and it is overrated. Although, as I said, it is a nice little watch if you have 100 minutes or so to spare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Flat variation on the so called ""Homage"" genre","This movie, or so I've read, has to been seen in a certain perspective.It's meant to be an homage to a certain genre of 70's/80's flicks in which the silent man with no name who has a possibly violent past kicks the behinds of evil crime lords who want to evict the really nice family from their premises. Like in ""Shane"", but different. In the sense that this is kind of bad.The first 10 minutes where promising, showing off with camera angles, riders and the lot. Acting wise, there's not a whole lot wrong with it, it's the directing or perhaps editing that killed the momentum. It's just too slow at times. After a while though, the camera tricks (especially the dramatic riders, zooms and extended no motion close-ups) tend to annoy you just enough to stay awake for the unnecessarily complicated, but still boring storyline.Edit: I will watch this film another time. There have been films in the past that I didn't like the first time, including ""Full Metal Jacket"". So maybe I just don't recognize a masterpiece first time I see it., and had similar strong feelings about them, and turned after re",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Long Live Real Heroes!,"The movie is a perfect contender to be later a great classic. Drive is somehow capable to bring back something from the Dollars Trilogy. It is felt like Ryan Gosling continues what Clint Eastwood did in his famous trilogy. Protecting the weak ones.Gosling's character is an unnamed Driver who also works as a mechanic, stuntman and getaway driver. He has a little bit strange personality ,not to talking ,just doing his job... Later he meets his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and starts to have feelings for her. When Irene's husband ,Standard (Oscar Isaac) comes back home from prison he finds out that Standard owes protection money to a gangster, Cook. In order to protect Irene and her family it gets start the war between the Driver and the mob that will come with superb action ,some ""The Fast and the Furious"" like scenes and some hard core violence.The scene when the Driver comes in a mask to take out one of his big targets Nino, a Jewish mobster (Ron Perlman, who also I would to ad matched perfectly with his role), is one of my favorites, I knew then that the movie has what has to have a classic.Most of all Drive's great value is the never ending fight and the morality that the driver has to fight off the trouble between people. And of course the great romance.The ""A Real Hero"" soundtrack is perfect in the movie , makes a beautiful atmosphere to it, Clint Eastwood's legacy can long live on.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Modern Western,"Drive. A simplistic title for a movie where the lead character main asset is his driving abilities and from this point it may seem like the plot would be all about cars and driving fast. Luckily there is more to this than going 0-60 in 3 seconds.A narrative which is based on classic westerns themes, a nameless hero who falls for a local woman and gets mixed up with the wrong crowd and endeavours to make things right. Except this is located in modern LA and his speciality is his driving skills. Ryan Gosling plays our nameless hero who is a getaway driver for hire and a stuntman and mechanic by day.The opening scene shows us his impressive talent and his quiet, strong persona that commands the screen and grabs our attention immediately. He is impressive when he talks and equally brooding when he doesn't. The nameless protagonist is cool, calm and collective. His life is simple and with little or no desires only to carry out his job and to do it well... that is, until he comes into contact with Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, his neighbours.They become friends and connect through unspoken glances and Gosling's character feels an emotional connection with Irene and her son Benicio. The Driver has found something that has been missing in his life but unfortunate that is short lived as Irene husband is released from jail and he is in heavy debt to some very dangerous men who intend to collect one way or another.With the film shot in a highly stylised way you'd be forgiven in thinking it's all just flash in the pan, fast edits with little or no substances to character or story but in fact the opposite is true. With a mesmerising soundtrack and a very authentic 80's feel to it, the director has made it feel cool and never contrived. Even down to the opening titles, a pink neon typography adds to the appeal.The strongest focal point to the film is Ryan Gosling's portray of the lead character. As mention before he comes across as strong and passionate man with little or no weakness. A believability and a measured control of his emotions allowing a remarkable performance where he can show you what he is feeling without saying any words. Fine support comes from Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad) as his only friend/companion.I warn those of a weak disposition that there are some gruesome acts of violence amongst the beautiful shot imagery. If anything, you won't forget the contrasting image of a kiss and a skull being smashed in the same shot. A haunting and powerful film with an outstanding performance from Gosling, one of the best film of 2011.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brining back taste and creativity to Hollywood,A well written film with a brilliantly accompanying soundtrack. Drive's writers and director bring taste back to cinema with a deep enjoyable film not over shadowed with useless dialogue and filling scenes. One of the best films I've seen in years and glad that there are still people with visions making movies. A breath of fresh air from your norm. Great Film hands down.Do not give negative reviews if you walked into this movie expecting Transporter because the title of this movie is not Transporter and is probably the furthest thing from it. Judge the film for its true worth and not because you were mad that you went to the wrong movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Well Told Thriller,"Drive Driver (Gosling) is a get-a-way driver, a stunt driver, a mechanic and soon to be a race car driver. That is until he meets and falls for Irene (Mulligan) whose husband is in prison and is about to get out. Then the problems start. (here we go) No, no it's not what you think.This is basically a love story with some very good stunt driving and a whole lot of killing over a robbery gone bad.We have all heard the line: no good deed goes unpunished and basically, that is what puts Driver into high gear to help solve a problem.As things go wrong, Driver feels he has to make things right. However, Driver doesn't carry a gun and doesn't know any karate moves; he just drives, and everything he does is for Irene and her little boy. As we go along with him, we are somewhat concerned as to how he is going to fare going up against professional killers. But, it's in the telling that makes this a very good thriller. And, this is very well told.The slow moving scenes are there to help build tension and there is tension galore to jump-start your heart almost from beginning to end. The driving stunts are very good and I don't think CGI was used. Kudos. The acting by all is very good. Some of the killings show bloody gore and in some instances, we witness overkill.and I mean real overkill. And, the music will help get your heart rate up there too. This is all about excitement. Yours and mine.The tension begins with Driver throughout. We know very little about him, we are never given his name, and he doesn't talk much; but we keep hoping he can be a Dirty Harry (without a badge) or a Mel Gibson character protecting his family. But Driver just drives, no gun, no karate. Stares a lot though and when he does that we feel there is more to Driver than we know and we end up not worrying for him so much. StillThe ending confuses me. I thought I knew how this ended. Hey, I was there. I watched it. But, now, I'm thinking they are thinking Drive 2. But, that couldn't be, can't happen. What do you think? (very clever the way they ended this. HA!) (7/10)Violence: Yes. Bloody Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"As with La Haine (1995)- not a Hollywood cop out - 'Driver' is for grown ups, who are nuanced and well versed in film","This is very much a film for the grown ups. It forsakes the immature Hollywood conventions of spoon fed expose.A knowledge of the genre and film history helps to truly appreciate this film's value - The Driver (1978)- is an exceedingly good a cue point for the sub culture inhabited by these 'players.'The innocents serve to heighten the chasm between normal life and one where the participants in the 'chess game' play for keeps and death is awfully real. The waitress and her small child bring our reality right into theirs. We feel hot breath of killers up close to accentuate and contrast against a mum with her son unknowingly targeted at the centre of a malevolent maelstrom.Driver successfully coupled the European sensibility of realism and seemingly modest budget, allowing story and the director / camera to be the auteur. The cast hit all the right notes, a top class ensemble performance.Well something like that. As with La Haine (1995)- not a Hollywood cop out - 'Driver' is for grown ups, who are nuanced and well versed in both the history, connections, references and language of film, including TV productions, historically European and rest of the world outside the US, however, notably vastly improved American TV productions are emerging.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Unexpected,A crime movie with some unexpected twists and turns skillfully underplayed by Ryan Gosliing.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Finest film all year; Gosling gives his all.,"I'll just come out and say it straight up; this is my favorite film of the year (EDIT: After seeing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this is my 2nd favorite). No contest, honestly. I didn't have the highest expectations going into the theater, but I figured it would at least be a decent film. My expectations were exceeded, in the greatest fashion. I absolutely loved the movie, and instead of decent, I got PHENOMENAL.It moves at a slow pace, yes, but it is so damn mesmerizing and alluring, you can't help but continue to watch. As the film goes on though, the pace seems to pick up a bit. The action bits are amazing. They come out of nowhere, with brutal gore. It really enhances the experience, in my opinion.The acting is top-notch. Gosling gives a great performance as the Driver, even though he utters very few lines during this film. The emotion in his face and eyes are what really shows the character. Everyone else is great as well, with some great performances from Albert Brooks and Carey Mulligan.Perhaps my favorite part of the film, is the musical score. It has a retro 80's feel to it, and one particular song I just couldn't get out of my head. It's great stuff. The cinematography is great as well, it is really well shot. Good stuff.You really have to see the film for yourself, honestly. I HIGHLY recommend this movie; it's pure brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
