"""Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.""","It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort's mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
It really is a comedy,"There is a reason this is called Wolf of Wall Street and not Lion of Wall Street. This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it, I didn't think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.The way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. Never forget, as someone else also stated, this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. If you are not on that level with the movie, you will call it names. And that is OK, because obviously the movie is out there and it will not be everyones taste. That's why you have to decide early on, if you actually want to watch it or not.If you don't feel like it, don't watch it. Save yourself some time and watch something else that interests you instead. If it hits a nerve with you though, you will revel in it. Especially in the performance Leonardo Di Caprio is giving. There is a scene involving him driving ""carefully"", that has to be seen to be believed ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Oscar worthy,"The movie Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten an Oscar for. His portrayal of the character is perfect. The movie is well-written, leaving no details out of the original story.

"Decadent, shocking, brilliant.","Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stock-broker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.Martin Scorsese isn't just a film maker, he's a genius, he's The Master of film, and this is another of his jewels. The Wolf of Wall Street is one of my all time favourites.The remarkable story of Jordan Belfort, is love to know how much of this is actually true. There are multiple shocking scenes, my jaw dropped multiple times, one thing is clear, money talks.It's shocking, but it's also hilarious, there are so many funny moments, that scene with the dog at the end of the bed, too funny.Production values are off the charts, this film truly looks tremendous, it feels as though no one frame is wasted, no opportunity is missed to show off the wealth, the orgy of sex, drugs and money.Another stellar performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, he is outstanding as Belfort, one of his very best, not only does he look the part, but he exudes the character's greed's and desires.Robbie and Hill are first rate. It gets an extra point for featuring Joanna Lumley, albeit in a small role.A fascinating story.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Excess Doesnt Equate to Exhilaration,"Ahh, America. What a country, yes? Isnt it refreshing to know we can produce such stellar specimens as a Jordan Belfart to roam free in our midst?The ""true"" story of Belfart and his meteoric rise and fall in the world of money trading has immeasurable numbers of victims in its quake. Not only as he lived it, but since then for the uninitiated viewer of ""Wolf.""No doubt Scorcese and DeCaprio and anyone else attached to this overblown piece of bile received praise and accolades up the wazoo for their respective efforts in ""Wolf.""DeCaprio's finest work? Should we care? Watching him run around in a 3 hour drug induced profane laden frenzy like a bullet train on a 90 degree downward slope with no brakes was not, nor will ever be, anywhere near my ideal of entertainment.As for Scorcese. Some are saying ""this is Marty at his best."" God help us to envision there might be 2 or more levels of ""worse."" Ramping up every aspect visually - more vulgarity, more graphic mindless sex, more uncontrolled random depravity without a sense of conscience - sorry, it doesnt add up to ""more is better."" Its like watching a group of ""adults"" who were locked in a cage at age three for 20 years with no healthy socialization, who were then suddenly released upon society. It merely leads to relentless doses of repulsive excess that leaves you more than exhausted long before its concluding scenes.Really, if you want to be drained of the last drips of hope for your kids, grand kids, and every future generation beyond, embrace the Belfart express. He's everything wrong with society wrapped messily in one package. Still no doubt the book deals, speaking engagements, etc, have rolled in since his prison released, because we love rewarding our depraved.Congrats, Marty, it wasnt an easy task, but you've managed to take top honors for the most insipid film, devoid of substance, ever viewed by this reviewer. No amount of a visually enchanting Margot Robbie was ever going to save this one. Now excuse me while I try to discover a way to flush it entirely from memory.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"High energy and wonderfully excessive as it delivers an engaging true story, but the lack of morality anywhere was a limiting factor","This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio, but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.And this is a problem, because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don't think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life, but for sure it doesn't do much to balance it – and this really is my problem with the film.The structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you'll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us ""as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"" and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film – the appeal but also the cost, all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person, because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say ""so why not get on board"". I know this is not the case but the lack of a ""point"" or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own, which is a weird feeling.But then again – I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious, the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive – they are almost totally appealing, we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here, and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that ""it's all broken so why not at least get rich yourself"". Getting away from this, it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season's second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead – OK he doesn't find the heart of the character, but the film doesn't ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic, drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer, because it isn't distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO's Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works, although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself, to its characters and to its message. I don't mind the ""it's all screwed so who cares"" message that it ultimately seems to give, but I didn't feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprio's Crowning Work,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching ""Intervention"" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly ""go for it"" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won't find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Wolf of Wall Street review,"If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.Based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort - the real-life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes - the film showcases one seriously messed-up slimeball of a man. If his scheme sounds familiar, it's because it's been the inspiration behind the 2000 film Boiler Room, and this film covers much of the same concepts, albeit with better structure. The film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power, suckers thousands into his schemes, and then lives a life of extreme excess. And it is extreme: the whole film becomes laden with drugs, sex, superficial luxuries, material things, and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. The sheer corruption becomes palpable on-screen, and I couldn't help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when I saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. I have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the real-life events, but at times it's almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. And yet, the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the American dream; the pursuit of money and success, through any means, remains the main drive of the characters and the movie, and it leads to a fairly hard-hitting downfall.This film features good-looking photography and editing. Acting is great: Leonardo DiCaprio is practically perfect as the titular character, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well (including Jonah Hill, who seems to fit into his character's archetype very comfortably). Writing is really sharp and good; the film is full of great lines and great speeches. There are some great-looking sets, props, and costumes on display in this film. Music has a varied mix of songs, and they're all used really well for their intended effect.The Wolf of Wall Street is every bit as good as Martin Scorsese's previous work with The Goodfellas and Casino. All these films work with similar plots and themes, but TWOWS is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upper-class corporate swindling. It is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full, before proving that, even for the super-rich, crime still doesn't pay.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Wolf in a $2,000 suit","An old adage goes that if on a certain day, everyone in the world received a million dollars, by the end of the day, ten percent of the people would have all the money.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" pretty much shows how that could happen.Based on Jordan Belfort's book, this is a very entertaining movie - although probably not for those who lost their money. The film follows Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) from newbie stockbroker to head of Stratton Oakmont, the largest 'Over The Counter' stockbroking firm in the US.Along the way he has two marriages, acquires luxury homes and automobiles, a sea going yacht with a helicopter, a taste for wild office sex parties, which would put a Roman orgy to shame, and a huge drug habit. But even after the FBI steps in and everything unravels, the guy still can't help making money.The movie is loud, lewd and often hilarious; it doesn't have a boring minute.Matthew McConaughey gives a brief but telling performance as Mark Hanna who initiates Belfort into the darker side of Wall Street. He also introduces the tribal chest-thumping chant that becomes a motif throughout the film.Aussie Margot Robbie is hard to take your eyes off as Belfort's second wife, Naomi. She was also an amusing guest on talk shows when the movie was released where she told how she pulled off the Brooklyn accent, and kept the news about her nude scenes from her family for as long as possible.But this is Leonardo's movie. Although in his portrayal of Belfort, where there appears to be almost no moral or ethical boundaries, he keeps our sympathy because he can actually laugh at himself; it's a high energy performance, but with a light touch.In a way, the performance has echoes of the one he gave for Spielberg in ""Catch Me If You Can"". Despite the fact that both Jordan Belfort and Frank Abagnale Jr. break the law, their sheer audacity dazzles us. Also, both Spielberg and Scorsese have great comedic timing; they know how to deliver a punch line. If you were looking for a reason why this film works better than Scorsese's ""The Aviator"", which also starred Leonardo, it could simply be the latter film's lack of humour - Hughes was eccentric but he wasn't funny.Enjoyable as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is, at the end you can't help wondering if even half of it is true, how it is that with people like Belfort and his friends helping themselves to such over-sized slices of the pie, that the world's economy hasn't descended to the level it did in 1929. In a way, it's actually a very scary movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
sometimes hilarious,"Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a regular guy from Long Island working at the ground level in a Wall Street firm where Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) is the star broker. On the first day of him becoming a licensed stockbroker, the market crashes in Black Monday. His firm goes bankrupt and he's thrown into the streets. With the support of his wife Teresa (Cristin Milioti), he ends up working in a Long Island boiler room dealing in penny stocks. He starts his own firm gathering a group of questionable salesman like Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). He quickly rises gaining the attention of FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). It is a drug-filled, stripper-strutting, midget-throwing wild-partying office. Jordan has an affair with Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) and eventually even marrying her. However the high life doesn't last even with their own Swiss banker.This has some funny moments and sometimes even gut busting hilarity. I do have a small problem trying to enjoy this movie at the start. Jordan becomes essentially a con man. The joke is that they're having all this fun but I can never forget that the fun is done on everybody else's dime. The characters laugh while I cringe. About halfway through, I do get acclimatized and feel more at ease with the movie. There are some great scenes. The scene of Jordan rallying the troops for the Steve Madden IPO is amazing.

The funniest movie of 2013,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is infectiously entertaining. It is probably the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen. Between all the fun however,  there is also a story about addiction and how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs, money, or power.Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese does a wonderful job keeping this movie at a high at all times. Never once does this movie lose it's energy or sense of humor much like the drug induced characters. There are a lot of quick cuts and edits to keep the movie feeling as If you are on drugs as well as playing high energy music in some of the more serious situations.The cast brings their ""A"" game. The stand out is obviously Leonardo DiCaprio, who pretty much owns and excels any scene he is in. This film really showcases his diverse range.Overall ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a full on adrenaline ride that never loses momentum. It's directed with a lot of flair and energy and has an incredibly well written script that gives it depth and a ton of laughs.

"Leo's performance is great, the movie - you can give it a miss","Let me start of with the basics, prior to watching this movie I heard the city of Dubai censored this movie down by ~40mins by cutting out rude scenes involving sex, nudity and so forth. At first I was rather flabbergasted at this opinion, however when I saw this movie last night, I realized they had every right to do so. Most of the scenes dragged on way beyond it's point where it started venturing near a soft porn clip.The movie will be much more enjoyable had it been a 2hr running time with 85% of the useless sexual references removed. If I wanted to see something as full-frontal I would have watched Eyes Wide Shut.To me it seemed the jump from the garage operated boiler-room to the full-blown office was slightly over expedited. We never got to see Jordan's ""lows"".Leo does a fabulous job with his performance however as the title suggests, I think the movie had better potential in many different ways.Final thought?

"Excess Is Boring, Especially When It's Three Hours Long","Martin Scorsese at his undisciplined worst.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is 90 minutes of glib satire stretched over an interminable 180 minute film. I get it, I get it -- the excess of the film itself matches the excess of the Wall Street world depicted in it. But excess, both as a subject matter and as a style, is boring after a while. The first hour or so of the film blows the roof off the joint, and I was sure I was experiencing a film that would go down as one of Scorsese's best. But as it went on and on, and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance became more and more histrionic, and the film made the same point over and over, I had that depressing feeling that comes when a movie you're really enjoying makes a wrong turn and becomes one you really dislike.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is of course critic proof. Anyone who doesn't like it is instantly categorized by its fan boys as stodgy and unable to handle the subject matter, as if it's an impossibility that someone could dislike the film simply because they don't think it's any good. Whatever. It's an overblown mess, stupid when it's trying to be funny (the Quaalude scene, for example) and in desperate need of someone who had the balls to tell one of America's greatest directors that he was letting his material run away with itself.Grade: C",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Where Human Flaws Make a Rotten Core,"Brilliantly acted, superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese, it is a masterclass of directorial craft.Showy when it needs to be, but also quiet and contemplative. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the equivalent of something like ""Good Fellas"" or even more so ""Casino"" but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"".Where Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.Leonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.It's a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.One could almost hear Scorsese's clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.It is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference.

A Three-Hour Bacchanalia Caught on Film,"Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.As of now (February 2014), this film sits at an impressive #57 on IMDb's list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review, we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable, but certainly not within the top 100 -- it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorsese's best work.Along the same lines, the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013, with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing, the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course, without nine nominees, we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...)Scorsese received a best director nomination, and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining, without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them, as the film itself is blank (in the best way).While on the subject, could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the non-stop sex, which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir, not reality, and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts, read the court transcripts.Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor, and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort, and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not DiCaprio's best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.Jonah Hill, on the other hand, was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto, he probably has no chance, but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in ""Superbad"" to a formidable actor in his own right. At first, ""Moneyball"" seemed to be an anomaly in Hil's career, but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair, though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing, which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.Of the film's five nominations, it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (DiCaprio). More likely it will walk away empty-handed. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Must See! DiCaprio and Scorsese are Brilliant!!!,"By far the Best Movie of the Year, Best Actor, Best Director! The whole supporting cast is excellent as well. This movie will not disappoint it was much better than I expected and the duration of the movie is not felt at all. It definitely did not feel like a 3 hour production. Scorsese put this movie together brilliantly! You are on your toes and engaged throughout from beginning to end. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best! He will take you through the highs and lows of the movie with an Oscar Winning Performance.

I commend Scorsese and DiCaprio for keeping this epic picture as authentic as possible. After all this is Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Excessive in style, lacking in substance","When the final cut spun in some back room, I wonder what Scorsese thought he had here, a comedy, a thriller, a drama. This movie has a little bit of everything, but the sum of its parts adds up to very little. Very little that we as movie goers have not already seen 100 times before and nothing that I necessarily needed to sit through 168 minutes to see again.The lack of a conscience, the drive to make money at all costs, these are things we all already associate with Wall Street. So when Leo takes his messed up principles and quickly turns his smooth talking ways into millions of dollars, the audience says to itself, OK, now what? How will the story turn dark, how will the greed and booze catch up to these guys, because it always does, right.Wrong. The plot here floats at the surface to allow the merry pranksters of Leo and Jonah Hill to basically do whatever it is they want throughout the entire movie. The parties and intoxication are normally something I love, its fun to watch people party and do drugs (at least for me). Here, the excess becomes tiresome, and that would be fine, if the film was intended to show the perils of excess. But that's not the intent, the negative effects of the drugs is touched upon, and as the plot slowly veers toward the end for our wild wall street bunch, the drugs naturally move the plot deeper down the rabbit hole, but its too much after awhile and thus the film becomes a caricature of itself. A comedic display of excess that the viewer may enjoy like an exaggerated drawing, but not something that has any staying power.Scorsese may have realized this, so the plot meanders through FBI investigations, ship wrecks off the coast of Italy and Swiss Bank fraud. Its the classic example of throwing too much at the window and hoping something sticks. I found the plot to be unnecessarily bloated, I found the story to be largely superficial, and I found the actual direction to not be nearly as good as Scorsese's past films.Leo and Jonah are fantastic, some of the bit actors are good, but there is no real story here. It's just a party with consequences that do not seem to bother the characters and therefore, never really create any tension in the narrative. Its an enjoyable film at best, a plodding, repetitive, shell of a movie at worst. You be the judge.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Wolf of Hollywood!,"I have two main points to say, first being Mr.DiCaprio has delivered a cracker of a performance. Second being Mr.Scorsese has made a farce out of movie which could have been something else.I once heard a joke that if there was a movie made on Mr.DiCaprio in which the actor playing him had actually won an Oscar for the performance it would be damn hilarious as Mr.DiCaprio can never earn one himself. This joke i think struck Mr.DiCaprio rather hard, as you can see the desperation in his performance in this movie. Of course he has delivered many a memorable performances in ""Inception"", ""The Beach"", ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"". This movie is different, it is different for him very much as never has he been so bang on in creating a riotous comic scene with the true conviction of a actor. Some scenes in this movie have been written for Mr.DiCaprio and he fits into the shoes like a veteran with such ease that it amazes you.Mr.Hill complements him very well as the awkward homo erotic klutz who is a steadfast friend. The pleasant surprise was Mr. Kyle Chandler with a determined and charismatic role. Mr.McConaughey in a brief but important role was a added asset to the cast. Miss Margot Robbie was ever so gorgeous as all the leading ladies in Mr.Scorsese movies are.Mr.Scorsese has been strong in weaving tales which grip you like a ""f**king"" iron vice, he hasn't faltered in this one too. Who am i to be even be able to review the great Mr.Scorsese but all i can say is ""tut tut"", as this movie could have been made into classic but it seems to have been settled down for a entertaining farce of urban gimmicks like drugs, stupid men who swear a lot and lot of ""A"" rated scenes.Kudos to Mr.Terence Winter for writing a entertaining script with such plot points which you can expect before hand yet can't help but admire. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is crisp yet rich.Nevertheless some scenes hit you like a concrete wall and you cannot help but cringe at the crudity of life as it is shoved onto your face.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
At what point does a movie about deplorable debauchery become deplorable debauchery?,"One of the many reasons The Wolf of Wall Street didn't sit right with me is that I couldn't tell what it was trying to say. It seemed to glorify what Jordan Belfort and his cohorts did instead of condemning it. And at some points, the movie that was trying to tell us about deplorable debauchery became deplorable debauchery itself.

Scorsese's best pic since Goodfellas,"The last few Scorsese pics left me a little disappointed. I had begun to think Marty had become a 'gun for hire' and that his brilliance may have been spent (his earlier works were some of the best movies ever made). I attended a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street this evening, and was expecting to be unimpressed. I am happy to say I was completely blown away. This pic is Marty at his best. I laughed, I cringed, I related (with fond memories as well as a bit of guilt) and I TOTALLY believed every unbelievable moment. A good book, a great screenplay and a delightful cast were formed and molded into what I believe should get Scorsese a best director Oscar, and likely a Best Picture Award for the movie. Leo DiCaprio has grown into a versatile actor and his creation of this super hero dirtbag's roller coaster ride in this crazy (true) story is really honest and delightfully entertaining. Jonah Hill pulled out all the stops too and this is definitely his best work. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for delivering the goods so brilliantly!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Goodfellas Meets Wall Street Meets Biting Black Comedy,""" The business of America is business "" screams an old cliché but like so many clichés it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism , supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal ""In effect this is how the film works to a large degree but Scorsese is on top of his game so having such a large similarity on a narrative and visual level with GOODFELLAS and CASINO doesn't matter because for a movie lasting three hours it just flies by . Once again Scorsese uses the directorial technique of intensified continuity which is film critic speak for in your face direction . All the Scorsese hallmarks are here , breaking down the figurative fourth wall , garish and glossy cinematography , constant camera movement , pumping intrusive music etc etc . It's all here and you've seen it all before but it's so well done that none of this matters and remains totally compelling as once again the master director brings us Shakespearean tragedy in its most American and cinematic formTo be fair to Jordan Belfort he didn't torture or kill anybody and his methods of gaining economic profit only differs from the rest of the finance sector in that they're illegal . Actually in amongst the excess of drugs , sex and foul language the storytelling doesn't make a very good job in telling the audience the difference between legal and illegal stockbroking but we're asked to take on board that Belfort isn't that bad because he's played by DiCaprio . Fair enough and he does a good job as a shallow and greedy boy who seduces stupid greedy people in handing over their cash . The rest of the cast also go along with the loud colourful style of the movie but was I puzzled by the one scene cameo by Mathew McConaughey in a pivotal role and kept expecting his character to make a reappearance at some point in the film which doesn't happen . . it'll be very ironic if as I expect McConaughey beats DiCaprio to the Oscar this year . A British audience might also find the casting of Joanna Lumley distracting in much the same way as Ray Winstone in THE DEPARTED , but the cinema audience I watched this with spent much of the running time laughing at the grotesque blackly comical scenes as they played out on screen . Mission accomplished Marty , although one can't help thinking an inclusion of a scene where Belfort passes a card warning a colleague about something is trying a little bit too hard to paint Belfort in a better light than he deserves . I mean it's not like anyone would be queuing up to listen to his lecture seminars after seeing this film is it now ?This is one of the better films from the long , prolific resume of Martin Scorsese , possibly his best since GOODFELLAS but one that will probably be very under rewarded at the prestigious award ceremonies due to one of the strongest film line ups seen in many years . It also won't convert anyone in to being a new found Scorsese fan but for those of us who's enjoyed his familiar language of cinema to tell a story about the American dream turning in to a nightmare it's proof once again that he's Hollywood's greatest living director.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Hugely entertaining, if a little long","Martin Scorsese redoes Goodfellas in the financial sector. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a young man immediately smitten with the ruthlessness of Wall Street (at first represented by Matthew McConaughey in a hilarious cameo). After the market sees a startling crash in the late '80s, DiCaprio gets pushed out of the big leagues. He quickly finds a way in smaller markets, pushing penny stocks. He figures out ways, not all of them strictly legal, to make cash hand over fist. Soon, paired with new best friend Jonah Hill, he opens his own firm. All the rules go out the door as he pulls in millions of dollars a year, which leads to all sorts of drug-fueled mayhem. The draw here is the pure debauchery. It will surely offend some, but the pure spectacle of depravity is enormously amusing. The film really doesn't want to think too hard about the awful things that Belfort is doing, which is kind of a bold choice. Sure, he does end up suffering in the end, but, with all he experienced beforehand, the little bit of suffering seems almost worth it. It could easily be argued that it's a hugely immoral film, but I think it just wants to put us in the action. The film has an epic runtime, which isn't really deserved. I wasn't exactly bored with it (though I was feeling it physically), but it could have been shortened. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, but I was most amused by Hill. Many will despise his abrasive character, but I thought he was hilarious.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Greed reigns supreme!,"Martin Scorsese must be a director who can't make a bad movie. Most of his movies have focused on streetwise lowlifes, and so now he looks at a different kind of lowlife: the Wall Street kind. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the true story of stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Having come of age in the '80s, Belfort was convinced that there was nothing wrong with greed, and so he stopped at nothing to get what he wanted. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort as an amoral slimeball leading a hedonistic, frat boy lifestyle: drugs, booze, hookers, the whole shebang. And yet the whole thing is very funny.There have been complaints that the movie glorifies greed and egotism by portraying the characters having a lot of fun. I'd say that the movie is showing how they don't have a care in the world. They make millions and spend it on their own decadence.No, it's not Martin Scorsese's best movie, but you're sure to have a lot of fun watching it (understanding of course that the characters are NOT good people). I recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Much That's Good, But Leaves The Wrong Kind Of Taste Behind","An accusation that can be convincingly levelled at Scorsese, especially in his weaker moments, is that he wants to have his cake and eat it. Is he celebrating, lampooning, or critiquing alpha masculinity... or is he doing some combination of all three? In the later part of his career this film is the prime example of that - I'm never quite sure where he lands, and I don't think he truly is either. There's some brilliant performances; and one scene between Margot Robbie and DiCaprio towards the end is genuinely upsetting. But the relentless, frenetic pace of much of the previous three hours does seem to dwarf that; not to mention what comes after it. Three hours of that pace of editing and that volume of sound is just too much; and there seems to be a bit too much comedic enjoyment gained from morally reprehensible behaviour to convince the film is sufficiently nuanced. Not to say there isn't plenty to admire and enjoy - but by Scorsese's standards this leaves the wrong kind of taste in the mouth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
LEO'S HOTTEST FILM,"Yet again Scorsese blesses our screens with another portrayal of a 'one of a kind', entertaining lifestyle. The glamorous, inhuman life of Jordan belfort was demonstrated with the purpose of idealising the motivation and ambition Belfort undergoes, inspiring the audience. Dicaprio perfectly captivates the character of Jordan, depicting his growth as a person (gaining success and power) and battling the consequences throughout the late 80s, early 90s. Scorsese includes the thought of trends throughout that time, he creates a stylish, aesthetically pleasing movie. With the addition of Margot Robbie, the film takes a raunchy turn. Hill, Dicaprio's co-star, creates an amusing, comedic side to the story of the wayward tale. Similarly to Dicaprio his character experiences a rapid rise in wealth and success, the story shows how they both deal with this sudden change in life. Scorsese portrays this experience in a colourful, luxurious and fashionable manor. This is definitely one of Scorsese's best productions, the shots have been taken with an insightful intent, producing a unique perspective, cleverly designed to showcase the extreme wealth that is amongst this film. There is not one boring moment in this movie. You will be hooked. An all round 10/10 production.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Even when you have everything, you still want more","It is difficult to watch a movie that you absolutely know how it will end. Scorsese is known for casting Leo diCaprio as the young energetic underdog that gets the world, only to lose it wholesale. The other movies of this sort, though, were interesting because they featured the criminal underworld or some other bizarre and exotic environment. The Wolf..., in comparison, is a movie about spammers and thieves that get drunk and high all the time in order to keep up with their own fantasies about their lives. Really, you could make it about Romanian hackers and it would have been a much better and fun film, with the same general ideas.Even worse for this three hour movie, Matthew McConaughey appears in a tiny role at the start of the film and explains it all: you don't want to make money for the client, you want to keep him betting on stocks, getting fabulously rich - on paper, while you get hard cash from commissions. The basic trade that we are supposed to empathize with is phone spamming and conning greedy and uninformed clients.The money that gets generated for the stock traders ""more than we knew what to do with"" doesn't go into ""diversification"", doesn't go into growing the people that until then were hungry bastards looking to pay their mortgage, it isn't invested into anything. It just goes on expensive cars, yachts, prostitutes, drugs and trophy wives. And while I admit many people would sell their soul to get to the point where they can do that, the outcome of such a behavior is obviously not good if that is all you do.And I am not being moralizing here. Hell, screw the bitches and snort the dope, but do something with yourself, plan for when the money will not be so good, make sure you will never get screwed over by technicalities, government agents, false friends or accidents. Instead the characters in the film act like there is no tomorrow. Literally they behave like the end of the world is around the corner. For three hours. It quickly gets old.There is some value in the ending, when DiCaprio's character is terrified he is going to get to jail, only to discover than when you have money, it isn't that bad at all, but other than that I just wanted to see the film end. There is no cat and mouse game with the FBI, nothing comes as a surprise, it just goes on and on with how wonderful it is to have enough money to spend it stupidly when you earn it by praying on people even more stupid than yourself.Bottom line: while DiCaprio makes a good role - after all, he is a damn good actor - the film itself is only mildly entertaining. Considering it is based on an autobiographical book, you might forgive the film for being too real and too boring, but there is still the matter of why someone would choose to make a movie on such a material. I watched the film with two other people and they were both awed by the opulence depicted in the film and the comparison of their own lives to that of the protagonists. I guess there is that; learn that if you are ingenious enough, hungry enough, you can make yourself have all the money in the world. Perhaps Scorsese wanted this, or perhaps he missed the point with me, because all I felt when the film was over is that I am happy with my life and I am glad the movie finally ended.It is interesting to read about Jordan Belfort, that's a real person. Also, his story is told in another movie from 2000, called Boiler Room, with Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Might be worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Scorsese and DiCaprio Make Another Masterpiece,"The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)**** (out of 4)Two word review: A Masterpice.Martin Scorsese's latest film is yet another brilliant one with Leonard DiCaprio turning in the greatest performance of his career as stockbroker Jordan Belfort who takes some rather bland people and turn them into one of the biggest scams that the FBI ever saw. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is going to make many people unhappy and there are many more who are probably going to be offended by it but the perfection that is Scorsese was right when he decided to turn this into a comedy instead of a drama. Yeah, it's GOODFELLAS on speed and ramped up sex but it's just so brilliantly and wickedly funny that you can't help but laugh at all the craziness going on. Yes, there are some moral police out there who are going to object to a movie being made about a man who ripped off poor people but I'm sorry, I like the fact that this film doesn't really care about those people and instead just gives us an in-your-face look at these wild people, their wild drugs and their wild sex lives. This film is certainly over-the-top in regards to the excess but so were the characters so I thought they just went hand and hand with each other. Scorsese was the perfect person for this project because of his ramped up speed but here is goes all out and really delivers an incredibly wicked little ride that will have you smiling and laughing at some very questionable things.I've been a fan of DiCaprio long before he became famous and this here is without question the greatest performance he's given so far. I was curious to see how he would do playing someone crazy and wild like this but he does so perfectly and I'd say it was a flawless performance. No matter what was going on in this crazy life you believe that you're watching a real character and as his character says throughout the film, sell him something. Well, DiCaprio sells this performance and role like no one else could. The supporting players are just as wonderful with Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Matthew McConaughey and Jean Dujardin all delivering terrific performances. The cinematography, the music selections and everything else are just flawless here. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET could have been a complete disaster in so many ways but the strong screenplay and Scorsese's wicked direction makes it an incredibly entertaining film that works so well. It's hard to fully put into words what Scorsese and DiCaprio have pulled off but it's certainly one of the best and most memorable comedies in ages.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
3 hours long...and I was not bored for a second,"This is one of Scorsese's best films, and the best of 2013. Driven by a performance that should have won DiCaprio an Oscar, Scorsese turns another true story into a powerful movie. It is modern Goodfellas, where Jordan Belfort makes a name for himself on Wall Street just like how Henry Hill made his way up the mafia. While it is not quite as good of a movie as Goodfellas, it is unique in its excessive showing of sex and drug use.First off, this movie is freaking hilarious, and wildly entertaining. The humor is mixed in perfectly so it adds to the story. Additionally, Jonah Hill does a great job as a supporting actor. Some people Don't like this film because of how explicit and over the top it is. But it is really just an accurate portrayal of the events (as confirmed by the real Jordan Belfort) that drives the message home.Scorsese and Dicaprio condemn Belfort's style of living, and not directly. Instead, they convey their message by showing what actually happened (as well as the consequences) and are able to powerfully convey their point of view while making an entertaining and amusing film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day.

HK Auteur film review - The Wolf of Wall Street,"Martin Scorsese's latest is based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker and founder of Stratton Oakmont, a company which engaged in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street during the nineties.First off, the performances are top-notch. Leonardo DiCaprio has managed to find new depths by playing a character that is even debatably worse than the racist plantation owner in Django Unchained. DiCaprio has done more than enough to win his Oscar, and winning for The Wolf of Wall Street is as good any of his other roles. My favorite DiCaprio performance is still Howard Hughes in The Aviator. Though my vote goes to McConaughey for Dallas Buyers Club this year. Speaking of which, McConaughey has a great cameo as Jordan's mentor, who gives Belfort the inspirational push. However, Jonah Hill is the standout as Belfort's psychotic sidekick Donnie Azoff, delivering an even more impressive performance than in Moneyball.At a 3-hour running time, the film is too long and it easily could have been shorter with less party scenes and throwing midgets into giant dartboards at the office. As a rise-and-fall story, it has too much 'rise' and not enough 'fall'. I wanted the story to move on and inform us about the financial damage this all caused and all the lives it hurt in the process, but Scorsese does not seem interested in the forensics. Overall there are some very good party set pieces and funny scenes, but after a while, I was just numb.The story is essentially told from the villain's point of view. Extending this idea to the classic children's storybook The True Story of the Three Little Pigs, which is told from the Big Bad Wolf's perspective. The Wolf retells the Three Little Pigs story and asks the reader to consider his side of the story. The Wolf was simply trying to bake a cake for his grandmother's birthday while nursing a bad cold, and things got out of hand. Therein lies my criticism: there is nothing redeemable from the Jordan Belfort character in The Wolf of Wall Street. Or at the very least, the filmmakers do not seem interested in showing anything beyond the surface.The breaking-the-4th-wall story device of having the villain narrate his story to the audience is raunchy and creative, but Scorsese totally forgets that it is supposed to be ironical. The premise of the black comedy is that we're supposed to laugh at how vile and putrid these people are. But by the nth orgy scene, the characters are matted into two dimensions and we never get beneath the surface. The morality play tips over to the other side and it mistakenly justifies itself. Just because this a tale about self-indulgent shallow people doesn't mean we have to tell their story in a self-indulgent shallow fashion.The bad taste left in my mouth at the end is not the film's self-indulgence, but out of worry that The Wolf of Wall Street is so unclear about its cautionary message, that there are certain viewers that will admire this lifestyle and become inspired to become a stock broker. For the rest of that find the Belfort character repugnant will feel empty wondering what justified the three-hour running time.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Entertainment, not reality","Yes, Scorsese has always entertained us so well with abberant types, from mobsters to street criminals to boiler room stock brokers, all dealing death or financial destruction 24/7. But, do any of them bear even a faint resemblance to what really happened, and did those people actually behave that way? Regarding this film, I worked on Wall Street during that time, and even though we had heard of Jordan Belfort's firm, it was totally discounted as a boiler room and had no Street cred at all, just a terrible rep as sleazebag junk. It was no more than a side story to the real Wall Street, as those boiler room types were the lowest level of that era's greed-is-good WS slicksters.But, the movie.....could any human superman take the amount of drugs and unprotected sex shown in this story and even function, let alone at a high continuous level and not have a fatal heart attack? None that I have known or seen, and I have seen a lot. But, Dicaprio as Belfort was a marvelous choice for this outsized role, and he played it to the hilt as never before, with Jonah Hill as his sidekick comic relief, and Matthew Macconaughey a great choice for Belfort's oddball, probably whacked out(off?)mentor, and Bob DeNiro in a short mobster spot.It was such fast action that the 3 hours went by quickly, with not a dull moment in it. I enjoyed the fantasy ride that Disney could not have done better, but I could never get past the fact that it was 99% dramatized fiction, done to sell tickets(greed is good!) but not to enlighten us at all about the real Wall Street of that era.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Great Leonardo!,"I have been using IMDb for years & have never posted a review but after seeing TWoWS I felt I needed to finally enter the domain of amateur critics.I've always been a fan of Scorsese's since I was young, some of most memorable cinematic moments come from his earlier works but for me, when he teams with Di Caprio, it's a match made in the highest reaches of movie-making heaven. 'The Departed' is undoubtedly one of the best crime thriller's to ever hit theater's with outstanding performances from multiple cast members but 'The Aviator' was the role that took Di Caprio to that next level, Scorsese provided him the stage to perform and carry the movie to what I feel will go down as one of the greatest artistic portrayals on film.Everyone did not share my love for 'Aviator' but it looks to be a different story altogether with TWoWS with the film already receiving fantastic reviews and praise despite the controversy about the extraordinary excess portrayed. For those who haven't seen it and are sitting on the fence due to the criticism remember one thing, this is a Scorsese movie and you are almost always certain to be a part of a truly visceral experience, Scorsese is used to pushing the boundaries of what is usually acceptable to a mainstream audience and this is no different.At 3 hours the film never feels overdrawn, the characters are fantastically written (which is attributed to Terrance Winter's screenplay) and some truly memorable performances (Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughy are both excellent) but it is Leonardo Di Caprio's execution of one of the most sincere slime balls ever portrayed on film that you MUST watch this film for.The best achievement I attribute to it is that without him, for this movie to be ANY BIT as good as it has turned out, you would only be looking at a very select few actors in the business.Will he finally get an Oscar? That remains to be seen..",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Two Thumbs Up!,"Ever had the urge to drive fast after watching a Fast & Furious movie? If you are on the page as me, then beware, The Wolf of Wall Street might make you wanna jump start a career in investment. It is exactly what the protagonist Jordan Belfort motivated his accomplices to do in it. There is always something that you could (not proudly) relate to in a Scorsese movie and in The Wolf of Wall Street its about money and who wouldn't love to relate to it.The Wolf of Wall Street tells the rise of Jordan Belfort, a man with high ambitions and even higher exuberance, how he conquers the stock market, goes over the top and more. This could be considered a rags to riches story and the narrative takes a turn after the second act when the riches phase goes a notch above and becomes greed, power and eventually an inevitable descent. When you are this far down the rabbit hole there ain't no coming back to the surface, unscathed at least. A movie with excessive nudity, sleaze and drug use, The Wolf of Wall Street is exactly how its meant to be and Martin Scorsese has done a job which takes its justified crown at the box office and most likely even at the Oscars. One of the strong points of the movie is humor and Wolf of Wall Street packs it in tons. This is by far Scorsese's funniest movie till date that I developed a cramp in my stomach laughing so much.The Wolf of Wall Street is about 3 hours long and not once did I feel an impatient bladder, I was rooted to the seat eager to know where Jordan was going with it. Agreed Jordan Belfort is not guy you'd want your kids looking up to and his ways are never strictly speaking legal. But despite that you want this guy to emerge at the top for his ambitions, this character is as fun as it can get and who brought life to Jordan? Leonardo Di Caprio of course! This is maybe his 6th collab with Martin Scorsese and you have to owe it to them, they do make a dynamic duo. Leonardo despite his charismatic and magnetic performance in his recent movies never landed him an Academy Award but who cares? He has proved that he is one of the greatest actors of our times who literally steals every scene he's in. For once I wanted to step back from the cosmetic layer of Jordan's pompous life and have a different angle at his ways. But Leonardo Di Caprio's performance was just so captivating and he just didn't give me a chance, there was no stepping back when you have delved this much into being entertained.A stellar supporting cast promises that the screen is always filled with intriguing characters. Jonah Hill especially is a force to reckon with as Jordan's most trusted Donnie. This guy has become the go to guy for brilliant supporting roles and is getting increasingly entertaining, starring in almost all of the Academy Award nominated movies. This is indeed a boy's club where there's little importance for feminine characters and I felt the their roles in the movie were objectified. Of course it'd be Pan Am's Margot Robbie's nude scenes that'd be the talk of the day after watching this movie and it is indeed hard to take your eyes off her but you have to admit it takes a splendid performance to be noticed when you've got a star studded male cast to compete with. Matthew McConaughey, Jean Dujardin, Kyle Chandler and Jon Bernthal equally deserves a thumbs up for their short but memorable roles.Its impossible to deduce how Martin Scorsese had done it. The man's edging over his 70s and has crafted a movie so modern, so energetic and with so much passion that even a younger director would be challenged to top it. I really don't care how he is being criticised for his apparent sleazy glorification of the stockbrokers or for the 506 F-bombs thats been dropped in the whole movie. He just delivered another masterpiece, an edge of the seat dramedy that is on par with most of the his as well as others' best movies ever. I enjoyed every frame of it and was left wanting more. Relentlessly funny, loud & ceaselessly crazy, The Wolf of Wall Street in undeniably one of the best movies of 2013 and is by far the best time I had at the movies in recent times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.,"Boasting the fifth collaboration between lauded director Martin Scorsese and can-do-no-wrong A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street signals the moment the two finally took the step over the brink. Their previous films together - Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010) - were all solid, if hardly groundbreaking works. With The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese seems to have let go of his reservations and embraced the daring, X- rated innovations of his 70's and early 80's work, and DiCaprio deserves to look smug after giving his finest performance to date. From the opening shot of DiCaprio snorting cocaine from between a prostitute's open legs, this is 3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.Shortly after being taught the ways of excess and cocaine by his Wall Street boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), young stockbroker Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) finds himself out of work following Black Monday. When he takes a boiler room job at a stockbroker's dealing in penny stocks, he learns that commission for these stocks are 50%. Soon enough he is making money hand over fist, setting up his own company, Stratton Oakmont, along with his dentally-challenged follower Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). He recruits some of Donnie's marijuana-dealing friends and teaches them a script designed to sell, but ultimately the operation is a pump and dump scam. He is labelled The Wolf of Wall Street in a negative magazine article, yet this propels him to cult fame, and soon has flocks of eager young Gordon Gekko's begging for a piece of the pie.At one minute shy of 3 hours, the film could certainly do with a trim. Yet Scorsese and DiCaprio's obvious fascination with this anti-hero means that we are treated to experiencing every juvenile and ridiculous second of Belfort's rise to Wall Street superstardom. We get flights with on-board orgies and drug taking, Jonah Hill masturbating in the middle of a crowded party at the sight of Belfort's future wife Naomi (the stunning Margot Robbie), dwarf-tossing, and Belfort taking helicopter lessons whilst drugged off his face. This is certainly dangerous territory - the film could easily slip into a celebration of frat-house antics, which is kind of does, but Scorsese keep the insanity levels at such a height that it's hard not to just laugh and shake your head.A lot of it is down to the performances of DiCaprio and Hill, the latter of whom is proving to be a damn fine actor beneath that Jew-fro and obnoxious mannerisms. The film's highlight focuses on a botched scheme to smuggle $2 million dollars via Brad (Jon Bernthal) to reptilian French banker Jean (Jean Dujardin). Having learned that FBI agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) has his phones tapped, Belfort must get home to warn Donnie to get off the phone. The only problem is, they've taken a large quantity of Qualuudes. Thinking that years of indulgence have caused a tolerance to build up, the expired best before date have simply lead to a delayed reaction. Belfort suffers from what he describes as 'the cerebral palsy stage', flailing around on the floor without control of his limbs or his speech. His long journey home is the most laugh-out- loud example of drug-fuelled ineptitude since the ether scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998).Of course, the film's morals are questionable, and Scorsese has suffered the same narrow-minded criticism he did from his 'glamorisation' of the mob in Goodfellas (1990). Yet I like to think that Scorsese trusts and respects his audience enough to allow them to think for themselves, to get a laugh from the on-screen antics whilst understanding that this is not the behaviour of a sane or ethical individual. Refreshingly, the movie stays away from any moral preaching or underlying messages, and simply tells a story because it's entertaining. Although it doesn't quite justify it's 3 hour running time, this is the most fun I've had watching a comedy for a long time, and proves that there's plenty of life in Scorsese yet.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Excessively excessive comedy,"Rated R Post... within the first 5 minutes, Leonardo Dicaprio snorts cocaine off a hooker's ass. The rest of the movie is just as excessive. A spectacular orgy of excess: cocaine, Quaalude, materialism and full frontal female nudity. Check your morals and you might have a good time. But DEFINITELY NOT for everyone.Scorcese directs in his usual High NRG style (like ""After Hours"" and ""The Color of Money"", the camera never stops moving.) DiCarpio goes all out with this character, making him human, though not heroic at all. These are awful people doing awful things, and the film might revel too much in that, without showing the consequences of it.A definite GUY film, probably could complement with Pacino and DiPalma's ""Scarface"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Not Marty's best work, more flash than substance","It's comforting to imagine that everything Martin Scorsese touches turns to gold, but it's not true. The same rules of thoroughness that apply to every other filmmaker also apply to Scorsese. If he rushes through a compressed editing schedule to meet an Oscar-friendly release date – as he did on The Wolf of Wall Street – his work suffers. Scorsese's latest clocks in at 180 minutes, not because its characters or narrative demand that kind of exhaustive treatment, but because Scorsese didn't have time to find a more focused, impactful shape for the film. Exploring the personal and professional corruption of notorious stockbroker Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street has several memorable sequences, but it plays like a clumsy, repetitive work-in-progress.Praise has already been heaped upon Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill for their charismatic performances, but it's important to note that this is wacky comic acting more concerned with eliciting shock and amusement than any deeper human truth. This miscalculation of emphasis also infects the storytelling in a more general sense. Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter focus nearly all of their attention on the excesses – sex, drugs, greed – that drive these characters, rarely placing them in a context that might reveal complicating texture or shading. It's perfectly logical to portray these characters as one-note imbeciles with an absence of inner life, but this also makes for stifling, unsatisfying drama.The Wolf of Wall Street never finds its bearings, but it becomes more tolerable in its second half when Belfort finally encounters some resistance (in the form of FBI agent Patrick Denham, played by Kyle Chandler) and sees his warped life of excess start to unravel. But even then, the film is dragged down by its reliance on Belfort's moronic perspective – the film is derived from his self-mythologizing memoir – which gives an Animal House frivolity to his constant misbehaviour, a smokescreen that distracts from the devastation of his professional crimes.Simply recycling sensibilities from Goodfellas and The Departed may seem like a logical strategy, but there's a crucial difference this time around. Whereas gangsters generally do harm to other gangsters, Belfort's victims are relatively innocent, draining this film's lawlessness of charm and fascination. Scorsese's ability to find humanity in reprehensible characters has always been one of his greatest strengths, but he doesn't even attempt to humanize the characters in The Wolf of Wall Street. This wilful oversight results in one of the director's most disposable, nihilistic films, a half-hearted effort that abandons the complexities of his own world view in favour of Belfort's clueless primitivism. This might have made for a uniquely compelling Todd Phillips (The Hangover) movie, but in the hands of Scorsese, this mildly entertaining diversion feels hopelessly erratic and insubstantial.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
My favorite movie of all time,"Why Leonardo DiCaprio didn't win the Oscar for best actor, I will never understand. Matthew McConaughey must have put on an absolutely indescribable performance in Dallas Buyers Club. I have yet to see Dallas Buyers Club, so I can't say Matthew didn't deserve it.The Wolf of Wall Street is insane though! It is a very well directed movie by my favorite director of all time, Martin Scorsese. This movie shows what it was like as a stockbroker in a very unique way as a comedy. However, if it wasn't a comedy, it would be a very boring movie. Well done by the writers.This is definitely my favorite movie of all time now. Even at 3 hours long, I wish the movie continued. I would recommend seeing it, but children should NOT see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Great movie-making, DiCaprio astonishes...but it's a bit all the same, all the time","The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)First of all—yes, this is a zany, hepped up ride, and it's intense and tiring and impressive. ButAs crazy as the hedonism here is, this is a notably straightforward telling of the tale of a stockbroker's rise and fall. And as energized as it is, it's also monotonous. You can't quite say it's boring—or maybe you can, because after the fifth or fifteenth party overflowing with drugs and prostitutes you go from numb to restless —but it occurs to you later: the story is thin, as a narrative structure.Too bad. This could have been edited to a 90 minute movie—it's TWICE that as it stands—and it would have had even more velocity and energy. And maybe a few details would be left out, but you know what? They wouldn't matter! In fact, all that matters is the single large arc as Belfort builds a stock trading company out of nothing—out of a garage, literally—and then sees the FBI roll in toward the end.Don't get me wrong—Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing, covering the whole terrain from drugged out of his mind to inspirational speaker, from down in the dumps to innocently hopeful. He's so ""on"" in every scene it's a marvel. And around him are some equally strong players, such as Jonah Hill as his second in command. The women have less to do (more on that in a sec) but the woman playing Belfort's wife, Margot Robbie, gives the character more depth than you might expect, and with a great New Yorker working class accent.Scorsese directs this as he always directs—with absolute force. He doesn't know the word subtle, which is fine (which is great overall—we have other, subtle directors). Whether you look at ""Shutter Island"" or ""Hugo"" or this movie (all recent examples), you see someone who is worth following closely. He's one of the great directors we have. If all of these movies have flaws, they have so many other things going for them you end up impressed, and maybe even moved.But moved—emotionally moved—is not the result of this film. You can say that was on purpose (people have). Fine. But that means the bacchanalia is what it is. You watch and watch. And it's such a man's world—and I mean men with their testosterone unchecked, supplemented, worshipped—that women are almost totally there as toys and companions. For sex and for sex. It doesn't matter if you agree or not, if you're a woman or not, or if you have politics on this one way or the other. It remains clear that we see nothing from their point of view, and we are made to accept (as a viewer in a chair) this unevenness. It's actually sickening, if you give it the time of day. And if you really study it, you see that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is yet another film that trumpets a male over female system as good, or as inevitable.Maybe it is! (I'm not defending sexism here, hold on.) But maybe you need the testosterone to be as greedy, cruel, mindless, and driven as all the men in this movie are (including the FBI guy in his ""dignified"" way). Maybe this is another way to condemn the mosh pit of Wall Street completely. Maybe there's another way to run an economy, to have corporations make things in a competitive world.Probably not, but you do strain a bit to give the movie some rationale. The real content here is more gut level—intensity and insanity. It's amazing. But it is what it is, too, an expert docudrama with surprisingly few surprises.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
What the hell did I just watch?,"If you don't like what you see within the first 15 minutes of this film, turn it off or leave the theater, because that's what you will see repeated over and over again for the next three hours. Okay, I get it. There are people who will do anything for money and who are morally bankrupt. This is Hollywood meets soft porn when soft porn has already been killed off by one-click-accessible porn. I'm not a puritan. This is just an objective fact. We live in the Age of Pornography. I, therefore, don't understand why Scorsese thinks this is the 'shocking' lens he should use to educate us on the evils of Wall Street greed and excess, unless he hopes to drag in the teenage boy audience, in which case, it simply amounts to pandering. In the end, I felt that it was Scorsese himself who was morally bankrupt. I think it is time for him to reassess his career. No great film was ever made so by pandering to base instincts. Great films stand on the strength of fundamental truths about human nature that leave the viewer leaving the theater uplifted, inspired, or awakened to elements of human nature in some way. This does not mean all movies have to have happy endings. The knowledge one takes from a good film can force one to reassess their values or ideas and this can be a difficult experience. But there is nothing fundamentally challenging about this film. Even if you try to think of it as a sort of documentary, it falls flat.Now, what about the acting? There is no doubt that Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor. However, I haven't been impressed by many of his recent efforts (i.e. Gatsby). In this film his character is one dimensional from beginning to end. There is no character development and no real opportunities for him to show his acting range. The same can be said for all the other actors, but given such an insipid script, what can you expect? After a couple of hours of watching Scorsese trying to educate us on the evils of wealth, I just wanted the film to end. He seemed to have an ax to grind in the tradition of other ax-grinders like Michael Moore and Oliver Stone. The last hour was simply an ordeal. Scenes seemed randomly cut and pasted together. Although I can't say there were not some interesting scenes within the film, they only served as sad reminders of Scorsese's wasted talent.It makes no sense at all to me why this film is rated so highly. Maybe there are a number of people who were surprised to learn that excessive wealth can lead to bad behavior. All I learned is to be careful of giving too much credence to the ratings of any Scorsese film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Dog of Wall Street,"I found this movie to be tedious, boring and not all that well made. This nearly 3 hour movie should be CUT to about two hours. Things drag on without much of a conclusion.

The drug orgies are way too frequent and way too long.Leonardo is a good actor, but not a very compelling character here. He's not that believable as a salesman or druggy. Martin needs to hire an editor who has the courage to CUT, CUT, CUT and tell a story succinctly as possible.

Scorcese Still Showing His Master Filmmaking Powers,"Wolf of Wall St. is a fascinating film by a master filmmaker, bringing 40 years of skill to the table; from casting, to shot selection, to how he pulls you into that world. And a guy who just plain having fun. The 3-hour film, traces the rise and fall of Wall St con man Jordan Belfort. A tightly constructed film, I wasn't bored for a minute.There were some people who kicked up a fuss about the film and its glorification of these slimy characters, their materialistic lifestyle, and their treatment of women as nothing but sex objects. Some have said that the film glorifies that lifestyle, but to me, Winter (screenwriter) and Scorcese went out of their way to show the reality of it. The film focuses on how animalistic and primal people can become when greed takes them over. The obsession with money and power becomes a pathology. This, of course, is what many Wall St people will loathe about the film.As for accuracy, I'm sure Jordan Belfort (who the film is based on and worked as a consultant on the film), embellished a few things, but according to one of the FBI agents who worked on the case, many of the more outrageous aspects depicted in the book and film were accurate.The sad part is that even though there will will many Wall St workers and finance people who will watch the film and think, ""That's a bunch of crap. They're painting with a broad brush. It's not fair,"" there will be far too many young (and not-so-young) Wall St up-and-comers who will ignore the whole last hour of Wolf of Wall St., and simply look at the first 2 hours as an inspirational tale of the American dream.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

I'm a former member of the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens. The year I turned 26, as the head of my own brokerage firm, I made $49 million, which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.""The film was flawlessly shot (nominations for best film and directing) and, although it lasts for three hours, it is not boring for a moment, and for the most part it is even very entertaining. Leonardo DiCaprio excelled in the lead role, but, as usual, remained only on the Oscar nomination. He is supported by Jonah Hill (also an Oscar nominee), Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, and many other not-so-famous, but no less good actors.If you are looking for a dramatic but humorous portrayal of life on a high but shaky leg, a newly rich man who lives fast in crazy sex, drugs, and more drugs manner, you are in the right place. To gain some idea of the explicitness and decadence in the film, it is interesting to note that DiCaprio once cited the Tinto Brass' ""Caligula"" (1979) as an inspiration and role model for making this movie.""Let me tell you something. There's no nobility in poverty. I have been a rich man and I have been a poor man. And I choose rich every time. Because, at least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of the limo, wearing a $2000 suit and a $40,000 gold watch.""But, although this story has some indication of social criticism and the potential for a deeper and more serious film, it still remains in the domain of a typical American blockbuster, without much substance and point.7,5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A Cinematic Masterpiece That Roars with Unapologetic Brilliance!,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013) is nothing short of a modern cinematic masterpiece, deserving every bit of a perfect 10/10 stars. This film is a relentless, audacious, and electrifying rollercoaster ride that leaves an indelible mark on the world of cinema.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a tour de force performance as Jordan Belfort, the charismatic yet morally bankrupt stockbroker whose rise and fall is the core of this exhilarating narrative. DiCaprio's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing; he immerses himself fully in the character, capturing every facet of Belfort's complex personality. His magnetic presence alone makes this film worth watching.The supporting cast is equally exceptional. Jonah Hill shines as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's unhinged partner in crime, providing a perfect counterbalance to DiCaprio's character. The chemistry between these two actors is palpable, and their on-screen interactions are electrifying. Margot Robbie is a revelation as Naomi Lapaglia, Belfort's seductive and fiery wife, bringing depth and complexity to her character.Scorsese's direction is nothing short of brilliant. He fearlessly dives into the dark and morally bankrupt world of Wall Street excess, portraying it with unflinching honesty and a wicked sense of humor. The film's pacing is relentless, and Scorsese's use of music, especially the iconic ""Gimme Shelter"" sequence, is a testament to his mastery of the craft.Terence Winter's screenplay is a work of art, seamlessly blending humor, drama, and social commentary. The dialogue crackles with wit and satire, and it keeps the audience engaged throughout the film's epic three-hour runtime.Visually, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is stunning, capturing the opulence and decadence of Belfort's world with breathtaking precision. The film's use of practical effects and seamless editing further enhances its visual appeal.What truly sets this film apart is its unapologetic exploration of greed, corruption, and excess. Scorsese holds a mirror to society's obsession with wealth and power, and he does so with razor-sharp wit and intelligence. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a scathing critique of the American Dream gone awry, and it doesn't pull any punches.In conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic tour de force that deserves every accolade it has received. It's a wild, exhilarating, and thought-provoking journey that showcases the best of filmmaking talent. With DiCaprio's unforgettable performance, Scorsese's masterful direction, and a screenplay that crackles with brilliance, this film stands as a testament to the power of cinema. If you haven't experienced it yet, do yourself a favor and watch this modern classic. It's a 10/10 star triumph that will leave you both exhilarated and contemplative.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Wolf of Wall Street,"The Wolf of Wall Street was directed & produced by my favorite director in Martin Scorsese, who's directed popular titles like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Departed, Shutter Island, and my god, the man did it again! By taking authentic source material, while slightly deviating it from the truth, he created this MASTERPIECE, inspired by Jordan Belfort's real story, and his autobiographies.Terrance Winter & Martin Scorsese did a PHENOMENAL job telling this story. The narrative has so many memorable scenes, amd tremendous layers, that holds so much rewatch value! After watching countless videos on the true story, and what the real Jordan Belfort (who was also on set for the production) thought; all of these seemed to be fantasy's, were almost all true, and immaculately presented! According to Belfort, Scorsese & Winter's dumbed things down! Not only was this the best paced out, three hour film I've seen, but probably one of the greatest films I've seen, in general - I was so intrigued from minute one, all the way to minute one-hundred-eighty!The screenplay by Winter's was super creative & and so much fun! He added so many great layers to each character, giving them their own distinct personalities. The script was so vulgar, yet very witty, while still being ridiculously funny.Even though Martin Scorsese & Terrace Winter's flipped some of the names, and some being made up completely, due to secrecy reasons, this A-list cast had such inspiring charisma, and displayed all the real actions, tremendously! I have seen A LOT of films, and more than a few Dicaprio films, but this was hands down the best acting I've seen across a cast, but giving tremendous credit to Leonardo DiCaprio, who got snubbed for an Academy Award for his performance! His anti-hero swagger, with such an engrossing personality, brought an abundance of charm, wit, and tons of comedy to this film. His love life was also nailed to a T! Margot Robbie's character development in the third act compliments the tone it was going for. The way Scorsese displays their relationship was pretty accurate, almost all the way down the line. Dan Porush, named Donnie Azoff in the film, played by Jonah Hill, is Jordan's second in command. Jonah Hill put on a FANTASTIC performance; definitely my favorite performance of his. I also thought Jonah Hill was snubbed for an Academy Award. Jonah Hill embodied Dan Porush to a T, down to his wife, his ambitions attitude, and everything else around it. As far as the strattonites go, in Henry Zebrowski, Kenneth Choi, Brian Sacca, Jon Bernthal & P.J Byne, they had the most chaotic roles out of everyone, on the side of Leo. Every character knew their role, and played it to perfection. I loved Rob Reiner in this film, even though he wasn't that important. His crazy dad attitude was displayed clear as crystal, and was an overall great addition! Matthew McConaughey had another small, but important role in Jordan Belfort's character development. After doing further research, McConaughey had a lot more of an impact than his screen time allowed. One of my favorite additions to this film, was Bo Dietl, playing Belfort's PI. Bo Dietl was the actual PI of the real Jordan Belfort. His character was just another small, but necessary addition, with such an effortless performance, due to Dietl playing himself.The editing by probably one of the most credible editors in the game, in Thelma Shoonmaker, who edited all of Scorsese's films, had a tough task at hand. This film was 3 hours long, so I can only imagine how many deleted scenes there were, and what the run-time would've actually been, without so many cuts, and mashes. Shoonmaker did make some scenes a little obvious that they were two scenes mashed together, or shot at different times, but it's hard to fault someone with that much on their plate, with that much of a hefty resumé.Overall, this is in my top five FAVORITE films of all time, and I HIGHLY recommend this film. Another film you MUST see before you die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Wolf of Wall Street stands as another masterpiece by Scorsese and DiCaprio and is an absolute must-see,"I recently watched The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) on Prime. The storyline follows a young man in New York who excels at day trading and quickly rises through the ranks to amass great wealth, eventually starting his own company. As he becomes more affluent and successful, he draws the government's attention for his activities. Can he elude the long arm of the law, or will they bring about his downfall?Directed by the iconic Martin Scorsese (Casino) and featuring stellar performances from a talented cast including Leonardo DiCaprio (Django), Jonah Hill (Superbad), Margot Robbie (Barbie), Matthew McConaughey (Killer Joe), Shea Whigham (Splinter), Kyle Chandler (Super 8) and Jon Bernthal (The Walking Dead).This film boasts an outstanding cast, mesmerizing performances, sharp dialogue, superb narration, and features beautiful women throughout, alongside unbelievable circumstances that capture the viewer's imagination. Every scene within the office setting is mind-blowing, making you yearn to be part of that extravagant lifestyle. While the ending may be somewhat predictable, as all good things must eventually come to an end, especially illegal ones, DiCaprio and Hill's dynamic chemistry shines through. The supporting roles played by Robbie and Chandler are executed flawlessly, and the cameo by the actual Wolf of Wall Street at the end adds an intriguing touch.In conclusion, The Wolf of Wall Street stands as another masterpiece by Scorsese and DiCaprio and is an absolute must-see. I would give this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
What Is This Film Supposed To Convey To Its Viewers?,"From what I understand, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is loosely based on a real-life individual. However, director Martin Scorsese delivers such an over-the-top caricature that either Jordan Belfort was truly the wildest individual to ever roam this planet or this is the most bonkers ""based on a true story"" liberty-taking of all time.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Belfort (Leonard DiCaprio), a Wall Street banker who experiences a market crash on his first day in NYC. As such, he starts his own firm--Stratton Oakmont--duping clients into buying massive amounts of penny stocks. But Belfort is an excellent con man, and soon he's challenging Wall Street institutions in terms of profit. Along the way, he lives the most profane, drug-addled, sexually promiscuous, over-the-top lifestyle one could possibly imagine. All this puts him on the radar of the FBI, of course, in particular Agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) who is out for the bust of his life.At heart, I think ""Wolf of Wall Street"" is a parody of Wall Street culture--the kind of shyster existence that generates as much depravity as it does wealth. I'm sure there are some genuine lessons to be learned from all that.The problem here is that Scorsese leans so hard into the debauchery of the whole scene that by the end I didn't find anything or anyone likable. I don't consider myself a prude by any means (especially when it comes to movies), but the amount of profanity, drug use, and sexual antics in ""Wolf"" did reach--and surpass--my limits. There is not a nuanced moment in the entire picture--everything is a slap to the face, so to speak.All of that being said, there are just enough things happening in ""Wolf"" to make it somewhat memorable: DiCaprio is on fire from beginning to end, Margot Robbie is utterly entrancing, Jonah Hill is reliable solid, and it has certainly produced some gif-able moments or speeches.But other than those aesthetic pop culture snippets, I found the whole of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" to be quite a mess. Mainly for a lack of nuance in trying to convey any sort of message about Wall Street and its ilk. By the end, I felt bludgeoned to death as opposed to thoughtful or engaged.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"A Hysterical Ride, But A Little More Depth Wouldn't Have Caused Any Harm!","Scorsese and DiCaprio's fifth venture together, this might be their most mainstream attempt till now. This black-hearted comedy, filled with colour, glamour, parties, money, corruption, drugs and sex, oozes of energy throughout it's three-hour long run-time. I admit it's a fun-filled ride throughout, and it never gets boring. But after a certain point, the narration, the jokes and the parties get monotonous. For such a long movie, the character-development and character-exploration is very poor, and there are so many characters and scenes which don't have any special relevance or importance in the whole story being told. I can't believe it's Terence Winter (from 'The Sopranos' and 'Boardwalk Empire') who wrote the script. The main distraction while watching a biopic like this is that the things shown on screen (fabulous office parties, amount of drugs each of the them take within a day, their ability to function properly in such high, the money lavishly spent around, and so many other things) always make you wonder how much of it is accurate and how much of it is complete exaggeration; you don't get a clear picture of the people and lifestyle of that place and era.But whatever you say, with whatever is given to him, Leonardo audaciously gets into the skin of the character and is fascinating to watch. Moira MacDonald from Seattle Times aptly says, ""DiCaprio is positively reptilian; he spits out his lines with a nasty glee. You're both horrified and enchanted by this creature - a monster in Armani"". And Jonah Hill is almost as integral to the movie as DiCaprio himself; he's hilariously terrific from beginning till end.I like that the movie doesn't shy away from being filthy. Plus Scorsese's depiction of a modern tragedy as an epic farce works to its advantage. Looks like Scorsese was in quite a fun mood or pretty high (like the movie's characters) while making this. Though it's a hysterical and thoroughly-entertaining journey, I still don't understand why Scorsese and DiCaprio jumped into making this completely exaggerated alleged life of a convicted swindler. Anyway, the feature is good not great. With a little more depth, the movie could have been timeless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Crude and Unsatisfying,"I had heard good things about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it. My first thought was that this movie is long. I was prepared to watch this but with a runtime of 2 hours 59 minutes you need to really grab some snacks and prepare yourself.Prior to this movie I had never seen a Martin Scorsese film, but I have read things about his movies and I would say it's right on par with his other films in regards to women. I feel like women in this movie were treated more like set decoration than real people with a purpose to moving the story forward. We get it. He's a sex addict who cheats on his wife and likes strippers. I think it was a bit overdone.With that being said, I think the acting and the screenplay were top notch. The story was well written, it was directed well, the plot was interesting, etc. It was a fun watch and I think the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill was great. I feel like it was an unconventional team up that really added something to the film. I also hated the ending, but maybe that was what they were going for. It felt very unsatisfying.Overall, I enjoyed the story and the acting. I just feel like the runtime could've been cut down if some of the sex scenes were cut out. All in all, if excessive drug use and overdone nudity don't bother you much, it's worth the watch!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (Martin Scorsese, 2013) ***","Considering its many affiliations with American HUSTLE (noted in that film's review), it is interesting to watch how in the former, the F.B.I. emerged as foolhardy in their undeniably well-meaning approach – while here they are treated more or less as the heroes of the day when their operation proves a resounding success! Anyway, much has been said of this latest Martin Scorsese/Leonardo Di Caprio collaboration – especially in how it treads the line of tastelessness for much of its 3 hour duration (with some of the admittedly over-the-top sex'n'drugs antics seeming to belong more in a grindhouse or even ""Euro-Cult"" movie from the 1970s!). Still, I feel this backlash (especially for the way such serious offenses as depicted in the film are treated in blackly comic terms) was itself extreme: just note how much attention has been given to the dwarf-throwing gag (the pros and cons of such a wild scheme are amusingly delineated just like any other business-related item!) but, seeing how it occurs during the very opening scene, one would expect the viewer to have totally worked it out of his system by the time the picture's end credits start rolling! Indeed, to Scorsese's credit, if the Jordan Belfort gang's scamming of both poor and rich people was dealt with so thoroughly – or, should I say, the rewards they reaped from it – these characters' fall from grace is at least as detailed and spectacular; so, in that respect, it comes off as a balanced evaluation of a particular lifestyle which, like it or not, existsand to which gullible people themselves contribute in a misguided attempt to increase their own bank account without having to work for it!As for Di Caprio, his performance is indeed among the year's best and one of his own towering achievements – but, personally, I feel he was even better in THE AVIATOR (2004) and SHUTTER ISLAND (2010; for which he was not even Oscar-nominated!), both also for Scorsese. The film under review is up for just five Academy Awards, which rather shuts it out from winning any of the top categories – unless the AMPAS voters prefer the star to Matthew McConaughey in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (another initially reprehensible real-life character dealing in illegal substances but, in his case, for the common good rather than self-gratification), which I sincerely doubt!; incidentally, McConaughey himself turns up here early on as the anti-hero's mentor and whose ritualistic hum to get him functioning on a daily basis is even worked into a song by the actor and the film's music director Robbie Robertson (ex-member of The Band and a Scorsese regular)!Jonah Hill as the protagonist's sidekick is also shortlisted in the Supporting Actor category but, while his contribution is highly entertaining, there is little depth to the part (even less so where their other colleagues are concerned, who somehow seem stuck in the lower rungs of the firm despite its obvious flourish!). Di Caprio's role – being based on the book written by Belfort himself – is clearly much more rounded, then, especially since his intermittent narration is adamant that money and power (even more so when acquired at a young age and unlawfully) too often lead one on a self-destructive pathand the fact that he was able to rise again after 'doing time' is a testament to his talent for survival, if nothing else! To go back to its ties with American HUSTLE, the F.B.I. sequences necessarily recall those of Scorsese's earlier and superior GOODFELLAS (1990) – which suggests that its best (and funniest) moments tend to involve the after-effects of the copious intake of drugs, notably DiCaprio getting tongue-tied during a vital telephone call and his 'spastic' attempts to reach his luxurious car and drive back home. For the record, film director Rob Reiner appears as Di Caprio's colourful dad and Jean Dujardin is a Swiss Bank manager (to where the countless millions are literally transferred out of the federal authorities' reach). On a personal note, I should say that I was expecting to hate this going in but I have had to eat my words and admit that it was an enjoyable if (no pun intended) taxing ride...which, as soon as it was over, made me run to the medicine cabinet and pop a headache pill myself!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

This 3 hour movie is filled with so much energy and comedy dialogs (of course with profanity). As other Scorsese's films, there is a whole lot of description on drugs. There were three major comedy scenes that were hilarious. Few others were forced.Pros : Strong acting, direction and screenplay. Cons : Too much xxx orgy, excessive drugs and profanity.

Epic,"Absolutely astonishing piece of movie making, doesn't feel dragged at any point and the very essence of excess is maintained throughout the movie.

"Great, not perfect...","I've always been a fan of Martin Scorcese's work. He's had great cooperations with Leonardo Dicaprio before, so for me, this was a must see. However, I have some mixed feelings about the result.On the upside I thought the level of acting was great. I have always been a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio's work, and, even though I didn't feel that much sympathy for his character, he portrayed Jordan Belfort beautifully. Jonah Hill did a solid job as well, and I liked the absolutely gorgeous Margot Robbie very much (and not just because she didn't leave much to the imagination). As you can expect from Martin Scorcese, the movie is very well made, the photography was great, and the music supported the scenes very well. As far as atmosphere goes, you could really feel the madness. And last but not least, I was happy there was room for some humor.On the downside, I felt it was a very superficial portrait. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how close the storytelling of the movie is to the book, but at times the movie felt like a giant collection of moments out of Jordan Belfort's life, rather than the story of his life. Even though the movie lasts for three hours, there's little or no room for character development. The focus was also continuously on Jordan himself and his side of the story. For example the whole fraud aspect was shown as his big success. There was no room for his victims in the movie. The investigation by the FBI was also rather non existing, as is his relationship with Naomi. After he gets to know her and marries her, she almost completely disappears to the background.In conclusion, it's a good movie, with a powerful portrayal of Jordan Belfort, for which I'm still giving an 8/10. However, the story could have been told better, making it more of a story, allowing characters to develop and showing more than just one side of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Wolf of Wall Street is among Scorsese's best,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a loud, flashy, and unfathomably vulgar movie populated by a wide variety of repulsive and narcissistic characters. In the hands of a lesser director, it could have easily ended up being unpleasant and unwatchable. However, thanks to acclaimed director Martin Scorsese's clever satirical touch and a witty script that surprises at every turn, The Wolf of Wall Street is a wild and uninhibited thrill-ride of a movie that's hard to forget.The movie tells the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man who went from struggling to pay his bills to being one of the most wealthy but immoral and corrupt stockbrokers in the country. As he leads an increasingly reckless and dishonest life, Belfort quickly transforms from a law-abiding citizen to an uncaring white-collar criminal.Leonardo DiCaprio may have finally found his Oscar-winning role playing Jordan Belfort. Although his character is far too selfish to be likable, DiCaprio's spirited performance makes Jordan endlessly fascinating in his depravity. Jonah Hill gives an equally impressive performance as Donnie, Jordan's best friend and the co-founder of his firm. Hill's loud-mouthed and often inconsiderate behavior as Donnie makes for some of the funniest scenes in the movie.Although many of the scenes are far from light-hearted, The Wolf of Wall Street is ultimately a comedy. The characters' wildly reckless and irresponsible actions provide most of the humor. One particularly funny and memorable scene involves Jordan trying in vain to reach his car and drive home while under the influence of drugs he had taken. Unable to stand up and walk to the car, Jordan is forced to slide and drag his way across the floor, all the while yelling incoherent slurred sentences.Running in at 165 minutes, The Wolf of Wall Street is not a short movie by any means. Although it's always enthralling, there are a few scenes that could have easily been cut to shorten the running time. One series of scenes that wasn't necessary involves Jordan Belfort getting into a dispute with a butler over $50,000 in cash that went missing. The scenes are entertaining enough, but they have no relevance to the story as a whole and aren't essential to the movie.The Wolf of Wall Street is not the sort of movie one would expect a 71 year-old man to direct. Director Martin Scorsese is far from an ordinary 71 year-old man though, and with The Wolf of Wall Street he has crafted his most lively, compelling, and outrageous movie in years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The fact that they cast the real Jordan Belfort in a cameo is a slap in the face to his victims. I wish the film had shown the devastation he caused.

Great fictional work from Hollywood,"This is one of those films that will make the smart consumer think about what it means to ""like"" a piece of art work (if you can call Hollywood filmmaking that). Is the film glorifying the horrible crimes that Belfort and his cronies committed, and if so, can one still judge the film and the actors based on their performance and not on the morality of its subject matter? It's difficult, and I respect both types of opinions.Just looking at the film as a fictional story (which I am sure it is, mostly, since Belfort seems to have a knack for embellishing the truth and making a seemingly uninteresting thing the most exciting thing in the world to sell it as best as he can), the plot is rather formulaic for Hollywood standards. Character development is not the main point here, as the characters are larger than life caricatures, even down to the ""boy scout"" FBI guy who has it in for the bad guy (whose motives and story are almost entirely unknown to us, since the story is narrated by Belfort). DiCaprio is in top form, but the rest of the actors and actresses take the prize in genuinely thrilling performances. The acting is probably the best aspect of the film (apart from the glimmer and shine), as every single main and supporting role is played to full potential and perfectly to fit the caricature written out for it.Perhaps the most interesting character is Belfort's number 1, Donnie. We see more character development here, where the nerdy and greedy guy rises to the top and lives a very large life. His morals seem even more lacking than Belfort's, but this is perhaps because Belfort is telling the story.The other interesting, though not novel, part of the story is the role of drugs in Wall Street. Drugs and inevitably sex. It is perhaps alarming that the markets that can ruin our lives by crashing, etc. are run by people who abuse drugs all the time. Belfort is not the one to say this first, and I am sure he won't be the last, either.All in all, the film is ""entertaining,"" if not cringe-worthy. Some moments that are absolutely hilarious in their absurdity can make you cry if you lost a lot of money in the market or lost your job in the recent economic crisis, because in reality, they are not funny. That a company can make billions within hours of a launch, well, that is just sickening no matter what your world view is, unless you are the guy who is making all the money (in which case it is kind of sickening, still, but in a different way).Moralistically, the film is like any art work that deals with humans who commit crimes. I did not find it more glorifying than mafia films where the godfather orders people's deaths ""for the family."" The truth is most humans have a moral understanding and ways to justify their actions according to some moral structure, no matter how twisted or unorthodox the rest of the people might think their structure is. Belfort justified his actions in some ways, and his actions hurt people (including his family), like any other criminal. I did not come away with a message from the film that said ""What Belfort did was awesome!"" It was certainly something more like ""Belfort was successful. His success hurt other people and helped some others. In general, he was an asshole, who did not care much about anyone, but himself and for anything, but getting rich.""The real message is: don't invest your money in the stock market unless you are filthy rich. And even then, don't invest too much of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Porn Movie,"This movie should be rated x. Still impressed the American public is so desirous of porn and drugs use...and thinks it is funny. Congratulations to Scorsese for knowing his audience.

A Brilliant Satire,"The big problem a lot of people seem to have with this film is that it ""glorifies"" a life of attractive women, enough drugs to kill a horse and conning the average American people out of millions of dollars. I disagree. When you see a man crawling across the ground, partially paralyzed from over dosing on drugs as his life crumbles around him I struggle to see what is so cool about him. I see the film as more of a parody of the twenty first century, showing a mans life falling apart around him as he goes after more and more money, more than any one person really needs but still feeling it isn't enough. The cinematography is brilliant as is the direction by Scorsese, his choices of music perfectly compliment the on screen action and on a technical level I can't fault the film.I love the actors working here, just all top notch no matter the size of their part. Leonardo DiCaprio gives possibly the best performance in his career, Margot Robbie could charm the socks off of a stone wall and Jonah Hill is so supremely dislikeable that every time I see his face I want to punch him. I've read reviews saying that the film doesn't give enough information on how the scam that was being peddled worked and while I can admit that there wasn't much information given on how it worked I think it plays into the film that we are told we are too stupid to understand it, like these Wall Street people couldn't get any more pretentious. To conclude I love this film, I think it works amazingly as a movie and even better as a satire of our times. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"A fun movie, no much more than that","I'll start saying that I liked this movie, is fun and doesn't have the typical Hollywood filters and censure, that makes it authentic and explicit (sometimes that's good, or at least fun). It reminded me a lot to ""Fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" which I love. That said, I don't think it is the masterpiece that most of the critics are proclaiming. DiCaprios acting is undeniably good, he's being growing up as an actor for many years and he has made very clear that he can make a movie good on his own, and this is one of those cases. The support actors are good in their roles (especially the short but excellent part of McConaughey) but the irreplaceable here is Di Caprio, he steals the show. Not much more than a showcase of fun events involving a group of drug addicts enjoying excess in every way possible, and how they go to hell for what they do. From my point of view, not a great story, and it could have been shorter too... Photography wasn't anything exceptional neither. But the good writing (even if it's a bit repetitive as a consequence of being so long) made me enjoy this movie a lot.Very good acting and writing, good/average photography and story.The movie is really good fun, if you have 3 hours to spend watching it!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Great acting (Rob Reiner deserved an Oscar nomination too)...OK movie...and it was WAY too long!!! I don't know how he did it, but Scorsese managed to drag this out for almost 3 full hours.

Way too long,"This movie can be summarized as follows: DiCaprio is excellent; the movie is boring at its current 3 hours and needs to be cut to half its length.There's a thin story line running in the background which lightly covers the history of Stratton Oakmont (the boiler room stock brokerage firm). I came away feeling more like I'd watched an endless loop of the movie Hangover - sex/drugs/rockandroll. Here, there's maybe one hour of stuff that's worth watching and then literally 2 hours of nothing but snorting drugs, naked boobs, more naked boobs, and then more debauchery - no, I'm serious, NOTHING BUT that. Just to get my biases straight, I have no problem with naked bodies on screen (on the contrary!). But, it truly becomes boring when they stuff that much in your face.

"""'The Wolf of Wall Street': A Thrilling Roller Coaster Through Excess and Consequences""","Watching 'The Wolf of Wall Street' on IMDb was like strapping into a wild roller coaster of insane parties, crazy money, and a guy, Jordan Belfort, who seemed to have it all. Leonardo DiCaprio crushed it with his crazy-good acting, making me both fascinated and kinda disgusted by Belfort's wild ride.The movie's not just about the crazy fun, though. It's like this big mirror showing how wanting too much can totally mess you up. It's like a warning about how too much greed can mess with your head and make you forget what really matters. The story makes you think about how power can totally mess people up, even in places you'd never expect.Through all the party scenes and crazy money stuff, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' taught me that you can't just do whatever you want without consequences. It's like a wake-up call to think about how far you'd go for success and what you'd give up along the way.Overall, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is like this intense roller coaster ride that makes you wonder about your own dreams and how you'd chase them - without all the wild parties, of course!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The fastest and most entertaining 3 hours of my life!,"The collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio is a pairing that I don't want to end. I believe The Wolf of Wall Street to be their best collaboration to date.The Wolf of Wall Street shows us the life of Jordan Belfort from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.Out of all the Scorsese films I have seen, The Wolf of Wall Street might be the most fun and entertaining. I've seen this film multiple times and I'm still not bored of it. Scorsese's direction is impeccable as always. He manages to capture the high life and excess of Wall Street brokers so perfectly without holding back on anything. The structure is very similar to Goodfellas but I didn't mind it because I felt it was an appropriate choice for this story. The editing is on point despite the 3 hour runtime. I was having so much fun with this film that I couldn't believe how quick 3 hours went by which is a testament as to how good the Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is. There is such a level of insanity and adrenaline to this story that gets me excited each time I watch it. This is most likely Scorsese's funniest film. The dialogues and dark humour are absolutely hilarious. Scorsese loves to have actors improvise scenes and it amazed how many scenes are actually improvised which goes to show the talent these actors possess.I consider Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as the sex-crazed, drug addicted Jordan Belfort to be his best. As much I loved Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club, I honestly think DiCaprio deserved the Oscar for this film. The insane energy he brought to the character of Belfort is incredible. This is also Jonah Hill's best performance to date. There are quite a few moments where he completely shines. A particular scene where Hill and DiCaprio take drugs and enact the effects of it is enough to show fantastic their acting is. This is where I discovered Margot Robbie for the first time and she blew me away with her performance. She nailed the accent and surprised me by how great of an actress was. Matthew McConaughey appears for a short time but is easily one of the most memorable parts of the film. It was nice to see Rob Reiner back who is so funny here. Kyle Chandler and Jon Bernthal do a marvellous job as well.Some would say the film glorifies the lifestyle Jordan Belfort lived which I totally disagree. I think showing the excessive drug use and sex is important for this story so you can really get an idea as to how these people lived. There is no sugar-coating of any kind and it's important to remember the consequences of living such a life.The Wolf of Wall Street is easily one of my favourite Martin Scorsese films. The fast-paced frenetic energy of the story is so exhilaritating to watch. The performances all round are amazing and I don't think I'll ever get bored of The Wolf of Wall Street.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Obnoxious, Distasteful, and Borderline Offensive","When The Wolf of Wall Street first begins its nearly three hour running-time, you aren't exactly sure when the opening studio titles end and the film begins because of Scorsese's stylized letterboxing academy ratios with certain scenes, emphasizing a television type framing as opposed to the rest of the film's widescreen cinematography. The questioning doesn't stop there; after the entire year of anticipation, the story of Jordan Belfort unfolds for the first hour, I continued to wonder when the real The Wolf of Wall Street was going to start.I follow numerous accounts on Instagram, on Christmas morning I came across a screenshot someone took on their iPhone of an elderly female critic reviewing The Wolf of Wall Street. With rotten icon from Rotten Tomatoes and the preview of her review stating, ""Too much sex and drug use,"" I rolled my eyes in agreement with the Instagram account of the unfair criticism. Then I saw The Wolf of Wall Street and realized it was not just a senior citizen compliant, I think Scorsese crossed the line of fun and entered an area of repugnance.I may be the only member of my age group (18-24) who complains about the overuse of sex, greed, and drugs, call me an old man, but after a three hours enough is enough. If The Wolf of Wall Street had some sense of a moral compass that drove the narrative, I may not criticize this aspect so harshly, but neither Scorsese nor the screenplay has anything to offer the audience to latch onto in selfish, unlikable, pathetic characters.Scorsese had to tell the story of Jordan Belfort and I'm sure his life was as unruly as the film paints it to be, but he abandons any sense of class. This is not the Scorsese we all have been enamored with the past. The Wolf of Wall Street is the type of film to be enjoyed by the same audience as The Hangover, not award voting Academy members or critical film analysts. I kept having the feeling I had seen this exact same film in May with flashier costumes, called The Great Gatsby. Wolf is not that far off from it, a few steps above Gatsby in terms of quality filmmaking, but the empty feeling it gives off to the audience is no different.Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese's fifth collaboration has been brewing in the minds of everyone who enjoyed their previous films and hope that one day they can finally ""click"" the way Scorsese did with Robert DeNiro back at the apex of their careers. The best thing The Wolf of Wall Street has on its side is Leonardo DiCaprio's eminent charm; he melts his audience and hits some of the greatest highs of his acting career. Certainly deserves to be included in any of the Best Actor races this award season.The Wolf of Wall Street's problems do not stem from the technicalities of filmmaking. Though the storytelling half of Scorsese's job that could have been executed much better, at least he forms the shell of a quality movie. His films typically have a masterwork of film editing; the editing for Wolf is no exception. It is like DiCaprio is snapping his fingers the whole for the three hours. The look of the film is another strength. The juicy cinematography looks as if it was painted with the infinite money made my Jordan Belfort.Some of Scorsese's past film successes find themselves drilled into The Wolf of Wall Street. The first person point of view from Goodfellas and Casino is put to good use, it even grows in this film. DiCaprio not only narrates the majority of the film, but also pulls a Woody Allen and looks directly at the audience and speaks to us like we are having a private conversation with Jordan Belfort. His obsession with wealth and drugs damaging his life and family echoes from Raging Bull, but this works against Wolf. In Raging Bull we saw Jake LaMotta beat his wife, but we also felt his guilt. There's a scene in Act Three that feels like a direct homage to Raging Bull, but Wolf lacks the humanity of that film. Scorsese wanted to isolate us from the world in Wolf like he did in Taxi Driver, where we understood the violence Travis yearned for, but here Wolf fails to tug at the same cords with greed as Taxi Driver did with loneliness.At the end of the day does the greedfest of The Wolf of Wall Street matter? No. If it were not so hollow, it could have been a fun movie, but I didn't even buy into the ""enjoyment."" People around me were laughing at the slapstick comedy, but I did not find most of it funny, not even DiCaprio's raved physical comedy scene in the last section of the film. I shrugged my shoulders after the first thirty seconds and then the scheme continued for five more minutes. Not a bad film, a bad narrative, and a poorly communicated film. If I retitled the film, it would read: The Disappointment of Wall Street.Grade: B-Rating: 6",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A very good Martin Scorsese film,Movie based on the life of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). He was a poor man who joined Wall Street in the late 1980s. He slowly built his way up to the top--making his own company and doing anything (legal or illegal) to come out on top. He also became addicted to drugs and sex and it slowly destroys him.A VERY good but not great Scorsese film. Let's get the negatives out of the way first--it's far too long at 3 hours (this could easily have lost 30 minutes); Jonah Hill is TERRIBLE and annoying in a supporting role; the constant swearing and screaming gets tiresome; there's WAY too much female nudity (while a scene with male nudity was cut down to nothing) and there's no real ending...it just sort of stops. Still I loved it a lot more than I hated it. The acting was great by everybody (save Hill). DiCaprio was brilliant in the title role. Who knew he could do comedy as well as drama? He anchors this film and he's never less than mesmerizing. As I said mostly everybody else is good but special mention must be made for Margot Robbie (as his second wife Naomi) and Joanna Lumley who is incredible as Aunt Emma. The story moves fairly quickly and there's a great use of period music. So this is excellent but not great Scorsese.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Entertaining but empty,"Jordan Belfort arrives in Wall Street and gets a job selling stocks over the phone. The environment is vulgar, brutal, ruthless. One of the senior guys takes him to lunch and gives him the lessons to survive. The main point is to put money from the customers in their pockets, not so much enrich their customers.When Black Friday hits, Belfort is out of a job, and ends up working at a company of amateurs selling penny stocks. He does so well that he ends up opening his own firm ripping people off. He hires friends and shady characters. One of them introduces him to drugs. They are so wildly successful that they pretty much don't know what to do with all their money. He becomes addicted to money, power, and all drugs he can get his hands on. His wife divorces him and he marries the gorgeous Naomi.As the feds start snooping around his business, which involves everything illegal under the sun, he decides to move his money to a Swiss bank and Naomi's English aunt helps in the process as well as various carriers who transport millions of cash by hand. Eventually, the government catches up with him as his life unravels.The Wolf of Wall Street is your typical Scorsese ""rise and fall of a bad guy"" movie. It's a bit different in so far as Belfort is nowhere near as likable as the other Scorsese main characters. Here you are not wishing for Belfort to escape and get away. You want him to face justice. And violence has been replaced with comedy. Much of this overlong movie is made up of comedy skits basically. There's DiCaprio on drugs, DiCaprio having deranged sex, there's DiCaprio fooling his wife into doing naughty things in front of a hidden camera, there's the company jerks throwing little people at a target, etc, etc. This movie could have easily been cut by at least half an hour. There's also not nearly enough drama.Most disappointing is the lack of any sort of moral message, if you will. It shouldn't have been difficult to point out the insane misantrophy of Wall Street folks. But there's only very little of that. Given that the finance world still gets away with murder, or perhaps these days even more so, it's not clear why Winter, Scorsese, the producers, anyone, was not interested in taking the opportunity to scold the finance world.Acting is OK. DiCaprio is strong except for the scenes where he's motivating his employees. There are too many scenes of those and DiCaprio doesn't convey the charisma necessary. Margot Robbie is the revelation here. I'm not crazy about the rest of the cast- Hill in particular doesn't convince.Like all stories about larger than life personalities written by themselves, much probably didn't happen as told.

But what I'm trying to say is that he he and Everton e in this film made it what it was. An outlandish concept that was executed perfectly. The story is amazing and the path that Leo takes as a character builds a stronger connection to the plot! Where this film suicided is how well and progressive the story was told, where we as viewers were able to follow it all the way. And with Leo's great acting he made it smooth to go through. THIS FIPM IS A GAME CHANGER for the filming community, why? Because it tells an original story that was written so well where towards the end we even feel sympathy for the police that's an antagonist in that move! This movie has changed how characters react with villains on every moview afyer it BECAUSE! In this film everyone is a villan, but we understand everyone's ambitions and goals to the point where we're intrigued as to how it goes.And for one more note, this movie has shown that if you take the rights spets in how reactions translate in a script to the final cut you can keep the story afloat almost comparable to the entire story of Lord of the rings where the story makes sense yet takes to places you wouldn't've guessed based on the start (At least before the interview lmao)Well written and well executed in just 3h it will feel like 45min.Why 9/10 because as you may know in film we always know that there is room for improvement no matter how good the films are, that's exactly how you know if someone is giving an honest review rather than saying ""10/10 good film. Would recommend 😀"" that's just not how we do things 😉",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Nothing great.,"Okay. Its a Scorsese movie and I was told it is his best movie ever and Leo is definitely winning an Oscar for this. And then it turns out to be a pointless, unfunny American Pie/Project X stuff with A-level actors and a Wall Street backdrop.Some parts of the movie were brilliant. But honestly, these parts summed up to almost 30 minutes of a 3 hour long movie. I think the movie will appeal only to those who will be hearing so many curse words first time in their lives. There were many people at the cinema actually laughing at the reference of 'Moby Dick'. So, if you only want to hear some 800 curse words, with a lot of sex and drugs all at the same time without any sense, go for it. But if you are expecting some serious Scorsese kind of 3 hour drama with a nerve-wrecking climax, this movie is a big letdown.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Nothing of note, nothing to justify","This was about the most unredeemable movie that I can remember. The acting was over the top with only a few bit players turning in good performances Joanna Lumley as Aunt Emma comes to mind. Jordan Belfort tells his tale of excess without remorse or humor. I sincerely hope that he had a few sober moments in the late 80's and early90's where he accomplished something good, he doesn't seem to remember any of it. Most recovering addicts that I have met have tried to honestly reflect their past and turn away from it. Mr. Belfort has found a new drug in reveling in the hangover of his past. This movie is at best an extended drug flashback, one which has nothing to say about the human condition other than that Mr. Belfort and friends were degenerate.

Entertaining biog of a truly abhorrent individual,"Martin Scorcese, is the master of taking truly awful people and making them normal. Hell, he even makes them likable. In goodfellas we watch as drug dealers and gangsters brutally beat and murder each other and we are thrilled and entertained by it.It says so much, that although the premise here is similar, the main character is harder to root for, yes it's funny, occasionally thrilling with excellent performances (this is one of Di Caprio's finest jobs amongst great performances and Jonah Hill and Robbie provide excellent support) but ultimately for me, the main character and the situation is both abhorrent to the point it dampened my enthusiasm for what is a well made film.

Over-hyped but mediocre at best,"With all the hype surrounding 'The Wolf of Wall Street', I went to see it expecting something mind-blowing, but what I've seen was a mediocre biopic at best.It is clear that Scorsese's intention here was obviously to make the new 'Goodfellas' or even the new 'Godfather', but most of the time 'The Wolf' runs flat and fails to engage. I couldn't really tell whose fault that was, because the the pacing was pretty solid for a three hour flick and the balance between comical and serious bits was just about right, but I somehow failed to care about pretty much anything going on in the film.Everything that happens on the screen seems to just happen; there is no real plot, there is no real suspense and there is no real development of any kind. All character development happens in the first 15 minutes or so, and from that point on 'The Wolf' is just a steady flatland ride filled with gang bangs, drug abuse, cock jokes, cursing and generally bad taste, most of which serves the story itself in no way, but has somehow managed to create enough hype to be listed among 100 best films of all time here at IMDb.I can understand all the hype about Leonardo DiCaprio, because he was really good, but the sea of mediocrity surrounding him might have made him look a bit better than he actually was. What I don't understand is the general word about this film being the best Scorsese's work ever. In my opinion, this one doesn't come even close to 'The Departed', not the mention the real classics as 'Goodfellas', 'Casino' or 'The Taxi Driver'. What I especially do not understand are the stories about Matthew McConaughey deserving an Oscar for supporting role... for a mere three minute long Christopher Walken cameo impersonation?! I mean, come on, people!All in all, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is not a bad film, but it's far from good and it's far from being a classic. It has its moments, but most of the time it's far from excellence once made by Martin Scorsese. I wouldn't go that far to call it forgettable, but I have a strong feeling it won't be talked about this much in just a year or two. Time will tell.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Mathew McConaughey and P.J Bryne. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies.

Under par Scorsese overacted by Di Caprio,"Three hours is simply too much of a half good thing. Scorsese probably wanted to emanate in the montage the coke fueled consciousness of stock broker Di Caprio who can't decide if he wants to portray the main character as a parody or as a biography.How many drug and sex inspired scenes can one endure in three hours, without getting bored by the repetition? After the first amusing hour, the movie goes over the top and hysterical and one can't help to be relived of the ramblings. The Wolf of Wall Street wants to be dramatic and funny at the same time but only achieves half of both. You'll get a few laughs out of it (mostly out of embarrassment) , but if this wasn't announced as a Scorsese in big letters, one would probably not think it's a Scorsese movie in the first place.Not 'bad' by any means, but under par for Scorsese.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Awful movie - borders on audience abuse,"I really can't believe anyone likes this movie. It is an over-budgeted indulgence in offensive (intentionally, I think)...what I guess you would call ""soft porn""...that seems to have no point.

Throw a bunch of lewd, disgusting debauchery into EVERY frame, every scene, over and over again, and they will eat it up as if there was something there. But there is nothing there. There is no real story, no real character development, no real reason to watch these immoral characters indulge themselves.

With those themes for a plot, why not just make porn. The audience would be wider, and the profits greater.As for being a dark comedy, that might be a tough sell, give that comedy tends to be more individualized and subjective than drama. Perhaps I am just getting too old to find humor in debauchery. However, I did laugh out loud once during the park bench scene between Leonardo DiCaprio and Joanna Lumley.

Would have loved to see less tits and more action (i.e. the Wolf closing business deals). The humor is so so too, not good enough to laugh out loud but bare good enough to make the 3 hours enjoyable. I have the impression that something was left, maybe a part 2? Things rushed once the Wolf & Danny were on the yacht in their way to Switzerland and had the accident.

A desperate Oscar grab,"It's unfortunate; I came into this movie with such high expectations that was sustained through the first 30 min of the movie, crashing right after in similar fashion to the stock market crash of the early 80s.You see, it's very similar to Goodfellas in it's narrative format. That aside, the movie is loosely tied by a plot reminiscent of Casino, holding together episodes of pointless bantering and ridiculous debauchery. The debaucherous episodes are fun, but the gratuitous sex and drug scenes honestly get tiring after awhile, since it seems they ran out of any compelling plot points.I expected Jonah Hill to be a little funnier. I sighed every time Leo was about to give a speech, I could see himself trying to hearken to Gordon Gekko's style of speech yet with a veinier more expletive filled delivery.

Gangs of New York updated...,"There was a real opportunity here to make a powerful statement as well as a highly entertaining film but it got completely thrown out by the director & author of the screenplay. Instead of a stinging indictment and/or satire of Americann greed & lust we get an over- the-top presentation of sex & drugs as male pre-pubescent fantasy. Everything the average 13 year-old imagines his future to be. Not surprising given that the director Martin Scorsese gives the majority of his films the same blockbuster treatment: everything short of singing & tap dancing. The only other director using a similar approach is Baz Luhrman. Interesting that Dicaprio starred in this movie & Gatsby in the same year, highly miscast in both. Casting him is understandable: he's likable & cute & popular with the mainstream movie-going public. Here he basically replicates his performance in Catch Me If You Can. I don't say he's a bad actor, just wrong for the part. Here he reminds me of Bob Hope in something like Monsieur Beaucaire: likable but clueless as to what makes the character he's playing tick.

One of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances.,"The Wolf of wall street is a riveting film. It's funny, dark, and suprisingly fast paced throughout even though it's 3 hrs long. I feel the length is a bit long for the film, I felt that 5-10 mins could have been cut off the film, and it would've been better.You have great performances from Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort, Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, along side some fantastic direction from Martin Scorsese.This film really looks in to what money can do to people, how it effects people, and how greedy we can become when we earn alot of money.I like how Jordan Belfort has no remorse and doesn't care what happens, but this is also a problem, due to the character having no remorse, his character doesn't really change at all, by the end, he's still pretty much the same person as he was at the beginning, with some slight changes.It's a great film to watch with a bunch of blokes and I feel it better suits Males than Females. The Cinematography is creative and varied, with some great shots thrown in there.It's a film where characters don't really change or grow, but it does this to great effect to further show what mass amounts of money can do to people.I had a great time watching it and I would definitely recommend it if you were looking for a great time.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

People all say Jonah Hill is great, but I'm not sure he can hold up such a big supporting role against Leo, with all due respect of course. I loved his small roles across the board which were all absolutely hilarious, but in this one, again, I think his role lacks depth too.

The great puzzle is how director Martin Scorsese with his track record could come up with this rubbish?

A Great Watch! 8/10,"Review: I really enjoyed this epic movie which keeps you on the end of your seat from beginning to end. Although the film is about serious issues, there is some really funny scenes, especially between DiCaprio and Hill who had great chemistry. The storyline goes from one extreme to the next, which is what made it hard to believe that it was based on a true story. The amount of money that the traders go through is ridiculous and the whole care free attitude had to come to a halt at some point. At nearly 3 hours long, the director done well to keep the movie interesting and a joy to watch. I never thought that I would say this, but it is in the same class as the original Wall Street which was a tough act to follow. A Great Watch!Round-Up: DiCaprio really showed that he is a top class actor with his performance in this movie. He really needed to dig deep to make this character believable because of the amount of drugs, cash and women that him and his friends went through, under the eyes of the law. Jonah Hill was an excellent choice to play DiCaprio's partner in crime who also showed that a different side to his acting skills. Even Matthew McConaughey was brilliant, with his weird expressions and phrases which were a great way to kick off the movie. Anyway, it's very hard to find anything wrong with this film, although some of the speeches on the microphone did drag on, but that's just me being picky. Its definitely worth a watch!Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $390millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there witty dramas about the crazy world of a stock trader who works hard and definitely parties extremely hard. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
""" There is no prestige in being Poor ""","The greatness of a memorable film emerges from an exceptional Director like Martin Scorsese. This film entitled "" The Wolf of Wall Street "" was written by Jordon Belfort who's malicious deceptive practices eventually earn him a stint in Federal Prison. Taken from the excessive exploits of Jordon Belfort himself, it tells the story of a unemployed Wall Street executive who was abruptly lay-ed off but despite his fall, landed on his feet. Despite falling, he arose quickly to create a new financial institution which not only netted him millions, but created a whole new way to acquire further riches. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, an enterprising salesman with a golden gift of gab. Inspired by Matthew McConaughey and his own convincing talent, Belfort take a converted Garage, added an exceptional sales crew, transform them into a sea of voracious financial sharks like Rob Reiner. Belfort then creates a lucrative financial institution which nets them untold millions. Achieving his ultimate success, he continues onward and upwards attracting the attention of Wall Street itself and of course agent Patrick Denham of The F.B.I. In addition, Belfort also seeks out and weds the love of his life Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) who brings romantic security and domestic headaches as well.The movie is fast paced, money, drug and sex oriented along with the life style of the rich and famous. DiCaprio is in his element in this movie as are the talented actors of Scorseses' cast, who showcase what can happen when unbridled greed meets unrestricted wealth.

Great film and worthy of a few Oscars,"The Wolf of Wall Street takes an interesting look at the life of Wall street broker Jordan Belfort and his rise and fall. The film had and used some its ingredients to make a wildly entertaining film which included exceptional acting, great plot, narration, addictive soundtrack and the rise and fall of the central character in world of Wall street and finance. These elements have been used masterfully by Scorsese in former classics.Leonardo definitely deserved an Oscar for his performance as he lives the role of a shady Wall Street broker that is corrupted over his tenure as a stockbroker. The first person narrative works brilliantly as we are told Jordan's story. The portrayal of brokers is interesting as cut throat and money grabbing who use on it on all the vices life has to offer. The film excels at showing this lifestyle in excess from hookers, heavy drinking to living in mansions and sailing on yachts. Jonah Hill and the other cast and crew also hit some home runs to make it enjoyable and humorous at times. The achilles heel when it comes to the cast is easily Margot Robbie. While some of the world seems infatuated with her, she was unimpressive and mediocre. She was very annoying and Leonardo had to carry most of their scenes. The film would have benefited from another talented heroine who brought the best out of Leo and could meet his intensity in the scenes.While this is a great film it also had a few issues that stopped it from being an absolute classic. Scorsese can be creative when he makes his films but in this one it appears his creativity got the better of him and got ahead of itself. So instead of making a carefully coherent film like he has done before it is a film that incorporates unnecessary scenes, dialogue and screen time that distracts from the story. The result is a film that is 3hrs long and scenes that add no value to the plot. Scenes could have easily been reduced in length, the gay orgy scene could have been cut as could the scene with Brad living at his mothers and the list goes on. Cutting these scenes would have made this films great plot richer and less distracting. When I started watching this film I thought this was going be the greatest film Scorsese has ever made but the additional and unneeded scenes changed that. In my humble opinion this is what makes this a great film but not an Iconic film. An entertaining film but not legendary. A strong 8/10 that should have earned a few Oscars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"What happens when you follow your basest instinct, every time you can, for years?","Jordan Belfort(DiCaprio, playing a charismatic jerk. Really glad he and Martin found each other, they bring out the best in each other) is a stockbroker, with incredibly low morals, even by those standards. He finds ways to trick people into buying what he's selling, and quickly starts to make obscene amounts of money. How long can he possibly keep that going?If Scorsese has directed a bad film, then I don't know of it. Then again, I have heard that the Irishman feels like it takes as many years to watch as they deaged the leads by. While this one does substitute violence for debauchery, it does play a lot like one of his gangster biographies. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. No reason for him to stay away from his old bag of tricks. There's a lot of narration, since there are simply too many details to ""show, don't tell"" everything. Most of it voice-over, some of it breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the camera - occasionally it will be very Deadpool, even though this beat that movie to theatres by three years. We get quirky types of people(Margot Robbie was an excellent find, and it's really no wonder that she's been in as hot a name in Hollywood as she has been since this, despite some of them not being all that well received). Depicting very carefully approached lawbreaking, where we can understand how, and why, it works.I've heard some criticise these movies, saying that they romanticise these obviously unethical behaviours. Pointing out that a lot of attention to detail is put into showing the positive experiences they have specifically because of the awful things they do. My argument against that has always been that that's only the first chunk of these pictures. They are also very careful to show the eventual downfall. Unless you walk out early, clearly the message of these is that, though you might get away with it early on, in the long term it will destroy you and the people around you. In this flick especially, the way things gradually fall apart is a sight to behold. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine. Or that amazing dominoes bit from V for Vendetta. It's hard for me to overstate just how well constructed, and how fun to watch, it is. One sequence, dealing with a car, several phones, and some unforeseen consequences, made me laugh harder than I have at comedies for several years.This features a lot of nudity, sexuality, drug use and strong language, as well as some violence.

Over the top T & A,"A TMG rating of 6.0 is being generous with an emphasis on this movie could have, and should have, been a whole lot better. How? Listen to an editor and cut about 1.3 hours of pure crap and meaningless scenes from the film. Tossing a pile of hundred dollar bills on top of naked women is funny and outrageous once, but unless you are the guy getting to do it, it is one and done. After twenty scenes of butt, booze and debauchery on film, you pretty much start thinking of just a good beer, a brat and reading the Wall Street Journal.This film was Wall Street (1987) on Geckko steroids and quaaludes. It was less about the corruption or inner workings of Wall Street and much more just about unbridled Hedonism. It was a more The Hangover Part III (2013) outtakes meets Catch me if You Can (2002). Basically, it was a cheap film with bad writing, marginal acting with lots of cash, drugs and T & A---not meaning tax and accounting.The only real bright spot was the always fun and ingenious acting of Matthew McConaughey. His role was priceless, but all too short.This mostly misguided attempt to make an epic was as badly executed as DiCaprio and Scorsese's effort in Gangs of New York (2002)---a film that made my pet squirrel fall asleep on a pile of acorns. If you have not seen this film yet, skip it. Go home. Have a quaalude yourself. Pull out a Penthouse magazine and throw some dollar bills in the air. You will pretty much get the same experience.

*A Glitzy Parable of Excess and Ambition*,"Martin Scorsese's *The Wolf of Wall Street* is an audacious exploration of ambition, decadence, and the morally bankrupt world of finance. Released in 2013, this cinematic rollercoaster invites viewers into the high-stakes life of Jordan Belfort, portrayed exuberantly by Leonardo DiCaprio, whose rise and fall mirror the excesses of a bygone era where greed was not just good, but glorified.From the very first scene, where Belfort introduces us to his whirlwind lifestyle, Scorsese deftly immerses us in a world of outrageous opulence and reckless abandon. This film is not merely about the financial markets; it's a vibrant tapestry woven with themes of ambition, desire, and the consequences of unchecked hedonism. The frenetic energy of the film, accentuated by its rapid-fire editing and dynamic cinematography, thrusts viewers into the frenetic pulse of Wall Street, where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye.DiCaprio's performance is nothing short of iconic, melding charm and cunning to create a character who captivates and repulses in equal measure. Belfort's magnetic personality is enhanced by a fantastic supporting cast, including Jonah Hill as the outrageous Donnie Azoff, who perfectly embodies the absurdity of their lavish lifestyle. Their escapades, from drug-fueled parties to lavish yacht escapades, are portrayed in a way that is both humorous and horrifying, forcing the audience to confront the stark reality behind the glitz.What stands out in *The Wolf of Wall Street* is its unapologetic approach to storytelling. Scorsese does not shy away from the darker aspects of Belfort's life; rather, he embraces them with a tongue-in-cheek bravado. The result is a film that oscillates between riotous comedy and a sobering reflection on moral decay. Despite the chaos and laugh-out-loud moments, there lies an underlying critique of capitalism that resonates in today's society. Scorsese expertly crafts a narrative that leaves viewers questioning the true cost of success and the emptiness that often accompanies it.Visually stunning and audibly exhilarating, the film is punctuated by a soundtrack that perfectly encapsulates the era's hedonism, with classic tracks underscoring the characters' relentless pursuit of pleasure. The vibrant cinematography captures the lavish settings-a grandiose office, extravagant parties, and opulent homes-painting a picture of a world where the excess is both intoxicating and toxic.*The Wolf of Wall Street* transcends the traditional biopic, offering a frenetic portrayal of a man who embodies the spirit of excess in contemporary society. It is a story of illusion and reality, ambition and consequence, wrapped in a package of humor and extravagance. As the credits roll, viewers are left with an unsettling reflection on the seductive nature of wealth and the inevitable pitfalls that await those who chase it without regard for morality. Scorsese reminds us that while the wolf may howl at the moon, the sobering consequences of its predatory nature remain ever-present, casting a long shadow over the allure of excess.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Bit Overrated for Me,"I was really interested to see Wolf of Wall Street, not just because its Scorsese and it's gotten so many nominations but also I cant remember a movie that my friends on Facebook have given such differing reviews to. I've read everything from Wow great movie! To What a waste of time. And I have to say, after seeing it yesterday, I come down pretty squarely in the middle. It was good. It was funny (in parts) It was drawn out (in parts). It was entertaining. But I don't think it's anywhere near the best movie of the year in fact I can think of a few movies that weren't even nominated (42 for example) that I thought were better overall movies.I kept feeling like I was watching Goodfellas but with Wall Street Greed as the driving force instead of Mafia Greed. Scorsese isn't the first film maker or writer to do this. You have a successful template of a story, you change some of the mitigating factors and voila! You have a new movie. Michael Crichton did the same thing with Jurassic Park. Go back and watch Westworld and it's pretty much the same movie (adult theme park where the attractions get out of control) with robots exchanged for genetically recreated dinosaurs. So I'm not knocking Scorsese but I will say this, Wolf is no Goodfellas. None of these characters rang as true to me as Henry Hill or Tommy and Jimmy.And that's the challenge with a movie like this. We have to like the villains. We have to pull for Tony Soprano or Henry Hill or Jordan Belfort because at the end of the day MOST people abhor that type of behavior so how you can you watch a movie like this and not want the protagonist to go down in flames? Answer: if somehow, against all logic and odds, we've fallen in love with them. And I don't think Scorsese did enough to make me love (or even like) Belfort and Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and the rest.That's what the comedic scenes are for in these movies. When Joe Pesci does his classic, ""I'm funny? I'm here to amuse you?"" rant we want to be at that table. We want to be in that group because they are funny and cool and squeezing every last moment of joy from life. And that's what moments like the midget tossing are supposed to do for us in Wolf and like I said, I laughed at some of these (yes I laughed at the midget tossing, sorry) but overall, my mind never left the fact that
these guys were getting rich by taking innocent, hard working people's money and putting them into worthless investments. And when I say ""taking"" I get the fact that they were ""selling"" and not stealing and I think some people who love this movie see it as that: a triumph of master selling, another ""Boiler Room"" or ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" where the silver tongued ultimate salesmen proves he's superman and can do anything, but quite frankly if you lie and deceive to sell, I don't consider that selling. I consider it lying and deceiving. And I'd just as soon have you throw a brick threw my window or torch my store 'cause then at least I know who you are. So in the end, I never did fall in love with Belfort and his quaaludes and hookers enough to not want him to get busted (like I do when the helicopters are chasing Henry Hill)Scale of 1-10 I'd give Wolf a 6. Entertaining movie with funny moments. Coulda been a half hour shorter. And no way, IMO is it Best Movie of the year.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
WOLF OF WALL STREET,"The wolf of wall street is a movie starred by Leonardo DiCaprio. This is a famous and great movie because of all the action and situations that happen along the story. It shows how at a moment the character is in a great moment and in seconds he is passing a really hard time. All the action and scenes in the movie is amazing.The movie is about Jordan Belfort(Leonardo DiCaprio), a man who is a middle class but who wants to get glory. He starts working on a big Wall Street company but the company goes broke so he has to go to a really small stock market company. In that small company he discovers that selling really bad products and telling the people that the products are great, he will get a really big profit. That's how he begins to win a lot of money and starts his own stock market company and gets really rich. But while all this happens, he lives some situations that makes his goal and life difficult.All the action that happened in the movie show how Jordan reacted to all his situations, how he could get wild and rage, how he spent and enjoyed all the money he won and also how he was intelligent to do really big things. Also all the action made the movie interesting and made you watch all the details. All the action made me concentrate all the time in the movie, also it showed me how an eccentric and really rich man lived his life and spent his money. Also it showed me how the richs enjoyed their life in the 90s.This is one of my favorite movies because it is really interesting and it tells a really great story, also shows that you need to make the right things or you will lose everything. I recommend it because it has really good actors, action, locations and is a really good and interesting theme.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Masterpiece,"The Wolf of Wall Street; a three hour long masterpiece. When I started it, I didn't know how long it was. A lot of the times I thought the movie plot had reached its end and that the credits were going to roll, yet I was shocked to find I was only half way through and there was still an hour and a half to go. It just continued to get better as you watched. I was glued to the screen all the way through and was mesmerized by Leonardo Di Caprio and his deserved Oscar winning role. I applaud his talent of multi genre acting, and how he managed to fit that all in one movie. He did so well I started to believe he was actually a filthy rich stock broker. Also Margot Robbie did an astounding job as Jordan Belfort's wife Naomi. Martin Scorsese deserves another Oscar. Him and Leo make the best team in many movies. Plus one that is based on a true story (and at the same time a book) is always promising. There was no way this movie could have gone bad, every way you look at it, its got the best actors, narration, camera work, and script and screenplay. Apart from the snorting of drugs every 5 minutes (which was unnecessary) it was a compelling, captivating film I give ten out of ten!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Excessive but Lacking,"The Wolf of Wall Street is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made by director Martin Scorsese. Unfortunately, it is not one of his best. Clocking in at a whopping 180 minutes, Wolf is too much of everything: sex, drugs, profanity, laughs, dialogue, improvisation, narration.If you've been following the development and release of Scorsese's latest, chances are you know all about the four-to-five hour, NC-17- rated cut that had to be trimmed down hastily for a Christmas day release. While legendary editor and Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is certainly not lacking in imagination, she and Scorsese let scenes run on entirely too long, cutting back and forth between actors who are clearly making it all up as they go along. Most of the time, the actors appear to be having a great time with the freedom they've been given by their director. Leonardo DiCaprio, in particular, gives an absolutely fearless performance, and he is clearly enjoying himself. If only the audience had such a luxury.For its first hour or so, Wolf acclimates its viewers to its brisk pacing and no-holds barred storytelling. For the next hour and a half, however, the story falls victim to a ""rinse-and repeat"" method of constantly regurgitating its themes, scenes, and dialogue, until the inevitable ending provides some relief from its relentless pace.Wolf tells the story of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street con artist who dreams of being a rich broker like Henry Hill dreamed of being a gangster in Scorsese's Goodfellas (more on the similarities between these two films later). After losing a promising job in the recession of the late 1980's Jordan learns the tricks (literally) of the trade at a small operation selling penny stocks. Whereas larger, more regulated stocks yield a much smaller commission, ""penny stocks"" provide a 50% commission for their brokers, who in turn sell an inferior product to gullible investors. Jordan's bright idea is to sell these cheap stocks in huge quantities to much wealthier clients, reaping a huge take for his new front-of-a-firm, Stratton Oakmont.Needless to say, the plan works for a while, and Belfort and his partners, including Donnie Azoff (played by a joyously weird Jonah Hill) become unfathomably rich. The remainder of the film is basically a visual orgy of gratuitous (and I mean ""I-can't-believe-they-got-away- with-this) sex and drugs, set against the backdrop of an FBI investigation into Belfort's dubious business practices.Perhaps the biggest issue I had with the film is just how gratuitous the edgy material was. Let us compare to a movie like Goodfellas, for instance. That film shows multiple murders, often with characters meeting their demise by gunshots to the head. It also features copious amounts of cocaine consumption, along with about as many f-bombs as you'll ever hear. However, one could make the argument that for the sake of the story, all of these elements are necessary in their fullness. When Henry Hill dabbles in unauthorized cocaine and arms dealing, especially after his best friend gets bumped off, the stakes become raised: one has the very clear understanding that in this world, one wrong move can result in death.The Wolf of Wall Street, on the other hand, shows relatively little in the way of consequences. For all the laws broken, all the drugs and hookers used up by the male characters, the biggest threat facing the supposed protagonists is possible jail time. A film that mimics the structure and feel of Goodfellas would do well to up the ante a bit, but Wolf falls woefully short in this regard.This is not to say that there are no consequences. Belfort's unraveling is spectacular, particularly in a late scene in which he tries to leave his mansion with his young daughter in tow. But after two and a half hours of debauchery, a small portion of comeuppance seems like a lack of balance—or poetic justice. This lack of justice is exactly Scorsese's point: for the vastly wealthy, there are often no tangible or justified consequences. Scorsese does a great job of not condemning or judging his characters—he simply shows them as they are, rather objectively, and they condemn themselves with their frat-boy antics. However, the director's overlong dive into a world of excess at times seems a somewhat unhealthy fascination.The debate over The Wolf of Wall Street is currently raging online. Variety is now running two pieces debating whether the film glorifies its characters' depravity. Some say this is Wolf's genius—an ambiguous presentation of both the temptations of sin and the obvious consequences of those who give in to it. Others would argue that people are giving Scorsese too much credit for what is ultimately an uneven tale with no dramatic drive. I count myself among the latter.There's a classic sequence toward the end of Goodfellas in which Henry lives in a constant state of paranoia—first as the result of his drug use and later because he has agreed to rat out all of his friends to join the Witness Protection Program. These scenes are key for the arc of the story—both to illustrate the dangerous stakes and to drive the narrative toward its conclusion. The Wolf of Wall Street should have had such a sequence. Instead, we were given just another scene with cocaine and sex.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Overly vulgar.,"Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, like most of the time, was exceptional. Even Jonah Hill's acting was quite good (I was surprised there, as it was the first time I had seen his performance in a film with a more serious tone).But the shots in the film were extremely vulgar and disgusting, even a film from a porn site has more elegance than some of the scenes I watched in this movie.I was looking forward to watching this film because the director is Scorsese (who's great at his work) and because of the great fame it had in its time when it came out, but I must admit that I was extremely disappointed; I know that for the plot of the films, sometimes it is necessary to put graphic scenes, but this was grotesque and neverending.

I couldn't wait to get out of the theater and I would have done so without waiting for the end had I not been sitting in the middle seat of a crowded auditorium. Sitting there to the end was actually painful.Moreover, during that last hour I found the scenes to be repetitive: the cocaine-snorting, the manic behavior , the parties, the shouting - all of it tiresome, tedious and incredibly boring and dull.This movie, while it has some great acting and truly funny scenes, will test your patience.

Excessus Mentis: A Defence of Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street.,"Martin Scorsese's latest offering The Wolf of Wall Street has divided audiences into two camps: those who praise the work as a masterpiece of cinematic verve, and those who say it glorifies white-collar crime along with the film's antihero, real life penny stock criminal, Jordan Belfort. While not quite the magnum opus some call it, I think The Wolf of Wall Street is an inspired parable and cinematic opera about greed, excess, and the perversion of the American dream.Hollywood, like the stock market, is big business, netting profits in the billions every year. In many ways, Hollywood is emblematic of the American dream; certainly the cinema is a place where we exchange money to watch our dreams, fantasies, and even nightmares unfold on a big screen in a dimly lit room. Scorsese, who often challenges Hollywood sensibility, continues to be one of American cinema's great dream makers and storytellers, gifting the world films like Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990), and The Departed (2006).The Wolf of Wall Street continues Scorsese's fixation with crime, identity, and machismo, as well as his Roman Catholic concerns around guilt and redemption. However, unlike Scorsese's other gangster films there is hardly any graphic violence in Wolf, although there remains, perhaps more than any of his films, his liberal usage of profanity. It could be argued, and probably should, that Belfort's obsession with controlling women's bodies, as well as his betrayal of his victim's trust, is violence. The narrative techniques and do-it-yourself rise to power in Wolf parallels Goodfellas, but instead of mob bloodshed and revenge, Scorsese focuses his lens on robber baron, capitalistic sociopath, and real life penny stock criminal/self-made multi- millionaire, Jordan Belfort.For me, the film was a little like travelling through Dante's fourth circle of Hell (greed/avarice) for three hours, although I do admit that I laughed a fair bit, which is sort of the point of the grotesque parody. The Wolf of Wall Street is an irreverent and potent satire about greed, excess, and the perversion of the American dream. The writing is spot on, Scorsese's directing is inspired, providing lots of room for his actors to improvise, and DiCaprio gives the most dynamic performance of his career. Matthew McConaughey, who also gave a great performance in last year's Dallas Buyers Club, steals a scene in the movie. Some might feel the film glorifies greed. Jordan Belfort glorifies greed. America glorifies greed. The film does not. In some disturbing ways, Belfort was simply being American. As Belfort belts out in one of his many excessive speeches in the film: ""This right here is the land of opportunity. This is America. This is my home! The show goes on!""My full review available here: http://pauldbwatkins.com/2014/01/12/the-wolf-of-wall-street/",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"A Fantastic Story Of Wealth, Success &  The Smart Mind.","Where too start...Lets Just say, No Spoilers and this is not like a review anyone has read before about this film.Acting 10/10.This is the story of in my mind an extremely intelligent man who is able to manipulate peoples thoughts with regards to investment by selling them the ultimate sell.Jordan Belfort. Fantastic. The story is no other than fascinating. The way This film is written and directed is fantastic. (Thats 2 Fantastics in one line)Im a true believer that what he did was not illegal. I believe there is a fine line but not quite Illegal.Jordan Sells shares to people who are a lot like himself. Greedy people who always want more for they're money. But what is greed? its only when you have lost something do you realise your being greedy in the first place. A price is what the market sustains, not the cost of the asset; and is driven by demand and supply, which in turn is driven by greed.This is a perfect example of share selling. It doesn't matter what the asset actually cost. What matters is how much money you can make from it, once you have covered that cost.A 10/10 film which DiCaprio does AMAZING to show that Jordan Belforts life was not glorified and that really, he was never happy nor satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Good Guys of Wall Street,"The Wolf of Wall Street tells the story of Jordan Belfort's life in stocks. It depicts a world of rich people who are daily flooded with money but do not know what else to spend on other than their excess. That is just one side of the story, but that is what the audience is wholeheartedly focused on. It's not exactly only about a man who had done wrong choices then eventually learn by his mistakes in the end. It's more of a raucous portrait about rich people being petty, having way too much fun on their lust, never realized that they actually look terrible by it until they eventually become the worst of themselves. The overall film is enormously entertaining. It may bring relentless filth on screen, but the awareness comes right when things really get out of hand.There is nothing more important in their world other than money, sex and drugs. It is ought to be satirical, but one may think that it is taken too far, only when they take the comedy too seriously. The real plot here is Belfort's actual crimes in Wall Street. The film doesn't make those acts look much of a big deal. His victims are never shown because apparently the viewers should be rooting for him. It's almost just a series of outrageous parties, and schemes that will keep their fortune and pleasures going. Despite of their behavior, we are still obligated to care about these ""good guys.""The film somewhat comes close to Martin Scorsese's other film, Goodfellas. Aside of the throughout narration, the story has some similarities: a man who love affairs with a job that betrays both of his marriage and any moral standards, however the guy lacks the sympathy which defines the character's humanity. The main character's human figure here is all the negative sides. Compare him to the other goodfella, his motivations and striving are much petty, because of course, he has it all.Martin Scorsese makes it feels like a comedy which is kind of appropriate. It's swift and energetic, which thoroughly provides endless entertainment. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply terrific, from unhinged crawling to spilling charisma, he has made Belfort an effectively awful yet magnetic cinematic character you'll encounter in recent memory. His co-star Jonah Hill shares the same feat as his twice the arrogant, profane and half-witted pair. Also notable strong performance from Rob Reiner and Kyle Chandler. And for only few scenes, Matthew McConaughey steals all the ones that he is in.Everyone might think the ending is as much as inconsequential than it suggests; the point can probably be the ugly price of the person gets in the end is within himself, a perfect life won't fix a broken man, or misusing cash and power will always cause a lot of trouble. There is many suggestions about its themes. But in the end, Jordan Belfort is just a another man in the community who is blinded by the typical extreme lust and fortune, and for sure anyone would get the same condition if they ever get to taste its pleasures. In spite of treating everything as a joke, the film suddenly becomes compelling. That's the kind of trick it has. Anything else, The Wolf of Wall Street is just insanely fun. Even for its lengthy runtime, it's able to be very enjoyable every minute of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The wolf of anything but Wall Street!,"I was so excited about this movie when released, Scorsese and DiCaprio teaming up again, a story taking place in Wall Street, what else to expect. I don't know why but it took me two years to watch it. And I am kind of ""Gosh, it could have waited more"". The reason is it doesn't tell you anything from a financial standpoint. All we see is a greedy broker who suddenly makes lots of money, parties all the time, and too much sex, sex and sex. I think the name should be changed to ""Sodom and Gomorrah All Over Again"" or something like that.The story doesn't clearly tells how Jordan Belford (DiCaprio) gets rich and climbs to the highs in Wall Str. We know he and his friends sell penny stocks and lead the IPO of SM women shoes, and that's it. It is never told how the penny stock mechanism works, or what happens to the people that trust Belford, and moreover he starts being ""Robin Hood for himself and his colleagues"" but are the rich that fool, do they just give away their money? Similarly, all of a sudden we see him lose everything, FBI investigation, wiring, everything getting out of hand, no story telling whatsoever.Jonah Hill does a perfect job. DiCaprio too much, overacting again. The speeches he gives in the company, for me, are too emotional, it looks more like a cult religious ritual than an ordinary speech to employees. Maybe they are not ordinary, maybe it is that stealing other people's money needs that kind of encouragement. Lastly, I think, the name of Martin Scorsese makes us expect something great, and this movie does not fit and come anywhere close to that expectation.

American Psycho as a Tragic Comedy,"9.1 of 10. It's hard to criticize a film about it's length that is great and part of its greatness is its satirizing of excess, making the length part of the story. Length, however, and a few other things that could have been cut or given more thought prevent this from being perfect. For example, McConaughey, either just before or just after his award-deserving performance in another award-deserving film, Dallas Buyers Club, is miscast. He doesn't need to be in this film and he looks like an underfed, homeless man in a suit. That said, if you can ignore his appearance and misplaced accent, he, like all the cast, does give a wonderfully amusing performance.I definitely won't complain if this gets awards.For DeCaprio, this is a wonderful complement to his role in The Great Gatsby. In fact, he fits into this character far better. It would be wrong to call it ironic, but his role here is an inversion of essentially the same character he played in Gatsby.As for capturing reality in a film based on true, possibly somewhat enhanced, story, it's nearly impossible to find flaws. Because of the lack of cutting, there is at times some sympathy developed for characters that shouldn't be getting any empathy. I would have also made some different soundtrack choices for a film set in the late 1980s/early 90s.Overall, however, it's an exotic use of time that captures aspects of lesser films this year (I'm thinking Blue Jasmine and All is Lost) all into one masterpiece so you don't have to watch them. If you haven't seen American Psycho, however, be sure to see that. That will help you enjoy the truth is bizarrely similar to fiction elements of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"""Goodfellas"" in ""Wall Street"": Wolves in Armani's Clothing...","""Why don't you boys go down to Wall Street and find some real crooks?""This is Tuddy Cicero speaking to the FBI men while they arrest his brother Paulie near the end of ""Goodfellas"". It's very revealing when 'ordinary' gangsters believe they don't hold a candle to the Wall Street guys. And after the 2008 financial crisis, the Goldman Sachs and Madoff scandals, it's hard to prove them wrong. 23 years later, Martin Scorsese, the greatest gangster movie director, finally did justice to Cicero's words and took on the 'bigger players', through his adaptation of Jordan Belfort's autobiographical book.Jordan Belfort is a guy who, as far back as he could remember, always dreamed of making money and found an easier way than being a gangster: he became a trader. He wasn't more handsome or charismatic than Henry Hill (as portrayed in the films), he just studied and got the passport to Wall Street. He could do what Hill did in all legality proving Al Capone's quote that ""Capitalism is the legitimate racket of the ruling class"". In fact, he almost made the Goodfellas look closer to Robin Hood figures, at least, they bribed a few working-class men.""Goodfellas"" was craftsmanship compared to what these 'wolves' in Armani's clothing did: elevating theft to an industrial level, about making millions in a few hours, and money out of virtually nothing, which is the essence of finance. It reminded me of these courses in business schools teaching how to make risk-less money through arbitrage. What Belfort makes is more straightforward, he sells worthless action to blue-collar people and then, it's the traditional supply-and-demand rules, the more people buy, the more others want to buy, the value increases and when it goes high enough, you sell. What then happens to your client is besides your concerns.Call it unethical, cynical or criminal, but this is the world's holistic system. And the only talent that can make you rich quicker than talented and deserving people is being a good salesman. Because, when you have to sell ****, just sell dreams. A good trader sells securities and buys capital, he sells promising values and makes real money, and it takes some communicative skills to make that possible. And that's the key to these characters' ""likability"", by cinematic standards; they know how to communicate their appeal, that's the 'Gekko' syndrome.The screenplay, written by Terence Winter, is full of these pep-talk speeches echoing the famous ""Greed is good"" tirade and we have such motivational ones as ""there's no nobility in poverty"" (also borrowed from Oliver Stone's film). ""Wall Street"" set the tone for the financial-themed movies, and there's a reason these films fascinate us: we all love money, we all dream of being rich, if we dream of something else, it's liable to have wealth in the process. There's no potential dream that doesn't involve in a way or another, sex, money or power, these movies speak to us, in a very personal level.I often found myself thinking that an average guy must make money to have sex with a beautiful girl, and a beautiful girl can get a rich guy easier than an average one. The film made me understand why: basically, a man's main currency is the money he makes, even if you don't dream of banging hot girls, you won't earn your nagging wife's respect if your pockets are empty, and a woman's currency is her beauty, her body and her willingness to use them. Not only Margot Robbie's frontal nudity is not shocking, but it's also a necessity. When you have these guys indecently throwing lobsters, wiping their ass with paper bills or harassing flight attendants, it's just their money language, they can get away with it. Full nudity is the woman showing her best asset in that decadent world, it's a fair trade.And only Scorsese could have portrayed such loathsome and amoral characters with that flamboyant, dizzying and electrifying style. The characters are sleazy, have nicknames as pathetic as their intentions, as if behind every trader, there was a crook sleeping, but they strangely appeal to us. There Scorsese's obligatory morally corrupt protagonist rising high to fall hard, a multiple-time sinner who's given a few moments of redemption but won't go until the sun really burns his wings. Leonardo Di Caprio finally brings a performance where he can show a wide range of emotions, be charismatic and pathetic within the same five minutes and the credits also go to the gripping realism of the portrayal of cocaine, crack and Quaalude uses.No movie ever portrayed drugs and lust, and the combination of both in such a straight-forward way, and that was essential because there's got to be a catch behind such a dreamy lifestyle. This ambivalence goes further as the title was borrowed from an unflattering portrait of the young yuppie go-getter, yet it gave him the perfect publicity to build his reputation. Did things change much? After he cooperated with the FBI, he served a few years in prison and became a motivational speaker. In the film's closing scene, you can see people looking at him with respect and adoration. The joke is on us.From Leo to the surprisingly good Jonah Hill as his right-hand man Donnie Azoff, from Matthew McConaughey as his first tutor, Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent or Jean Dujardin as the suave and crooked Swiss banker, the film is some actors' finest hours, and that includes Rob Reiner as Leo's father and the promising Margot Robbie. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is Scorsese back to his roots and one of his best.And what a cruel injustice that Roger Ebert, Scorsese' number one fan, who loved every single film he made with Leo and adored ""Goodfellas"", didn't live up to see the culmination of the actor/director's duo and the film in the same vein of greatness than its glorious predecessor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Simply the best movie ever.,"Finally, after the disastrous Wallstreet 2 (faimily drama with baby face LaBouef) and the shallow MarginCall that didn't begin to explain what really went down at the heart of the financial melt down, Wolf of Wallstreet is an entertaining masterpiece. Littered with Stars, directed to perfection, full of humour and still somehow semi-educational on the financial aspects of the plot. Only rivaled by the big short (with Christian Bale).
The only downside of this movie is the blatant advertisement of heavy drugs. I get it that the quay loods seemed like a fun story element, but smoking crack for fun??? Well,if that doesn't bother you, enjoy this movie. It's real good :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Wall Street Exposed,"The Wolf of Wall Street is exhibition of excess, greed and the perversion of the American dream, it's deeply honest and darkly humorous story of the rise and fall of the infamous Wall Street stockbroker Jordan Belfort. DiCaprio comfortably steps into the shoes of the ruthless wolf 'Jordan Belfort' he quickly transitions from a naive intern to a ruthless, amoral Wall Street tycoon. He goes for lunch with a senior stockbroker to learn that the industry is really just a zero-sum game. No one really knows which stocks are going up and down and no one wins but the broker - all that matters is whether you can sell. Jordan Belfort is the poster boy for everything Wall Street doesn't want us to know.Wall street is depicted to be a world of animalistic instincts where only the ruthless survive. The employees at Stratton Oakmont are often beating their chests like monkeys, chanting in a ritualistic manner, having sex in front of each other and pissing in the offices. The office truly is a wolf pit, where man is enslaved by his primal instincts. Testosterone is in the air, fueling aggressive confrontation and impulsive behavior; in one scene Jonah Hill's character eats another employees goldfish in front of him to assert his dominance. Belfort and his co-workers increase their wealth in equal measure to their hedonism and quest for instant gratification. Cocaine and sedatives called 'Ludes' become as commonplace as coffee, a seemingly necessary part of life as a stockbroker in the 80s. The film is laced with moral questions; even more pertinent in today's economic climate Scorsese makes us ask ourselves how much is too much?The film often feels like a series of darkly humorous anecdotes. At times it can feel like it is missing a direction or any real plot. Only in the last third of the film does a solid plot start to develop with the long awaited arrival of an antagonist. However, the plot is not what makes this film great - it's the depth of the characters, The Wolf of Wallstreet should be viewed as a character study of a man corrupted by wealth and in that respect it excels.I was expecting DiCaprio to blow me away with a performance worthy of an Oscar, but instead I found myself pleasantly surprised at the intensity of Johan Hill's performance. My previous experience of him playing a similar version of the same character led me to believe that he was a one trick pony and made me question whether he could pull off such a complex role However, Jonah proved his diversity as an actor and brought the character 'Donny' to life with a powerful performance, sparking intensely funny scenes with his natural comedic flare. He was reportedly only paid $60,000 for his supporting role, choosing to work on the film because of his respect for Scorsese. Despite being paid much less than DiCaprio, Jonah arguably gave a better performance and deserved to win an Oscar for best supporting role.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Wasn't crazy about this movie,"Wasn't crazy about this movie. Just another copycat ripoff of Wall Street 1 & 2 and The Boiler Room to name a couple and even stole lines from Pretty Woman and the other two movies I mentioned. It is however a good example of how the con artist scumbags took advantage of poor people for personal gain and to a small degree exemplifies how the world economy has been trashed by these scumbags. They tried to make DiCaprio's character into a hero, but he wasn't It had a few funny moments. If you liked the last 2 Wall Street's as much as I did, you may be disappointed in this. I haven't liked Scorsese's last two movies, oddly enough they both had DiCaprio in them, lol. He seems to keep playing the same guy and with a different twist and I am a fan of DiCaprio......",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The initials spell  'WOW',"Martin Scorsese has done it again. The 70 something director known for his amazing projects like good fellas , the departed and many others has directed this movie of the same pattern as of good-fellas , which is first person narrative combined with third person story telling. The film offers us a tub full of jokes and comedy scenes delivered beautifully by the whole star-cast, Leo, Jonah and Patrick Denham.The movie has even made an amazing selection of special appearances like Matthew and Jean Dujardin. I was really shocked when Leo didn't win the Oscar , because this time he deserved it more than ever.So the movie in a nutshell is a full package, combing amazing story telling, with stupendous performances and beautiful direction.WATCH IT !",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Laugh out loud funny with a perfect cast,"This excellent true story comedy of a wall street hotshot downfall is laugh out loud funny. It's well written, over the top at times about the drugs sex and excess but it's comically so and relevant to the story. The way the dialog is written and the way the scenes played out is fresh and witty. The scene with the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler on the boat is hilarious. So is the drive back from the country club. Doesn't feel draggy even though it's nearly 3 hours long because the story moves along and the characters are sympathetic.The casting is terrific. Leonardo demonstrates some good comedic delivery without overacting even if the scenes and dialog are a bit exaggerated at times. It's good he isn't playing a more familiar person so you don't have to deal with him not looking much like Howard Hughes or J Edgar Hoover. Jonah Hill has some hilarious moments that he pulls of well like the cousin conservation. Margot Robbie is quite good as the poster second wife. The European supporting cast is perfect - Jean Dujardin as a sleazy Swiss Banker is spot on as is Joanna Lumley as the English aunt. Wonder why Matthew McConaughey is skinny and haggard for this movie as well.Liked it more than American Hustle. Good to have a comedy about Wall Street crooks to contrast with the more serious Wall Street 2 and the recent documentaries. It doesn't glamorize drugs rather it shows the effects. Good warning about the dangers of penny stocks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Emperor's New Clothes?,"I have just switched off The Wolf of Wall Street in.....well, shock frankly. After persevering for quite some time, because this is a film directed by Martin Scorcese for goodness sake! So felt it just had to get better any minute NOW.Unfortunately, it did not. Flabby and self indulgent. This required an excellent editor to step up and shout over the ego's: 'No really fellas......that just goes on and on and on.....keep it sharp!' Just shocked at how appalling this actually is. If this was a couple of guys just out of film school, would the critics have raved about it? Would it get nominated for Awards?More evidence of the ridiculousness of big award nights.I have read the reviews here of people who liked this film, and all respect to you.

This Is a Truly Terrible Movie,"It would be impossible for me to write a spoiler in this review, as I walked out after an hour.Basically, this movie is about a shameful, conscious-less prick who has surrounded himself with an assortment of losers who are quite content to emulate him in the pursuit of money at the expense of anyone who is unfortunate enough to cross their paths. In Goodfellas and The Departed, Scorsese showed us equally unsavory people, but those films were redeemed by having - at least - great dialog, engaging characters and a decent story line.""Wolf"" has none of these things. It's as if Scorsese dropped acid and decided to make a movie about people who lack any redeeming values whatever - and celebrate the fact every day. There are no characters you care about, no story line of even the remotest interest and - frankly - no reason to bother watching this mess.The problem with today's movie business is that about 90% of the movies made are targeted at the ""14 year old boy"" demographic. Thus Thor, Enders Game and all of the rest of the crap that clogs up the cinema universe.""Wolf"" is not just aimed at 14 year old boys, but at DEPRAVED 14 year old boys. If you get the urge to go to this movie, just take the ten bucks out of your pocket and wipe your butt with it. You'll get the same result and save yourself the three hours.(BTW, after walking out, I was lucky enough to stumble into American Hustle. Now THERE is a movie worth watching.)",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
10/10,"Acclaimed master director Martin Scorsese ('Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' & 'GoodFellas') teams up with with producer and frequent collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio in this tale of greed and debauchery focusing on real-life stock broker and convicted fraudster Jordan Belfort in his rise to the top of the world of seedy Wall Street investing before his fall through the excesses of drugs and sex and illegal activities.In 1987, the money hungry Belfort (DiCaprio) finds work on Wall Street as an entry-level trader at a blue chip investment bank before the catastrophic Black Monday market crash leaves him out of work. Rebounding to Long Island to sell risky and largely unregulated ""pink sheet"" shares, Belfort teams up with business partner Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and a few other sales people to start his own brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont selling stocks to wealthy investors whilst rampant prostitution and drug-fuelled antics play out on the trading room floor and Belfort and his associates run an illegal pump-and-dump scheme to get rich off over-inflating stock prices. In the meantime, Belfort finds a new wife Naomi (Margot Robbie) who's relationship is tested and strained with Jordan's behaviour whilst FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) puts Jordan and Stratton Oakmont under the microscope with intense scrutiny.Whilst not quite at the same level as Scorsese's masterpieces, 'Wolf' is a quintessential film of his most recent filmography and is definitely his most funniest and outrageous film, whilst also serving as a cautionary tale much like 'GoodFellas' and 'Casino' borrowing their narrative structures and use of narration but replacing the visceral violence seen in those films with plenty of scenes depicting sex and drug use, along with a record amount of swear words (569 ""F-bombs"" were dropped in the film, a record which still stands for a widespread theatrical release).DiCaprio is perhaps at his best in this film playing the sleazy and narcissistic Belfort, whilst his co-star Jonah Hill delivers plenty of laughs and maintains excellent chemistry with DiCaprio in their scenes together. Margot Robbie in her breakout role as Naomi is a standout in the film and definitely one of the best casting choices in a Scorsese film, while Matthew McConaughey in a brief 5 minutes of screen time as broker-cum-mentor Mark Hanna also delivers an excellent performance that makes you wish he was in the film longer.'Wolf' is definitely a hilarious but also horrifying depiction of a man's greed that spirals out of control and costs him everything but nothing in the end, perhaps also reflecting on the audience of Belfort's outrageous tale still wanting to be like him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Wolf of Wall Street Literature and Movie Review,"The 2013 film of Jordan Belfort's The Wolf of Wall Street novel begins with Leonardo DiCaprio breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the audience. He does this repeatedly throughout the film and if he is not speaking directly to the audience, he is doing lots of voice-over to explain or inform what he or the other characters are doing at that particular time/situation in the film. Most of the time, I find voice-over very distracting, but I have to admit that it works in this dramedy film very well. The book, written by Jordan Belfort, a former New York stock broker who earned hundreds of millions of dollar during the 1990s at his Stratton Oakmont brokerage firm on Long Island, New York (not really Wall Street in downtown Manhattan). The book is very long and seems to glorify everything Belfort did during this time of his life along with all of his friends and co-workers at his stock firm. He founded this firm which started as a penny stock firm, where unfortunately he defrauded everyday ordinary investors with fraudulent stock sales. Considered a stock swindler, he developed a very severe lifestyle, which included a very serious addition to Quaaludes. The company at one point employed well over 1,000 brokers and dealt with more than $1 billion stocks, including the Steve Madden show company. The 2000 film Boiler Room was inspired by Belfort and Stratton Oakmont. It should be noted here that Belfort was indicted in 1998 for money laundering and securities fraud. He spent 22 months in a federal prison and was to pay back $110.4 million that he swindled. Meeting Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong in prison, Belfort was persuaded to write and publish his story, which he has. Stratton Oakmont was considered a boiler room that manipulated stocks. In the book, he tells in full detail how he did it from money laundering to swindling customers. Millions poured in, bringing with it many excesses, which included women, drugs, huge homes, servants, yachts, aircrafts, not only for himself but for everyone who worked for him. He also describes in detail all his dope escapades and sex, despite constantly telling the reader how much he loved his wives, particularly his second (and now ex-wife) and his children. Again, in full detail, he tells the reader about the supporting characters, from Aunt Patricia, his father who he calls Max Max, the Swiss forger, his cohorts in crime at Stratton, along with Steve Madden and others. The drug use, the sex, the violence, the storm at sea that destroyed his yacht, and the car wrecks are all listed throughout the book. It finally ends with Belfort being arrest and jailed. In the film, which is considered a black comedy, the story deals with the scam that Belfort initiated and where, or not, some, any, or all of what he tells the reader what he did during this time in the book is accurate remains to be seen. As is always the case with any film, plenty of creative license is used to tell a particular story. Seeing how Martin Scorsese, the director, in all his films, tries to be as faithful to the novel as he can be, he has done the same with Belfort's memoir. So this particular film is a close adaptation since most of the story elements are kept while some have been changed, added, or dropped. But, one has to be reminded that Belfort was a true scam artist, so just how much of his story is legit is up to the reader and now the watcher to decide. Most of what Scorsese has included in this film is accurate based on the book. Mark Hanna, played well by a still very thin Matthew McConaughey from his role in Dallas Buyer's Club, tells a very young Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) that the key to being successful included hookers, cocaine and masturbation is told in the novel. The use of what is called a pump-and-dump scheme (selling a risky stock at an inflated price and then sold the stock to make a profit for themselves) to make a profit is also accurate. Belfort and Danny Porush (Donnie Azoff in the film, played by Jonah Hill) did this. The brokerage firm did in reality take Steve Madden's shoe company public, which Madden, Belfort and Porush owned the stock, driving the price up. All three of them went to jail for this. The smuggling of the money that Belfort laundered in Switzerland was actually done by his wife's mother and English aunt. Prostitutes were hired and were billed to the corporate credit card and then these expenses were written off their taxes. The yacht, originally owned by Coco Chanel, was sunk. In the film, his second wife's name was Naomi; in the novel, her name is Nadine. In the book, Belfort gave up Porush, among many others for a reduced sentence. In the film, he tells Porush not to incriminate himself. It is true that Belfort was born in the Bronx to accountant parents and he was raised Jewish which he is still today. I guess the audience would like to believe that Belfort only stole from the rich. Truth be known, many small investors are still to this day trying to recover from his scheme while Belfort has failed to repay what he owes and Porush is still doing his get rich quick plans. Many of the characters; names from the book were changed. Danny Porush is Donnie Azoff, Patrick Denham (FBI agent) is in real-life Gregory Coleman, Denise Lombardo was changed to Teresa Petrillo and Nadine Caridi was Naomi Lapaglia. Chandler was the name of his first child, but was referred to in the film as Skyler. Scorsese did include at the end of the film a disclaimer saying it was a fictionalized version of the novel and in the film, some of the names had been changed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Surprisingly Bland Display of Debauchery,"Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an ambitious young Wall Street numbers-cruncher, working under an equally ambitious (though decidedly more corrupted) stock broker named Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey). Things are going well until Hanna's firm goes under, leaving Belfort to create his firm. Belfort throws together some sleazy characters (Jonah Hill, Jean Dujardin, Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal) to create a large securities fraud investigation-in-waiting, finally forcing him to use his conscience to decide between an extravagant life or a way out for himself.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a nightmare, for both the characters and the viewer. A script that can't fit itself into coherence drones on and on about corruption, while never seeing fit to inform the viewer of exactly how Belfort became what he is. He just, is. We never learn much of anything about him. Nudity, drugs, and violence corrupt his despicable life. And that's what the movie is. In many ways, I would have learned more from watching a documentary about Belfort than watching this movie.For a Martin Scorcese picture, especially one written by Boardwalk Empire scribe Terrence Winter, I was shocked at the utter one- dimensionality of these characters. Belfort is a scumbag. Each and every one of his cronies are equally scummy. The only characters who seem to have any benevolence are Belfort's first wife (despite her many scenes, we never learn her name) and the FBI Agent pursuing the fraud, Kyle Chandler. Chandler might have had a name. If I saw the word ""Cop"" across from his name at the cast and credits, I wouldn't be surprised.By far the worst part of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the structure. The end result looks like someone took scissors to the reel and haphazardly pasted the final third together. It's a complete mess, trying to force all the character development we didn't get for the first TWO HOURS into the final chapter.The only character who was at all interesting was McConaughey's, who as a powerful broker who loses it all perhaps served as the heaviest foreshadowing the film could offer. Yet we lose track of him after the first twenty minutes, and by the time you're numb from the waist down and your brain is turning into mush, you've completely forgotten McConaughey was ever there.Scorcese and DiCaprio should be ashamed. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a disaster that engages its audience through the type of stuff I'd expect in a Uwe Boll film.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Fifths is not a charm for Leo,"After dumping his longtime companion Robert De Niro for the hey-day Leonardo DiCaprio in the naughties, Martin Scorsese embarks on a series of ambitious enterprises to earn his overdue Oscar statuette, finally third time is a charm, THE DEPARTED (2006, 8/10) achieved that goal, but poor Leo is still Oscar-less, so their fifth teamwork is THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, an excessive satire of Jordan Belfort's autobiography, a former Wall Street stock-broker's rise and fall from 1980s to 1990s, which grants Leo the uppermost leniency to embody this corrupted, decadent and indecent character with inordinate excess and extravaganza, unfortunately, Leo's time has yet arrived.Running around 180-minutes, the film is ultra-snappy and the camera faithfully acts in accordance with the doped delirium where Jordan (DiCaprio) and his cohorts habitually reside, it is an out-and-out wealth-flaunting satire, periodically overreaches its boundary with benumbing and slightly off-putting repletion since Jordan's hollow life perpetually orbits around money, sex, drugs and drug-addled misdemeanors. Marty doesn't trouble himself to go deeper than that, the trenchant point is, Jordan is no more than an eloquent salesman and a shallow opportunist, luck is on his side at the right time, but he fails to apply a failsafe mechanism to get away with it, ironically, it is the American judicial system let him slide, all the more it incites audience to detest the hypocritical political body of democracy, which is inadequate in its wealth distribution and justice upholding.Leo's performance is voraciously full of vim and vigor, he devotes every effort to light up the screen with incredible body language and pitch-perfect accuracy with beguiling pomposity, but, an indelible impression is that with every gesture he poises, every line he delivers, simultaneously he is thinking of that damn Oscar, he even makes Jordan lovable and immensely watchable, it is his charisma, not his character's, which may bar him from winning in the race this year.Two-times Oscar nominee (alas!) slash red-hot comedy actor Jonah Hill, not a fan of his performance in MONEYBALL (2011, 6/10), there is no big stretch for him to showcase his prowess as a serious thespian here, he is uproarious and cheeky as Donnie Azoff, Jordan's best buddy, like in his other more coarse comedies, the only difference is this is a Marty's filmHaving said that, a preciously meaty part is when Donnie is choking and Jordan tries to save him, but we can vicariously detect in one blink Jordan thinks it might be good to let him die. This is one of Marty's masterstrokes to reflect the complexity of human's intuitive caprice.New starlet Margot Robbie consummates her big screen breakthrough as Naomi Lapaglia, the second trophy wife of Jordan, she intermingles her utterly stunning sex appeal with aggressive fervor, which might bring to mind Sharon Stone in CASINO (1995, 7/10). Coincidentally, Leo's Oscar rival and eventual winner McConaughey (DALLAS BUYERS CLUB 2013, 7/10) has a ten- minutes screen time as Mark Hanna, the one who remarks on the golden criterion in the Wall Street business, McConaissance is irrepressible even for such a small role. It could be Leo's idea to curtail the role of Mark in the film in order not to lose the spotlight of his own. Also I must extol Spike Jonze's unexpected cameo which offers some imaginable salaciousness with his tacit smirk.Marty has already risen to a lofty echelon of a cinema maestro who can apply himself to manifold genres with top-notch dexterity, which his recent works HUGO (2011, 9/10), SHUTTER ISLAND (2010, 8/10) all potently bespeak. At the age of 72, the night is still young, may his outstanding creativity will never peter out, which is a tremendous blessing for all the children of cinemas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"It's absolutely nuts, and I mean that in a positive way","I didn't care for the characters, but I damn did have a great time watching 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.

Phenomenal actor! He is outstanding here as Jordan Belfort, the guy this film is based upon. As noted, I didn't really ever care for Jordan but DiCaprio makes it impossible not to enjoy watching events throughout.Jonah Hill (Donnie) comes in with a very good performance, the type of which I hadn't previously seen from him; closest being, in terms of quality, 'Moneyball'. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, isn't easy to forget as Naomi. Though none of the following standout big, it's pleasant to see Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey and Jon Favreau, among others, appear.The almost three hour run time, aside from a couple of moments, goes by fairly quickly. A big reason for that is the sheer bonkers nature of the plot, which goes in so many different directions it's impressive.

MASTERPIECE,"I don't know where to begin to review this epic of a movie. I would like to give this movie 10 out of 10 stars or maybe more than that.Characters are represented brilliantly by all of them. Leonardo Dicaprio was great as always! He deserved an Oscar for his brilliant performance. Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie also played their part really nicely. It is one of my favourite movies directed by Martin Scorsese.Wolf of Wall Street is a rollercoaster ride which takes Jordan Belfort from nobody to a rich man and one of the best sales traineers in the history. This movie was inspiring and I enjoyed Belforts character. He is clever, bold, risk-taking. He has a chill-out attitude and effective leadership skills, which are the most liked traits of mine from his character.The movie also showed that some people in our life might show us a complete new different direction which may brings positive or negative impact in our life, like in the movie Mathew guided Belfort how to earn more money, how to deal with the customers. This leaded a significant change in Belforts personality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese another good film but this one has no class at all,"Scorsese has made some of the all time great American films and many are my favorite films of all time . The Wolf Of Wall Street has many similarities to his 90's masterpiece films Goodfellas & Casino with much action and fast paced storytelling. Also he has borrowed some black humor from his 80's offbeat films The King of Comedy & After Hours.It's a magnificent performance by Leonardo Di Caprio but it's his Jordan Belfort character I don't like at all. I have adored other Scorsese male leads roles such as Henry Hill (Goodfellas ) , Ace Rothstein ( Casino) , Travis Bickle ( Taxi Driver) in controversial and violent movies they all are portrayed with an element of coolness and all you also have some compassion for.Belfort is really a smart arse cocky guy you can't stand and I have trouble liking .The Wolf Of Wall Street also lacks class and at times thought I was at a friends Bucks Party getting cheap thrills. I understand the direction is deliberately over the top for this over hyped character. There will be young film goers that will see this film thinking it's the baddest film of all time. With no respect to a Maverick DirectorI could write more and more about this film but Scorsese please just one last film with De Niro and Pesci.I still like this film but way to excessive",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
My Best Scorsese's film,"The Wolf of wall street is undoubtedly the best film of Martin Scorsese. His comic tone that could take away weight a priori hides a very powerful and moral message that relates viewer and protagonists. At first we laughed with them and then we laughed at them.

"Good direction, bad editing","It is always difficult to properly review legendary directors. There always comes a point where movie-making trends and styles have passed them by or the creative juices have simply stopped flowing. This is the case for Scorsese, at least by judging The Wolf of Wall Street.All of his hallmarks are put to good use in the film. The immediacy and visual assault of the cinematography in particular was exceptional. The dark comedic touches are put to the forefront to great effect. I don't recall ever laughing out loud at Scorsese film before, but there are many such moments here.The story itself is one of the oldest movie clichés, man overcomes humble beginnings, becomes wealthy, is seduced by money and power, is consumed by his excesses and ultimately redeemed.The performances are intentionally bombastic and over the top and greatly add to the theme of excess. Jonah Hill especially loses himself in the role and delivers a lot of laughs and some depth to an otherwise shallow and one dimensional character. DiCaprio, while convincing as charismatic and flawed Jordan Belfort, grew tiresome over the course of the film as his character flies directly into the sun and then spectacularly crashes and burns.Unfortunately the theme of excess extends to the length of the film as well; it is simply way too long. I felt like I was watching a director's cut in the theater. I know the general trend in movies today is longer run times, but at almost 3 hours it is just too much. What should be a highly entertaining two hour wild ride just drags in some places. The outlandish action and comedy scenes lose their bite in the last half of the film as the viewer is just numb from the assault at that point. The dramatic scenes are not well thought out and did not establish an emotional connection with the characters and their downfall as I should.All in all, a very enjoyable, exciting film but it misses the mark in characterization and left me wanting less bombast and more meat in the story. I see an aging director trying to stay relevant and not wanting to make compromises this movie badly needs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
At a loss,"Two and a half hours into the film and I was non the wiser on where I was being taken. Character and storyline development was sidestepped for a vulgar expression of the American psyche - overt sexuality, the glorification of the abuser with no reference at all to the abused, excess without meaning.Many seem to believe that this is the crowning achievement of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio clearly lacks the depth of character that he has shown in many of his previous movies. He seems to have taken a step backwards, yelling, screaming and over-acting at every instance. As for Scorsese, more and more over time I am missing the point of his movies. They are - dull and lack the intelligent treatment of characters that he had in his early films.There are times when you seriously question why directors going off on major tangents in their careers, and why some wonderful actors continue to follow those directors. It is certainly time for DiCaprio to get out from under the shadow of Scorsese who seems to be slowly losing the plot.I did not enjoy the film in the slightest.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

fantastic,"when i first watched this movie months ago, i wasn't really sure what to expect. then, after watching the first 45 minutes i was completely blown away. this is easily my favorite movie, being the only movie I've like so much as to watch a second time immediately after the first. I read both of the books, in less then two weeks. Sure, they aren't the same as the movie, but honestly if your going to try and use that to say the movie was bad, then gtfo. I keep reading these reviews, such as this guy named Luci1977, who say, ""don't waste your time!"" or ""the movie has no connection to Jordan belfort's life."" I mean common seriously. None you have ever met him, and you act like you are best friends. I mean if you have, that's great, but your still a prick. Do seriously think that Belfort cares if the movie matches his life? Do you know how much he's making off of that movie?! So go look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself your not an actual movie critique, because your not. sorry. better luck next time. This is a great movie, it hilarious, and i recommend you see it. That is if your older than 17 of course.(lol boobs)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The master is back.,"Bacchus, Roman god of wine and debauchery, is alive and well and has been brought to raunchy life by Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese's latest film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". His human incarnation is Jordan Belfort, a fast-talking financial kingpin whose balls-to-the-wall lifestyle of sex and drugs and rolling in dough would make Gordon Gekko take a step back and reassess his lifestyle.And for what seems to be the first time, Scorsese's decade-long collaboration with DiCaprio has finally paid off. Because ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", written by ""Sopranos"" scribe Terence Winter, is a far cry from the polished but lifeless films that Scorsese, master that he is, has been pumping out of late. It is perhaps his most energetic film since ""Gangs of New York"", his cleanest (in craftsmanship, though certainly not in content) since ""Goodfellas"". Instead of wise-guys and low-rent mobsters, ""Wolf"" is about the sharks that swam in the seas of the 1%, ripping into their prey with gusto while coming at them with smiles.Set in the '80s and '90s, Scorsese depicts a glitz-and-chintz world ripe for the taking for any ambitious youth who wanted to make a name for himself. Enter Belfort, a fresh-faced twenty- something who starts on the bottom rung at one of the many firms in Lower Manhattan. He quickly becomes the acolyte of the head honcho (Matthew McConaughey, who in only a few short scenes manages to give one of the performances of the year), and in doing so learns the tricks of the trade, which involve indulging in any and all sins of the flesh.But when the market goes belly-up, Belfort (not wanting to go out on his ass like all the other Wall Street schmucks) realizes that he can take advantage of ""penny-stocks"" that no one cares about, pitching them to anyone gullible enough to buy them. Soon, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont, with a merry band of miscreants, including his right-hand man Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). Soon, Stratton Oakmont becomes a major, major player in the stock world, luring huge clients in with the hopes of paying out big-time. Except all that Belfort, Azoff and the others care about is their own gain, and the more they make, the more they want. And of course, absolutely none of what Stratton does is legal, so obviously the feds (represented by a dogged Kyle Chandler) seek to rain on Belfort's parade.But before that, the parade roars in full orgiastic force. Scorsese's film is an epic, three hours of every kind of cardinal sin short of murder, with characters both repulsive and entrancing, in a hysterically funny and painfully horrific saga of depravity as only Scorsese can bring. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing never once makes the film feel its length, and Winter's script is jam-packed with colorful moments and almost surreal hedonism. There are so many drug-fueled sequences that anyone who goes in sober will come out with a contact high.Perhaps the most impressive thing about the film is that, at long last, DiCaprio has learned to loosen up. ""Wolf"" allows him to finally sink his teeth in a full-on comic role, and he makes it work impeccably. His energy crackles with every single actor, and he even shows an adeptness at physical comedy (there's a scene involving a 'luded-up Jordan trying to roll himself down stairs that might be the funniest moment of the year). But the rest of the cast is equally up to the task to match him. Jonah Hill is in rarest form here, giving an excellent performance and displaying grand chemistry with DiCaprio. There are guys like Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal, even Spike Jonze in a small role that are absolutely wondrous to watch. And I do have to give special shout-outs to Jean Dujardin and Joanna Lumley, both of whom stole the show in playing characters that end up as part of Belfort's scheme to hoard his riches. (If ""Wolf""'s cast has an Achilles heel, it's Margot Robbie as Belfort's bride, who I feel tries so hard to be on Lorraine Bracco's level but comes off as a second-rate Sharon Stone.)Even as the film draws to its close, there's not a single moment where ""Wolf of Wall Street"" wants to relinquish its hold on us. We're in it for the long haul, as Belfort's protégés must have been. And for Scorsese and Schoonmaker, hardly spring chickens, to revive the decadence of the gods in all of its party-hearty glory is something to behold. ""Wolf of Wall Street"" had me flying high, and I'm still waiting to come down from it",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"We've seen the this story before, but it's lost it's emotion","Martin Scorsese has always been the Jewel of New Hollywood, he hasn't burned out like Coppola & Cimino, or softened his image by making giant block busters and family films like Spielberg and Lucas. Even his 2011 film Hugo, while a departure from his normal dark crime films still contained his trademark love of all things cinema. So how did his new film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" ad to his legacy? Well quite frankly we've seen this story before, actually we've seen it twice before in his crime masterpiece Goodfellas, and his chilling biopic (and possible greatest film) Raging Bull. The story of a young hot headed male ( Jordan Belfort, Henry Hill, Jake LaMotta) who starts humble while sinking deeper in their respective world (the corruption of Wall Street, the Italian-American Mafia, or Boxing title fights) is a world Scorsese can tell about growing up in the Machismo rich culture of Italian-American New York. But while each re-telling has seen Scorsese improve his technique and the art of the camera, each successive film has become more sterile. Viewing Raging Bull to this day still is a cinematic art piece that shows the negative consequences of the brutal male psyche, and then in Goodfellas, while Henry Hill follows the same path his character is not one to be sympathized much with, and then finally Jordan Belfort, a character that is as smug and unlikable, but is un-noticed when placed in a film with even more unlikeable characters (looking right at Jonah Hill). None of the characters in this film through the plot even allow you to empathize with them draining the film (with a run time of over 2 hours) of any compassion and only leaving the audience in disgust (especially in the current economic recession, not too many want to see the hubris of Stock Brokers). A Dark comedy, the film offers very few actual laughs, and for all the sex going on the background, none of it is actually sexy, just extravagant and over the top. If it were not for Martin Scorsese being the director I probably wouldn't be rating this film as highly . Not to take from Scorsese as I personally love many of his films (Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino) and with a resume like his he's allowed to make a few good movies opposed to great ones, which is exactly how to describe The Wolf of Wall Street.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
This was a horrible movie,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. Bloated, self indulgent, lacking in story line and plot. No idea why everyone seems to like it unless they just really enjoy watching men be totally disgusting for 3 hours because that is all there was to it. And I am a man who does not mind getting disgusting once in a while. I am no prude and not easily offended but this was like watching porn. Once you see the first orgasm in the first 10 minutes its 170 minutes of all the same after that.There was what could have been a moderately interesting subplot about a straight arrow FBI agent chasing the ""Wolf"" around which might have been slightly interesting in a seen that 10 times before way but it amounted to nothing.It is a bit disturbing how Scorcese glorifies the use of drugs, degrades women to nothing more then F@#$bags as they say in the movie, shows wife abuse and child abuse with no consequences and shows all the morally conscious people as ugly, dull boring individuals. You can say he is just telling a story, but he can tell any story he wanted to and decided to tell this one, so what does that say about him?A clear case of no one wants to say anything bad about a Scorcese movie.

The Intense Adrenaline Fueled Exposé,"This film is an Exposé of not just corrupt stock brokers, but of human nature in general. A study on Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, and Pride. All of these qualities deep within our human crevices. It is foolish to view these qualities by the seven deadly sins. Instead these are our animalistic flaws within our blood.The quick manic pacing, the cocaine infused script, The raw blood-pumping performances all create an intense exciting story of our own intrinsic nature. The cold, lifeless treatment of women, children, relationships, and friendships are put on blast as to further the power of these money-hungry men. You can smell the piss, sweat, and semen in the air from the attempted attainment of adrenaline.When we view stories like these its easy to determine what is good and what is wrong. We all like to think that we know who we are, and how we would act within a scenario. however sometimes our animalistic nature can take over, and rewrite how we view ourselves.This has to be one of my favorite dark comedy's of all time. I keep finding new things to appreciate in every watch.

Still one of the most amazing movies of this century.,"This movie is enthralling to say the least. Scorsese improves his rise-and-fall character arc to his fullest ability here. After watching this movie maybe 15 times, it's done nothing but grow on me. Every watch is something new to catch. Every scene worthwhile. Every line adds something to each character. The shots are amazing. While Scorsese is no Kubrick, he does have an amazing eye. The color pallet of each shot is insanely detailed, the tracking shots are perfect, and your focus is never averted from where it's supposed to be. This movie is truly a masterpiece and I really don't care who disagrees. Greed is captured in its truest form here, also with its truest consequences. This is not a movie about being consumed with vices, this is a movie warning you not to be consumed by them. If you're a bad enough person...you might just get rich.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
An overall fun ride,"I first saw this movie about two months after it was released into theaters. I was very skeptical as I heard from some people where they said it was the 'worst piece of crap' they've seen and some saying it was the 'best movie ever'. So I really did not know what to expect except that both sides could agree that there was a lot of sex and drugs. After seeing the movie, I found that it a very good movie overall. Leonardo DiCaprio is yet again very good and is 20 years overdue for an Oscar. He did a very good job portraying Jordan Belfort, the drug abusing stock broker. I did feel a little uncomfortable with he many sexually explicit sex scenes. I did also feel that the movie was very repetitive. For three hours, we watch Leonardo DiCaprio abuse drugs, have sex and look like a jackass. That is about it. But Scorsese finds a way to make it work and to make it entertaining. I was very entertained by this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Excess on '80 Wall Street,"This film tells the story of Jordan Belfort and how he made the fortune that funded his life of excess. After a brief prologue where he explains that he made millions and consumed vast quantities of various drugs we return to his first day on Wall Street; he is on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder but he knows he wants to get to the top... then a market crash puts him out of work. Instead of working at a prestigious Wall Street firm he ends up pushing penny stocks, basically junk, to people who can't really afford the losses they will surely face. It is profitable though and he quickly realises he can make a real fortune selling junk to rich people. He teams up with similarly minded people and creates a 'respectable' firm; soon he is dubbed 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and everybody wants to work for him. He gets a new wife, a large yacht and does even more drugs... his main problem is how to secure his money so that the authorities can't get it when they finally catch up with him... and he knows they will one day if he isn't careful.This film is all about excess; it could take a prurient view but instead it revels in it... Jordon Belford and his friends may be drug-taking womanisers were few if any morals but for three hours they are good company. Belford is a charismatic central character; at times he reminded me of Charles Foster Kane, from 'Citizen Kane' at other times he was more like Tony Montana from 'Scarface' without the violence. As fast as he rises it is clear that he will ultimately fall. Leonardo DiCaprio is on top form as Belford; I can only suspect that the amorality of the character stopped him getting major awards. The supporting cast is solid too; most notably Margot Robbie who is great as Naomi, Belford's second wife; and Jonah Hill as Donnie, his closest associate. It must be stated that this film isn't for the easily offended; there is prodigious swearing, lots of drug taking, a fair amount of sex and nudity and a small amount of violence... if you aren't offended by that it is a lot of fun. Given that I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting an entertaining romp of a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Funniest Comedy Of All Time,This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time I really enjoyed this movie and I did not see much wrong with it. This movie was hilarious and there were so many funny scenes throughout the film. This movie tells the story of the stock brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont. And it shows all of the illegal acts they participated in. We get to see the journey of Stratton Oakmont with many funny scenes throughout the film. Leonardo dicaprio did a fantastic job portraying stock broker Jordan Belfort and he was very funny throughout the movie. Also Jonah Hill was also very funny playing his role. Matthew mcconaughey was very funny but I wish that he was in more scenes but overall he was really funny and he is my favorite character in the movie.

"How many uses of the F-Word? 506?! F**k, that's a lot!","It's a shame that January is usually known as 'bad movie month"" (e.g Movie 43 last year), because this movie is most certainly not. It really is a unique piece of Scorsese's and DiCaprio's track records.I've gotta start of with the humour. This movie is so hilariously funny. Like, my jaw was aching when I came out of the theatre. At least every 4 minutes pretty much everyone in there burst out in humongous laughter. There was a guy next to me literally howling with laughter (maybe he thought the 'Wolf' mentioned in the title was literal?). I think the reason it was like that, though, is because it was so effortless. I've got to say, it was funnier than 50% of the comedies I've seen in the past year. It was so effortless because regular comedy movies just try to hit one emotion: Laughter. So they need to really try, because that's it's purpose. This film hit so many other levels of emotions that everything about it felt so organic and the humour was placed so perfectly. Even the scenes where the story got deep were full of so many emotions and were hard to watch. You could feel it. It was obviously down to the script (there are some parts where you can tell the actors are about to crack up), but also the editing. It had such great comic timing, and was so subtle that it felt completely natural.It's hard to believe that Jonah Hill is that same actor that played the goofy kid in 'Superbad' way back in 2007. It's the best performance of his I think I've seen. It went past the point of seeing Jonah Hill with all his Jonah Hill-isms playing a character that Jonah Hill always plays. For those 3 hours he genuinely was Donny Azoff, and played the role perfectly. He even managed to develop the character through the acting so subtly but so effectively.You can't not mention DiCaprio when talking about performances in this film. Aside from being the brilliant talent he already is, he worked so hard at the role and it defiantly paid off. The parts where he broke the 4th wall while narrating were so seamless, and when his character fell on hard times, he portrayed it with so many different emotions that his character was becoming so complex it was believable. He could have fallen into so many clichés trying to do that, but seemed to have no trouble side-stepping them. I mean, those scenes where he's 'under the influence' show that this guy is prepared to go above and beyond for his roles. Also, even though he was only in it for a short while, McConaughey deserves a shout. I've only seen him in as trailer for 'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past' as one of the ads on my copy of 'Quantum of Solace' (I think. Anyway, beside the point), so had no idea what to expect. But boy, he can defiantly act. It's because Scorsese knew what he wanted to get out of his actors.He was definitely the genius behind all of this. His direction is another thing you just can't flaw. Everything little thing added so much to the story or the humour or the characters. His way of making everything so surreally extravagant was an incredible medium into a real life situation. To some it probably seems that the amount of profanity and sex was unnecessary, but I think if there was any less the film wouldn't have been as powerful.A 3 hour thrill ride of hilarious eccentricity and amazing performances, this is a film to be experienced. You'd think that during 180 minutes the pacing would start to drag, but just when you think it does, it'll suck you right back in with underlying comic genius or subtle character development.In a way, it felt nostalgic. And in a word, it was incredible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Better than American Hustle,"Wolf is concerned with one thing and one thing only:excess and at 3 hours it could have been a tighter film if it had clocked in at 2 1/2 hours. At 3, there's a lot of repetitiveness as if Marty thought the audience needed Thor's Hammer to drive the point home. If Hill pushes Rush's exceptional Bruhl or Hustle's heartbreakingly terrific Renner out of a nom, I will be so mad.This isn't Leo's best performance for me but he was dependably solid. That he wanted to bring Belfort's story to the screen is commendable indeed. He doesn't sugarcoat the man's excesses and for the audience is more of ""Hey people really live these kinds of lives!"" Belfort as Leo portrays him was alternatively defiant, occasionally sympathetic but always boisterous. Wolf can be seen as a complementary piece to American Hustle;just the methods to achieve such differs.Because Leo and Marty have corroborated many times in the past, their bond/ trust is palpable here. Leo is/was comfortable in doing certain scenes here for Martin that he otherwise would not have done. To put it simply, white collar crime as depicted in Wolf is rendered OK in the sense this is how one man chose to lead his life and his cohorts who merrily went along with it. But Scoreses does show the downside; perhaps not as much as he should have.For myself, Wolf is highly entertaining and noms are mostly likely for Best Picture/Best Actor/Cinematography/ and perhaps Best Director.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A ruthless roller coaster of a movie,"Three hours of typical Martin Scorsese knocking you sideways, sweeping you off your feet and blowing your fuse are what you get with this film. Every scene excels in bringing the animal in all of us and every other scene or so is a giddy whirlpool of unmitigated profligacy and orgies that make you question how true the story really is. Jordan Belfort is a character that can't stop plumbing the depths of depravity, drowning in wads upon wads of banknotes and seizing every opportunity he eyes, and the magnificent Leonardo DiCaprio delivers perfectly as always.

A Wild Ride That's A Bit Too Obscene- NOT For The Easily Offended!,"WARNING: This review contains descriptions of explicit content in the movie. This may offend some readers, so be warned.I first saw The Wolf of Wall Street 7 years ago- when I was 16. My Grandma/guardian ended up seeing half of it with me, so it was awkward as she griped about the relentless profanity. I didn't care for that, or the nude scenes that challenge the R Rating.I saw it in 10th grade, and in 11th grade, classmates teased me for not liking it- they even said that they enjoyed it FOR the cursing and steamy scenes. There's also been other times I've been ridiculed for being disgusted by the movie.As such, if you told me 7 years ago that I would be seeing this again- AND recommending it, I would have thought you were crazy. But I am- WITH heavy caution.The plot, based on a true story, follows Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), a stockbroker on Wall Street who finds ways to rip people off with stock bonds and make millions upon millions of dollars for his gain and their loss.He then uses the laundered cash to get bigger houses and boats, as well as hookers and drugs and whatever he can get his greedy hands on, and this eventually leads to his downfall.As I said, I have despised this movie for 7 years. However, I've heard friends and cousins say that they enjoyed it, and I have enjoyed Scorsese movies like Goodfellas and Casino, so for a couple of weeks, I've actually thought about giving it a second chance.With the swearing and sex in mind though, I was conflicted. (I also wondered if not being teased in a long time would change anything.)Finally, I decided to see it again- so last night I went to a used DVD store and got the Blu-ray, and shortly after returning home I watched the movie again- all alone this time!As I said, to my surprise, I enjoyed it much better. For one thing, it's a well-made movie- beautifully shot and well-paced. Even though it's 3 hours long, it goes by well and doesn't feel that long by the end.The acting is also well done. Jordan Belfort isn't among my favorite Leo roles (I'd prefer ones like Titanic and Catch Me If You Can) , but it's a very good one nonetheless- Leo makes Jordan a fascinating yet despicable character.On that subject, there is debate on if this movie glorifies or condemns Belfort. I would argue that actually it does both- it shows how glamorous his rich life is, while also showing how ugly it turns out.Donnie Azoff, Jordan's partner- is played by Jonah Hill, who gives a performance outshining his usual nerd role in comedies like 21 Jump Street. There are also great performances from the likes of Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, and a brief role from Matthew McConaughey.Martin Scorsese doesn't usually do comedies, but this movie is very funny at times. Most of the laughs are from quick lines. For example, in one scene, Jordan's father is shocked that a hooker was used as a credit card charge. He asks: ""What kind of hooker uses credit cards?"" Donnie then quickly answers: ""A rich one!""Those who love Scorsese movies and crime dramas should enjoy this immensely. That said, I do have a few minor gripes with the movie- ones that made me dislike the movie before.For one thing- The Wolf of Wall Street has the most F words in a non-documentary film- over 560, the exact number depending on the source.This shows the dialogue of a Wall Street stockbroker for sure, but it does get a bit old at times- like when a group of brokers chant ""F you"" for a straight 30 seconds. There could have been a shorter amount of F words, and the point that they curse a ton would have gotten across the same. Admittedly, I did kind of get numb to it after a while and so it didn't bother me as much as the movie went on.Also, there are many sex scenes. Some of these are important to the story- like when Jordan cheats on his first wife or when his second wife asks for a divorce after having sex. The movie also shows that these Wall Street brokers also engaged in orgies, so a few lemon parties come up.That said, some of the sex scenes were very extreme and could have been cut. Like the F words, I didn't exactly need ALL the orgy scenes to understand that these men enjoyed orgies.Also, BE WARNED, 2 minutes in Jordan blows cocaine off a prositutes's colon to arouse her, and he slaps her butt to make her moan. I could have gone my whole life without knowing that was a thing!On top of that, this is minor, but there were some editing mistakes as well. When Donnie and Jordan first meet, there is a moment where Jordan speaks but his mouth doesn't move. In the scene where Jordan and Naomi (Wife #2) fight about getting a divorce, Jordan goes from pantless to sweatpants in seconds.Finally, there was some sexist stuff that I didn't like. Women show more nudity than the men in the orgies, and in one scene, Donnie tells a woman that he can tell her what to do because she has his money taped to her boobs. Women are mostly just objects in the movie. I thought that was pretty rude, and I'm a man.Despite these minor flaws- making this short of being one of Scorsese's finest works, I actually enjoyed seeing it a second time. The Wolf of Wall Street is NOT for minors or the easily offended, but it's a thrilling and wild ride for everyone else.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Mixed Bag,"First, DeCaprio is magnificent and it was nice to see Rob Reiner again, in a ""meaty"" role (no pun intended). Not knowing much about Belfort before the film, it was educational and at the same time quite unbelievable, but then these people are genuinely larger than life.I soon became quite tired of the constant use of the ""f-word""--not surprised to read in the Trivia section that this movie ranks second for the most use of that word. That, along with so much nudity and fornication (NONE of it was ""making love"") was a real distraction from the story.There is also a lot of drug use, and I CAN believe that went on, but I was uncomfortable that so many people in the theater laughed throughout the segment when Jordan and Donnie get dangerously high. I don't think Sorcese's intent was comedy at that point, but I could be wrong.I think this could have been an excellent movie with a little more depth and a lot less f---ing. Women are portrayed poorly, and we see very little of the damage done to personal relationships in the wake of the greedy climb to the top. Leo deserves an Oscar nod but the film itself needs to go under the (editing) knife.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Fantastically Written, Directed, and Acted","This movie has a pretty lengthy run time of 3 hours, but even after it's over it still leaves you wanting more from the film. The movie makes the viewer feel so many emotions and engage with the story and characters, this movie makes you feel uncomfortable and disgusted at times because it's acted so well. The movies is also surprisingly funny at times even for it's very serious topics. Some of the scenes in the movie can be pretty hard to watch because of how real and raw they feel whether it's doing drugs or even abuse, but these scenes also contribute to what makes this movie so great. A timeless classic and definitely one of if not the best Leonardo DiCaprio films and performances.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
What we allow,"Okay, let's try from the start to escape the whole debate raging about this and find our way back to the crux of the thing. This should be a way of life, swim through swathes of unnecessary noise so we can gleam the fact that cuts through and illuminates.We have not figured life and death after all, it shouldn't be so easy to say anything about this man one way or the other. To show this, we need to find a human moment in the film, pluck it from the fabric and pose to ourselves the question. For me it's this: at one point the protagonist, a Wall Street scam artist, has been invited up to the apartment of a sexy blonde and contemplates sleeping with her or going back to his wife and rich, comfortable life, when she steps out naked. No one has to know, it is there for the taking. What do you do?This is the whole thing right there. What if you could pick up a phone and make boatloads of money as easily as he could sleep with that girl, and you never have to know, no one has to know, where they have been torn form? That's not to say there can be no answer, we just can't pretend it's an easy one that one way or the other wouldn't keep us up at night.The film is this sale made to us. It has to be convincing, every sale does. It has to lure us with the appeal, all that partying. We see that it's easy when you don't have to know, when the knowing is at an abstract distance, but the good life can be enjoyed today. We would like it to be this way perhaps. The film ends with the man making this sale to an audience eager to learn the trick.It falls on us to see that it's a scam. This is not because eventually he pays dearly for it with all he had, because even in the end he has it pretty easy. The real Belfort spent an obscenely lenient 22 months in prison and is out now giving pep talks on strategy. This shows that we have built a system as fundamentally ignorant as the man himself: common burglary without prior record gets you 2-4 years for stealing pennies to Belfort's dollars, because in Belfort's case it is a subtler manipulation at that abstract distance.It's a scam because it trades all that ferocious spending of time and energy and gives no real happiness back, and it can only be deeply apparent as such when we have to swim to that realization against the current of self who is entertained by the partying.No mistake, Scorsese gambled here more than say, Goodfellas.He lost, because the choice of topic demands most of the artistry goes on this side of the telephone and the overkill of meaningless partying sticks much more than the glimpse of his daughter's face as she watches him stoned out of his mind. It is all of course adapted from a book by Belfort himself on that life, the unreliability is signaled early with the car switching colors to the narrator's whim.There's one masterful moment I will carry with me though, because it casts light on a more ambiguous human nature, and this is the crux of the thing. How can I become the person that will make me and others happy? Money isn't the answer of course, we see that it merely substitutes the anxiety of not having with a different set. But it cannot have anything to do with simply sticking to principle either, any more than expounding on gravity can make you a good skier.The moment is when Belfort and his friend are both stoned in his place to near incapacity, his friend is choking to death and a Popeye cartoon is playing on TV. It's all there so clearly, cutting through right and wrong. What happens there? An image that pops up and surrounds that incapacitated self, drawing him out of his stupor to do something for someone else. It couldn't work if the urge wasn't there, and if the image did not inspire that self to become a person worthy of the story. This is not poetry but how the mind works, we are the thoughts we allow. This is to see the desire for the girl or money palpably rise in front of us, instead of at a distance. Still no easy answer, but now we're on to something.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

An insight into the mentality of the finance industry,"Welcome to the world of unadulterated greed and decadence. The premise of this movie, is 'if you are part of a multi-billion dollar industry that produces nothing, why bother with moral values?'Jordan started from nothing and became a multimillionaire. He defeated the odds, bent the rules and made it big. However, with success he grew even more greedy and nothing was enough. To overcome his urges he needed to binge on drugs and sex in order to cope.The film is a satire and we observe a man who has it all, yet nothing. Rich yet nothing more than a common junkie. The quest for more and more is never ending and he has to resort to even bigger risks, more law breaking in order to somehow tame his insatiable appetite for more wealth.The intelligent, witty individual will initially gain our sympathy and liking but soon he is nothing more than a pathetic figure.This delightful film is ultimately an insight into the world and mind frame of finance and given that it is people like Jordan that caused the crisis the world is currently in, we better take a good look in order to decide how to deal with such attitudes especially when they are so influential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Read the following sentence to know all the movie is about,"It's about sex, drugs, and money. That's it. No really that's it. Pretty much nothing happens in between.

If you want to watch a movie to get some sort of vicarious good feeling out of watching a character do what you wish you could then this is your thing. Otherwise, it's pretty much a three hour waste of time. This is no Wall Street 1987, or American Psycho.

I Enjoyed Most of It,"The varied reviews of this movie with rating from 1 to 10, from garbage to Oscare nominee and best of Scorsese, amused me, and I have to say I found some truth in most of them.

A lot of the naysayers say that the movie glorified the excesses of drugs, women, money and just about everything that can be abused. I wouldn't say that it glorifies it but rather that it presents a pretty honest view of how these times in the market were. I loved DiCaprio in this role. He doesn't play a lot of characters that are just completely unlikable and here is no exception, the charisma and charm of Jordan Belfort is played well here, but it also shows the fall that ultimately come from the deceit.If you ever saw the movie Boiler Room, with Giovanni Ribisi, then you know the basic plot and what Boiler Rooms are. Wolf is tremendously better written, directed and acted, but the general plot is the same.In the end I enjoyed this movie, though I think 30 minutes or so more editing to get the movie down to a more reasonable 2 1/2 hours, would have helped.

brilliantly acted and directed; not for sensitive viewers,"This is a superb film, but it definitely deserves it's 18 rating; it is gratuitous, the language is very ""colourful"" and there is a lot of nudity and drug use-a-plenty. Usually I'd not particularly go for a film like that but it is a biopic and based on the book by Jordan Belfort (played by DiCaprio). It's a man gets super-rich by nefarious means and goes a bit crazy kind of film; women, drugs, big boy-toys and all the trappings of the nouveaux riche, and then his downfall. It's a sort of morality tale, his lifestyle is meant to be seen as depraved and excessive (in a bad way) not admirable and the Director (Scorsese) and the writers make that clear as Belfort (and the other men too) unravels.DiCaprio and Hill were superb; DiCaprio was horribly good and Hill has in one film jumped his way up from a comedian to a serious character actor. It has, however, a good lot of humour as well as stressful points and also scenes in which you are incredulous. For all the nudity and sexual content, it isn't titillating just bawdy and sordid. It still astounds me that men behave in that way - Boiler Room's extended cut had a few similar scenes but not so bad as this. Boiler Room is actually a good comparison for plot although - as I said - Wolf of Wall Street is way more over the top. For all the scenes where you think ""oh goodness I shouldn't be watching this,"" there are plenty where the actors show their grit and the Direction is so superb. It is the sort of film where you almost forget you are watching a film, you are so engrossed and just ""there"" absorbed in the action. I did think it was a bit too long in terms of duration, some of the scenes went on a bit, and certainly the debauchery was too much. Yes it was a (watered down, apparently!) telling of a life story but the viewer doesn't need everything spelled out. Jordan Belfort was played as a horrible man who got his just desserts but that didn't detract from the humour and superior production of this film. I would be very careful who I recommended it to given it's content, certainly NOT those of delicate dispositions or under eighteens. Brilliant film though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Not La Dolce Vita,"The emperor's new clothes, the elephant in the middle of the living room, whatever you want to call it, but the uncomfortable truth must finally be faced--the DiCaprio-Scorsese teaming has never been all that cinematically, and WWS is no exception. It would be a fool's errand to point fingers, saying who's to blame, etc. Who can say? And it hasn't all been mediocre. The Departed was to die for--but there was a lot more than Leo. Shutter Island was grand. And it isn't that pre-Leo Scorsese didn't have his egregious stumbles--think the all-star teaming in Casino. But Gangs, Aviator, and now this film, are all terrific demonstrations of something that doesn't work--brilliant filmmaking surrounding so-so acting and a very so-so script. In WWS, we have exquisitely filmed excess that must be leading to some big moral revelation because otherwise why have such a gargantuan build up, no? But not really. Dolce Vita this is not, and yet one feels that Scorsese, like Fellini, wants to go there with this material. We even get a tiny tribute to La Strada in the bedroom scene when Belfort's wife keeps provoking him by throwing water in his face. But it ends up being more of a throwaway--like many scenes in the film. You wonder whether some offscreen financier was occasionally slapping Scorsese on the hand, saying, ""More spring break, more spring break."" Like Casino, it's a series of funny, opulent, overly long scenes strung together chronologically than a real drama with complications experienced by a main character undergoing a moral struggle. Its sexual situations and language are also surprisingly frank given that's it's a mainstream film, but this may just be part of the pornographication of mainstream life. The fatiguing amount of drug use and drunken sex, Belfort's inability to experience anything without being high--all of this seems to be leading somewhere. In the middle of a storm at sea, while Belfort's helicopter is getting swept off the deck of his yacht, Jonah Hill is ordered to go below deck to get the quaaludes out of the flooded stateroom. That's a pretty meaningful action. And it required some heavy duty filming. But nothing really comes of it. Weird. It's easy to suppose that this a vision of a lower-middle class character becoming corrupted by the excesses of the '80s. But the guy is such an empty vessel to begin with that you really only end up with empty vessel + drugs + booze + sex. You can't even say he's a hypocrite because he never stood for anything to begin with. Surely there was more to this guy than that. When the Lemonheads' version of Mrs. Robinson plays you get that a feeling of complete spiritual emptiness. But that passes quickly because the film is so overbusy and needs to bounce to the next outrageous situation. It's a highly watchable film in a voyeuristic way, but even then it has so much Leo narration that fully admits to the insanity of what's going on that you never even get the chance to feel dirty from peeping Tom-ism. He is very reliable narrator, so there's very little irony. There's not that much to actually say about the film because it doesn't say that much. The only reason it gets this much ink is because this is the director of Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, etc. These are major movies. But this is more Scarface meets the Hangover. It's a guy's film, make no doubt it. No woman is going to like it because it revels in the adolescent antics of grown up men that women find repulsive.

Very good at being fun and serious at the same time. It's almost like a dark comedy mixed in with a really gritty and crazy biographical drama.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Fantastic,"With some fantastic acting, clever writing, and as always brilliant direction from Scorsese, The Wolf of Wall Street shines. Leonardo DiCaprio leads an all out cast in one of, if not, the best performance of his career. Jonah Hill also gives a fantastic performance, as well as Margot Robbie and even smally from Matthew McConaughey. The film is shot with great style and care, and there is no doubt it is one of the best crafted films of the decade. The film is full of humor, heartbreak, and can be at times surprisingly exciting. The film does seem to go on a bit too long for certain scenes, but even with the 3 hour runtime, the film is still able to be massively entertaining. Shining with every frame and taking action every chance it gets. In the end, The Wolf of Wall Street may be a long journey to sit through, but it is far more than worth it. It bubbles with atmosphere and excitement. It's funny, entertaining, and by all means an absolute blast.

Hide your wallet is the moral of this story,"These guys can sell sand to the Arabs. Scorcese, DiCaprio and have you seen the videos of Belfort doing seminars in NZ years later? These guys are masters of their game. The subject matter seems improbable yet it ain't. The whole thing is hilarious and along with Marty's other master works, this is going to always be way up there. There's just so much mischief going on, on so many levels. This is the stuff of fairy tales on steroids ... or cocaine as is the case here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A good movie for family viewing,"From a biographical point of view, the film avoids glorifying or denigrating the nefarious lifestyle and illegal activities of former stockbroker Jordan Belfort. His character is reminiscent of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho as the cunning businessman. However, the excessive amount of salacious antics paint a sensationalist picture of white-collar crime, serving as an Achilles' heel for credible portrayal. This criticism does not invalidate my interpretation of The Wolf of Wall Street as a cautionary tale of the pursuit of power and greed at the expense of ethics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One of the most masterfully directed and at the same time pleasant film,"The wolf of wall street is a fantastic film beacause of the incredible quality of directing,storytelling,acting and cinematography.Scorsese uses amazing directing techniques that takes the movie into a new other level.Dicaprio is extraordinary as well and he may have show one of the best performances of his career.Jona hill was also excellent and proved that he has a strong name in hollywood.The only disadvantage was the fact that it had an excessive use of drugs in a way that made them look desirable without outlining their repercussions.In genera i have to say it is one of the best comedies i have ever seen but i would recommend it to more mature viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Maddeningly Ferocious Genre Of Cinema. ♦ 70%,"This is not black comedy, this is utter boldness. It climbs on your body and takes hold of your whole damn face and then barks on your ears, flashes on your eyes & talks sitting on your mouth. This is cinema at its most vulnerable phase, harnessed to tell a story which cannot be told in any other possibly charismatic way.Martin Scorsese has fascinated me with his themes and not his works themselves; he finds details in the simplest story & barfs it into hell of a script. With The Wolf..., he does the same. Telling a story was not enough, so he extrapolates. The life & times of a maverick stockbroker told from all points of view. There is nudity, sex, drugs, porn, society, money, business, animals, wild human beings and genius. 3 hours of maddeningly extraordinary tale of a person concludes to a magnificent climax and that is what I loved about it the most, the climax.The performances are immense and intense. Leonardo DiCaprio is hands down, a phenomenal actor. Jonah Hill has catapulted his power & career to the space. Supporting cast is excellent. The music is good but I am not happy with the editing, which could've been more tight had they given attention to the post-processing.But, the question is do we need such hybrid boldness to depict something so simple? It solely depends on the watcher. I for one got bored at some point in the film with all the shenanigans the mischief machines do during the second half, but the humor kept me hanging there. It also is factor to consider that when you observe closely, it talks nothing new as such. So, with a brilliant screenplay, what does it achieve? Maybe send a message? Nope. The message is already conveyed by some other movie. All it does is imbibe audacity into the themes of power, money, corruption & sex. But I appreciate what the makers have done to give respect to the talent of Jordan Belfort.BOTTOM LINE: Everyone should give this a try & think for themselves how it can be analyzed as a cinema & where it stands aesthetically & culturally. For movie buffs, this is a good 3-hour noon show. Nothing more.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO (It has all the things Indian parents don't approve of; so it'd be better if you don't even utter the title of the film. It is also the film with most use of the F word, FYI.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Very long, but consistent and good","This is a pretty good movie, simply because I've not seen many like it, and what it offers is a good mix of raunchy comedy, and business crime. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a charming and cool character and Jonah Hill fits in really well as his buddy among the rest of the crew that you will see in the movie. Still, it doesn't score too high simply because of how long it is and its extreme over reliance on debauchery to try and balance the length. It's as if the screenwriters were so scared of people falling asleep that they had to stuff in as many bare tits to keep the crowd attentive. I get it, it's a long film, but come on.Wondering if it's worth watching? If you are here for Scorsese, go ahead and watch it. I think it's one of his best. If you are here specifically for a business drama, watch it. If you are here for Leonardo DiCaprio and/or Jonah Hill, watch it. If you are here for anything else, then you will probably not enjoy it too much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
No spoilers because there are no surprises,"To say I hated this film would be an understatement. I knew little about it, other than reading a review in Empire magazine a couple of days before. Approximately one hour in, I went and retrieved the magazine to read the review again because I could see no resemblance on screen to the reviewer's glowing praise on the page.Here I must admit to being female, and also totally appalled at the misogynistic, vile portrayal of just about every woman in this film. The only one that isn't pawed over, stripped and slapped about like a piece of meat is Jordan's first wife, but she is lied to, sidelined, betrayed and dropped as though she never meant a thing. The new wife that replaces her gets a 5 minute courtship, a honeymoon period of approximately the same duration, and is then firmly placed on the humiliation conveyor belt.As for the legions of whores and other apparently inconsequential women, just about every scene is filled with their degradation. Not even key colleagues get any respect, as one scene determinedly shows the only woman at work to be named down on her knees in a glass lift with her face firmly stuck to the front of some moron's flies.Yes, I am sure that being a woman has coloured my view of how women are portrayed in this film (and yes, the Empire reviewer was a man) but I notice I am not alone in being disgusted by the over-the-top porn and sheer vileness of behaviour that is revelled in and served up for what I am assured in other reviews is 2.1/2 hours. I probably lasted just over an hour before I gave up. Gave up hoping for any kind of story, gave up hoping for different characters instead of the same character assigned to just about every actor on screen. Gave up hoping that somebody, ANYBODY of the opposite sex might actually be treated fairly, even for half a minute.Where was the story? What was this about? What was the effect on the victims that were sold useless penny stocks? No, they don't feature either as the film relentlessly focuses on the bullies and morons that relieve them of their hard-earned cash with no glimpse of the consequences. When these heroes stop their carousing it is only to have pointless gibbering conversations about nothing which just serve to delay the orgies momentarily. Nothing is said that advances the story as the only story here is sex, drugs and exploitation. It is the pornographic equivalent of an evening looking at someone's boring holiday photos.There is zero progression, zero development, and - as far as I am concerned - zero interest in actually telling a story and entertaining the audience, just a determination to portray every excess known to man for no reason or purpose. Who cares if the real Jordan did any of this? I kept waiting for Vince Vaughn to show up as it was more like one of his puerile comedies than an Oscar-nominated film.I am old enough to have worked in a corporate environment in the City of London during the 80s. Yes the place was awash with money, but every woman was not treated like an expendable whore. Shame on Scorsese and all involved. I am no shrinking violet but so much emphasis on misogynistic, negative behaviour means little or no emphasis on anything else that could have made this a worthwhile film to watch. Ultimately it has nothing to say except F U, and does nothing but relieve the public of its entrance money with little return (true to its subject matter in that respect).This morning I watched District 9 which I had recorded on a whim and also knew nothing about. A film with plenty of heart, made on a tiny fraction of the budget blown on The Wolf of Wall Street, and to much greater effect. No prizes for guessing which of these films I would recommend.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Not funny enough, and not serious enough. A mess.","I'm a fan of crude--I've got no problems with nudity, sex, drug use, foul language, etc. But this movie tried to be two things and failed at both. It's listed and well reviewed as a comedy, but it's not very funny. It tries too hard because it's simply not witty, almost throughout. The writer, Terrence Winter's funniest contributions to culture were Sister, Sister and Xena: Warrior Princess (4 episodes combined). That's fail #1.The attempt at being a cautionary tale is fail #2. Most people walked away amused, maybe disgusted. But who walked away with any genuine anger or sadness after this movie? Maybe a handful of people. The duped investors, and society at large are the victims of the crimes shown on screen, but you never see them, never feel their pain. There isn't even a character to develop on screen in that respect.I would've rather they'd gone all out with glorifying the crimes on screen, with actual funny dialogue and creative scenarios--that would've require another writer for sure. I would've been thrilled by that. But this movie wasn't funny, and it wasn't cautionary either. It was just a hyped up mess of a movie.This was a painted up trollop version of Boiler Room.

Do not watch till you read this,"I would not write a review this long for free unless it was worth it. This is a movie where the lethal formula of Scorsese & DiCaprio takes the movie industry to an entire new level. A movie that makes you wish the bad guy wins at every scene. It is a perfect blend of thrill, comedy, politics, lust and social criticism, not much drama though.PROS:DiCaprio & Scorsese are top actor & director, video & sound effects are amazing, girls acting are incredibly beautiful, plot is genius, comedy is genuine and very funny. CONS:movie promotes the idea that drugs has more pros than cons therefore be careful with youth watching, overuse of foul language, too much sex scenes, the gay butler part is unnecessarily added and in my opinion should have been taken out as it will not affect the plot or the message the movie tries to deliver.

Entertaining comic celebration of the worst of human behaviour rather than any form of  condemnation.,"A former Wall Street broker realises that pumping junk (penny) stock is very lucrative and turns a small cottage industry into something a lot bigger. Soon crossing white lines even he can see.I am generally a fan of Martin Scorsese to the point of often wanting to watch his movies more than once. Sometimes even owning. He has made some fantastic films giving some real depth and insight into off-beats, street people and criminals. There isn't a director working today who he hasn't educated. Indeed quality hard-edged TV shows like The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire are almost based on his templates, look and ideas.(Can you imagine these shows even being made if he had died at birth?)And yet, and yet, the man has a serious flaw: he struggles to be moral. On film at least. He seems on the side of the conman, the crook and the mafioso. The Joe Public who get crushed under their mighty wheels are of little interest to him. Comedy fodder. Police/law enforcement who stop them (or at least try) dull and low paid. Sometimes corrupt, inefficient and devious. At other times ignored completely or treated as last-reel extras.Here he brings all his faults to the table and then some. Indeed almost seems to be underlining them. The FBI are full of subway riding drones in cheap brown suits and non matching ties.. Dry humoured nasty people who want to end the party (all bought with stolen money) early. There only advantage - over their quarry - being not risking sleeping six inches from a toilet seat.Although few have noticed, this film has been shot before as ""Boiler Room."" A passable Vin Diesel number. So little has this film being seen that some scenes are almost copies of it! Indeed copies with a bit bigger budget. When you have the budget the camera can swoop and roll through a million extras - all acting their little socks off. Here everyone acts like they are on The Price is Right, even when they are work!(Do the tits-out extras get extra pay? Hope so. Humiliation should come with compensation.)Excess? I can spot it in small doses. It doesn't need to be repeated over and over again until I wonder if I have sat on the remote control and jumped back two chapters. Voice-over too. In case you have gone blind during the movie. It stops just short of flashing subtitles pointing out that what we are watching is immoral or illegal.But wait and hold on, it does entertain and does make you laugh. Guilty laughs, but laughs (of the out-loud variety) are not common with me. A lot of it is probably true as well. Or true-ish. Clearly MS doesn't know how a helicopter is actually flown, so why not employ somebody who does?DiCaprio is very good in the central role of Jordan Belfort. Best acting yet and let's be frank his face has been his fortune so far. Clearly over-the-top and silly at times, but some real acting wrinkles. It is not him on the stunts though, the double is too tall to be him and even in the ""daring"" sex scenes we never see candle wax on his back. Only that of the double.I love Jonah Hill (Donnie in the the film). He is a brilliant comic actor. He just has it. Never afraid to make a fool of himself, he does a wonderful performance as best friend and co-conspirator. Not consistent though, stupid one minute smart the next. I wonder if he is going to go down the Jack Black route and get his own vehicles? Second wife Naomi (played by Aussie Margot Robbie) is hot in a Playboy way and seems appropriate for the role, but you don't like her character much. Just another spoilt mercenary happy to join the bandwagon without asking too many questions. Unlike his first (screen) wife. Whether Robbie is going on to anything else is open to question. Probably turn up in costume in one of those superhero movies they are always making. Has the build for it.In the old 40's Warner Brothers days the film ended with the crook dead or in jail. Here there is another scene to underline the bit about Scorsese being basically immoral. And maybe so if the audience if the IMDb rating is correct. Maybe we are all going to hell laughing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen in 40 Years,"8.2 Rating for this tripe? Wow, did the sheep get caught in the echo chamber and herd for this one! They heard, ""Oh Scorcese! Oh Leo DiCaprio! Oh Jonas Hill!"" and they all fell for it! Haha! Suckers! They got sucked into it just like Jordan Belforte sucked all his clients in! That's the only thing funny about this garbage.And please, don't try to pretentiously turn this movie into some kind of moral message, or some kind of hipster perspective on it because there is nothing deep, profound, or any message about it.Looking back on it, this is one of the most insulting films I've ever seen, and not because of the adult content at all, but because it was really a bad movie. The only part I even remember was DiCaprio high on Quaaludes and having a hard time crawling out of his car and up or down the stairs- that was actually funny to see, but that's it. Sure Robbie spreads her legs in the skirt, woopedy doo, nice meme for the vapid millennial generation.Everything else was pure garbage. And another thing: DiCaprio looks nothing like Belforte. Belforte has an alpha male suave about him when this was going on in real life, while DiCaprio is just playing DiCaprio, and I didn't believe for a minute he was capable of being in charge at that corporation. This whole thing is awful.If you want to see a more subtle and intellectual take on the very important topic, then just watch the far superior ""Boiler Room"" with Giovanni Rabese, Vin Diesel, and those guys from around 2000. It is much more intelligently made and still portrays all of the same material, but just with a little more realism and subtlety.It should be in the Bottom 100 worst movies ever made!1.5/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
On par with Goodfellas!,"Scorsese has created goodfellas of the new generation. It's his longest film but it's never boring, and this movie's shockingly very hilarious. For me, Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better in a film before. The screenplay by Sopranos' Terence Winter was perfect in every way. As a conclusion, this movie is full 3 hour of enjoyment, minute by minute, and it's definitely better than another Scorses's classic Casino. Whether or not this movie is better than Goodfellas I'm not sure yet, but Goodfellas is one of the best movies EVER MADE, and this movie's on the same level to that. In 71years old, Martin Scorsese's surely back on that level, that's how incredible he is.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Brilliant, hilarious and so much more","Scorsese and DiCaprio is almost impossible to fail, but here it's at it's absolute best!

It has all the usual style and elegance of Scorsese and well.. the movie is hilarious! Especially the scene where he lost his senses and had to stop his friend from talking to the phone was so amazing i almost choked laughing! Jordan's descend into madness, greed and addiction is shown in a hilarious way, without however overromantisising his hideous lifestyle as many claim, since his actions have direct consequences, and ultimately lead to his downfall. The only reason i don't give this movie a 10 is because i believe it drags on for a bit too long, and at one point it might be a bit too excessive.

Sounds like every other conman/Ponzi scheme operator in history, right? Well it is and we don't hold them up as heroes.Hard to watch this and not think about the misery he caused just so he could beat his chest and buy another exotic sports car.Watch as a cautionary tail of a lifestyle still lead by many wall street masters of the universe and yes can't deny it is very well put together film, it is only the subject matter that is questionable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The dream-life of the criminal and irresponsible,"Jordan Belfort (played by Di Caprio) wants to make money as quickly as possible and decides to pursue the fast track by selling hot air, otherwise known as stock trading. He also likes getting high on drugs and prostitutes (sort of comes with the territory). Therefore, we are ""force-fed"" lots of orgies scenes, even if I got the point after the first one.There is also a sort of love story gone sour mixed into the decadent life-style, but it won't break anybody's hearts. In fact, hearts are the accessory nobody needs in this movie.I had read some reviews mentioning how OTT this was, but they were not even close to reality. Told in a manic and repetitive style, this is the lurid tale of a disgusting, greedy, criminal ass**le and his equally despicable, moronic friends. In other words, Scorsese did a re-take of Goodfellas, moving from the mafia environment to Wall Street. I suppose this is to prove that all men are equally corrupted and disgusting, regardless of the environment... which is a rather depressing view of society (regardless of the orgies).Half-way through, I started to feel nauseated by the overblown and endless sequence of shouted profanities, illegal deals and all sorts of wild parties, inclusive of one guy masturbating at the sight of Jordan soon-to-be second wife. Even if I know that the Academy's standards are very low, I was surprised to see that a movie with a guy jerking off was considered Oscar material.Final note: even my male companion got fed up one hour into this, to prove that not every man is actually like Scorsese is repeatedly showing us.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Great acting but terrible editing,"An hour and a half in, I couldn't believe how bored I was. Sex, drugs, general debauchery, yes, we get it. Maybe if you're going after the 18-24 male demographic it makes sense, but for people wanting a film with a plot line, it is excessive. A half hour would have gotten the point across just as well. Had we not known it was up for an Oscar, we might have just walked out at that point, but we figured that it must improve at some point. Right after my husband and I were whispering about how shockingly bored we were, the plot line finally moved on, and it was OK from there. The acting is all first-rate. Can't believe that it is up for an Oscar though; it's a good hour too long.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The sickness of excesses,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a great movie, with some excellent acting performances (DiCaprio in particular gives one of the best acting piece of his career), a perfect direction from Scorsese and very well made in general. The story is about Jordan Belfort, a broker which becomes rich and starts to live by excesses. This film is indeed a critic to this lifestyle, which is shown attractive and satisfactory at first, but it destroys who live this way and their families and friends with the passing of time. The movie makes a great job conveying a nauseating feeling through the noumerous scenes about drugs, alcohol and sex which are excessive and make fun of this people.
The only criticism I have is that I found is it a bit too long. This length is justified by the willingness to tell the story of Jordan Belfort without rushing anything but I felt like something could be cut, like 15-20 minutes, but it's not a big deal because the film is well made. And also a little thing about the editing: there is a scene near the 20 minutes mark in which it is so bad beacuse two characters are talking to each other and everytime the camera changes to frame the other its position is different and it is confusing. Fortunately it lasts like one minute.

I can't believe this didn't win any of the 5 Oscars!,"My review 1,899 is a great gold of a movie! Glorious cast, brilliant business writing, meme worthy/award worthy, awesome soundtrack, and multiple levels of the deadly sins. Martin Scorsese is masterclass at making dramas. Leonardo DiCaprio is great at choosing the best roles one of the few actors that perfects most of his career. For a story about stocks this is one of the best with all the other aspects mashed quite well. The buildup to the a mass of rich men is so good anyone would want that life. One of few occasions where 3 hours is smooth great length. I love the pervasive language and madness in this wild movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Incredulous,"DiCaprio really embodied his character well, as he does with all his movies. He became Belfort so much so, that my friends and I were questioning if he was like that in real life. The rest of the cast too, did well in portraying their characters and displaying the kind of people who are in Wall Street. The chemistry they had with each other was good, and felt more like a club than a company.The film is quite explicit and both promotes the American dream and depicts women as objects. Perhaps as this is a biopic, it actually did happen, but I felt it was not at all necessary for the show to have nude women in it. And many instances of it too. Plus, the amount of sex scenes and orgies showed is probably the most I've seen in any movie. It does add to the understanding of the characteristic of the environment, and of Belfort's character, but I'm not so sure if multiple and frequent depictions were necessary (this could have also shortened the length of the film).Additionally, I was quite surprised to see the breaking of the fourth wall. It's intriguing to me that it did this so well. Apart from the first time it occurred, the other instances aren't as jarring, and managed to keep me invested in the story of the narrative. As well, it didn't feel awkward. This was perhaps because of the fast pace of the film. As in the Experimenter, the breaking of the fourth wall was very awkward and didn't feel right.Overall, I'm not exactly sure how true this film is in depicting the actual life events of Jordan Belfort, but it definitely gave it a worthy try. The directing and editing is well done in establishing this fast-paced life of the Wall Street wolf, and the actors did a great job at portraying their characters. However, the film was about an hour too long, and had too much nudity. It also seemed to be slightly portraying this lifestyle as glamorous.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Best Scorsese-DiCaprio Film To Date,"A downright hilarious, unabashedly entertaining & riotously fun ride that presents both Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio in prime form, The Wolf of Wall Street is a masterly directed, sharply scripted & expertly acted biopic that chronicles the remarkable journey of Jordan Belfort from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption & federal government.Stylishly directed by Scorsese in what's his 5th collaboration with DiCaprio, this is arguably his best film to date and certainly the most enjoyable of them all. A tale of debauchery that's consistently high on money, parties, sex & drugs, the picture is gripping from the get go and sustains its manic energy & irreverent humour for most of its runtime but what keeps it alive is the auteur's assured craftsmanship.Further uplifting the viewing experience is the excellent production design, sharp camerawork, neat editing, breakneck pace, fab costumes, dynamic score & stellar performances. Leading from the front is DiCaprio who utilises every bit of his on-screen charisma & acting prowess to deliver his career-best work. Jonah Hill is a revelation too, playing Belfort's sidekick with elan. And they are well supported by the rest of the cast.Overall, The Wolf of Wall Street is an endlessly funny & deliberately unrestrained exercise in excess that promises 3 hours of non-stop extravaganza and finds both the master & his protégé delivering on all fronts. An infectious & intoxicating film that's high & hyper from its opening moments yet continues to snort more white powder every 5 mins, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the finest films of its year, one of the best examples of its kind, and certainly the most memorable one from Scorsese & DiCaprio so far.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Greedy Wolf,"Arguably one of Scorsese's best to date. The film examines individuals consumed by the want of money and the richness it brings. In this case the richness that is depleted from humanity. DiCaprio portays the most narcissistic character this viewer has ever witnessed on the silver screen. It's astonishing that it's based on true events. The film tells the story of Jordan Belfort who starts his own brokerage firm and bilks his investors out of millions of dollars with an idea that started with penny stocks. He starts the firm with his cronies that follow him from his beginning and their loyalty is unflappable. This proves to be crucial when Belfort's rags to riches meteoric rise catches the eye of a dogged SEC agent. He is on to Belfort and is hell bent on taking him down. While Belfort's lifestyle of debauchery and belief of being untouchable continues the agent is closing in. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it is virtually impossible to pick a favorite. Excellent direction, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography, costume, editing and acting. All of the artists involved deliver superlative performances. DiCaprio, Hill, Chandler and Robbie stand out. However it is DiCaprio who is commanding and mesmerizing. The plot is outrageous, uproarious, insightful, explorative, ingenious, sublime, intelligent, duplicitous, captivating, poetic and has a cathartic ending. To this day you'll hear fans of this film quote such famous lines as Belfort's, ""Sell me this pen"". This a a timeless masterpiece and remains one of the very best in it's genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Wild and Exhilarating Ride through Greed and Excess,"Wolf of Wall Street is a movie that took me on an emotional rollercoaster, making me laugh, cringe, and reflect on the sheer decadence and moral ambiguity of the era it portrays. Directed by the legendary Martin Scorsese and starring the captivating Leonardo DiCaprio, the film plunges us into the life of Jordan Belfort, a young, ambitious stockbroker whose hunger for success leads him down a path of excess, corruption, and debauchery.As I watched the film, I couldn't help but be drawn in by DiCaprio's magnetic performance as Belfort. He fully embodies the character's charisma, ruthlessness, and vulnerability, making it nearly impossible to look away. The supporting cast, including Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, also shines, adding layers of depth and complexity to the story.The narrative moves at breakneck speed, whisking me through the highs and lows of Belfort's life with equal parts humor and drama. Scorsese's expert direction ensures that the film never loses its momentum, even with a lengthy runtime. The pulsating soundtrack perfectly complements the movie's tone, adding to the sense of exhilaration and chaos.As I watched Belfort and his associates revel in their debauchery and criminal activities, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of fascination and repulsion. The film is unapologetic in its portrayal of these events, offering a raw and honest look at the dark side of the American dream. While some may argue that the movie glamorizes this lifestyle, I believe it serves as a powerful cautionary tale about the corrupting nature of greed and unchecked ambition.In the end, Wolf of Wall Street left me feeling both entertained and introspective. With its stellar performances, captivating story, and Scorsese's masterful touch, this film offers a unique and unforgettable cinematic experience that speaks to the human condition and the limits of our moral compass.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Energetic, Fast Passed and Indulgent: A Film on Drugs","The Wolf of Wall Street goes for three hours but by the end of the film it only feels like its gone for two. Martin Scorsese presents the audience with the fast paced, energetic, drug and sex fueled rise and fall of Jordan Belfort the wealthy stock broker who made millions off scamming people out of their money. Scorsese uses the movement of the camera, fast edits, snappy dialogue and the excess of Jordan's life including naked women, drugs and money to hook the audience into this world of indulgence. It fully emerges you into Jordan's world and shows just what exactly Jordan would do with his scammed millions. Leonardo DiCaprio brings a stellar performance as the drug fueled Belfort with him being calm and cocky for the most part until he doesn't get something his way or has a little to much of his drugs (the quaaludes scene being especially memorable) . The rest of their cast holds their own with Margot Robbie and Jonah Hill bringing their A game to the film with Robbie playing the no nonsense Naomi who stands her ground against Jordan and Jonah Hill as Donnie, Jordan right hand man.

good,"Jordan Belfort and whatever is left of his partners from business firm Stratton Oakmont turned into the very meaning of abundance and revelry, their workplaces an engine compartment filled by cocaine and voracity. High weight deals strategy and not exactly lawful off camera control reared a lot of twenty-something tycoons, and Belfort fabricated himself a realm at the highest point of the store. His ascent and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, in light of the diary of a similar name.Under most conditions, the activities of Belfort and his colleagues (counting Jonah Hill in a howlingly clever turn as Belfort's business accomplice) would be seen as disgustingly detestable, yet Martin Scorsese outlines this story of eagerness with a comedic focal point that permits us to snicker at things we presumably shouldn't discover hilarious. Whether it's an awkward endeavor at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing on Quaaludes, or the order of whores utilizing securities exchange wording (""blue chip"" hookers make you wear a condom and regularly acknowledge Visas), the film is crazy from beginning to end, and once in a while vacillates in its mission to engage the group of onlookers for three hours.Belfort figures out how to misdirect himself and his buddies into supposing they can live like this eternity, yet the gathering of people knows better, and Belfort's possible comeuppance is not really amazing. However, the way is cleared with cleverness, particularly in a scene on board the head honcho's extravagance yacht, where he surreptitiously offers a couple of FBI operators everything from alcohol to young ladies to real money in return for their hush. What's more, we should not overlook his discipline for shakily guiding a helicopter into the terrace of his bequest at 3am, getting under the skin of his trophy spouse (Margot Robbie).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Martin Scorsese has proved his given yet another masterpiece of different genre,"Scorsese The wolf of wall street ""I would wish for any one of my colleagues to have the experience of working with Martin Scorsese once in their lifetime."" These lines are from world famous by legendary actor Daniel Day-Lewis. Martin Scorsese who is famous for his noir films like Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street. He handled many plots, time and social upheaval. Handling a character is his forte. Many directors from US work according to story and then create the character. Scorsese never give importance to story. This revolutionary director who make his film around the character, for him character is the most important factor. Film is about the character and his psychological landscape. His films offer us an exclusive glimpse of society, social scenario and its impact on character's mind. We surrender ourselves to the screen and scream with a character because we never realize when his character becomes our alter ego. The Wolf of Wall Street is a film about Jordan Belfort's memoir. Jordan Belfort who worked as stockbroker and who is convicted for stock market manipulation. He has spent 22 months in prison. Now he works as a motivational speaker. Jordan who was greedy for money and who committed many frauds to experience all his whims and fancies of as a mortal. In this film we find anxiety, emptiness and despair amid the rampage of group hysteria throughout the film. As Scorsese say, ""As you grow older, you change."" These lines come true when we watch films. This film showcases the characters of William Shakespeare's characters from tragedies and comedies. Representative stories of great men and their downfall, facing trial, drugs, daughter get kidnapped, car crash ultimately he become vulnerable. He realizes his self destructive urges. This showing us how the world works, everything comes up with a price. Belfort gets scared once he goes to jail. Thus the Machiavellian Belfort, an anti-hero of late-capitalist finance selling the lure of wealth as an alchemical panacea , may be our equivalent of Richard III or Iago - who also charm us and immobilize our moral instincts by taking us into the confidence of their villainous schemes. Rothstein has much in common with Shylock, hated by his Italian associates as a Jew, and finally incited to self-destruction by a contradictory human passion for family. conceivably the damaged and driven, yet heroic Hughes that Scorsese and DiCaprio showed us resembles Coriolanus - a mother- figure of immense power whose uncontrollable personal demons shape our destiny. We can call it a psychological capitalist epic. It could be compared with Citizen Cain. It is a film with a serious subject when we are living in the time of fast change. 2008 financial collapse of financial world made him make this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Wow! I'm torn.,"Just watched this for a second time after being underwhelmed the first, 8 or so years ago. Ever since I heard so many people say how great it is. Well, it has some great bits that's for sure. The familiarity to Goodfellas is evident from the outset not only the use of narration, but LD comes across very much like Ray Liotta in that film. A man living life on the edge, and very much to the max and not at all legally. All at the expense of many relationships with the women in his life.The film certainly has its laugh out loud moments, and probably deserves being categorized as a comedy, but when you start to realize this film is supposedly autobiographical it makes you wonder whether you should be laughing, or even enjoying this film at all. This man is everything that is wrong with the human race and free market capitalism to boot. Greed and excess over everything else - including his daughter, his wife and his health. It certainly makes you wonder how much embellishment has gone into this tale and in a way I hope a lot. With the office antics on display it really makes it hard to believe that any woman not in the sex industry would work and tolerate being in that environment and that equally applies to the female actors willing to recreate these scenes. The drug use is extreme and I really can't imagine how anyone can function successfully and make that much money while jacked up on so many substances. This Jordan Belfort certainly had a special gift.Acting wise LD dominates, Jonah Hill is great, Margot Robbie looks and portrays Nichole fantastically. I would have liked more from Matthew McC. And more quiet condemnation of what was going on rather than a celebration(somehow) from the director. But if in real life all Jordan got was 4 years then life didn't really condemn him so why should the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Leonardo Dicaprio, one of the most underrated actor in our generation fails yet again to win an Oscar who happens to deliver one of the strongest performances in his entire career. Not once during this film the audience should consider recognising Dicaprio but his convincing character (Jordan Belfort). His performance was intense and impacting, along with Jonah hills improving attempts. The direction of this film was memorising frame buy frame, not one scene was lazy or tedious despite its outrageous runtime, the film successfully sustains focus and confidence. The editing was extraordinary and the films script holds pure brilliance. The film explores the lives of beyond rich stock brokers in wall street during the 80's and their consequences when their obsessions get out of hand this films plot is limited but surprisingly intriguing. Now because this film is directed so magnificently well, I had literally transported myself into the skin of Jordan Belfort and when the film had ended I returned back to my average home feeling the need to blend into the environment of not being rich. The only down side was there were a few unresolved sub plots and not enough character development for the side characters, which made me feel that Jordan Belfort was the absolute centre of attention which is fine but this resulted into the other characters to look like they're worth jack sh*t.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Dramatic irony,"Probably, few people realize that Scorsese really meant drama when he shot this film. Dramatic is the fact that what he shows on the screen is the pure truth. Smart people, people who really create and do something 'ride the subway'. All sorts of sneaky fools who don't even understand how to dispose of a lot of money they earn - on yachts.Scorsese masterfully conveys how pointless and pointless such an existence is. A lot of money and what's next? Gradual transformation into a pig through drugs, booze and girls. Without completing their education, without maturing their soul, these people seriously believe that such an existence is the peak of everyone's dreams in the world. It's both bitter and funny. Moreover, it seems that the very process of making money becomes a kind of drug for such people, because in the end they hint to Belfort - isn't it time for you to stop? But no, because the rest of his life is so empty and muddled that even brokerage activity makes much more sense for him.Scorsese uses a bunch of naked women and perversions, but this is also a kind of trick. A normal person is already sick of this by the end of the film, which, it seems to me, is what the director is trying to achieve.This is not an admiring song dedicated to the 'sweet life'.

A Wild Ride of Excess and Consequences,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic tour de force that thrusts viewers into the unapologetic world of excess, greed, and unbridled hedonism. Martin Scorsese, along with Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performance, delivers a bold and unflinching portrayal of the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street tycoon whose insatiable appetite for wealth leads to both incredible highs and devastating lows.DiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is nothing short of extraordinary. He embodies the charismatic and morally bankrupt character with a level of energy and intensity that is both captivating and repulsive. The actor's chemistry with Jonah Hill, who plays Belfort's eccentric business partner Donnie Azoff, is electric, providing some of the film's most memorable and outrageous moments.Scorsese's direction is masterful, capturing the excesses of the 1980s and 1990s with a frenetic pace and bold visual style. The film's editing, coupled with Thelma Schoonmaker's expertise, creates a relentless and immersive experience that mirrors the chaos of Belfort's life. The use of voiceover narration and breaking the fourth wall adds a unique layer of storytelling that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish.While ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is undeniably entertaining, it doesn't shy away from the moral ambiguity of its characters. The film serves as a scathing critique of the unchecked greed and moral decay within the financial world. It forces the audience to confront the consequences of unchecked ambition and the toll it takes on individuals and society.The supporting cast, including Margot Robbie, Kyle Chandler, and Matthew McConaughey, all deliver standout performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance. Robbie, in particular, brings depth to her character, providing a strong counterpoint to the male-dominated world of high finance.The film's three-hour runtime may seem daunting, but every minute is packed with energy, humor, and biting social commentary. It's a wild and unapologetic ride that leaves a lasting impression, prompting reflection on the excesses of the era and the broader issues of morality and accountability.In conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic spectacle that leaves an indelible mark. Scorsese's direction, coupled with DiCaprio's powerhouse performance, makes it a must-watch for anyone seeking a rollercoaster of emotions, from laughter to discomfort, in a brilliantly crafted narrative.

A True Masterpiece,"Scorsese is always named among one of the great filmmakers...and why shouldn't he be? He's made tons of masterful, acclaimed, and overall classic films. Even his documentaries are amazing (my personal favorite of all his films is actually the concert doc ""The Last Waltz""). He also supports a lot of rare and classic films (just look at his World Cinema project and the two film history documentaries he made, one focusing on Italian cinema and one on American cinema), and, in interviews, expresses his true love for film, which I must admit I share with him.I've seen hundreds of comedy films, and few are nearly as hilarious as this film, and there are few films that are over 2 1/2 hours that are as entertaining and enjoyable as this film.At times it may seem like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" glorifies Jordan Belfort's criminal lifestyle. Well...so what? All of this glorification ultimately ends in darkness. Anybody complaining that the film encourages this lifestyle obviously skipped the last 30 minutes. Trust me when I say the last half hour is extremely intense and emotional, a complete change of tone compared to the rest of the film.And, this last note is to all of the reviewers that like to give films like this 1 star and then title their review ""Disappointing"". Please, lower your expectations or something! You can have your opinion, but isn't 1 star a bit harsh. This is a film that is very well shot/made and has some great acting!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
extravagant but long,"Martin Scorsese has a handful of films like this one in his portfolio; Exuberant, energetic films with lots of substance abuse, partying, girls and money splashing all over the place. But in all of his films, dialogue is where true magic can be found, be it Marty himself in the back of Travis Bickle's taxi opening up, or Joe Pesci being confused about how ""he's funny"".The scene I'm about to refer in Wolf of Wall Street is when Jordan Belfort (Leo) meets with agent Denham (Chandler) for the first time on his fabulous ""boat"", a meeting ending in one party throwing lobsters at the other, a surreal and brilliant scene which also happens to be, in my opinion, the heart of this film: Money, ways to obtain it and differing views of it. It is a recurrent theme in Scorsese's cinema more minutely explored here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
SHEER GENIUS,"I feel like I had this whole movie memorized just from the sheer amount of memes that came from the movie.I am still so surprised that Leonardo DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for this. And I'm also surprised that Margot Robbie didn't win anything either. They both were spectacular and played their part so well. Even Jonah Hill was amazing.This movie was absolutely insane. And the fact that it is based off of an actual human, and his life, is beyond me. I read somewhere that this movie was in fact, not dramatized enough to match The Wolf and his personality and adventures.Mind blowing.I don't know why I love these movies that feel like the producers were on crack the whole time.

"Just a fair film, although one should not be blamed if they over enjoyed the film.","All the arguments of the haters are valid. This is an offensive film with a stupid story. Cheap dialogues, drugs & sex, these are the only 3 things this film offers. But how they offer them? Excellently! I believe the cast and crews should be proud of their works. But I don't like the fact that they've just made me like something I should hate.Jordan Belfort tried to show himself as a hero. I did not read the book, I don't know the real story, but from what I've seen in this film, he is a bad person. In fact I'd love the movie, if it were fictional.

"Poor  over the top performance by Dicaprio, boring overlong movie","So Dicaprio is nominated for an Oscar for his role here ? What rubbish, while his acting is about OK, he does carry his role over the top, he over acts in too many of his scenes, seemed unbelievable. Always over screaming, shouting out loud speeches with inflated neck veins that does not seem to look real or in context with the scene, I also did not like his performance in Great Gatsby, is he losing his touch ? The academy does not seem to think so! The same goes with Jonah Hill, ridiculous over the top acting made to be funny but ended up lame.The plot is nothing original, the rise and fall of a powerful man, have we not seen that so many times before ? Similar movies include Blow, Scarface and even the Spanish film starring Javier Bardem called Golden Balls. Overlong run time filled with lame rubbish over the top sex and drug scenes that seemed to take forever. I really cannot find anything good about this film, except a few laugh out loud scenes and a promising start that took a strong curve downwards as the movie progressed, 2 1/2 hours of torture.Still the movie gets Oscar nominations including best picture and best actor, what a disgrace!!

The Wolf Eats Well,"The greatest thing about this addictive, chaotic, machismo piece of beefcake movie magic, would have to be Scorsese's ability to slow down where it hurts, and show big moments in really long scenes. The life of Jordan Belfort is portrayed as a mélange of orgies, parties, business dealings, extortion, pure crime, and unabashed and unapologetic decadence. Even from the start of the film Belfort is unapologetic, which may be the true theme of the entire film. Though he feels neglectful of his family, irresponsible in his business dealings, and drug addled to the point of insanity, in the end he really feels unapologetic. Having a character like this is refreshing, since we haven't seen this level of criminality since Gordon Gekko. Not only is Belfort uncaring, but he traverses in a world of richness and depravity that we couldn't even handle. Scorsese takes his time, and creates big, beautiful set pieces, that take a lot of time and explain very little in terms of plot. These scenes are amazingly intricate and are some of the most memorable moments of the film. The entire sequence when Belfort (DiCaprio) is on lemons and has to make it home from the country club, could have been trimmed, but because Scorsese let it go on and on we got to appreciate the level of helplessness Belfort was going through. We saw his immaturity, his guilt, and his horror at the state of his life, and that can't be replicated in any one line of dialogue. The scene where they're speaking about the contract with the dwarfs and how they should have been treated, could have been cut easily, but it shows how Belfort and his associates treated those they could buy, and led to one of the funniest moments in the film. This film is downright hilarious at many points, especially when dealing in character development. Jonah Hill deserved that Best Supporting Oscar nomination, because he not only handles diverse moments of dramatic tension, but he's laugh out loud hilarious. Donnie Azoff could not have been played by a funnier person, or a better actor, and every time he's on screen it's another chance for us to see just how removed from reality these people really are. There's also a level of opulent violence that shifts underneath the surface that we don't always see, but we know it's there. While movies like ""Scarface"" put the prospect of violence in the forefront of your mind, ""Wolf"" builds its tension over time, until characters erupt. While Belfort may not be violent towards his wife throughout most of the film, he is emotionally abusive and their fights are temperamental. It makes that much more sense when things become physical. There were some excellent performances from many of the cast, especially DiCaprio in the lead role. While many of DiCaprio's roles kind of blend together for me, this was a truly unique, unequivocal performance. Belfort's brazen love for business, and building himself up to the highest level possible, is his undoing time and time again. He can't walk away, even when he's offered an out, only because of his pride. Even today Belfort makes his money easily, with a level of persuasion that can only be portrayed by DiCaprio. Hill is enigmatic and perfectly crazed as Azoff, Margot Robbie is a delight in her role as Belfort's second wife Naomi, Matthew McConaughey is just the right level of kooky misanthrope as Belfort's mentor in the beginning, Rob Reiner is perfect as Mad Max Belfort, a man who is always angry and always influenced by his son's schemes, and Kyle Chandler is a surprisingly entertaining choice for the FBI agent who takes Belfort down, commanding his time on screen with a very complex and layered performance. This isn't exactly a love letter to the world of Wall Street, or even to the lives of the rich and famous. We as the audience don't want to see Belfort succeed or fail, we just want to see what he does next. Belfort's life is so chaotic and crazed that he seems unreal in such a huge sense. Between the legions of hookers, the drugs, the money, and the antics of his entire office, the film plays more like the exploits Caligula than the playboy world of a charlatan like Belfort. For many, they found no insight into the moral capacity of the character. Without morality critics decided that this was a hollow perspective intent on showing indulgence. I disagree heartily, and would argue that this is much more a character study than anything. There's solid humor to this film, there's a decent level of character development, and for what it's worth, there doesn't need to be a moral. Scorsese shows us that these men exist, and they are getting away with everything, to the point where they can brag about it. Scorsese doesn't want us aligning ourselves with the likes of Belfort, and he certainly isn't legitimizing the exploits of his company. He set out to make a ""ferocious"" film, and he did just that, creating a black comedy that shows what modern day indulgences look like, and how they are being employed by everyone and anyone who can get their hands on their version of the American Dream.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Comedy With Leads Who Will Disgust You,"I honestly back to back watched Scorsese movies today. And I am so glad that I watched The Wolf of Wall Street almost immediately after The Departed. After The Departed I wanted something lighthearted yet intense still and this movie totally fit the bill.I laughed and was entertained by the movie for sure but not as much as others stated. A bigger feeling that I had during this movie was the disgust by the characters. Yeah they showed a beautiful life, but I did not find the characters redeemable for the most part, particularly Jordan Belfort. And I was okay with that because I knew what Scorsese was trying to convey and I was okay with feeling this disgust and seeing this reality through this biopic.The film may have been about the scam by Jordan Belfort, but it was more of a biopic and focused on Belfort only. We never saw the way his actions affected the victims, but we saw him and how the extremities of him and Wall Street culture is horrific and enabled. I think it would have been valuable to see some victims, but still it worked and got the point across without being on the nose. Although it might be a reason why some misinterpret the film. It showcases wall street culture quite well and shows how toxic it is. Loved the film for how much it showed, and glad to learn it was an accurate portrayal from others.Leonardo DiCaprio lived it as Jordan Belfort. Apart from the final shot, I don't know how Belfort is in reality, but DiCaprio succeeded in making me hate the character and loved his performance. He was hilarious and made the audience hate him simultaneously. Margot Robbie was amazing in this movie, putting her beauty aside, she really added to how we hated Belfort with her performance and the scenes she had with him. Jonah Hill was another character who was initially hilarious and just as hated as others as time went on. Loved the performances in the movie.Some scenes were just fantastic. I loved the ending and the messaging that Scorsese attempted was quite commendable, but I think a scene or two of victims could have made it register for some of the audience. The final scene could be broken down and dissected for ages to show the reality of how gullible we as humans are and how despite us not liking how it ended for the character, this is reality.Overall, a great financial scam where the makers want you to disliked the characters and learn about the toxicity of wall street.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"7.7/10 - Fun, Good Characters, a Bit Lengthy","Well, that was pretty fun :)The Wolf of Wall Street is based on the autobiography of Jordan Ross Belfort, and it follows his story as a broker in Wall Street that does all the drugs in the world and scams practically every client.Now, this movie tries to be smart, I don't say it doesn't - Jordan is portrayed as a childish man, full of ego and toxic habits, that just won't stop until the whole world is in his hands. He's addicted to the game itself, at this point, to the chase after money. And you know, it somewhat succeeds - Jordan is an interesting character, and I like the Walter White thing that he goes through (if you got it you got it), but I won't say that Jordan is the main thing that made me enjoy this film. Sure, he's part of it, but honestly - this film is just full of dumb fun and good directing, and that's what sells it. Don't go into it expecting some deep introspective stuff, that will make you toss and turn while wondering wth did you just watch - watch it for fun, the fun characters are to bonus. The cast is great too, and each actor adds a lot of flavor to their character.If this film has any problem, and it's not a huge one, it's probably its length - it's like, three hours! Which can be pretty exhausting even in a fun movie like this one, and the dumb drug stuff can feel sometimes quite meh and redundant, especially after they did that thing for hours. I don't necessarily think that it should've been shorter, but it definitely has some downsides.So, yeah, that was a short review and I don't really have a lot to say here. This film is just really fun and well made, though it may be a little exhausting at times. Feeling a 7.7/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Good film about a pretty bad person,"(69%) The pairing of Scorsese and DiCaprio runs on, and is now as strong as the DeNiro partnership. This is the most full-on production of the duo yet, and is very likely to remain so for some time at least, although it must be said that it is not really that overly shocking. There is quite a bit of nudity and sex, but only prudish fools get upset about that, and the swearing becomes unnoticeable after the first five minutes, likewise the tons and tons of drugs filling the screen. DiCaprio is fantastic and this is worthy of a watch just for his performance alone, the brilliant scene of him crawling on the ground to get to his Lamborghini after one too many funny pills shows a more physical side of his talent which is not always shown. The run length is as excessive as Belfort himself as a good 25-30 mins could have easily made it into deleted scenes, but I never once got bored, just a little bit tired of it all after about two and a half hours in. It's also well worth a look simply to get an account of the devils pulling all the strings to the financial world, and at times the feeling that the FBI cannot get the handcuffs out quickly enough and put these guys away is very strong. One of Scorsese's good films, but not one of his best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Aftertaste Has Clout,"Some films leave an aftertaste. The aftertaste from The Wolf of Wall Street (besides how much fun the crew must have had trying to keep a straight face during some of Leonardo's antics...) is the frank exposure of the pure sham behind the entire stock market scene. How truly shallow is the American dream? How freely will business ""friends"" betray each others' well being and personal trust? How empty is the greedy search for material wealth regardless of the social or environmental costs? Martin Scorsese scores 100% for the riveting portrayal of how a sheep of a man, an uninitiated adolescent, was hiding in a wolf's clothing, and how the model is envied by shallow men throughout the world, fooling them perhaps all the way to their graves.

3 hours of debauchery,"I have mixed feelings about this picture. I expected great things because of the critical acclaim and viewers' response that it received and it stars Jonah Hill and Leo DiCaprio both of whom I am a big fan of. Did it deliver? Yeah kind of I guess. I mean it was wickedly funny and the acting really was convincing,Oscar-worthy even. But to say it was overrated is a bit of an understatement. The negatives were that firstly, it dragged and dragged- in fact, it could have been half as long and still achieved everything. Secondly, I felt that it glorified this disgusting, greedy and hedonistic behaviour. I know this sounds really lame, but I like a movie to have a message at the end. But you didn't get that with this one. Finally, I felt that nothing much happened. They had tons of sex. Did tons of drugs.

He takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Belfort makes a small fortune.The structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to a 90s flick called Good-fellas, that it is hard not to mention it.

Nicholson showing us how evil and good occupy the same turf using the same tactics. Then a few years on, DiCaprio is back in the cocaine feed bag showing us he can go beyond Jack Nicholson with more women more money more sex more drugs.In a way it's just too much, like a long walk that starts out scenic and amusing and becomes like a death march at the point of a gun. I felt obligated to stick it out though it's three totally degenerate hours and I feel like I need the steam room more than Leo to sweat out the toxins.

A must see film!,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 film featuring star actors Leonardo dicaprio and jonah hill. Both Leonardo and Jonah have a history of making great movies throughout their careers and in my opinion fit the perfect role for most movies with any genre whether that's comedy, crime, drama, or action. So, for a quick overview the movie is about Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a rookie stockbroker who started with a stock company, he then ends up finding his own firm called ""Stratton Oakmont"" along with a group of his friends to defraud wealthy investors while making millions of dollars from them. However, as he continues to expand his ""empire"" the FBI closes in on his illegal acts.First things first, this movie is definitely 5 stars for me and If you're into crime and drama then I definitely recommend you watch this movie.

MY REVIEW: Wolf of Film Making!!,"The Wolf of Wall Street. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, whenever they are together, you know you shall be ready for a cinematic treat and The Wolf is no exception.Playing a morally wrong character, Leonardo DiCaprio displays best of his acting skills. His performance in each and every scene is so animated and delicious that you may like to rewind some of the scenes just to enjoy them again and again. Martin Scorsese like a master of his game never let the intensity go down. Supporting actors like Jonah Hill and special appearance from Matthew McConaughey are icing on the cake. Screenplay is full of surprises and dialogues are sharp.Like Goodfellas, The Wolf is seen from the eyes of the wrong side and keeping everything authentic and comic works big time for this movie.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Wolf of Wall Street.

Lust and depravity in the world of finance,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a film directed by Martin Scorsese that takes us inside the world of excess on Wall Street, offering a raw look into the life of the protagonist, Jordan Belfort, the so-called Wolf of Wall Street. Masterfully portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, Belfort emerges as an unscrupulous broker who builds his fortune through fraudulent schemes targeting inexperienced investors. In this tour de force of exaggeration and lack of scruples, Scorsese paints a vivid portrait of Belfort's unrestrained life, where drugs, money, sex, and alcohol are the order of the day, in approximate order. His creation of the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont becomes a mirror of his own dissoluteness, a vicious circle of luxury and corruption that seems to know no bounds. However, as we delve into this whirlwind of excitement and degradation, we wonder if the film really has something substantial to say. The lack of true depth in the characters and the constant emphasis on hedonism may leave some viewers dissatisfied, longing for a richer and more complex narrative. It's as if Scorsese is offering us a live view of this excessive life, without ever truly digging beneath the surface. One of the film's strengths is undoubtedly DiCaprio's performance as Belfort. His commitment and energy bring the character to life in an extraordinary way, giving us memorable moments that will stay with audiences. However, despite the talent of the actors and Scorsese's mastery behind the camera, the film struggles to maintain the viewer's engagement throughout its excessively long duration. What may be missing, perhaps, is a clear moral vision or a significant commentary on the human condition. While Scorsese shows us Belfort's downfall, there seems to be a lack of deeper reflection on the moral implications of his actions. This leaves the viewer with a sense of emptiness, a lack of emotional or intellectual satisfaction that could make the cinematic journey more meaningful. Additionally, the portrayal of women in the film is another critical point. While there are female characters in the story, they often seem to be reduced to mere extras in Belfort's life, without true depth or development. This raises questions about gender representation in the film and its sensitivity towards female characters. Despite these criticisms, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" still offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of high finance and moral bankruptcy. The exaggerated and often humorous scenes may entertain, but ultimately, the film may not leave a lasting or significant impression on the viewer. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is certainly a complex cinematic experience, rich in insights and memorable moments, but in the end, it may leave some viewers feeling like they've witnessed an empty spectacle, devoid of true substance or meaningful social commentary. With a stellar cast and high-level direction, the film certainly has its moments, but perhaps it lacks the depth and complexity needed to elevate it beyond mere displays of excess and depravity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The glorification of a narcissistic sociopath,"If you are looking to waste three hours of your life watching the glorification of a narcissistic, douche-bag sociopath who makes a hobby out of exploiting every aspect of business and the people in his life, this is the movie for you.Based on Jordan Belfort's life (the real life narcissist) this movie is misogyny, corruption, and exploitation on parade. There is no moral, just the showcasing of the worst humanity has to offer. To a man with no conscience, conning people and spending their money frivolously is the only joy life has to offer. Why anyone would want to make a movie showcasing such a disgusting, sad human condition is beyond me.My main issue with this movie was it's failure to show the repercussions of Belfort's actions on his victims. Real narcissists and sociopaths ruin the lives of their victims and often drive them to suicide. The Wolf of Wall Street negates the real affect of these toxic people in our lives, especially the ones at the top like Mr. Belfort, the ones who operate the top corporations and are literally conning our money out from under us.The seriousness of the damage Mr. Belfort is committing is eclipsed by the extravagance of naked women & one man, copious drugs (nothing innovative there), and money.The Wolf of Wall Street is the worst movie I have seen in over a year.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Brilliant writing partnered with brilliant acting,"The Wolf of Wall Street is without a doubt one of my favourite films of all time. No I am not just saying that because of the many, many, many adult sections in this film such as the boobs, drugs, swearing, violence etc. I love this film for two reasons alone, the writing and the acting. This film has some of the best writing I have ever seen in a film which is ironic since describing the plot of this film is quite difficult. The plot development of this film is immense and the change that all the characters have to go through is incredible. This huge change however, wouldn't be the same without the incredible acting from pretty much every single actor in this film, not just from Dicaprio. The best way I can describe this film is saying it's a 'word action' movie. The plot is driven by the dialogue and it's done brilliantly.This film is a must see for any film fanatic if you amazingly haven't seen it already.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Comedy and story at its finest,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a fantastic story that tells the fall of a man in the destructive stock-broker business. The way it uses comedy may push some people off with the over-exaggeration of certain scenes, but it all leads into the point the movie is trying to get across and feeds the story perfectly.The main characters encapsulate everything I find morally wrong but I was enthralled by watching how they got there and how the want for money over moral righteousness drives someone to destroy themselves and everyone around them.It makes fun of multiple issues in the world by making them seem absurd but never makes you feel like you would want to live in that life.Watch the movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"A big mess, but a fun an intriguing mess","By mess, I mean the guys life. Very very much a crude and 'male fantasy'esque film, with enough comic effect to alleviate the drama.It's a crazy series of events that has you questioning which bit is even based on reality, but the entertainment value as a movie is 100% a reason to keep it in your watchlist and get to it when a good time comes around.Not one every woman in your life would enjoy for sure, a bit too much gratuitous nudity and Fear and Loathing level drug use for it all to add anything or be worth reiterating so many times, but the fact it is probably very close to reality kind of excuses the fact.It it not quite perfect or mindblowing, but certainly a super intruiging and fun movie, one you can talk to people about and leaves scope for conversation post-cinema.If you are trying to figure out if you should see it - It's a definite yes for anyone who is a regular film-viewer or hardcore movie goer.

"Big on Decadence, But Light on Meaning","An unapologetic celebration of mean-spirited excess and the depths of human greed. It's entertaining as hell, wildly indulgent and more off-the-wall than the craziest Jackass movie, but at the end of the day there really isn't much more to it than that. Leo DiCaprio is effective as the drug-powered, decadent master of ceremonies, even showing us a glimmer of internal conflict behind the hazy fog of those unfocused eyes, but his rare moments of shame are quickly washed away with all manner of intoxicants. The film's purpose is puzzling. Are we to pull for this loathsome figure, the very embodiment of the ugly American 1-percent stereotype? Shall we root for his comeuppance at the hands of the law? Merely observe, jealous but just, as he squanders our relatives' retirement funds on a perpetual hunt for fleeting ecstasy? In any case, we're in for disappointment. After an hour, the novelty of this lewd dash of A-list voyeurism begins to wear thin. At two, it's long overstayed its welcome. Thirty minutes later, it begins to deal with repercussions, but those too are impermanent and flimsy. I'm torn. On the one hand, it's a savory experience, looking over the shoulder of giants as they splurge on a lustful life of luxury. On the other... did we really do more than spin our wheels? A glittery, contemplative experience that misses its shot at excellence, I've decided, and one that really doesn't need to be half as long as it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

It seemed to be an over indulgent love-in of quality actors overplaying everything, the director trying to show off how fast he could get the cast to talk over each other with irrelevant excruciatingly long conversations of no interest to anybody except presumably the writer; and every character a ridiculous overplayed cartoon cutout. Even the steadfast investigating cop had to become a wisecracking Caprio mark 2 when the pair finally got together for their ""showdown"".

Highly entertaining flick about a bunch of a-holes,"This is one of those Marmite things - a well-made, entertaining film that may still leave you feeling that you've just been conned out of your money. It follows the general pattern of Scorsese' ""Goodfellas"": we are invited to a vivisection of the twisted life-story of a thug, with all the accompanying over-the-top theatrics. Here, however, instead of ruthless perversions of a life of killing and crime, we get a life of coke, Quaalude, and sex. The pace is often unbearable, but well suited to the story being told. Which still doesn't change the fact that the film ultimately glorifies the oneupmanship of a petty thief without really batting an eye. As far as the artistic value is concerned, this is a notch or two below ""Goodfellas."" You can probably make the same movie yourself if you patiently scroll through Dan Bilzerian's Instagram. There's very little room here for reflection, not only in a moral sense (which I don't care much about), but also in the sense of the development of characters. DiCaprio is well versed in this kind of fare and his acting doesn't really stand out. (In fact, Jonah Hill may be the stand-out performer.) At times, this gets really depressing, as when Matthew McConaghuey easily upstages Leo during the briefest of cameos. Or when Rob Reiner basically embodies the generational (and ethical) difference between the con-men of the 80's and the wheeler-dealers of the 70's. This is also why the film can still satisfy. Other than the pure showiness and shallow theatrics, it does include some fine acting and writing.

good movie,"And yet, the main praise comes from the director, who convincingly showed that at 71 it is still too early for him to retire. To shoot a three-hour share on the fall and fall of a stock broker so that the viewer during the viewing would not be able to look at the clock, in particular, far from being an observer, but the New York magician who knows and knows a lot about cinema succeeded. By the way, Belford himself had a meeting with his Directorate Caprio in the finals, foreseeing the events, and his face is not particularly lingering in memory.

A misconstrued masterwork,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that often gets misconstrued by its audience. This is a movie filled with dark humor, greed and ego.

The performance throughout the picture by Leonardo DiCaprio is my favorite from him and one of my favorite performances out there. The rest of the cast is amazing and perfectly plays their parts in the world they have created. The pacing throughout this film by Scorsese just shows his mastery as he makes a 3 hour movie feel like 2. The subtle fourth wall breaks in this movie help the audience follow along with the more complex nature of the stock world. The character study of Jordan Belfort shows us how someone can be corrupted by the luxuries they are shown and have been promised. For the plot of this picture we follow Jordan Belfort as he rises the ranks of the stock world eventually becoming ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". This film shows us his lifestyle in all its glamour and glory but also contrasts this with money hungry characters. Every character in this film is in it for thier own benefit and they do not care who they hurt along the way. This is a great film about how one can be corrupted by what they seek.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
DiCaprio definitely deserves an Oscar for this role and you owe it to yourself to see this film,"OK, so I went into 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' with no expectations and it really impressed me! I guess I shouldn't be too surprised - it is Scorsese! He's definitely a master director, with the film paced perfectly and the three hour run-time actually flies by, with barely a minute wasted. I also liked how DiCaprio occasionally broke the fourth wall and spoke directly to the audience - works well here.It's a true story, but I assume some creative liberties have been taken, as usual. It's basically a story of greed, ambition and ego, all played out on Wall St, New York in the late 80s and early 90s. There's some great supporting actors as DiCaprio's fellow stockbrokers/advisers, none more so than Hill, but it's great to see McConaughey, Reiner, Favreau and Suplee helping out.While a film about stockbrokers doesn't sound too exciting, I can assure you this is - it has debauchery, drugs, alcohol, ridiculous chanting, sex - approximately a new pair of boobs to look at every 5min - life-or-death situations, a decent score, plenty of laughs (particularly the country club scene!) and a fitting conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of 2013.,"Whoa, here we go again! Now this is the kind of film that is offensive just like most of the Martin Scorsese films are. One of them starred Robert DeNiro and Leonardo DiCaprio. And now The Wolf of Wall Street came out and they loved it and it's based on true events and based on the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort played by Leonardo DiCaprio himself. Like most Martin Scorsese films nowadays this one is intense. This is in fact the fifth time Leonardo DiCaprio worked with Martin Scorsese. They previously worked with each other in Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed and Shutter Island. Everyone is going on and on about Leonardo DiCaprio getting an Oscar for his performance as Jordan Belfort but instead won an Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as for some reason this is actually a black comedy but it has loads of biographical drama. Now let me get to something what is really important. Everybody loves The Wolf of Wall Street because your mum loves Leonardo DiCaprio and your dad loves to look at Margot Robbie. And you should't be watching it with your parents because why? Sex, drugs, nudity and up to 569 uses of the F-word. Martin Scorsese is known for making films that contains alot of swearing for the most part and if you're looking for a kid friendly film from Martin Scorsese, check out Hugo because everything else he's ever directed is never going to be child friendly. But if you regret watching a Martin Scorsese film with your Mum and Dad, The Wolf of Wall Street will be a prime example. That being said, The Wolf of Wall Street is a fantastic amazing film, lots of great acting by all cast especially from Leonardo DiCaprio. Although the film is 3 hrs long but that just makes the biographical moments look so epic and fantastic. The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of 2013.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

I have never been to a movie at the cinema where the whole audience was laughing that hard.Bottom line, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best movies i have ever seen, the best performance for Leonardo DiCaprio, best collaboration between Leo and Martin Scorsese, the most hilarious movie i have ever seen and it's worth every minute of its 3 hours.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
That movie,"Marty you did it again. First of all I never write reviews but this movie made me do it.Personally I am big fan of Scorsese's movies. Casino is one of my favorite Scorsese's movies (watch it) and for me it's very similar to The Wolf Of Wall Street. This time narrator is Leo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and it's about money, trickery, good friendship, alcohol, drugs and sex of course.

Lots of hot ladies and swearing. Great sound effects and music. Directing at finest. Lots of different locations. Leo was brilliant,(he deserves Oscar) other cast too.

"An obscene, excessive and over-indulgent romp","If you've seen one Martin Scorsese film, you've seen them all. Perhaps this statement only when applied to Scorsese can be construed as a compliment. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is quintessential Scorsese, overflowing with greed, ambition and excesses.The heart and soul of the film is Leonardo DiCaprio, adeptly playing the protagonist Jordan Belfort to whom ambition is the air he breathes, no excess excessive enough and playing the game alone is reward enough - at any cost. And at what cost! The film portrays the struggle of a single man to preserve everything he identifies himself with, even when faced by the inevitability of succumbing to the game. The film ends with a hint of poignancy, as if to suggest that the life ordinary is almost not worth it, and to trudge alongside people who ""don't get it"" is punishment enough.The performance of DiCaprio perhaps can entice the elusive recognition from the Academy Awards, as meaningless as they are, this time around. For it is truly a career-defining performance and he shines bright in a film that's all about his character. Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey deserve a special mention too for their supporting roles, and the film is an obscene, excessive and over-indulgent romp.

Needless to say, this is the driving force of Wall Street and the most important ruler of this materialistic financial center, which we will discuss later. Let 's talk about eye-catching first.

"Excellent acting and writing, but another Scorcese repetition......","The conclusion first: Another movie by Scorcese that is wildly repetivitive. It reminded me of gangs of new York in this regard. While I thought the acting of the two leads was impressive and actually liked the script, it was way, way too long. Cinematically it did not need to hammer home the same thing over and over and over; much the way gangs of NY did wiih violence. I just got tired of watching the same thing. For example the scene where Jordan is too high to get to his car to leave the country club.I do not know how long that lasted, but did we need to watch every centimeter of his travel to the car? That is just one example. Had an editor done his or her job (I would guess Martin did the editing) it would have been much better. Again I thought it was well written and acted, but for too many things dragged on scene after scene. The highs were high but the lows were low..",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
DiCaprio's career high.  One of Scorsese's best,"Misogynistic, homophobic, a little bit racist, heightist, sexist, uber pro-consumerism, violent, abusive, scandalous, a significant put down to the American working classes, at times almost soft porn and certainly not in the least sympathetic to any of its female characters.What's not to like about The Wolf of Wall Street?Marti Scorsese has either taken leave of his senses or decided that there's a time and a place to just let rip and have a bit of good old fashioned fun.Mark Kermode certainly doesn't agree. He spluttered all 'Old Liberal' into his green tea as he let rip in his Guardian review that this was essentially overlong, vacuous sensationalism.I couldn't agree less. It's an absolute blast from frame #1 to frame #4,475.Clocking in at 179 minutes you might expect this to be turgid and variably paced, but ace veteran editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, makes sure it keeps cracking along.It's Scarface meets the Goodfellas in an extended Bacchanalian orgy of sex and drug-taking that Joanna Lumley must have mischievously approved of, given her amusing cameo role.Has DiCaprio ever been better?Well, he was very good in The Departed, Revolutionary Road and The Aviator but this is surely his greatest (fourth time Oscar nominated) role in which he dominates the screen with a highly enjoyable supporting performance by Jonah Hill.The tale is about a stockbroker, DiCaprio as real life trader Jordan Belford, who begins his career on the day of the 80's Wall Street Crash and earns his nickname, and the movie's title, soon after in a Forbes Magazine article when the journalist profiling him names him such for his outrageous duping of America's working classes (""Postmen, why are they always postmen.?"") selling them worthless penny shares on the promise of unimaginable wealth.Far from exposing him, as the journalist hoped, it opens a floodgate of demand, not just from investors but from wannabe stockbrokers too.The movie is electrifyingly shot and edited. DiCaprio is a man possessed and Scorsese is on absolute fire with a hugely beefed up Greek Chorus of baying and howling trading floor macho- men whooping and cheering every one of his (Tom Cruise in Magnolia-like) pep talks, come training sessions. (Complete with naked brass bands, dwarf throwing competitions, female head shaving, orgies, and drugs aplenty.)Nudity is never far away. All of it female and most of it full frontal, including that of DiCaprio's Trophy second-wife, New Yorker Naomi , bravely played by long time ""Neighbours"" cast member Margot Robbie who really couldn't have made much more of a career leap. She's great.At 71 Scorsese has never had more fun.And the movie, throwaway as it is in many respects - it has no 'message as such 'other than 'this is bad' - takes its place near the top of his 'best of' CV, alongside the Departed, Cape Fear, Goodfellas, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Not because it has the sheer weight of these incredible movies but because it is made by a master in total control of his work.He ekes out a horrible, unsympathetic but spellbinding performance from one of Hollywood's most starry actors. This is something for DiCaprio to be proud of. Indeed, he may yet pick up his first best actor award at the Koodak Cinema in March (but, of course, there's Christian Bale and Mtthew McConnachie to contend with).Sadly, I think Scorsese will have to settle for an outrageous ninth losing nomination as best director as he graciously applauds a fellow director (this time Steve McQueen) the same night. That's as maybe. Put your PC sensitivities to one side for 179 minutes and just enjoy the ride.It's an absolute blast.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Great and Important Movie,"In Wolf of Wall Street Scorsese has made a masterfully engaging and entertaining film (we laugh at its characters, not with them); it's also moving in surprising ways. It delivers the blaring wake-up call a drunk hears when cops stop his loopy drive down Sunset Boulevard.  Is it great? Seems so to me. It certainly is terrific.Wolf is about excess - the real excess of the real world of Wall Street high finance and of the perverse American dream its siren call draws us to.  Those who walk away offended (ask who isn't) should direct their anger at ""the masters of the universe"" ... the real people the movie portrays  along with the people we see in the mirror each morning as we prepare to march along feeding the dream.   Do we condemn Bosch for painting his nightmares because they lure us into the pits of hell?Denying Wall Street's reality is like believing that steroids didn't propel baseball's batting surge -- and all the complicit claims of ignorance up to the top of MLB's food chain. Filming Wolf from a moral high ground to judge its characters would be a comparable denial; it would surrender to the culture of High Finance by buying into the fantasy that we need a big daddy to wag fingers at the perps and change the bad boys' minds.Wolf simply announces: this is the real Wall Street -- if you want change, be that change ... yourself.DiCaprio is powerful and  persuasive; McConaughey haunts the movie throughout in a tiny role; Hill is excellent, and Margot Robbie is perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Manic,"Dubious entertainment, but so fast paced and manic I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Is this the same director who made The Silence, Kundun and Last Temptation? It's the flip side of his spiritual films, and in some ways seems equally if not more honest - not to real life, but to whatever makes Scorsese such an irresistible filmmaker.. The film feels like a teenage kid flashing a porno picture at you and laughing satanically because he knows you are tempted. Di Caprio gets his best role in a Scorsese film, more or less playing himself on overdrive. However, one can question the cynicism at the centre of the film merely by observing that most people would have died from that amount of drugs: Di Caprio comes out looking mildly haggard. Not do we see the repercussions of his betrayal of friends. Nor does the 'system' he uses to get super rich make any sense. Then again, stars barely seem to age and most build their fortunes on a minimum amount of talent fine tuned to last indefinitely, so maybe their greed for success, talent for swindling and being selfish does work in keeping one young, and Belfort's story is also at the heart of Hollywood and what attracted Scorsese et all.

I can't believe that a Director and actor of such talent would want to make a movie celebrating the life of a complete low life (I can't say use the words I would like to) like Belfort. Think hard before you spend your hard earned on this because some of the money that you spend goes to a man that sent a wrecking ball through the lives of thousands and then rolled all the people who helped him do it so he could get a reduced sentence. I actually feel sick that I wasted my own money on it.If you want to spend 3 hours watching vacuous morons cheat, steal, lie, screw and celebrate that like they are conquering heroes then go ahead. There is nothing redeeming in the story, there is no mention of what happened to the people that were cheated, nothing to show that Belfort actually learned anything or changed in any way. It's just excess in every sense that goes on and on, 3 hours in fact.The title the Wolf of Wall Street says it all. Belfort sees himself as leader of the pack, rounding up the vulnerable and feasting on them whenever possible. Through this movie he's still feasting, on your money. Don't be fooled!",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Awesome but didn't need the 3 hours !,"I saw the movie yesterday evening and i tried to go watch it without any expectations even though i've been reading a lot of reviews. I am from the Netherlands so all the swearing and nude stuff isn't that much of a deal to us ;). And in my opinion kinda exaggerated. The atmosphere in the cinema was great and the first 2 hours of the movie were great !! great performances. Leonardo DiCaprio shows ones again he's one of the big guys nowadays and able to carry a movie. Jonah hill shows he's outgrowing the teenflicks although he still is the funny guy. I would describe the movie as interesting, exiting, fun and with so much underlaying messages trying to describe a bubble-era in the financial world with the sky as limit prior to the crisis we've gone trough the past years.Now for the downpart. I think 3 hours was too long. This movie didn't need the whole 3 hours to explain the story, be funny and a great movie. Pretty much after the boat scene it kinda starts to drag, this was also noticeable in the audience. less laughs, people got kinda bored at the end.All in all a great movie but 2 hours would've been just as good.first 2 hours : 9/10 entire movie : 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Yes, there's a ton of drug use, a ton of sex, a ton of expletives etc. Why you say?

A good movie but far too long,"Nobody could deny that Leonardo Di Caprio turns in a fantastic performance in this movie. There are several standout scenes including his various speeches to his staff, the hilarious encounter with the FBI agents on his yacht, and above all the incredible gymnastics with the car at the country club. I found him absolutely credible as a man driven by - not exactly the pursuit of wealth, because he carries on long after he has more than enough - rather sheer energy, the need to be incessantly active, whether in making money or spending it.And it's the spending of the money that drags the film down. What on earth persuaded Scorsese that we needed not just one or two drug-fuelled orgies but so many they couldn't be counted? The film could have lost an hour with no damage at all to its narrative arc or its exploration of human greed and white collar criminality. Ironically, the movie didn't take up on the opportunity to pursue the consequences for the duped of Di Caprio's fraudulent schemes. A very short scene on the NYC subway showed what was missed in that regard. Instead we had the constant pounding of the stock selling, the drug taking, the crazy behaviour.In some ways a remarkable film which took the time to explain how the scheme worked but alas not to illustrate the damage it inflicted on the victims. It might have been Scorsese's masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The best part of this movie is the reviews here on IMDb,"Three hours of story and I had no reaction to any of the characters - no likes, no hates, no caring, no nothing.There is no comedy, no drama, no scary scenes, no thrills, no acting! It's just a bunch of name and no name actors running around thinking they are making one of those goofy frat college flicks.This episodic tale of Jordan Belfort wants to be so much of what it is not and that not is 'entertaining'. The plot line just goes in circles and we all know he's got to have his downfall - otherwise there is no story.And if there is a message hidden somewhere in this tale it's that you can't trust Wall Street - what a shock!

Shortest 3-hour film ever,"This was an incredibly riveting movie. It was something like three hours long, but never seemed to drag on. The major criticism of this film is it's graphic vulgarity. Quite simply, it's crazy, raunchy and over-the- top. But if you come in preparing your eyes for total and utter craziness, it's not so bad.Beyond all the constant drugs and sex, is a complex main character (Jordan Belford played by Leo) with as many flaws as talents. In the end, it was his innate ability to motivate and sell that brought him to the top, but his demons that brought him down. Isn't this true for anyone? We all have our talents, but we all have our struggles. And no matter how much money and power you have, you can be brought down by your weaknesses. In Belford's case, it was drug-abuse and confused moral compass that ultimately crumbled his empire.From what I understand, much of what happened in The Wolf of Wall Street stays true to his memoir of the same title. However, it can be debated how much of the details in the memoir actually happened considering how much he was under the influence of powerful drugs during his ""peak"" years. What cannot be debated is the millions and millions of dollars he and his company, Stratton and Oakmont, swindled form the pockets of naive investors. This story line alone keeps the movie steering forward with details of drugs and sex splashed in mainly for entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Scorsese on Top Form,"Although I would like to say I'm a Scorsese fan, in all truth I can't. Having only seen three of his films from his long and much talked about career, it would not be right for me to say so. But, having watched 'The Wolf of Wall Street' I already feel like one.The Wolf of Wall Street makes a strong case for the best and most enjoyable film of the year. Leonardo DiCaprio owns the role and it feels like he was born to play Jordan Belfort, the real life character on which this story is based. The film is set between the 1980s and 90s, it sees Belfort making his way up in Wall Street from only able to sell penny stocks in a small building to making his own company and working with hundreds in a large office.DiCaprio gives it his all, sniffing, shouting and screeching with all his might and emerges with a performance like no other. Many have argued that Belfort is a character that is vile, repulsive and vulgar. Granted he may be at certain points in the film, yet it is the voice-over that truly gives the film an impact and makes us care about his character (not too dissimilar to the one used in GoodFellas by Ray Liotta). It enables the audience to relate to Jordan Belfort in a way that would not be as powerful or poignant without it.The minor characters, played by Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie are an unexpected welcome. Especially when I doubted Hill would be able to pull his role off, yet he does a marvellous job of it as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's right hand man. Always funny and excellently acted by Hill, there is no one else who could do a better job. Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Belfort's eventual wife brings sexiness and believability to her role and appears to relish every scene she is in.At its core it is a film about excess and how this can be our downfall, wanting, more and more. Belfort spends his earnings (gained illegally by misguiding customers, therefore making it almost impossible for them to gain a profit) on drugs, women and among many other things his own private yacht with a helicopter, as you do. In most points of the film his humanity is driven alarmingly close to the edge.Yet, Scorsese and his screen writer Terence Winter fill the film with jokes that we cannot help but laugh, almost entirely throughout its three hour run time. Many of the laughs are unexpected and that certainly helps, with an odd moment involving Belfort and Azoff completely off of their heads and a telephone cord led to me crying with laughter!All in all this is a perfect film with spectacular performances from the cast. It sees Scorsese at his best bringing the characters to life and even in their most questionable moments making them people that will still care about. At three hours the film never drags or lets up, there are always neat little touches that Scorsese provides – deliberate continuity errors when Belfort is high. The non-stop humour helps and guarantees the audience a good time and the most avid film fan left in waiting for the next Scorsese film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The best movie I have seen since Goodfellas,"The best movie I have seen since Goodfellas, The Wolf Of Wall Street tells us the story of Jordan Belfort, a man addicted to many things including alcohol, drugs, prostitutes, gambling and money. He is hungry for power and greed. The movie not only gets the theme spot on but also gives us an inside look of Wall Street in the 80's and 90's. Leonardo Dicaprio gives the best performance of his career and Martin Scorsese adds another masterpiece to his collection. The supporting actors also shine in the movie such as Jonah Hill, Jon Berthal, Rob Reine and Matthew McConaughey. The leading actress Margot Robbie also gives a shining performance as Jordan's wild and strong Dutches of Bay Ridge Brooklyn wife.

Don't look for the dirt beneath the carpet you might find a mirror,"Diane and I saw this film several days ago and I immediately wanted to see it again; she, on the other hand, could not allow herself to see it again. We both discussed the film later but she said that she did not have the stomach to see it again because although she was far beyond being naive enough to disbelieve what was on the screen, she was not prepared to watch the bottom-hugging activities of the film. I too was not surprised by anything that I saw on the screen however, I just wanted to see the parts that I probably missed the first time; although the film is about three hours long, it moves so quickly that it would easy, at least for me, to miss not only the dialogue but some of the visuals.I have nothing but praise for the acting, the script, the direction and the set direction; I saw nothing in the film to criticise. The enormity of the evil played before our eyes was nothing less than staggering. It would be easy to say that the film exaggerated the events but the limited amount of time I have spent socializing with business people leads me to believe that the events in the film could easily happen given the people making the decisions.The old saying, business is business and nothing personal meant can be blown up into the visuals on the screen. Once a person believes that screwing another person is just how business is conducted then it takes little imagination to see how that mental palate can be adjusted to the extent that virtually anything can be allowed. This is a hugely damning movie for any business that works on the premise that ""business is business.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Despite indulgences in morality and filmmaking, one of the best movies of the year.","Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" adapts the autobiography of Jordan Belfort, a high-rolling stockbroker selling penny stocks and committing securities fraud. It's an excellent movie, but I imagine most conversations about it will undoubtedly center around two things -- its length (clocking in at about three hours) and its obscenely gratuitous displays of moral depravity (much of the three hours revolves around sex and drugs).Fresh from his portrayal of Jay Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby,"" Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Belfort, a very similar character in many respects. Both are self-made playboy millionaires engaging in shady business dealings, living on Long Island's Gold Coast, and throwing wildly extravagant parties. But Belfort can perhaps best be described as Gatsby taken to the extreme of hedonism -- with a penchant for hookers and blow, battling an addiction to Quaaludes. DiCaprio gives a ferocious performance as the figurative wolf on Wall Street (the savagery of his speeches to his employees and the intensity of his drug-addled rampages both border on having almost animalistic fury), and odds are high that this is the role that will finally earn him his Academy Award for Best Actor.While Belfort allows himself indulgence upon indulgence with his lifestyle, so too does Scorsese with his filmmaking. There are countless scenes of sex-crazed stock brokers, cocaine-fueled orgies, and naked blonde bombshells. The novelty of the debauchery wears off quickly, and it veers toward becoming boring and repetitive over the course of the three hours. Despite the film featuring so many orgasms, there is no climax to its narrative arc. There is no moral or psychological growth in Belfort's character. Don't expect repentance; there's just more and more degeneracy.But these concerns don't get in the way of how entertaining the movie is from start to finish. The black humor of screenwriter Terence Winter's script adds constant hilarity to even the most morbid situations and helps with the pacing of the film. Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie give stellar supporting performances as Belfort's business partner and wife, respectively.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is easily one of Scorsese's most ambitious films, one of DiCaprio's most memorable roles, and one of the best movies of the year.9/10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Another Masterpiece From Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese has once again brought us another masterpiece with one of the most fun and entertaining viewing experiences I've ever had! An outrageous 3 hour drug and sex filled and darkly hilarious romp featuring the best performances I've seen all year.Leonardo Di Caprio is one of my favorite actors and even knowing his talent, I was still shocked just by how fantastic he was as Jordan Belfort. Despite being a huge fan, I almost couldn't believe I was watching the same Di Cpario I'd been seeing for years as he carried the film with such charisma and energy! It's by far the performance of the career and it he should more than deservingly receive an Academy Award for Best Actor (although he will probably be snubbed). Leo is not the only one fantastic here, Jonah Hill also gives the performance of his career here as well and Matthew McConaughey also shines in the brief amount of the film he appears in.Director Martin Scorsese who has directed some of the best films ever made brings his magic touch in telling this bizarre true story. Despite being 71 years old, he still knows how to have fun telling this story bring a wonderful visual style and fast pace at which the films 3 hour runtime fly's by. But it's not only Scorsese's directing that makes the film work so well, Terence Winter's writing just as equally plays a role in the films brilliance as well with his script filled with dark humor and excellent dialogue that will be quoted in years to come. On top of that, the two hold no bars on exploring Belfort's wild lifestyle refusing to shy away from the excessive amount of drugs and sex involved. This is one of the most graphic mainstream films I have seen in quite some time. But it's pervasiveness only favors the film making it all the more fun and entertaining.Even though it's long length, graphic content, and dark humor will turn some off, The Wolf of Wall Street ranks up as the best film I've seen all year and one of Scorsese's best!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"A Nuclear Explosion of Drugs, Sex and Greed","There is probably no other movie you could find that better captures decadence in the world of the extremely wealthy quite like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". A film that might not stand among the ranks of ""Goodfellas"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Departed"" or even ""Gangs of New York"" as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, but stands among the very best of 2013. Its a mess, but what an exhilarating mess it is.A 3-hour epic of gluttonous drug-use and explicit sex as documented by a truly repulsive human being. The fact is, this is how the workplace functioned back in the early 90's. The fact is, Jordan Belfort consumed more Quaaludes to make Hunter S. Thompson blush and engaged in enough ravenous sexual escapades to make Caligula faint. It seems almost unbelievable to assume that these events actually occurred, but to some degree, they did. If that is the case, then Scorsese truly crafted a masterful biopic.DiCaprio embodies Jordan Belfort perfectly. He soars far beyond any performance in film this year. Jonah Hill is also mesmerizing as Jordan's partner in crime, Donnie Azoff, who is a certified pig. Matthew McConaughey especially steals the show as Mark Hanna, a meticulous master of the stocks, with a strange habit of beating his chest to something similar to an Indian tribal chant. The female love interest Naomi, played by Margot Robbie, plays it sexy and cunning as a really charming tramp who mothers Belfort's child.The rest plays out as you would expect. Its a long, dizzying journey of T and A with copious amounts of cocaine sprinkled on top. But its a journey that is worth taking.

Scorsese Showing Signs of Senility and Hearing Loss,"Martin Scorsese, one of the Truly Great Directors Working Today with a Filmography that is Very Impressive, is Out of Control on this one.

Easily the Best Film of 2013! Critics with Bad Reviews... Get Over Yourself!,"Any critic who believes Wolf of Wall Street is anything short of a masterpiece is out of their mind! Long movies tend to get dull at parts, but this three hour journey through the eyes of a self-indulgent egomaniac captures the audience's attention and intrigue for the full one hundred eighty minutes. Some scenes might be excessive and go on for too long, but they do not lower the greatness of the film and only contribute to character development. Speaking of which, the characters are what make this movie. Every actor is appropriately charismatic and exactly on point with their performance.Leonardo DiCaprio transforms into the self-loathing stock broker Jordan Belfort, as this is arguably his best performance. If there is any time Leo should win the Oscar for Best Actor, that time is now. I honestly will be shocked if he doesn't get it. The rest respectively give top notch performances. Jonah Hill is just flat out the most entertaining person to watch in the film. His chemistry with DiCaprio gives the film a legitimate comedic dimension to the captivating story. Margot Robbie shines in her breakout performance as Belfort's trophy wife. And although he was in the movie for a limited amount of time, Matthew McConaughey's Mark Hanna was my favorite performance hands down. His character is what influenced Belfort's ambitions and his overall demeanor.In short, you will not have the desire to go see any other film in theatres right now after you see this masterpiece by Scorcese.

I went into the film w/ very high expectations, since I was already on board learning it was a Scorsese film & that Scorsese was partnering up w/ DiCaprio himself again & i'm happy to say I left theater very very satisfied.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance portraying Jordan Belfort is NEARLY his best film to date, nobody would blame you if you put the case that it's his finest to date & w/ DiCaprio being my favorite actor I'll say this has to be my favorite role of his personally. He's so invested in this role, he sells Belfort so well that even thought he's essentially a douche, he makes you want to grab a #1 foam finger & cheer for him like none other. Jonah Hill delivers the best performance of his career, as he's so so good in this role as Donnie Azoff, in my opinion it blows his performance in money ball out of the water & Margot Robbie isn't only wonderful eye-candy on screen, but also delivers a good performance. & last but not least w/ the screen time Matthew McConahay got he did a good job leaving his unique mark on the film. The whole cast from it's main to supporting being all invested in the rolls, hit it out of the park.As I mentioned the film isn't afraid to get graphic, w/ many sex/nudity scenes, a WHOLE lot of drugs & I mean this is probably the movie I've seen that's had the most amount of drugs & cocaine ever, blows Scarface away, & fun fact this movie holds the record for dropping the most f-bombs in a film. This film really does push the boundaries. Do know what you getting into when seeing The Wolf Of Wall Street.At the end of the day The Wolf Of Wall Street is an amazing well done movie from Martin Scorsese, one of his best ranked up there w/ such as ""Good Fellas"" & ""The Departed"". From beginning to end, from scene to scene this is a long entertaining/fun/party/thrill ride, & the most fun I've had this year in a movie. Not only is the Wolf Of Wall Street, fantastic. But my favorite of 2013. Must See.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Neither here or there,I liked the movie but just felt like it was an over indulgence of a director and actors just having a good time and not really portraying any kind of story. Ultimately just a film taking it to the extreme and the movie was just too long.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"It's like Wall Street, except on Lemmon 714 Quaaludes","In the time that The Wolf of Wall Street was approaching its UK release, it had been accused of glamorising and promoting the lifestyle that was or is being led by these corrupt Wall Street types. The Wolf of Wall Street is however a cautionary tale of excess that never becomes heavy handed and keeps you 100% hooked for the three hour run time and all this adds up to make The Wolf of Wall Street Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas.The Wolf of Wall Street is full of sublime performances. DiCaprio is utterly captivating as Jordan Belfort in what is arguably the best performance of his career, possibly even topping his powerhouse performance in Shutter Island, ironically another Scorsese film. Co- stars Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Jon Bernthal and Matthew McConaughey are equally as good, with McConaughey delivering a hilariously absurd performance as Belfort's mentor Mark Hanna.The Wolf of Wall Street is essentially the most unconventional horror film ever made. The horrors of greed and how it distorts people are expertly shown by Scorsese in a darkly comic yet truly terrifying way. There is no questioning that Wolf is dark, possibly Scorsese's darkest yet due to the fact that it is a comedy which leads me to what I thought would be the biggest problem with the film, the tone. Despite the fact that Martin Scorsese is a master director I thought that even he would find it hard to overcome the tonal issues he would more than likely encounter when trying to adapt this surprisingly dark story into celluloid. However, I am happy to report that Scorsese balances the tone with expert precision and is possibly the most impressive feat that Wolf achieves.The Wolf of Wall Street is definitely not for everyone and I would totally understand if someone doesn't like it for one reason or another, like the fact that some may think that the 3 hour run time is over kill. Despite the hefty run time (which is filled up perfectly), in my opinion The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese best film in 24 years and one of the most biting, unflinching and daring films ever made. This is a story of how even the mightiest of people can fall from grace done in the best way possible. If you want the definitive film about financial corruption that is clever and hugely entertaining, then look no further.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A chaos induced thrill.,"Anything that involved Scorcese, DiCaprio or Hill and I'm there. This film will have you laughing, crying, scared, disgusted, all of them, simultaneously. Not since Pulp Fiction have I experienced such a huge and varying mix of emotions, flying around in a three hour film. The hours fly by, the narrative moving so fast you don't remember what happened in the last scene. DiCaprio and Hill are the dynamic duo that steal the show from even Scorcese's incredible direction, their comedic input making you forget their disgusting exploits that you end up so completely enticed in the world of the film that you can't peel your eyes away from the screen for even a second in fear of missing anything.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Goodfellas meets Wall Street, its one helluva ride.","To say The Wolf of Wall Street isn't the best Scorsese film would be accurate, it doesn't even crack the man's top five films. But, with that being said, Scorsese is THAT good that saying this isn't his best film just means it is the best of the year and not of the decade. This film is insightful, poignant, and downright hysterical from start to finish. It leans more towards Scorsese's comedy genre, much in the vein of After Hours with a little smidgen of Goodfellas and Casino added to intensify the film high you get when you watch this. The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring film with energy to spare and performance to marvel at. Martin Scorsese directs yet another unforgettable performance from DiCaprio and gives Jonah Hill a high point in his career. Between all the Quaalude, cocaine, and hookers, there is a Greek tragedy playing out before our eyes. Belfort goes from being the top broker/criminal at his firm to being a drug fueled, yuppie with high minded ambitions that always seem to have a funny and hysterical way of falling through. The film is a chronicle of his rise and fall and clocking in at 3 hours, you barely feel it. The film is so energetic in telling this story that it is hard to look the other way even when we are exposed to characters smoking crack, popping Quaalude like Skittles and snorting more cocaine than Tony Montana along with banging every hooker north of Manhattan. This film is pure entertainment and worth seeing in the theater. Go and see this film, you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Highly recommend it...,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a Biography - Crime movie in which we follow the life of Jordan Belfort, from his start as a stock-broker to his crazy, wealthy life and his involvement to corruption. His life is simply crazy and his attitude too but things are easily change.I liked this movie very much because it's based on true events, therefore its plot is interesting and the plot twists made it even better. The direction which was made by Martin Scorsese was simply amazing and he succeeded on creating something that will remain as landmark. The interpretations of Leonardo DiCaprio who played as Jordan Belfort, Margot Robbie who played as Naomi Lapaglia and Kyle Chandler who played as Agent Patrick Denham were all very good and their combination created something simply beautiful. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Thrilling Ride with Some Flaws,"The Wolf of Wall Street is an exhilarating, high-energy ride through the world of excess, greed, and moral decay. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, the film offers a scathing portrayal of the rise and fall of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, a man who manipulates the system for personal gain. The film's performances are exceptional, with DiCaprio delivering one of his best performances to date, and Jonah Hill providing standout comedic moments as his right-hand man.However, despite its captivating performances and direction, the film isn't without its flaws. The most glaring issue is the film's length. At over three hours, it sometimes feels excessive, with certain scenes dragging on longer than necessary. While the excessiveness of the characters and their lifestyle is a central theme, the film occasionally feels like it glorifies these aspects too much, offering a portrayal of debauchery and corruption without fully examining its deeper consequences. The repetition of indulgent scenes-drugs, parties, and excessive wealth-can feel monotonous at times, detracting from the deeper narrative.Additionally, the film's approach to its characters' morally questionable actions often borders on glorification, making it harder for viewers to sympathize with or understand the destructive impact of their behavior. While the story is undeniably entertaining, it can at times feel like it's reveling too much in the spectacle of these individuals' lives, without offering enough critical perspective on their actions.Overall, The Wolf of Wall Street is a wildly entertaining and well-crafted film, but its excessiveness-both in runtime and in its celebration of corruption-prevents it from being a perfect film. Despite these shortcomings, it remains a must-watch for those interested in the darker side of ambition and greed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"The Wolf of Wall Street is entertaining, powerful and extremely amusing.","Summary: The Wolf of Wall Street is entertaining, powerful and extremely amusing. 94/100 (A-)The Wolf of Wall Street is insane, hilarious and entertaining. It boasts an amazing cast and a vibrant direction. I'm not a huge fan of DiCaprio's previous work, but after seeing this I'm very impressed with his acting. Moving on, it's a three hour flick, and it wasn't boring at all. Despite its long running time it kept me interested and entertained. I usually don't like this type of films, but this one was very funny and powerful. The characters and the story are interesting too.The cast is absolutely faultless. The main character performed by DiCaprio is completely nuts, he's riotously funny and you care for him. Although some moments in the movie were too surrealistic, I still love it because it's an extremely well executed biopic that manages to be hilariously entertaining and inspiring. It is about leadership and craziness; it's a strange flick filled with a bunch of obscene and bizarre moments. It definitely earns an R rating, it has some... explicit stuff. (A-)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
What's missing in what should have been a masterpiece,"Given the filmmaking skill, amazing cast, excellent performances, directing, editing, and photographic talent that went into making this film, it should have been a masterpiece. However despite some often entertaining moments, the film leaves you feeling there is something missing.First of all, Leonardo Di Caprio is too soft an actor to take on a roll like Jordan Belfort, the Wall Street wannabee who scammed millions. While he had some great moments and obviously was fully committed to the lead role, there just wasn't the hyperkinetic quirkiness he should have had. If you don't believe me YouTube the real-life Jordan Belfort, on whom the character is based and watch him. Then imagine him high on cocaine and you will see what I mean.Secondly, the script utilizes the same story telling approach as Goodfellas particularly in the use of voice over. I believe this was a smart choice in principle as Belfort's depraved but relentlessly honest voice is important to hear. However, the VO is excessive and throws you out of the scene, frequently distancing you from the greater emotional potential that remaining in dramatic action would have provided. Voice over thus becomes a crutch here defusing the torque the same technique provides Goodfellas.Like in Goodfellas, Scorsese takes the VO strategy a step forward by breaking down the fourth wall and having Di Caprio talk directly to the audience. It works in Goodfellas because it takes place at the end of the film when Liotta's character breaks out the world of gangster and migrates into his new lackluster life. In Goodfellas it also occurs with an energy that matches what comes before and after. Here the same tactic takes place in what seems to be a random manner that makes no story sense at all while it also jars you out of the drama by defusing the intensity of the scene which it interrupts.Thirdly, the distancing of the voice over narration enhances the fact that the film is just too long. Its was clearly a difficult beast to wrangle in editing but it could have lost 20 minutes easily. A shorter edit would have undoubtedly punched up the structure, increased tension and smoothed out some of the few awkward moments.Fourthly, Scorsese who in my opinion is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time gets cute with his own trademark devices. His slow motion moments seem mechanical, his eery silences that usually scream loudly sometimes fall flat here and his score which he usually edits from popular music better than almost anyone else just doesn't work. The Howling Wolf and Muddy Waters selections are great in themselves but he doesn't seem how and why and where to cut them in.Thankfully the film does support some masterful work by all creative participants (it is after all a Scorsese picture). The performances are excellent and even Di Caprio achieves much despite what I feel is a case of unfortunate miscasting. Jonah Hill is amazing as are all the other smart ass hustler guys. Margot Robbie could have stopped at being beautiful but she showed depth, sensitivity and moxie as Di Caprio's second wife. Cristin Milioti also was excellent with big brown eyes that break your heart when they tear up. Rob Reiner was a great surprise and Matthew McConaughey's hilarious and off the wall but unfortunately his very short appearance in the beginning of the film makes it clear who should have been cast in the lead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"""The Wolf of Wall Street"": A Wild Ride of Excess and Exuberance","Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a raucous and exhilarating journey into the high-stakes world of finance, excess, and ambition. Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who rose to dizzying heights of wealth and power before crashing back down to earth, this film is a wild and unapologetic exploration of greed, hedonism, and the allure of the American Dream.At the center of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is Leonardo DiCaprio's electrifying performance as Jordan Belfort, a charismatic and unrepentant conman who embodies the hedonistic spirit of the 1980s and '90s. DiCaprio's portrayal is a tour de force of charisma and energy, as he effortlessly commands the screen with his larger-than-life presence and magnetic charm.But ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is more than just a showcase for DiCaprio's talents; it's also a masterclass in storytelling and direction. Scorsese's direction is bold and audacious, as he immerses audiences in Belfort's extravagant lifestyle with dizzying camera work, kinetic editing, and a pulsating soundtrack that captures the frenetic energy of the era.While the film's three-hour runtime may seem daunting, every minute is packed with exhilarating moments, from wild office parties and lavish yacht trips to high-stakes deals and daring escapes. Scorsese balances the film's hedonistic excess with moments of biting satire and dark comedy, creating a narrative that is as entertaining as it is thought-provoking.Of course, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is not without its detractors. Some critics have accused the film of glorifying Belfort's criminal behavior and moral bankruptcy, while others have questioned its portrayal of women and its handling of sensitive subject matter. While these criticisms are valid, they do not diminish the film's overall impact as a gripping and unforgettable cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a rollercoaster ride of excess and exuberance-a film that dazzles and entertains even as it exposes the darker side of the American Dream. With its powerhouse performances, dynamic direction, and razor-sharp wit, this is a film that demands to be seen and savored-a wild ride that will leave audiences exhilarated and questioning the price of success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Excellence in only one aspect of a film ....when do you stop caring..,i have never been more confident about the title of a review capturing my thoughts about a movie so completely.This movie has brilliant performances ...the excesses shown as part of the lives of the protagonist and his associates (most of which i have learned are true)...have been shown with a blend of extremism and restraint which will guarantee nominations in all the awards..The issues begin early on starting with the plot.....because the story revolves around characters who barely change throughout the movie....and around a series of events in their lives .....the movie becomes utterly predictable and boring towards the end....The editing is leisurely as if a deliberate attempt at an epic is play.The cast is able to pull of individual scenes with aplomb but the weak plot and poor editing ....which has stretched the movie to the EPIC length of 180 minutes doesn't do this movie an favours..We all know from the beginning how this is going to end...but after a while the sense of foreboding reaches the point where you almost know how every scene or incident is going to end.This movie is possibly a victim of its Cast and crews greatness...and their misdirected shot at making another legend..If the end despite the amazing talent behind and in front of the camera this movie remains a bunch of amazing scenes..,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Outrageously boring,"Like a kid trying to get your attention, the movie yells and annoys a lot. And even if this it's just an exact replica of what really happened, that only means that reality was annoying, not a justification for the movie.Clearly the excess got into the creators, which meant at least 30 too many minutes in the film that turned it into a boring one, even when there are some brilliant sequences or scenes (Belfort creation of a success until they move into a bigger building; drug night and driving back in the Ferrari; the FBI meeting with Belfort in the yate; Belfort's meeting with the banker).DiCaprio is great as addict smart trash; Hill both annoying and funny at the same time; and Margot Robbie distracts with pure beauty, but not enough to make it less long, dense, repetitive and at times boring.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The best Comedy Movie,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is infectiously entertaining. It is probably the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen. Between all the fun however, there is also a story about addiction and how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs, money, or power.Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese does a wonderful job keeping this movie at a high at all times. Never once does this movie lose it's energy or sense of humor much like the drug induced characters. There are a lot of quick cuts and edits to keep the movie feeling as If you are on drugs as well as playing high energy music in some of the more serious situations.The cast brings their ""A"" game. The stand out is obviously Leonardo DiCaprio, who pretty much owns and excels any scene he is in. This film really showcases his diverse range.Overall ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a full on adrenaline ride that never loses momentum.

A New Story Approach: The Pro-Villain,"If you're looking for a great character who you can empathize with and whose values you want to mimic, this is NOT the movie for you. The story of Jordan Belfort is one that is told to show one path that takes you to the neo-American dream that is becoming so rich you don't know what to do with the money. As long as you can tolerate a good pro-villain (spectrally opposing the anti-hero) movie that subtly denounces everything the main character stands for, you'll enjoy the superb directing, acting, and props of this movie. Jonah Hill breaks out as a quasi-serious actor with the hilarity of his character's flaws.

The film's fast-paced narrative, combined with Scorsese's razor-sharp direction, creates an intoxicating mix of humor, drama, and moral recklessness.

The Wolf of WS's Biggest Excess is the Film Length,"The excesses in the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, the true story of the wealthy stockbroker told in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, is an essential element of this movie. However, the biggest sin of the filmmaker is that he stretches out of the debauchery, greed and decadence over a three-hour film that is ineffectively countered with only an infinitesimal amount of moral and rational content.The acting of Leonardo DiCaprio is not in question here; nor, for that matter, are the performances of his supporting cast, most notably Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, who play his business partner and second wife, respectively. Strong performances abound by those three actors and others as well in this cinematic effort. In the case of DiCaprio, one could argue that this could be one of the top movie portrayals of his career.However, save for the very brief moralistic beginning of the Belfort character, the other 98 percent of the movie leaves you with a protagonist that offers nothing for viewers to root for, unless you are a fervent worshiper at the altars of Gordon Gekko (see Oliver's Stones' 1987 Wall Street), Hustler's Larry Flynt and the Allied Brotherhood of Drug Dealers Incorporated.Yet, this is apparently the true-life story of Belfort. Thus with respect to his rise to making millions of dollars, all the drugs, sex and abject degenerate behavior that went with it, along with his eventual fall from the illicit pinnacle he built up for himself and his company, it is what it is.However, when the audience is required to endure the long drawn out corruption and comeuppance without giving it any reason to care about the outcome of the arrogant central character, it makes for an unsatisfying cinema experience. Just a little bit of redeeming character (even if invented), such as that afforded to cocaine magnate Tony Montana (Al Pacino) in the 1983 Scarface, along with about 30-60 minutes of editing cuts would have made The Wolf of Wall Street a more enjoyable movie experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Marketing genius,"The meaning of the movie escaped me, and therefore the picture was watched only for the sake of familiarization. It is funny and disgusting at the same time. I gave it a eight because it is still necessary to be able to denounce all those who spin among dirty money. Scorsese did it, and he did it vividly.Sex and drugs, and of course the money that is used to buy the first and the second - that's what you will see when you sit down to watch the movie. There are no positive characters in the movie. Jordan Belford, telling the viewer his story, evokes exactly the emotions that remain after watching the movie and about which i wrote above. The movie is not made with a great purpose, there is nothing instructive in it. Drugs are bad... Really? Except the main character doesn't think so. His wife, who is far from a paragon of virtue, thinks so, so her opinion doesn't count.Scorsese definitely made the movie with the intention of making fun, but usually the banter ends with a denunciation or the denounced person losing, so that it is clear how to act good and how to act bad. This movie does nothing of the sort. It just shows us all the most disgusting aspects of the life of a greedy rich man to make us laugh and draw or not draw conclusions - it's up to us.The acting is off the charts, but the large amount of lust and rot is off the charts too. In the end, the movie turns out to be classy, but - paradox! - pretty average.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Great in many ways, but a bit interminable... and could backfire","The Wolf of Wall Street is a fantastic showcase. It showcases all the artists who create and inhabit the world depicted, including the tech (set/prop/etc.) folks.The writing/direction is good. Expressionistic/over-the-top, fun; effective at what it does.The only problem I had was that the flick seemed to be a kind of ""The Hangover""-with-money. In other words, it's this interminable expose of a hollow man; and that's not enough to take the film to the next level. You are treated to this cavalcade wild ride of big money adrenalin and bizarre drug abuse, and wind up sort of lost in that kaleidoscopic maze... for a long, long time. Then the film ends. It was a great vehicle for all the people involved, and I enjoyed it, as such. But bear in mind that, in the end, it's a kind of hollow snack.How is it hollow? Let's think about the moral dimension for a bit. It seems like Scorsese is trying to lay bare the amorality (at best; immorality at worst) of high finance. But doesn't this flick really just wind up scapegoating an over-the-top talisman of Wall St. excess? Aren't we supposed to chase the Wolf over the cliff, and then feel cleansed of sin? No: That wouldn't work; not with folks who think about the hard implications of Mammon worship. Which means, actually, that I'm wrong: ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" would work just dandy, at a deep, subconscious level, with altogether too many people. And that is an unfortunate key effect Scorsese's approach to this story that actually bothers me.I like to think of Scorsese as a complex, challenging voice of moral conscience; but he seemed to have sort of lost his way with this flick. I think its effect is a perverse inverse of what a ""voice of social moral conscience"" would intend. I think, for all the out-of-it, abusive, egregious affronts to decency, that the downstream effect is an apologetic for those affronts.I often think of one of my fave, direct, cinematic expressions of this kind of moral inoculation: THX 1138. There's a scene where one of the denizens of that underworld are flipping around the TV, and encounters a 24/7 channel which shows robocops beating up citizens. The idea is that, after being exposed to so much overt abuse, you speedily go through your cycle (rage, bewilderment, internalization) and then can get on with your passive role as a cog in a system. That's how I feel about the depiction of excess in ""Wolf"". Sadly, I think Scorsese missed the boat: We're already inoculated. Wall Street has long, long, long been disassociated from human value, and we have long, long internalized that disassociation as ""business-as-usual"". Do they really need Scorsese's help?",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Utter Waste of Talent.,"This has to be among the worst films I've seen featuring one of my all time favourite actors;DiCaprio. Whom all together gave a lack-lustre just plain boring performance. This film is simply a waste of time. It centres around a group of creeps led by upcoming wall street big-shot Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio). Who thrive conning white-collar's out of their money until the government catches on to their scams and the ploy inevitably crashes and burns.The main problem I had with this movie surprisingly was not its glorifying of terrible human behaviour, greed, drugs and full-throttle misogyny throughout (which I did have a problem with), but the fact that it was all pointless, and continuously depicts the the same crap over and over; something that gets very old. Very fast. It is possible to show debauchery and distasteful conduct in context and with a POINT (I', not some crazy who can't bear to see nudity or cringes at the sound of profanity). But this movie is deprived of anything close to a message or even a dialogue trying to give any form of meaning whatsoever. It seems to show these things just to shock or for cheap laughs (I didn't laugh. But had I they would've been incredibly cheap.). And that is what I have a problem with, the movie glorifying these things for what seems like no reason, or for a reason the makers failed miserably to get across, it just makes the film itself seem rampant, immature and stupid.Another huge problem with this film is the fact that it constantly barrages you with this debauchery brought about by DiCaprio and his cohorts, but never gives it any real substance, no blowback, no depth to it nothing (as I've already said) this in turn makes the characters look like exactly what everyone in this movie seems to be: immoral scum. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, they are all creepy greedy sexist pricks with nothing to show for. And this is where the movie falls ultimately flat. Its not a ""love to hate"" relationship between the characters and the viewer, it is a simple loathing of pretty much every cardboard cut-out in this terrible film, the writing is awful, almost seeming like they cut corners on purpose to avoid giving any characters or acts any depth or meat at all.Overall its an immature film that Hollywood will eat-up. Ridden with dick-jokes and the grade of humour that appeals to most teenage boys. Its not quite boring, but flatlines of anything memorable throughout. Maybe there was some sort of thought and effort originally put into this movie as shown by all the A-listers who appear. But all this movie offers is a waste of time, a waste of effort (if there were any), a waste of talent and a waste of money. Its simply not funny and will leave anyone above the average 7th grader maturity level feeling like they have to wash their hands for a couple minutes after watching.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The wolf of wall street review,"Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a powerhouse performance as Jordan Belfort, capturing his charisma, ambition, and hedonistic lifestyle with electrifying energy. DiCaprio's portrayal is both captivating and repellent, making Belfort a complex antihero whose charm and audacity draw viewers into his morally bankrupt world. Jonah Hill, as Belfort's eccentric right-hand man Donnie Azoff, provides strong support, adding layers of absurdity and humor to the narrative.Scorsese's direction is vibrant and unrelenting, infusing the film with a sense of urgency and chaos that mirrors Belfort's own tumultuous life. The screenplay, written by Terence Winter, is sharp and witty, blending outrageous humor with biting social commentary. The film's pacing is relentless, with a runtime of three hours that feels brisk due to its constant barrage of high-energy scenes and shocking antics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

It marks the fifth collaboration between DiCaprio and Scorsese.Leonardo DiCaprio is magnificent as Belfort, managing to portray him in a brilliant way, showing off the character's extravagant and vice-filled lifestyle. DiCaprio is able to show on-screen the radical transformation his character goes through when money and greed come into play. Jonah Hill's portrayal of Belfort's sidekick is great too, the actor uses his comedic abilities to bring fun to the duo. And Martin Scorsese's direction is excellent.

"Bulls and Bears, Lies and Flares","The Wolf of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a bold, unflinching exploration of excess, greed, and the corrupting power of wealth. Based on the true story of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, the film chronicles his meteoric rise and reckless downfall as he navigates the morally bankrupt world of Wall Street. With its unapologetically audacious style, dark humour, and dynamic storytelling, The Wolf of Wall Street serves as a compelling critique of ambition, materialism, and moral decay in the pursuit of the American Dream.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a masterful performance as Jordan Belfort, portraying the character's charm, ruthlessness, and insatiable desire for power with remarkable nuance. DiCaprio's fearless performance brings depth to Belfort, making him both magnetic and repulsive in equal measure. His on-screen chemistry with Jonah Hill, who excels as Belfort's eccentric right-hand man Donnie Azoff, adds layers of chaos and dark humour, enhancing the film's irreverent tone. Margot Robbie's breakout role as Naomi, Belfort's wife, brings a necessary emotional grounding to the narrative, balancing the excesses with vulnerability and intensity.Scorsese's direction is energetic and unrelenting, employing rapid editing, fourth-wall breaks, and a frenetic pace that mirrors the chaotic world Belfort inhabits. The film's comedic timing, alongside its unrestrained visuals, ensures each scene is both entertaining and impactful. The soundtrack further complements the tone, capturing the spirit of the characters' indulgent lifestyles. Scorsese's refusal to glorify his characters while still immersing the audience in their absurd world creates a sharp, satirical edge that underscores the film's critique of Wall Street culture.The Wolf of Wall Street goes beyond its portrayal of Belfort's lavish lifestyle, probing into the darker themes of greed, corruption, and the moral cost of excess. The film invites viewers to reflect on their own relationship with ambition and materialism, all while highlighting the absurdity of Belfort's world. Though its lengthy runtime may feel repetitive at times, the film's humour, energy, and thematic depth make it a compelling and thought-provoking experience.In conclusion, The Wolf of Wall Street is a dynamic and entertaining exploration of unchecked ambition and moral compromise. With its powerhouse performances, sharp direction, and incisive social commentary, it stands as one of Scorsese's most audacious and memorable works-both a celebration and a condemnation of the pursuit of excess.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Saying this movie is perfect is underestimating it as a whole.,"Like the genuine bine of what perfection looks like in film. And honestly the greatest comedy/drama I've seen. Scorcese hits all the marks again with this movie. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect cast. If it were up to me, I'd nominate a lot of people in the cast for an Oscar in this film, because the performances were like you've never seen. DiCaprio, Hill, Robbie, and Chandler were amazing.Going into this I had my doubts about Jonah Hill because I'm used to seeing him in these comedic roles and I didn't think that he'd fit in well in Scorcese's movie next to people like DiCaprio. Going out, I was thinking Scorcese has got his new Pachino, just like DiCaprio is his De Niro, because he was honestly was the second best part of this entire movie (Obviously Leo was #1). I will NEVER underestimate his acting skills agian. In fact, Hill should take on more roles like this, cause he's amazing in them.Look, as a biographical movie based off the real life events of a scumbag, I thought it was gonna be boring. This movie NEVER failed to catch my attention. I had my eyes GLUED to the screen. Everything from the screenplay, the acting, the directing was just captivating. It was supposedly 3 hours long, but I felt like I was sitting in my seat for about one hour because I couldn't feel any tinge of drag. Even from the get go at the start I was intrigued. Just jumped right into it. This movie didn't hold back any punches. As a comedy it hit EVERYTHING. I lost my near  in so many times. I don't know exactly what scenes are meant for the laughs, but I was laughing a lot. So the humor is A+. As a drama, I felt the tension, due in part to amazing acting and amazing script.So many people complain about the excessive
nudity, crude nature, and language in his film, but geez. It's R rated for a reason people! Don't get too much on your high horse for it.The one thing that I hate about this movie was the after effect of it on the real world. Jordan Belford, the guy who this movie is based off on, gets more attention for being a complete jackass and for his past criminal deeds of tricking a lot of people into going broke. It doesn't sit well with me that he gets a positive end from it. But that's just me. He deserves a whole lot worse for his past abuses.This has gotta be one of my favorites movies of all time. And I'mma be sticking my neck out on a line, but this is one of Scorcese's best movies ever. It just is to me.10/10. Utter perfection!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Overlong but reasonably entertaining movie with Leonardo DiCaprio's manic performance on the loose.,"After going 360-degree with the unexpected children's fantasy, HUGO in 2011, it's good to see director Martin Scorsese has finally back to his familiar R-rated territory with THE WOLF OF WALL STREET. Already a highly controversial movie upon its release last Christmas in the US due to its boundaries-pushing R rating (for the depiction of sex, drugs and profanity), it's no surprise that THE WOLF OF WALL STREET failed to pass our local censorship board to be shown in Malaysian cinemas.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Based on the Jordan Belfort's memoir of the same name, the movie charts the rise and fall of 22-year-old Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) who first started out as a rookie Wall Street stockbroker in 1987. On his first day at the firm, his boss, Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) already sees potential in him and eventually mentors him to become a successful stockbroker. It all started out well for Jordan, until the unexpected Black Monday (the 1987 stock-market crash) cost him his job. Jordan moves on and gets a new job selling penny stocks in Long Island, at which he manages to make a fortune out of it. Then one day, he meets Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and quickly becomes partners after he decides to open his own brokerage firm called Stratton Oakmont. Soon he recruits more people to work for him and he gets richer as the time goes by. With so much money, drugs and sex at his disposal, it doesn't take long before FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) begins to investigate around Stratton Oakmont's illegal practices.THE GOOD STUFFMartin Scorsese's direction is as energetic and cinematic as always. He really amazes me that even at his senior age of 71, he still got what it takes to make a vibrant cinema (even though he doesn't reaches the same creative peak he had in GOODFELLAS, CASINO or even THE DEPARTED). From the technical standpoint, everything here are aces with Rodrigo Prieto's lively camera-work (e.g. freeze-frame, slow-motion, fast dollies) worth the special mention.Collaborating with Scorsese for the fifth time since GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002), Leonardo DiCaprio gives a live-wire performance as Jordan Belfort. Here, he combines the cocky swagger of Michael Douglas's Oscar-winning performance of Gordon Gekko in WALL STREET (1987) with a dash of Alec Baldwin's Blake character in GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS (1992), and even a little of Robert De Niro-style of acting method. But it was the funny side of him that viewers rarely seen from the typically-tense DiCaprio he always known for. He certainly knows how to let loose and have fun with his character. He even pushes his comical edge to the limit that you have to see it for yourself.The supporting actors, ranging from Jonah Hill's strong support as Jordan's right-hand man Donnie Azoff to Kyle Chandler's effective performance as FBI Agent Patrick Denham (with his particular memorable scene involving him and Jordan at a yacht), are downright captivating. Last but not least is the breakthrough performance by 23-year-old beauty Margot Robbie as Jordan's trophy wife, Naomi. Not only she's strikingly hot and beautiful, she manages to stand on her own against DiCaprio.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The long, comical set-piece involving Jordan overdoses a handful of Quaaludes (a type of sedative-hypnotic drug), at which his entire body becomes numb and unable to speak properly. During that particular scene, he tries to crawl his way out of the building and back to his car to head home. Think Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or even Jim Carrey and you'll get the picture.THE BAD STUFFAt three hours long, the movie is undeniably excessive to a breaking point. Not surprisingly, all the manic energy that Scorsese is trying so hard to push forward, begins to wear out its welcome. Then there's Terence Winter's adapted screenplay which feels strangely monotonous. For instance, does the movie have to be so redundant by including repetitive scenes of Jordan and his people snorting cocaine and having sex with lots of endless naked women like nobody's business?FINAL WORDSTHE WOLF OF WALL STREET is far from Scorsese's best works, but it's a worthwhile entertainment for those who wanted to see the lighter side of him.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Morality? You Be the Judge,"It has been a major criticism of The Wolf of Wall Street that its main protagonist, the anti-hero, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Dicaprio) is not seen to truly get his come-uppance. There has been a suggestion that the film is a glorification of his lifestyle and practices, that it, through not outwardly condemning them, tacitly supports them.Such moral condemnation of literature and film is hardly new. The now largely forgotten Somerset Maugham – the most popular writer in the English language for much of the first half of the Twentieth Century - often faced similar criticism. Maugham's response never wavered. It was not his job as an author, he would state, to set the world to rights. He based his characters on people that he knew. He wrote of, and embellished, their faults and shortcomings. It was for his readers to make their own judgements and determine what was right, and what was wrong.Director Martin Scorsese and scriptwriter Terence Winter seem to have adopted a similar line. They have simply told their version as they saw it: the story of a man corrupted by greed whose habit was fed by those who were only too keen to invest greedily in schemes where they thought they could make a quick, easy buck. It is ironic that many of those who now complain Belfort is portrayed too sympathetically were those investors prepared to do anything to get money apart from work for it. If Scorsese's film has a moral lesson, it is that people should not be seduced by the thought of soft profit. I suspect also, that Scorsese is of the opinion that nothing much has changed since the balloon went up with the GFC, that the fault lines remain in place for history to repeat itself. Wasn't it Sir Winston Churchill who stated that the only thing history ever teaches us, is that nobody ever learns from it.So I would recommend you go and see The Wolf of Wall Street and make your own judgement as to its morality – don't rely on others to make that judgement call for you. It is a great piece of film-making which runs solidly for three hours during which the pace never slackens or dulls. It fascinates for its whole duration. Direction, script and cinematography are all spot on and the acting complements it well.Leonardo Dicaprio is always at his best when playing larger than life characters and here is no exception. His charisma oozes from every pore and is essential to his characterisation – what conman was ever successful by being dour and self-deprecating? His skillful piece of acrobatic acting as he opened his car door with his foot when out of his mind on Quaaludes was laugh out loud funny.The rest of the cast also rise to the occasion and there is a wonderful comic cameo from Joanna Lumley, as Belfont's aunt by marriage, whose major scene with Dicaprio is great fun, very much a highlight. Special mention also to Australian actor Margot Robbie as Belfont's second wife who holds her own opposite Dicaprio and never lets her accent slip.Two criticisms – one more serious than the other.The debauchery and female nudity were overdone. The solitary scene of a musical band of bare torsoed men seemed to be a contrivance and inserted simply to deflect such criticism. Much of the female nudity seemed only there for male titillation.And a minor criticism of the otherwise excellent Jonah Hill, as Belfont's sidekick Donnie Azoff. Azoff was clearly a near chain-smoker. Yet Jonah Hill never looked comfortable holding a cigarette and was obviously faking the inhalation. Smokers (and ex-smokers) easily pick up on this and it's a distraction. Odd that the many, many scenes of coke snorting looked wholly realistic.I have my doubts as to whether The Wolf of Wall Street has the gravitas to become a classic, but it is a highly enjoyable romp giving a good snapshot of the 'greed is good' culture which remains with us and is surely lurking, ready to bite with even greater effect next time round.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Another masterpiece from Scorsese,"This film is out of control, in a good way.

My rating: 6,"The wolf. The wolf is a beast who has no pack and is a wolf till his end. In this sense he do not loose. There are few movies with the same plot but when DiCaprio is here that is not taken in mind. He made some bright roles recently but I may say strong images, strong personalities.The-movie-story have action moments, moments of narrative and protracted explanations. Also unnecessary deviations. It shows the human ambition for self-creating and freedom but also of Greed. The price which is paid in such cases is almost equal to never being born. The extreme experience of the body are not enough to overcome ""the horror of being sober"" and to lose your love ones, twice.The-movie-story is very long. It is hard to me to imagine such life but I believe that everything is possible. Very good supporting role. I think always supporting role but always very good.The-movie-story is provocative.

A flawed but marvelous explosion of incredible insanity,"The Wolf Of Wall Street will be loved by some while others will be absolutely mortified. I'm more in the former direction. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a fantastically appalling stockbroker who lives the high life thanks to making millions illegally, but soon the authorities become aware of his illegal activities. Divisive but acclaimed overall, TWOWS, with its depictions of swearing, greed, sex, drug use, moral corruption and bad behaviour does not know the art of taste or the art of subtlety, but if you can look past its lack of taste, it's a relentless, ruthlessly effective and devilishly demented black comedy which is less a movie, more a machine gun helicopter blasting its way through every tasteful movie studio around. Disregarding a short running time, a restraint on unnecessary scenes and examinations of the consequences maybe wasn't the best idea, but this is overall a slightly brilliant movie which, as a cinematic whole, has got it all. People may forget how brilliantly made it is.TWOWS is quite blatantly the work of a master. With every frame exploding with cinematic skill and precision, this movie looks amazing and there's not an arbitrary shot to be found. In terms of scripting, despite having over 500 uses of the F word it never feels gratuitous, and with amazing dark humour, clever character development and badass lines galore the screenplay refuses to be boxed in. Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better on screen, while Jonah Hill makes it pretty obvious he is destined to win an Oscar at some point. Matthew McConaughey is only in it for 10 minutes, but he makes a huge impact. There isn't really a solitary bad performance here. It dips after the halfway point before finding its feet again, and there are many scenes which aren't necessary and feel like they're prolonging the film for the sake of having an obnoxious length, which means the delirious heights the film sometimes reaches are never sustained for long enough. Even so, this is one of 2013's finest and deserved the Oscar nods.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
DiCaprio's best - maybe Scorsese's too,"I like The Wolf of Wall Street for more than what it is as a film: for Scorsese, this is such a change of pace and topic for him, that I respect not only taking the leap, but executing it with such a flourish.This story highlights both the reckless abandon that I think is probably rife on Wall Street, but also demonstrates just how good Leonardo DiCaprio is as an actor (and, to a lesser, extend, Jonah Hill). This is a big-budget, OTT film: drugs, debauchery, fraud and everything else, helped by being a really fun watch.A lot of faces appear throughout as well - Matthew McConaughey, Margot Robbie and Kyle Chandler are all brilliant in supporting roles, not to mention the rest of the great cast. DiCaprio slips into the persona of a delinquent financier effortlessly, and should really have won an Oscar for this role over The Revenant.The normally drab interiors of financial centres are bright and intriguing thanks to shot selections and a lot of different cinematographic choice, complemented by a really good soundtrack.To be honest, I don't actually think the story is that amazing or unique - but for re-watchability purposes, I have found few films better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Awesome performances, but not for the prudish","The old student adage - ""better a bottom in front of me than a frontal lobotomy' - was never truer than in Martin Scorsese's new film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"".The film tells the bizarrely true story of Jordan Belfort (based off his autobiography): a rags to enormous riches story of the ugly side of stock-brokerage. Starting off young, naive but ambitious in a 'standard' Wall Street company, Belfort (Leonardo di Caprio) is taken under the wing of wild-duck maverick Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), who teaches him some of the ropes as well as introducing him to some distinctly bad habits. Following redundancy on Black Monday, and picking up sidekick Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) on the way, Belfort focuses on selling dodgy penny stocks to blue chip customers, with astonishing success. His success draws him to the attention of an investigating FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) who gives him and his team hell in trying to convict him of wrongdoing. Around this general plot line drives the alcohol and drug-imbued love life of Belfort: a steady stream of absurdly beautiful women normally wearing nothing more than a smile, led (notably) by Australian beauty Margot Robbie (About Time).This is definitely not a film for the prudish. The nudity and sex is (if you'll excuse the pun) definitely in your face. The drug taking is extreme and prolific: the very first scene of the film shows Belfort ""doing crack"" (this is in fact a killer joke, copyright my son George Mann). And there is limited albeit distressing violence (of the marital abuse variety). All in all, this is not the film to take your favourite maiden aunt to see on a Sunday afternoon. But if you can stomach all of this (or, perhaps more appropriately, snort cocaine off the stomach of all of this) then this is a gripping story with fantastic performances throughout. Nobody - but nobody - can talk to the camera so grippingly as Leonardo di Caprio. He does it in style in this film, particularly through a tour de force walkthrough of the dealing floor whilst explaining the ins and outs of trading to you, the audience. Overall, di Caprio's performance is - quite frankly - astonishing. He has never to date won an Oscar and that is a crime. (Perhaps with this performance? But with the likes of Christian Bale (American Hustle), Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyer's Club) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) up against him, this might not again be his year - we will see).There are actually many similarities about this film and his earlier film, The Great Gatsby. Both have him starring in an hypnotic and totally over the top role, with both emphasising the debauched limits of acceptable behaviour, albeit 60-odd years apart.The rest of the cast are also fantastic: Jonah Hill is standout (in lots of sorts of unpleasant ways), adding both humour and pathos: his acting at the point where Belfort is about to discover his terrible mistake is just superb. And Rob Reiner, as Belfort's long suffering Dad, and Jean Dujardin (""The Artist""), as a dodgy Swiss banker, are also both standout performances.You might from this precursor think I loved this film. You wouldn't be completely correct. Firstly, it was long - way too long. I hate to think what happens if Peter Jackson and Martin Scorsese ever go out to dinner together. Waiters hanging around 'til 3pm in the morning, getting increasingly irate about inconsiderate diners not allowing them to lay up for breakfast and go to bed! Some of the monologues in ""Wolf"" - whilst brilliantly scripted - were 50% too long. The whole film could and should have been condensed to at least 75% of its length.And I also had severe reservations about the morals of the film. The film shows the rise and fall of Belfort. But then you see Belfort's successful later life and you never get to really see the misery of the poor investors - many of who were ordinary working people - who funded his revolting lifestyle through their investment of their life savings. As someone who has personally been on the sharp end of this type of practice (via property investment), I felt this both glorified his dodgy practices and made marital infidelity and drug-taking seem normal and acceptable. For this lack of balance, I knocked a point or two off the rating.(If you enjoyed this review, ""follow the Fad"" at http://bobmann447.wordpress.com... thanks).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese gets ballsy again,"After a flight into ""general audience"" land with the excellent 'Hugo', Martin Scorsese collaborates for a fifth time with the ever more dependable Leo DiCaprio, playing his second real life figure for the legendary film maker. Jordan Belfort came from nothing and built a Wall Steet empire like a true Gordon Gekko by, essentially, screwing over any sucker he could. The man did time, paid his dues, wrote a confessional, cautionary tale, and now performs sales seminars. None of this is spoiler; assuming you are at all interested in the topic, this should be unsurprising knowledge. It is also par for the course with this sort of Scorsese movie; you've seen the ""rise and fall"" riff from him a few times before now, right?For the actor, everything he touches turns to gold right now; here he gives what is probably his most energetic performance, often invoking a young Jack Nicholson. Certainly an extraordinary, extended sequence involving the results of a narcotics overdose is due to be considered classic in no time! For Scorsese, the obvious touchstone here is 'Goodfellas'; the style of building momentum and ""bad guy"" narration is back, but again, the gangster epic remains the superior film. For both men as a team, 'The Aviator' is their obvious high point.That said, there is much to be admired here: The excellent look of the film, the superb performances from Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey, the latter of whom only has about ten minutes screen time but leaves a huge impression; the fantastic use of music, again reminding us of Scorsese's ability to compose excellent montages, which drive us forward without much plot, and a masterful ability to turn the tone of the film on a dime, if only for a moment. This latter point results in unexpected laughs and gasps of disbelief; a sense of comedy arises from what is frequently a simultaneously rather obscene and absurd set of circumstances and behaviour, which leave you feeling quite horrified and/or disgusted.On the downside, there is no excuse for its length and, toward the end, an upset rhythm. Up to a point we are completely on board, but as the film enters its third hour and is only then truly exploring the repercussions of Jordan's actions, along with his humiliation, we become painfully aware that with some more intelligent and brutal editing, there was probably a good forty-five minutes of the previous couple of hours that could have been easily expunged, leaving room for more of the final act and bringing it in at an easy 135 minutes. Perhaps we should turn to Leo as producer here and ask, ""Why didn't you say no to a three hour cut of this?""'The Wolf...' asks for a lot of investment in a set of characters it is pretty tough to care much for, and with ultimately little reward. The film is an impressive effort, and undoubtedly Scorsese's most ballsy film for some time, but it is also disappointing; looking at his career, we all know that this should have been a five star film! The sense that this master of cinema could have done a bit better is not easily ignored. Nevertheless, there is enough here to make it worth your while when it leaves the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Glamour and Glitz,"When you think Wall Street you think money. They go hand in hand. Everyone on Wall Street is in the business of money: loaning it, investing it, borrowing it, even insuring it. The Wolf of Wall Street aka Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) was determined to make money one way or another and he had the gift of gab to help him.Jordan was a stock broker who started a small penny stock trading company called Stratton Oakmont. He built it into a multi-million dollar company by gaming the system and some sleight of hand. This movie is an inside look at how you too can get rich by being smart, risky, and unethical. Yes, you may go to prison one day, but it won't be that bad because you'll have millions of dollars. And even if you lose the millions of dollars, you can write a book, do a speaking tour, or other celebrity gigs and bounce back. In other words, become a millionaire by anyway you see fit because now matter how far you fall you'll still be above the rest of the peons.I was rooting hard for Jordan to fall on his face. He was a horrible human being. Even though the movie was entertaining for the most part, it wasn't the money, drugs, and girls that interested me. It wasn't even the scheme that interested me.

There certainly is no shortage of gratuitous kinky sex , full frontal nudity, excessive profanity , and over the top drug use . Although this film really does glamorize the perverted behaviors of white collar Wall Street criminals , one can not help but to envy their excessive lifestyles . The script is sharp and crisp and holds your attention throughout most of this very long but fast moving three hour movie . With little surprise, the film ends as you would kind of expect it to do . This is not a family movie and it's definitely not for everyone . Leave the kids and your elderly parents at home . I highly recommend this film to everyone who has ever dabbled in the stock market or anyone that fantasizes what it would be like to be ridiculously wealthy ! DiCaprio scores big in the leading role and should win an Oscar for Best Actor .. I gave The Wolf Of Wall Street a solid 9 ... That's Hot !.. PWH",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Sell me this pen,"Edgy, racy, and full of F bombs thats what this movie is. Jordan Belfort played by Leonardo DiCaprio is a man trying to get filthy FU**ing rich and sniff some coke on the side and have a great time. This movie maybe 3 hours long but its worth it and it is funny as hell it has that kind of funny like am i supposed to be laughing at this movie because they are scamming a lot of people out of a lot of money. But this is a movie i really wish Leonardo DiCaprio wins i am tired of him not winning at the Oscars i mean this guy is talented and of course Martin Scorsese is the best director of all time what is not to like about this movie its a movie anyone can enjoy because it shows you how money can make you happy.

"Good for adolescent boys, I guess.","I didn't like Wolf of Wall Street for a number of reasons. It was very repetitive and ultimately boring. How many times can one watch people snort coke, get drooly on Quaaludes, and have sex with prostitutes? How many smooth-skinned blondes with shaved privates are enough, and how many times do we have to watch mindless machismo and bonding? After the third or fourth scene of juvenile debauchery the excesses of the central characters become mind-numbingly dull. I recognized many attempts to inject a little of the magic of Goodfellas into the proceedings, which made me wish I was watching it instead of Wolf of Wall Street. Don't get me started on the film's attitude towards women (even aside from the aforementioned prostitutes.)The movie had a bit of humor, especially towards the end, but the characters were not developed and many chances to deepen the movie were missed. The movie came alive only in a few scenes, usually ones accompanied by music. It made me sad to see a director I admire making such a hash of it, and reputable actors trying valiantly to turn two dimensions into three.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"the magical duo of ""scorcese-caprio""","i have been waiting for this movie from the very moment the trailers were out . lets just say martin Scorsese's has the ability to create that anticipation and that is why he is a legend . nonetheless when the movie did arrive in the cinemas it was like my wedding day, i was awake from 5 in the morning to catch the 9 o clock show, the movie started and from the first 10 minutes itself the audience started laughing their a** out, the dialogues, it was punches after punches and you can see the ease with which every actor in every single frame perform,which takes you into their corrupt and drug infused world . i see lot of people complaining about the sex scenes in the movie , i say to them the scenes are their for a reason , Scorsese's have dealt with every detail in the movie and that makes ""wolf of wall street"" such an delight to watch. now lets talk about the whole controversy about the""movie glorifying bad habits"" ...its not , the movie is asking you to just witness the life of ""Jordon belfort"" and beauty about scorcese's direction is like other directors he is not judging the characters he is just being a spectator and telling us ,the viewers to choose our own fate,that we choose to be like what Jordon belfort was or what he is now it depend on the individual who is watching the movie . Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordon belfort is absolutely tremendous ,he has soaked each and every aspect of Jordan belfort ,his dialouge delivery is spot on especially the speeches .the other characters in the movie special mention to be made for Jonah hill and Margot Robbie who has perfected her Brooklyn accent in spite of being an Australian origin. my only complain if i have to is the length of the movie that could be cut short a little, but it does not matter when their is DiCaprio in the frame .. thank you Mr martin Scorsese's for giving us another treat to watch :):)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The best Scorsese/DiCaprio Movie ever!!!,All i want to say about The Wolf of Wall Street can be said in one wordEPIC!!!In my opinion it is DiCaprio's best performance till now.And this is also Mr. Scorsese's best movie since Goodfellas.Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey are also really good.Margot Robbie is also really good.I expect DiCaprio to finally win an Academy Award ( which has been due for long ) for his performance.It is true not everybody can watch this movie due to its content.Other than that it is a very nice movie and it will surely win a bunch of Oscars,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Enough Martin, enough already","I love Martin Scorcese. I am also Italian, so i feel simpatico of sorts with the man. But Jesus Christ, can he make a film not about excess, alpha males or the mafia? This film has no mob, but it has sex, drugs, and midget bowling. For three freaking hours. Good God, the last thing I want from a film is the sight of the supremely overrated Jonah Hill jacking off. I do not need to see that, no one does outside of a torture chamber. You know who loves this film? Fifteen year old teenagers. I know many because of teaching, and they think this movie is cool. So, congrats Martin you have made a film the glorifies Wall Street, excess and law breaking. As usual.

I consider it the best film of the 21st Century to date.,"A thousand years from now, when historians study the fall of the American empire, they will watch this tale of sex, drugs, money, power, corruption, greed... and will laugh their asses off. The movie is about indulging excess, and it's an indulging excess itself. I mean, a three-hour comedy? Are you kidding me? Who else can pull this off? This is a master, Martin Scorsese, at the top of his form. DiCaprio's impeccable comedic timing in this film cements him as one of the greatest actors of this generation (to me, comedy is far, far harder to do than drama. It's harder to make people laugh than you think). And don't get me wrong, this is a film of horrible people doing horrible things, and most people will be offended how this movie turns horrible things into laughs. That doesn't take away that it's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Save yourself 3 hours..... don't bother!,Painfully long - this could have been a 90minute movie with pace and precision - instead it was a 180minute nose bleed full of irrelevancy that should have been left on the cutting room floor.Really slack storytelling - key bits never explained or exposed and often rushed. Dull peripheral stuff laboured over for 20 minutes a time.Such an obvious plot - after the first 10 minutes you knew EXACTLY what was going to happen - and then it did and then finally you got to go home.This is a classic case of a A List actor and director being allowed to do just whatever they damn well wanted to do. They needed a really strong script editor and a real producer who wasn't going to put up with their prima donna nonsense. Overall a wasted opportunity - although Leonardo's performance was really pretty good which is where the 2 points come from.,2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Money is the Ultimate Drug,"I thought Scorsese owed me one after Hugo, which I really hated. TWWS only partly repays the debt of the two hours I lost to that previous film. It is a much better film than Hugo, but only a little more than half as good as The Departed, which, to be fair, was pretty darn close to being a masterpiece. TWWS is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio a broker who made a fortune selling penny stocks, which are stocks sold for companies so far down on the corporate food chain that they cannot get listed on the stock market. These stocks are appealing to a man who is as addicted to money as Belfort is, as they bring the prize of a fifty percent commission, though it comes at the expense of people who maybe cannot afford it as much as the more well-heeled whales of Wall Street. Along with his right hand man, Donnie played by Jonah Hill, Belfort makes a killing and lives the life of debauchery that his wealth affords him, which includes drugs, boats, houses, cars, and of course, women. His long rise and subsequent downfall at the hands of a dogged federal investigator, played by Kyle Chandler form the narrative arc of the film, which is fairly profanity laced and full of sex and rampant drug use. The performances from Leo and Jonah are excellent, and it is good to see Dicaprio finally in a movie where he actually escapes a sinking ship.A couple of problems I had: this movie is WAY too long. Because it goes three hours, it is of course not possible to maintain the level of energy it kept in the first half. I give a little bit of a pass now that I realize it is based on a true story. But still, it could really have benefited from a few less sales speeches from Belfort or a few less examples of bad behavior while on drugs. Speaking of the drugs: After the first few drug scenes, you start to get the point. Belfort is an addict. He does funny things while on drugs. But after a while, it starts to feel like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, with the ""look what I'm doing while I'm on drugs!"" punch line. It just seems like not all of these scenes were absolutely necessary. And much like other movies about somewhat unlikeable people (I'm thinking maybe Raging Bull), it is hard to root for anyone here. The characters give us an entertaining show, but at the end of the day, I have a hard time loving a film that I am not rooting for someone. This film is sure to earn nominations for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture, and I don't have a good argument for why that shouldn't happen. But that doesn't mean I have to love it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
My Favoite of 2013,"Martin Scorsese once again has done a fantastic job on making a remarkable film that will be appreciated 20 years from now. The story is obviously based on true story of a stock broker in Wall Street. Right out of the bat, this is absolutely a dark subject matter but colorful comedy story that makes you laugh your ass off. A lot of critics have complained it's just a repetitive and pointless film, well several things you need to concern, first if the nudity and profanity bothers you, this isn't your movie, and indeed, there is a lot of it in this film, and it gets worse and worse as the story goes along. However, you need to realize this shows the reality of these characters, it shows their greediness, it shows how the more they make money the greedier they become, and they want the same thing over and over again but just in bigger or stranger stage, it shows how much nothing matters to them, I mean absolutely nothing, it shows how much these people who used to be nothing now they are all everything and want everything with giving no crap to anybody else, that's the reason it can be repetitive to some people. The dialogue and narration are very smart and natural in this film, it's not just there to fill the gaps, and it's there to show the nasty nature of these greedy bastards and inside the protagonist mind. It shows how much fun these people were having and it's shown in hilarious and comic tone, but it's the truth, I personally think the laugh at these situations are more affective than in drama tones, be you ask yourself ""Am I laughing at someone's stealing money and ruining someone's life?"", the audience feel more guilty, and that's the point but it is not represented the usual and cliché way, which is why it's difficult for some to approach this with a comic tone. Regarding the performances, oh my lord, Leonardo DiCaprio brings his best performance of his career, prepare to be amazed by that; Jonah Hill absolutely deserves a nomination; Matthew McConaughey, oh my god, he's there in three or four scenes, and he kills it all - also I think he was getting prepared for Dallas Buyers Club; Margot Robbie astonishingly a beautiful and hot woman and talented actress, watch out for her in the next couple years – Aussie actresses are pretty talented honestly. The soundtrack fits the film so well, I just wish they would have released the end credit track that Matthew McConaughey hums, it's pretty awesome – FYI, that single improvise make two other scenes to be awesome in the final act. I also think the pacing and editing is absolutely fine; the three hours was gone quickly for me, I was so absorbed that I only looked at the time to make sure that I've been really laughing and enjoying this for 2.5 hours.Overall, this is my favorite film of 2013 and one of my favorite of all time. I had never laughed so hard in theater before (I almost rolled over or broke the front seat), I had so much fun watching this film that is unexplainable. To tell you the truth, that day I was all grumpy since the weather was all cloudy, insanely cold outside, and my cousins had left visiting me and my brother, so I thought I'd be bitching about it afterward, but this film changed my mood 180 degrees. I always read how people were critical about Stanley Kubrik's ""A Clockwork Orange"" or even ""The Shining,"" and look now, they're both appreciated and praised, and I think the same thing will happen to this film, so please be open minded and clever, then watch this awesome film. Since some critics are being crying baby to this film, I give the highest rating, 10/10, THANK YOU MR.SCORSESE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Leonardo DiCaprio will break his Oscar jinx,"Went to watch this movie all alone to ensure that I experience every bit of Scorsese's magic. Turned out to be one of the best movies I have watched in recent times. In addition, this movie excels in the black comedy genre.Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio has taken his acting to a whole new level in this one and no wonder Scorsese is interested in casting him time and again in his movies. A perfect 10/10 for Leo. In fact, almost every single actor has excelled in his or her role. Particularly, I loved Matthew McConaughey's role. It was short, yet his character and acting was very cool. The chick looks very hot. Yes, I am talking about Margot Robbie who plays the role of Noami, Leo's wife. My rating for the whole cast is 10/10. It was perfect.Narration + Screenplay: It is good. Not excellent. I don't think it can be compared to other gems of Martin Scorsese. However, it was not bad at all. The team has ensured that we stay interested in the story, and yes, they have succeeded. However, there are just 1-2 instances when you might feel that the movie is a bit longer than required. Especially in the second half. 9/10Direction: Rate Martin Scorsese? You must be kidding! 10/10Laugh riot? Not exactly! Not a laugh riot. But, a very sensible black comedy movie. It doesn't make us laugh by showing chaotic or funny senseless scenes. However, the movie wins big time by bringing on the screen, the right amount of humor at regular intervals. 9/10Would I recommend this movie? Hell, yeah! This is yet another classic from Scorsese and Leo.I hope and pray for Leo. Wish he wins the Oscar for his acting finally and breaks his jinx.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Di Caprio at his best,"This movie is supposedly based on the true story of Jordan Belfort. The screenplay is said to be adapted from the book of the same title by Jordan Belfort (Wolf of Wall Street). Reprising the role of Belfort is the ever-talented and perennially Oscar denied Di Caprio. This is perhaps the best movie role played by Di Caprio, who has come a long way from the lover-boy role in Titanic.The movie begins with Di Caprio joining a Wall Street stock brokerage firm that goes belly up in the late eighties ""Black Monday"" stock market crash. Belfort then joins a two-bit penny stock offering firm and turns it around. The first scene at the Penny stock firm is worth watching twice, as employees marvel at Di Caprio's sales pitch and perseverance in reeling in wary buyers. Scorsese is in his elements with amazing direction, as the movie showcases the rapid rise of Belfort into a multimillionaire who launches his own 'seedy' new stock brokerage company-'Stratton Oakmont.'The female leads are ably played by Margot Robbie (as Naomi, Belfort's second wife) and Christine Milioti (Belfort's first wife). The stand-out star of the movie other than Di Caprio is Jonah Hill. He has come a long way from ""Super Bad."" While Money Ball was a great introduction to Hill's acting chops, this could be his ticket to Oscar glory. Hill reprises the role of Belfort's partner -in-crime with aplomb. Their scenes of sharing banned substances are both hilarious and sad at the same time.Belfort soon realizes that the FBI are fast on his trail and makes more shady deals with Swiss banks to stash away his millions. While I don't want to give away the plot of the whole movie, this one by Scorsese is definitely worth a watch, once, if not twice. Oh, and how could I forget Matthew McConaughey. He plays the early career mentor for Belfort in a short but very meaty role.Enjoy the debauchery and the depiction of Wall Street brokers. One aspect that is unabashedly missing from the movie is the perspective of Belfort's victims. I need to read the book by Belfort to see how true Scorsese was in 'adapting' this book into the movie. The movie is not family friendly and has way too many adult sequences and serious substance abuse. If Di Caprio does not at least get nominated for an Oscar for this role, then there must be something wrong with the Oscar committee.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
You will enjoy it!,"I have watched a lot of movies about Wall Street and motivation. One of the latest movies I have seen are 'The Americans' and 'Boiler room'.Both movies are very motivational. Leonardo DiCaprio is awesome in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". He has spent hundreds of hours with Jordan Belford to know his character as best as he could.I have also watched motivational videos by Jordan Belford - this man is the best motivational speaker I've ever heard in my life. Motivator = a positive motivational influenceAmazing gestures, intonation and body language He's a perfect sales person - ,he can sell anything to anyone even if one doesn't need it at all! This is who I can call ""the master of his job"".How can you work 40 hours per week? · In my opinions it's - Insane. You don't have control of your lifeHow to motivate your people to work better?· Do you want to be rich? · Of course · In that company you will be rich These words are so awesome to motivate anyone!One of the best scenes in a movie is when Leonardo DiCaprio was driving a car after the drugs started to kick in , and he couldn't control his body. . My life has changed after this movie, I've started thinking about my life, what I could do do and how to improve.I think we all want to experience luxury life: money, expensive houses and yachts, and to be the Boss of our life. Sometimes people who have a lot of money and they can buy everything start taking drugs because despite having everything they need, they want to fill in the emptiness inside them I have compared two characters - Leonardo DiCaprio and Jordan Belford - and I was impressed.

A Movie about Wall Street Swindling Scum and the greed that enables them!! Easily not Scorcese's best or Leo's best,"You want to see a totally different performance or another facet of Leo as an actor,The Wolf of Wall Street is what you need to watch.This is not a usual Martin Scorcese movie.It simply had no meaning for me.It is a story of how a wise guy swindled money from the poor at first and worked his way up to the rich people.Leo is the alpha as usual.He leads the pack in The Wolf of Wall street.He is unusually funny,witty and is at ease when using the F word. Jonah Hill was second to Leo and also did a good job. And i saw this in a theater in India with an audience and it was still explicit.No wonder it was deemed NC 17 but later cut down to be rated R.One can only wonder how much drug sniffing,fondling women and F bombs that can have..I'm guessing no Oscar nominations for this one for Leo or are they going to be crazy enough to do it.

Incredible film! Dicaprio and Scorsese mesh better than ever!,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" will have you laughing, crying, and wondering what you were doing in the 1980's. Dicaprio becomes Jordan Belfort as Scorsese beautifully tells his tale. Jonah hill is as funny as Superbad except this time, he's a real character. The entire cast blend and convince so well that you'd never think this was a movie. It's a must see. As if this movie wasn't good enough already, there is more blatant nudity and drug use than ""Van Wilder"" ""Sex Drive"" and ""Breaking Bad"" put together. Scorsese and Dicaprio make light of these things so easily that you forget drugs are even harmful. The bottom line is that this movie does a fantastic job of telling a story about a wealthy stock trader who loses track of the important things through a haze of drugs, sex, and federal crimes. See it now, or forever hold your peace.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Powerhouse Movie from De Caprio and Scorsese !!!!!,"Martin Scorsese has always had an obsession with Robert De Niro initially as they have done 8 movies together and now the same continues with Leonardo Di Caprio, with the recent outing The Wolf of Wall Street being the fifth collaboration of Scorsese and Di Caprio.Scorsese's movies always have adapted the Narrative Style Screenplay maximum rather the Linear Screenplay where either the Protagonist or any other character associated to the story begins the narration. Raging Bull (1980), GoodFellas (1990), Casino (1995) and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) come under the Narrative Style Screenplay category.To begin with, The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) is based on the true life incidents of Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who comes to Wall Street in aim of making it big with money and finally ends traveling in path of greed and lust while creating his own stock broking company using all fraudulent methods to make quick money. This movie narrates his story of rise, downfall and salvation for his crimes. The biggest USP of this movie is its protagonist Leonardo Di Caprio who has not only acted, but lived the character of Jordan Bel fort in the movie and has completely shouldered the movie with his charismatic and riveting performance. His character is portrayed with sheer finesse from the scene where Jordan begins the narration of this story to the last scene where he begins his reformation.The scenes where Jordan first tricks a customer to invest for a fake company, the way he trains his new recruits on how to defraud the customers into investing to rob of their money and notably the complete scene sequence where the highly drugged Jordan reaches to his come from the country club to avoid getting caught by the police have been stunningly enacted by De Caprio, making this his career best performance.Scorsese has also done a brilliant job of extracting the required performances from the supporting cast which includes Matthew McConaughey, Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, Jean Dujardin and Jon Favreau makes a small cameo appearance. This movie has many scenes involving sexual content, excessive drug usage and its aftermaths and abusive language embedded in the dialogs of the movie and due to which this movie has been rated 'A' for viewing.You may have slight nostalgic feel from Scorsese's movie Casino, as some of the character references and their portrayal seems to be have been inspired from this movie. In Casino, Sam Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro) runs a Casino illegally with him being unlicensed whereas, Jordan in the Wolf of Wall Street runs a fake firm to make money in quick time. Ginger (Sharon Stone) in Casino is portrayed as a greedy, money loving and drug addicted character who aims at living a luxurious life rather than a responsible one and here Jordan takes the same role with the similar character shades in him with money addiction and excessive drug usage playing killjoy. If it's Nicky (Joe Pesci) in Casino, then it's Donnie (Jonah Hill) in The Wolf of Wall Street and the characters played by them in both movies have similar shades. If you are curious to know more, watch them both.Overall this movie is a Must watch for fans of Leonardo Di Caprio and a Highly Recommended Must Watch for fans of Art House Cinema and especially Ace Director Martin Scorsese.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One of my favorite films,"A great film that shows the the rise in power of Jordan Belford and his fall. It pulls you in with the fun and parties and then the fall from power. While some may see this as a criticism of this in finance, and it is, but it can be a warning for anyone. We all know someone from high school or college who got involved with parties and drugs and eventually fall on the wrong side of law enforcement.

Definitely not a fugazi but the real effin deal: Scorsese doing what he does best,"Well damn! This was most definitely not a fugazi but the real effin deal: Scorsese doing what he does best, telling the tale of seizing the American dream by any means necessary, be it legal or illegal, and the inevitable downfall that comes after trying to get too much of it.He's done it so well so many times before from ""Godfellas"" to ""Casino"" to ""Gangs of New York"", that you could say that Wolf of Wall Street is just repetition of the same formula – but it's a formula that works so damn well, it's just an absolute pleasure to watch. ""Wolf of Wall Street"" would be well worth the three hours even just for the performances: yes, di Caprio is on the roll as the rags-to-riches Jordan Belfort, but the film is filled with amazing performances in the smaller roles from McConaughey's manic mentor-like figure in the beginning to Jonah Hill as Belfort's best friend, pulling himself to major league from his previous mostly comic relief characters.But what makes WoWS perhaps even more relevant and worth while is the fact that it does not tell the tale of mobsters like so many of previous Scorsese bravuras, but of people in the finance business – of people who have had way more influence on the daily lives of people and the society at large than any criminal kingpins. And what sets Wolf of Wall Street apart from many other movies looking at the finance sector is that it doesn't at all try to analyze how the system works or show how the money is being ripped off. McConaughey's character Mark Hanna sets the tone in the very beginning by telling that Wall Street doesn't give a f**k about the people who invest their money – it's all about getting the dealer's share of the trade as it happens, no matter how crappy the stocks you are selling really are, and then heading for the next kill. With that notion, WoWS is free to focus on elaborating on the general debauchery of the people deep in the testosterone-coke-power-trip. And with all the dwarf-tossing, Ferraris, coked-up parties and nude hot bodies it does this so enjoyably that you can't wonder if certain people are going to look at this film as a how-to guide to dollar-fueled decadence – just as the real Jordan Belfort did look up to Gordon Gecko of ""Wall Street"" as a role model for his real-life version of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Excess vs. Access,"The Wolf of Wall Street is funny, coming from the much respected Martin Scorsese, a director I appreciate more and more as I get older it comes as a bit of a surprise. It's never meant to be taken too seriously, so if you're in the mood for something heavy and dark in subject matter and mixed with equal parts laughs humour, I have 3 hours for you to spend at the cinema. It doesn't really deserve any Oscar consideration (not that it matters), but it is a very well made film that will continue to exist, so you might as well sit down and enjoy it before it gets shoved in your face by the end of awards season.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a wonderfully physical performance that is a lot more over the top than anything he's done before, you still never forget you're watching DiCaprio, as is with Jonah Hill, but because their off- screen chemistry comes together on-screen there are no complaints in the acting category, though a nice bit of observation. In playing Jordan Belfort in his 24-36 year old period, it feels like the first time the baby-faced actor is playing too young. The Hollywood golden boy is finally showing physical signs of having grown up. This isn't something I'd dock the movie for, rather I see it as a positive indicator for DiCaprio's career arc.The only major complaint I would have about the film overall is that in being 3 hours of self-indulgence, and Scorsese and company being very aware of the themes of excess running throughout Jordan Belfort's life, the film almost doesn't feel worth the time the audience spends involved. It's a filmmaking paradox, which means it achieves it own means sometimes at the audiences' expense. This in turn is a major crime, that like the whole of the film and point of it, doesn't prove to be a major consequence.Rating: B/ +2",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
DId I miss the 90s?,"In the latest collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio (still with no love from the Academy), we get a glimpse into the world of high finance, high living, greed, decadence and corruption in the Wall Street of the 1980s. With Mr. Scorsese's usual excellent direction and Mr. DiCaprio's charisma, the 3 hour movie never pauses for a moment or allows the viewer to become bored.The plot is straight-forward without any surprises yet remains interesting on the sheer power of the director and the star. Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) starts as a straight-laced, young Wall Street broker eager for the things only money can buy. But after being laid off following Black Monday, Belfort learns about the world of finance removed from the glitzy world of Wall Street. Learning to take advantage of his salesmanship skills and the ignorance of the general populace (as well as the undermanned regulatory agencies), Belfort amasses a huge fortune illegally which he spends visibly and without restraint on drugs and women. When finally cornered by the FBI on his illegal activities, Belfort first chooses to fight before finally facing the reality that all is lost.The movie fully earns its R Rating for the record-setting number of F-bombs, as well as rampant drug use and graphic scenes throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Total disappointment,"The title of the film and its director were clearly enough to warrant seeing this one. But I was annoyed at how poor the acting was, and the incessant ultra-sharp close-ups of bad actors speaking mindless dialog made it too hard to watch more than the first half. While the storyline had a decent premise, its portrayal was shallow at best.There was almost no character development and no one you could identify with, which made it a bit better than a SNL skit. While the photography was good, it was put too bad use unless you like watching bimbos and greedy nerds frolic in cartoonish and gratuitous sex scenes.This wolf was a total dog.

Outragously good,"Genius!! Best film I have seen all year. Leonardo Di Caprio plays a magnificent roll in the quirky, hilarious, perfectly stupendous Wolf of Wall street. Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy. because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A comedy of the highest order,"It's safe to assume that you haven't seen anything like The Wolf of Wall Street before, Martin Scorsese's epic adaptation of Jordan Belfort's true life tale that you could literally call Wall Street on Crack. That we haven't seen anything like this before is a sure tell sign that what Scorsese and his leading man Leonardo DiCaprio have created is a black comedy unlike any other, a movie that brims with cracking dialogue and therefore acts as a stunning tale of greed, lust, drugs and excess.Directing a script written by key Boardwalk Empire collaborator Terrence Winter, WOWS sees Scorsese on a level we have arguably never seen him on before. Jumping into the tale with both feet and both arms (and wide rimmed glasses) WOWS sees the great spectacled Italian directing the movie with a feverish intensity that sees the 3 hour run time never outstay its welcome and gives the film an energy that is hard to describe for the those yet to see it. WOWS is a film that doesn't hold back, a film that doesn't care if you find it offensive or if in fact you find it appealing; its a film that Scorsese wanted to proudly display to you and say ""so what do you think of this?"". In a career that has so many peaks and so many varied hero's and anti hero's its not far fetched to say that WOWS is in the upper echelon of his films and is perhaps one of his bravest ever directional decisions, gone are many of his stylistic flourishes with the camera and in are scenes that crackle with mere dialogue (a scene played out upon Belfort's yacht with FBI agent Denham played by Friday Night Lights Chandler a prime example of this) and a comedic sense that even outplays Scorsese's great comedic tale The King of Comedy. If WOWS were to have been released in another year one gets the feeling that Scorsese would be getting primed to collect another well deserved statue come Oscar night, something you could say also of his leading man DiCaprio.A key player in getting the film off the ground, DiCaprio here in his 5th collaboration with Scorsese delivers what could well be the performance of his career in one that is littered with award quality turns. Whether delivering speeches, partaking in unsavory behavior (which has a major role in the film) or in one particular Country Club scene physical acting of the highest order, DiCaprio fully embodies the role of Belfort and is a commanding presence in a film that needed the audience to if not like, at least be interested in a main character who never really deserves our support or affections. With such a commandeering performance by DiCaprio it's Australia's very own Margot Robbie who stands up most in the supporting cast with her role as Belfort's second wife Naomi, it's a role that will unquestionably launch her into the big leagues. In the other main supporting turn I will be critical and say that Jonah Hill's turn as Belfort's business partner Donnie has been overrated and while not a bad turn is also not Oscar worthy, it could however just be his distracting fake teeth that look to pop out at you at any given opportunity.A movie that is not meant for everyone and a movie that doesn't look to give a definitive answer on what's right or what's wrong in a world that many would rather ignore, WOWS is a stunningly original movie that can be admired for pure unbridled insanity and at times breaking of the third wall between film and audience. It's a brave film, a daring one and a showcase for the great talent that is Leonardo DiCaprio. If you're willing to accept this particular Wolf into your life you will find much to enjoy, much to contemplate and much to cringe at and in the end that's rock solid proof that what we have here is a film that could one day be considered not only a masterpiece in its own right but the quintessential tale of what went wrong with humanity in this day and age of excess and partying.4 and a half Quayludes out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A movie about disgusting pigs.,There was not one character in this movie that I didn't despise. They were all absolutely disgusting and if anybody was going to become karma's bitch it would have been them. Their ego's are out of control for no reason. They're basically the equivalent of call centre operators or conmen. Their only skill is lying.I just don't know what to say because for what it was it wasn't a terrible movie but three hours of deplorable human behaviour is far too much. I got sick of seeing the same thing over and over again. It began to lose it's shock value and became uninteresting. After about forty minutes I was just holding out for the end of the movie when they finally get brought down.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Review ANA chan,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a riveting portrayal of ambition, decadence, and the moral abyss of Wall Street during the late 1980s and early 1990s. This 2013 film, based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, is a ferocious exploration of greed that leaves audiences both entertained and contemplative.From the moment the film begins, viewers are thrust into the extravagant, frenzied world of stock brokerage. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a career-defining performance as Belfort, embodying the character's charm and ruthless ambition with electrifying energy. His portrayal is both captivating and cringe-inducing, offering a window into the hedonistic lifestyle that comes at a steep moral price.Scorsese's direction is masterful, seamlessly blending dark humor with poignant commentary on the excesses of capitalism. The film's pacing keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, and its audacious use of narration enhances the storytelling, allowing us to delve deeper into Belfort's psyche. The script, peppered with sharp wit and biting sarcasm, captures the absurdity of the financial world with precision.The supporting cast is equally impressive, featuring stellar performances from Jonah Hill as the outrageous Donnie Azoff and Margot Robbie as the enchanting Naomi Lapaglia. Their dynamics add depth to the narrative, portraying the personal consequences of Belfort's greed and ambition. The film does not shy away from showcasing the darker themes of addiction and moral decay, yet it does so with a sense of humor that keeps the viewing experience exhilarating.Visually, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a feast for the eyes. The opulent parties, wild drug-fueled escapades, and lavish lifestyles are shot with a vibrancy that reflects the era's excess. Terence Winter's screenplay captures the zeitgeist of an age driven by monetary gain, presenting a cautionary tale wrapped in flamboyance.However, it's important to note that the film's unapologetic portrayal of Belfort's lifestyle raises questions about glorifying such behavior. While the narrative is undeniably entertaining, it also serves as a critique of a broken system that allows such excess to thrive. Scorsese invites us to reflect on the moral implications of wealth and success, leaving viewers with lingering thoughts long after the credits roll.In conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is an audacious and entertaining exploration of greed, power, and the consequences of unbridled ambition. Scorsese expertly crafts a film that is as thought-provoking as it is enjoyable, making it a standout in his illustrious career. Whether you're drawn in by the performances, the direction, or the sheer audacity of its story, this film is a must-watch that resonates well beyond the final scene.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"I'm a BIG Scorsese fan, but...","There have been big Scorsese productions that I wasn't particularly fond of, like Gangs of New York and The Age of Innocence, but this is a first: a Scorsese picture I actually disliked. Nothing can change the fact that Martin Scorsese is one of the great American film auteurs. His body of work is virtually unparalleled. But this picture is a big misstep for the great director. It is a failed satire, if indeed it was meant to be a satire. It's overlong, overwrought, and ultimately boring. He means to show us something about wretched excess, I suppose, but he fails to create a single character about whom we might give a damn, except for the antagonist, and in the end all you can do is yawn and be happy it's over.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One Crazy Movie,"1.Well to be frank this is one crazy movie, I haven't seen a movie with so much craziness. 2.It seemed to be more than reality to me at one point.The taking of the movie was brilliant and the screenplay was different. 3.I wouldn't have thought anyone better than Leonardo DiCaprio for this role. He played the role brilliantly. 4.It was he who carried out the movie completely.If it was not him, the movie wouldn't have been any better. 5.The narration was not so different, it was a routine. 6.The work of cinematography can be clearly seen, it was distinct in it's way. 7. Altogether I should say the crew worked so hard to portray the reality of the character so much. 8.

Brilliance!!!,I have not seen many Martin Scorcese movies in the past but this one just blew my mind away. The story of this movie is pretty interesting and will keep you hooked to the screen till the end. The movie is a bit long but I did not feel like I wanted the movie to end at all.Leonardo Dicaprio delivers another amazing performance. He seems to make every movie he does look so good. Jonah Hill has also given another amazing performance after Moneyball. Margot Robbie has also shown some fine acting skills and might become a good actor in the future.Thoroughly enjoyed this movie even with the abundance of foul language in the movie.

Fear and Loathing on Wall Street - The Alphas have it in Scorseses controversial comic take on Financial high piracy.,"In the fantasy novel ""The Blade of Justice"", the warlike pirate Ganoolite raiders have a religion whose main sutra states ""Life belongs to those strong enough to live it. Weakness is born to be crushed while those born with strength will thrive. Strength in unity! Strength in comradeship!"" In many ways Belfort and his 'raiders' resemble them a great deal, and the Ganoolite mantra might not just be theirs, but of the film itself.Imagine what a screwball comedy written by Ayran Rand might look like, and you have a pretty good idea of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", a highly fictionalised and romanticised account of the life and times of infamous crooked bonds dealer Jordan Belfort. Scorsese has, to his great credit, never been one to condemn or judge, but to sit back and observe the power play and rules of the game of the enclosed and exotic worlds he peers into, whether it is the Cosa Nostra or Victorian society, Tibetan monks or Civil war era New York. There are no real villains in his world, for even the darkest and most vicious human being is shown to have a soul and a personal code, and it is perhaps for this reason that his films have been so consistently refreshing and rich.That rule applies here, as Belfort and his financial 'raiders' defy the beliefs of both right and left, strive for nothing but the gratification of their own needs, and rob many people rich and poor of great sums of money to pay for them. They would be out and out villains in any other film or book, (just as the cast of ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"" would in most conventional thrillers) but Scorsese has again turned the picture around 180 degrees so we see it from their viewpoint.The film's message seems to be that in any world and any time there will be the 'Alphas', the men and women who are stronger, smarter, more capable, then there will be the rest. No matter where they start off, these 'Alphas' will rise to the top and dominate the others because that is their natural destiny in the Evolutionary cycle. In other times and societies, they would be bandits, pirates, raiders, war bands, but in American capitalism they are Wall Street hustlers. They behave like pirates, celebrating their natural superiority and engaging in ever more insane and dangerous acts of machismo and bravado to show they do not live by the same fear and apprehension of their inferiors. They worship their war leader Belfort with almost fanatical devotion, aware he has taken them from the gutter into the stars, and he in turn is protective of his war band, seeing in each and every one of them the same spark of brilliance he possesses. Around this ever growing band of 'Alphas' are the inferiors, such as the dim recruits who fail the 'sell me a pen' test, the limp wristed Gay butler who is caught with his hand in the till, the weedy would be raider who cleans his fish tank on a big day, or the superficial shoe designer roped in for a scam, or Belfort's slutty trophy wife Naomi, and even to an extent eager FBI agent Patrick Denham (the hero in most other accounts but here almost a destructive inhibitor of natural selection). They are humiliated and denigrated, shown to be weak and valueless besides the Alphas. Like it or not this is a true fact and it is a brave author indeed who dares propose it in these times, especially using a relatively recent true life story to tell it.""TWOFWS"" is however quite un-Scorsese like in its style, which is blackly comic and defiantly un-PC. In many ways it resembles last years ""Pain and Gain"", though even less judgemental and even more applauding of its characters vices. There are laugh out jokes aplenty of various styles and kinds, including a post marriage bliss scene between Belfort an Naomi that seems ripped from the 1930s screwball comedies so beloved of the film historian. The heavy use of drugs is also made light of, and the comedy veers from 'Cheech and Chong' territory to one extended scene which comes straight out of Gilliam's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (another film this recalls) featuring an accidental overdose of heavy duty pills, a Lamborghini and Popeye. However there are also some dark moments, the darkest of which is the breakdown of the Belfort's marriage, where neither party exactly covers themselves in glory and the screaming child between them is the confused terrified victim (hope they used clever editing for that?)Technically the film is great, with good cinematography and music (as you would expect) and the acting all round is top grade. De Caprio evokes compassion and support for someone who should not have it, Jonah Hill continues his rise, bringing his comedy skills into the mix, Margot Robbie excels as Naomi., likable and hateable at once, and Kyle Chandler plays the FBI straight arrow well, teetering between hero and villain. Also of note are Matthew McConaguhey who plays the wall street broker that teaches young Jordan the ropes and conveys the film's whole message in his Native American style 'war chant' before and after a 'raid'. ""The Artist"" Jean Dujardin plays a slimy Swiss banker, Rob Reiner plays Belfort Senior, and the UK's national treasure Joanna Lumley is Naomi's sexy older lady aunt.This is not a film for everyone, but it is a brave one, and an extremely funny and entertaining one for those with 'the strength to live it.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Although it may not seem like it, it hides many recurring religious themes in Scorsese's work.","I'm not sure how many times I have seen this film since I first watched it at the age of 14. At that time, I overlooked many aspects, idealized Jordan Belfort, and made foolish statements about wanting to be like him when I grew up. I did not understand the social context of the film nor could I imagine the real-life repercussions of Jordan's actions. I believe this is a common phenomenon with this film: amidst the chaos, excess, prostitution, and all manner of illicit acts imaginable within a work environment, a deeply moralistic and realistic story about adulthood and the reality of the business world is told.There is a scene that I particularly enjoy: Jordan gives $25,000 to a woman so that she will allow herself to be shaved bald before starting an extravagant party, almost like a rite. After Jordan hands her the money, she stands up, hairless, but with $25,000 in her pocket. Her face reflects a certain alienation; she appears as if she has had a paranormal experience. Many times, Jordan's meetings with his employees resemble more of a religious sect gathering than a business meeting. I believe the expression on this woman's face encapsulates the sentiment conveyed by the film: the enslavement and eternal dependence on money in the real world. The only thing that can make us act unusually and cross our own moral lines is money. Like a religion, money can control and change your life. As Jordan states, it can shape your thoughts; you can absolve your sins with money. With enough money, you can play God, just as Jordan did. This story is about the religion of money, and we all, unwittingly, pay homage and enjoy these rituals portrayed in the film; we are all part of this religion.Scorsese consistently addresses religious themes in his films in very clever ways. I am not religious at all, but Scorsese's films always prompt me to question these themes, and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is no exception. This woman has just received the ""divine blessing"" from the congregation's pastor (Jordan); hence her expression of alienation. She is astonished; a financial miracle has just occurred in her life. Who knows how many people lost their jobs? How many families were deceived? How many parents lost their savings? No one cared; they were just getting rich. That is the true objective of these characters and many people in real life.As I grew older and recognized the power and significance of money in the real world, this film becomes increasingly brilliant each time I watch it. With the blind faith in capitalism, the preacher-like voice of Jordan Belfort, and the excessive cult of money, it seems that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a more religious film than many others that claim to be so. Beyond being a moral compass regarding Jordan Belfort's life, I simply aim to present my perspective on this story-one of the first films I remember watching that ignited my passion for cinema. I continue to discover films like this, which delve into the depths of human thought and explore the moral boundaries of society.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Amazing!!! Leonardo Dicaprio is incredible!!!!,"West: The Wolf of Wall Street 9/10- Think of the best Leonardo DiCaprio movie you have ever seen, now multiply it by infinite and take it to the depths of forever. Now you have a glimpse at how this movie will play out. I have never seen a movie like this before, it is the most dynamic and energetic movie I have ever seen.I do not understand why this movie did not get better reviews. Some people may have thought that it had no class and was vulgar with unnecessary language, but they should know that Martin Scorsese films have never just tried to be good while staying on the same line that all other movies do so that it is deemed acceptable to all. No, Scorsese sees that line and says the hell with you line, I will do what I want. He achieved greatness with this movie by doing so.I guarantee that no one in this movie was playing themselves, but they fooled everyone. They could fool themselves to believing that they were these unpredictable, drug addicted stock brokers who broke every financial law in America. Leonardo DiCaprio is probably the one of the few actors in Hollywood right now who has been great in every movie he has been in. He just has the raw talent that is necessary to number one. He delivered the best performance of his magnificent career in this film playing the once legendary stockbroker Jordan Belfort. He delivered a perfect New York accent and the way he was able to show all of the different versions of the character he had was truly amazing. I have given this a lot of thought and I think this might be the best performance I have ever seen in the history of cinema. I honestly feel bad for Jonah Hill because he gave the best performance of his career as well but when you put him right next to Leo, Jonah Hill's performance looks like a first grade school play. Still, credit should be given to Jonah Hill because I firmly believe that only a few people could play this role as well as he did. Jonah's performance in The Wolf of Wall Street is a million times better than his performance in Moneyball. Aside from those two, who were really the only people who were in the movie consistently, the acting decent. I do not think that anyone else in the movie did a bad job, but when you have a three hour movie and someone is in there for twenty minutes such as Matthew McConaughey, it's just not memorable. McConaughey still did the absolute best he could with the screen time he was given.The Wolf of Wall Street was not just some hard core drama biopic either. If you are a person, you will be nearly on the floor laughing throughout this whole film. Some jokes may cross the line for some people, in fact probably a lot of people, but if you anything about the real Jordan Belfort, this plot is an understatement. The one thing I will say though is that there are a couple of scenes that are not really useful to the plot or understanding the characters, but still, even The Godfather wasn't perfect.I wish Leonardo DiCaprio would win an Oscar for this film like he deserves, but sadly the Academy probably will not give him one because it as I have said before, just crosses too many lines that some critics deem disrespectful.Nonetheless, I believe that if you have a good sense of humor and are open-minded, I think this film will amaze you.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The most entertaining and thrilling flim ever!,"Leonardo DiCaprio's acting in this film may just be his best performance ever! God, I was hooked on the screen for the whole 3 hours and didn't even move a muscle. This film was raw, charismatic and just so incredible in every way possible. The 100 million cost was so worth it: the film was mesmerizing and beautiful. While being based on Jordan Belfort's book with the same name, the movie is able to apply its own touch of beauty even while closely using the source material. All the performances were freaking incredible to say the least. This movie, in my opinion, should have given Leonardo his Oscar instead of Revenant (also great movie).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"needs a sharper, more precise scalpel","A young man gets power drunk on money, and the drugs and sex it affords him, while manipulating stocks and shares.The Wolf of Wall Street is in one sense Goodfellas transported to a different arena. Adrenaline junkies do bad things to achieve their high, abuse drugs and women along the way, and then give up their erstwhile allies to avoid a harsh prison sentence, all the while regretting not their bad deeds, but the fact that they have to live like ""ordinary schmucks.""This parallel narrative has its good points, as The Wolf of Wall Street has the same outrageous behaviour, quiet malevolence, and absurd comedy as the gangster flick. Where is falls down is that it over-indulges those excesses in repetition - every time they sell stocks it is basically the same scam. There is too much speechifying; Jason says the same thing, and too much of it, in every speech. The film also fails to show the social ramifications of Wall Street malfeasance. Scorscese is drawn to characters who live in excess, and in doing so both enthrall and appall. Unfortunately, he seems taken in by Jordan, when a little bit more objective distance might have layered this narrative in a more satisfying way. There is a small flavour of this at the end, with the FBI agent's gaze on the subway train. However, it is a fleeting moment of an element that needed to be laced in more. Notwithstanding the fact that Jordan's amoral deeds are laid bare, we are to a certain extent invited to sympathize with him, by virtue of the amount of time he spends on screen and the exclusion of time given to the consequences of his actions.With Goodfellas Scorscese re-invented the mafia film, but The Wolf of Wall Street, while being an entertaining ride, does not give us anything that Wall Street, or even Rogue Trader, has given us already, except with less pomp.In short a good, but not great addition to Scorscese's oeuvre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Wolf of Wall Street,"The Wolf of Wall Street, which is Martin Scorsese's new film based supposedly on a true story and book by Jordan Belfort, is not only the single worst film I have seen in 2013 so far, but it is also one of the worst films that I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The film sounded interesting enough as I have an interest in wall street and the business world and more times than not I have enjoyed Martin Scorsese's films and Leonardo DiCaprio as well as their collaborations together, but this film just did not work. First off, I think that this is one of the most vulgar and profane films that I have ever seen. I would actually be curious to know how many profanities were uttered during the course of this film because it must have been an awful lot because there was barely a minute that went by without someone cursing. Besides the filthy language and lots of it, the film showed the lifestyles these characters lived and showed in graphic detail all the immoral and perverse things that they were up to. Basically this was the whole of the film, showing a bunch of spoiled an arrogant rich people behaving badly with no real message, or anything to wrap the film up with. The film was just endless excess and then some. I have seen a lot of films over the years including some that have objectionable content of varying degrees and styles and usually unless it is done in a certain way, I do not let it bother me, but for The Wolf of Wall Street, it felt like there was no point to it and the whole objective of this film was to be loud, crude, rude and vulgar. To be honest I am shocked the film did not receive an NC-17 rating. I guess I was not the only person to have felt this way because people actually left during the screening I was in for this movie and I read that during an official screening of the film with cast and crew, someone actually went up to Scorsese and said ""Shame on you!"". I wish I could have said the same thing right to his face. This is the type of film that I absolutely hated so much that I wish my friend, who very kindly paid for the tickets for the movie, would have asked for his money back because this film was almost 3 hours of my life that I will never get back, 3 hours I could have spent doing something better, or seeing a much better film. I am personally really surprised at the high ratings the film is getting and also all the awards nominations as well. Did they see the same film I did? To me though, there was nothing that made this film special at all. Every single character was loathsome, so to say I admired the acting would be hard for me to say, seeing as I did not care about any of these characters and after awhile they got on my nerves and I just wanted the film to be over. The film's screenplay was just excessive bad behaviour and wild living with no moral, or point to it, other than just showing it and going as far as they can with the content and hoping that the audience has a wild and fun time with it, which I didn't. Also the film was way too long. At almost 3 hours in length sitting through this monotonous and vulgar bore was actually painful. I sat and squirmed in my seat and wished for better lighting in the theatre, so that I could check my watch to get a rough idea of when this piece of trash would be over. Alas, I sat patiently and this film would just not end. The editing was all over the place and there were scenes in this film that had no point of being in there and others just went on for way too long. The film is being classified as a comedy, but I do not think I laughed once. Often it's attempt at humour, or trying to make me laugh was just scenes that I found awkwardly executed and filmed and they looked clumsy and poorly done. The whole film felt like it was made during a college fraternity party and written and made after everybody had probably way too much to drink. This is certainly a major disgrace for Martin Scorsese, the man behind such classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. I didn't think with all his talent that he could make a film this bad, but he proved me wrong. Unfortunately, people are going to go and see this film and probably kick a big kick out of it for all the wrong reasons. I will certainly throw a fit if this wins any major awards over much better and deserving films this year though. As it stands, The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that I hope to never see ever again in my whole life and it was a rare occasion where I saw a film where I wanted a complete refund from the theatre chain. The absolute worst film of 2013 and don't make the same mistake I did by paying, or sitting through it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Standard cool-guy movie,"Despite the title, I do like this movie!

The Wolf on Wall Street,"Based in the 1980's, The Wolf on Wall Street follows Jordan Belfort, a starting up stock broker in New York. When the firm he is working at crashes on Black Friday, he is thrown to the curb with almost nothing to survive on. When he applies for another job, he discovers the excellence made off of penny-stocks and from there, it is a roller coaster ride of adrenalin rushed cocaine fun.Now, understandably, there is controversy surrounding the film. Citing that is making awe-too good out of a horrible situation, that is emphasizing drug-usage and prostitution, and other sorts of illegal activity. Now, I must say in someway I agree with the controversy.Back when Django Unchained came out, I defended the film, in a post Sandy Hook environment, the filmmakers had absolutely no percussing knowledge of the tragedy, so I stood behind the film. But this is a film that I can say that they know of the situation, and they are glorifying it.So this is where things get touchy; are the emphasizing it to notify it, or to have fun with a bad situation. Now, you are more than welcome to see either which way. Personally, I'm kind of torn on which way the cookie crumbles. But, from the environment and tone that the film presented in it's nearly 3 hour run-time, I'd say both.I did in fact see this film as a parody of it and I mean a classic parody. Like Mel Brooks parody. What they did was they took a devastating situation and shined a different light on it.Now, with the cast involved, people would have come out of the theaters commenting they didn't seize the opportunity they had at hand, if it was looked upon from another, more serious view point. So, either which way, people are going to come out peeved off.The film is narrated and stars Leonardo Dicaprio, in one of the best roles he has to date. What the filmmakers do is a Ferris Bueller type of narration, in which he would notify the camera and actually talk to it.The film also has an amazing supporting cast, with Johnah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Jordan's right hand man through out most of the film, Kyle Chandler as an FBI agent on Jordan's tale through out the second and third act of the film, Rob Reiner in one the best comedic roles to this date, and a cameo of sorts from Matthew McConaughey. All of whom knock it straight of the park.The slightest nit pick I have is the way they took the narration though. In some scenes he's notifying the camera and in others, he was just doing it in his head. Another thing I would like to bring up is how self invested it got the drugs and sexual innuendo.

One of the most hilarious and ambiguous films ever,"No wonder, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the greatest hits this year, with all the controversies going on about its content, some claiming it a feast of profanities, a film without any message and a torn of the moral values. Others, claim it to be a masterpiece, and hilarious and entertaining all the way through, some even go as far and say it's one of the greatest films ever made well, it's very subjective what is a good and what it's a bad film, the only thing we can judge and evaluate for real it's the artistic merits. And well, since that a comedy is always played for laughs, so in fact, this film deserves a thumbs up. But no wonder(as well), this film has some kind of distorted notion of morality for some people, and I really can't put the fault of them, because if this film isn't glorifying what Belfort did, it's not bashing or judging it either(like most films do with their despicable villains). It's just showing how dirty he is and how everything works. Of course, excellent acting by Leonardo Dicaprio. His performance was thunderous and powerful, required to interpret someone that was 90% of the time under the effects of cocaine. Funnily enough, I still not figured out what this film main intention is. The profanities on it is what may bother some people, since that it has really a lot of swearing, it's almost impossible to heard two lines in a row without them. I kinda liked Jonah Hill as well, he was disgusting and certainly it's his best performance by far. Everything works well into the film. But as you can see, worth noting, I still not figured out what is this film about. I hope there is something more than just showing how the dirty world of the Wall Street works. For now, it's kind of an incognita. Being said, it's a good comedy film, with some hilarious scenes, and a good watch if you don't mind with the language (if there is a real complaint about this film, language is it, for sure, and I find worth noting to say that it's really strong). 8.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
SELL THIS PEN TO ME!! this small quotation contrasted  the whole 180 min Film..Scorsese's best directorial and Leo's best performance!!!,"I'd like to thank first to Jordan Belfort for writing his Memoirs and now its become a major motion picture and we gotta chance to know about Jordan Life..even he was in jail for 4 years..it didn't go waste but he was writing his biography and people require to see this..forget about bad behavior and drugs addiction..everyone does that when it comes to have money..we just don't see them..I'm so inspired by his empowering quotation.I must tell this is the best Scorsese's film since Goodfellas..nobody could done it better than he did..Three hours of Film length just flew away like sands..I don't even realize how the film came to the end..the story doesn't have any dull moment that you might get bored. Directing, Scripts, acting, editing, production design and Cinematography are 10/10.Opening sequence of Leonardo as Jordan Belfort is portrayed very detailed and shaped well about Belfort attitude and life style.And the film went on flashback about how he started. Every level of the story depth was built in a very unique way that I just left on wondering every moment of the sequences.I would say only one thing for Leonardo DiCaprio that he deserve the Oscar.When it comes to Matthew McConaughey part, even he just appeared for the small sequence , he literally become the shadow of the whole film. His character was huge inspiration for Jordan. Even its seem small role for him, he has big reflection to the film. As Scorsese vision, he know exactly how to create an illusion in the audiences mind without existing in real.Then it comes to Jonah Hill..He turns out great in this film that you can't even imagine. Nobody could have done that character better than him. He is hilarious and faithful to his character.Its good to see Margot Robbie in this film since Pam Am America.The film would be her greatest chance to approach completely challenging character as like you see previous Scorsese's films such as female protagonist in Raging Bull and Casino.Moreover, the cast is fantastic including nowadays influential director Rob Reiner, Spike Jonze and Jon Favreau.Terence Winter screenplay is also powerfully written according to his best knowledge of Stock Business. And Scripts fell exactly into the right man Martin Scorsese.Cinematography and Editing style is fascinating especially in the boiler room. I always like the Scorsese's vision of cinematography as one single shoot without cutting such as in Goodfellas and Hugo. There is the one scene it was took exactly like that Camera move forth and back in one complete shot.It was beautiful. All the entire sequence of stoker broker making millions of phone call is beautifully juxtaposed and transited. Editor (Thelma Schoonmaker) and Scorsese are the best collaboration since over decades.Sex, Drugs, Wild party and I would say ""Orgies"": No comments at all..those are the most craziest moments ever portrayed on the big screen according to Scorsese Career. I wouldn't mind it all. It was truthful to the book of Jordan Belfort. Some people might fine it offended..but I would say its normal..people do crazy staffs all the time. That's what I like about Martin Scorsese that He's so dedicated and devoted for what he's doing..He doesn't feel hesitate to portray exactly what he imprinted in his mind. In real life, we normally hide those situations even if we did. I don't mind for that. Film is not about hiding the reality..but it's the mirror of human language, behavior and thought. People require to see that depend on age level.To wrap it up, I would like to say what's make Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest director of all time. It can be found in this film based on the two powerful moment;1. Subway Sequence: FBI officer is reading newspaper and wondering people on the train.2. The Ending: Sell this pen to me..That is all I have to tell about directorial. If you are going to deconstruct the sequences, you will find out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
More More More,"Greetings again from the darkness. A brilliant and expertly made film that is excruciatingly painful to watch, yet impossible to look away. That would be my one line review. Of course, that line could be followed by a 10 page essay, to which I won't subject you. How to do justice to this extraordinary three hours of excess and debauchery? How to give due credit the craftsmanship of director Martin Scorcese? How to acknowledge the pure physicality and kinetic energy of Leonardo DiCaprio's performance? How to heap praise on a project so lacking in morality and decency? There are no easy answers to these four questions, but there is plenty to discuss.Let's be clear. This is a vulgar film telling the disgusting story of a crude and egotistical scam artist who defrauded many innocent people. Jordan Belfort's autobiography serves as the source material for the screenplay from Terrence Winter (The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire). Leonardo DiCaprio (in his fifth collaboration with Martin Scorcese) portrays Belfort as the talented stock broker who soaks up lessons from both his mentor and the real world stock market crash of 1987. That Black Monday led him right into the world of penny stocks and huge commissions. Those commissions and his stunning sales skills take right into a world that rivals that of Caligula or Fellini's Satyricon.Sex. Drugs. Rock and Roll. Sorry, that's not enough for Belfort. He is also driven by money, greed, power and the need to take advantage of the weak. I lost count, but surely Belfort displays more than seven deadly sins. Everything is extreme. Nothing in moderation. Belfort is both smart and stupid. He is the worst of human nature, and when combined with his charisma, becomes very dangerous. Watching him give his invigorating and over-the-top pep talks to the team recalls the cult evangelists we have seen over the years. His religion is money and winning ... never accepting ""no"". His followers eat it up.While most of the movie is pedal to the metal, there are two exceptional scenes that really stood out. When a young, eager, new to Wall Street Belfort has lunch with his mentor (played by Matthew McConaughey), we sense him soaking up the lessons ... we see the wheels turning to a new way of thinking. McConaughey is in top form here. The other standout scene takes place aboard Belfort's yacht as he interacts with the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler. This agent is the closest thing to a moral barometer the movie allows and this dance of dialogue and acting is pure cinematic magic.Jonah Hill as Belfort's business partner is his physical opposite, and possibly even less morally-centered than Belfort. He is also extremely funny in a demented way. Three very talented film directors have supporting roles. Rob Reiner (in a rare acting gig) plays Belfort's bombastic dad and firm accountant. Jon Favreau is the high priced attorney fighting off the SEC and FBI. Spike Jonze plays the boiler room manager who first schools Belfort on penny stocks, and sets the wheels in motion. There is also a very sexy, funny performance from Margot Robbie as Belfort's second wife.My words don't do justice to the manic existence and frenzied scenes of sex, profanity and drug use. The black comedy mixed in prevents this from being the bleak portrayal that it could have been, but don't underestimate the depths to which the characters will stoop to get what they want. This one makes a similarly themed American Hustle look like a Disney flick. Consider yourself warned ... and don't think you can just look away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
What a great Movie!,"I wasn't really sure what to expect when we picked this movie after reading some reviews that said it was like soft porn or too intense with nudity and drugs. I thought it was extremely entertaining. I was engaged the the whole movie. Leo did such a great job on playing the role of Jordan B. There are some intense scenes with drugs and nudity, but when you read about Jordan's life, this movie was about his life. I loved the movie! When you are portraying someone's life you need to not leave anything out. Truly crazy to know what had happened on Wall-street during this time. I just couldn't believe what went on! I recommend seeing this movie, it isn't for the faint of heart though!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Lame camera work,"I give it a 6. Mainly for the entertainment value. Martin Scorsese does have a knack for good quotes and some interesting dialog, he also pushes his characters into climaxes we may not see in other movies, I like this. But overall, the story was week and did not develop very deeply. I do believe the cast was right for this movie and Leo did a good job. He is really looking and sounding like a younger Jack Nicholson in some of this movie. The cinematography was the biggest disappointment for me. I am very much into lighting and shot design when it comes to the big screen and though there we a few shots that were good, most of it seemed like a repeat of other movies, nothing new and mesmerizing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's worst effort ever.,"I would just like to say that I got absolutely nothing out of the viewing of The Wolf Of Wall Street. It is easily the worst effort ever from Martin Scorsese. The story line is almost non existent , DiCaprio is just a loser with a loud mouth, and all the surrounding characters are one dimensional. I don't see any moral battle being fought, I don't care about seeing hookers, lots of drugs being taken , or stupid parties, very boring. The real role model in the story cites his hero's as Gordon Gekko of Wall Street, Don Johnson of Miami Vice, and Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, what a completely shallow loser, even in todays bottom feeding America. The whole effort is simple B movie territory, not just because of the 80's and 90's settings. Couple this film with American Hustle, and you have a pretty awful state of 2014 film-making.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Quaalude Overdoses and Midget-Throwing: A Martin Scorsese Picture,"Very likely being an avid follower of Martin Scorsese's works and even more likely to be particularly fanatical about his most accessible and recent films, you were right in expecting a total reflection of the GoodFellas/Casino formula and style---machine gun cutting, swooping camera, characters bursting through the fourth wall like wrecking balls, monster production scope and a soundtrack like a jukebox on speed, all to get us high on our complicity in the excessive debauchery of the characters and their fast-paced lifestyle---and it is indeed awesome. But it is also amazingly effective as a slapstick comedy, loaded with outrageous and absurd laugh-out-loud set pieces.I say amazing because Scorsese has never done scenes like that and DiCaprio has never even done a comedy before. Scorsese has, but the hilarity here is not in the same vein as The King of Comedy. Or After Hours. It's much broader, goofier and unexpected, as demonstrated in several epic comic tours de force throughout. And it's that very sense of absurdity that makes its commentary on American capitalistic gluttony whole. You know exactly what movie you'll be seeing, but you'll be cheating yourself out of one hell of a ride if you don't see it. It clocks in at three hours but you still won't really want it to end. The movie is as outsized, excessive and compulsive as its title character is.Money here is not just the root of all evil. It's the total disintegration of any and all traces of decency, at the throbbing heart of which is DiCaprio's character, Jordan Belfort, a real-life stock trader so outrageously shameless and blind to his routine corruption that he virtually appears to be sympathetic, even chivalrous. Belfort couldn't care less whether his clients made money, so long as his share was complete. And like the oligarchs running the country now, his forte was defrauding the the struggling working man who he jockeyed into investing in third-rate penny stocks. Even his sweet first wife is feeling enough to wonder why he marks people who can't afford to be conned. Her civility gets in his way and she's promptly usurped by a blonde lingerie model.Scorsese's always able to take hard-to-like characters and look at them without judgment, then somehow never have a single dull moment no matter how long he has us watch them. In this case, unabashed farce is the key to it working as a commentary on the absurd overload of greed in this country and how disconnected the super-rich are from their actions and how they affect other people. It also has the most enjoyable and random cast I've seen in a long time, and almost certainly Jonah Hill's finest hour (or three).Sure, Jordan Belfort begins as a mild-mannered kid with a dream, refusing lunchtime martinis and all, but most of us start out with a soul and a sense of self-control, until we reach a level so rarefied and powerful that you never see any consequences or hardships, and you're cushioned and gratified so completely in a world of leisure and lavishness that whether or not you put the country in debt or screw a few working-class people doesn't really feel like it makes much difference.As long as the class divides are that wide, that will always be the case. We are constantly baffled by the total lack of conscience in the actions of the 1% and the politicians they puppeteer, but at the same time they honestly must feel that underprivileged people are that way because they choose to be, or simply aren't as smart as them. It's a catch-22 and the only thing we can do, Scorsese says, is laugh at it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
DiCaprio and Scorsese are the Wolves of Hollywood.,"There's a certain magic that director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio bring to the table when they are penned together for a film. The raw acting ability of DiCaprio could make even the dullest character seem interesting, and Martin Scorsese's directing style could make any script pure entertainment. In The Wolf of Wall Street, these two men are the showstoppers of arguably the best movie of 2013.The movie centers around the true story of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who's rise to power and wealth through securities fraud and money laundering led to his arrest in the late 1990's. It's a fantastically compelling story, and thanks to the mastermind that is Martin Scorsese, this story that most likely shouldn't be viewed as entertainment for its criminal roots, is made an absolute blast to watch. The 3 hour run time of the film at first seems like a heavy burden for this movie to carry, but the time is spent perfectly on delivering every detail possible. Nearly half of the film is spent providing background story of Belfort's life, and in the end, the extra character and story development give this movie a deep and very real plot that clings to you. The themes that are delivered in this movie are powerful to say the least, making you think about everything you thought you knew about crime and corruption on Wall Street. As a true story, this film grabs your attention and never lets go, seizing any idea you thought you had about crime stories and vamping them up to new heights.Any movie with massive amounts of sex, profanity and drug use are bound to be criticized, and with the plot showing the glorification of crime, The Wolf of Wall Street is the front runner for criticism. However, with every outrageously adult scene comes an abundance of entertainment and laughter. Belfort and company perform countless explicit acts, and director Martin Scorsese is able to take these acts and turn them into hilarious moments fueled by the ridiculous amount of drug consumption, profanity and sexual content in the film. The bottom line is that this movie is wildly fun to watch, with a high entertainment level intact the entire time.In my personal opinion, and in the minds of many more, Leonardo DiCaprio is the best actor in the world who has not won an Oscar. All I can say, is that if The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't earn him that award, I'm not sure what else can. There are endless amounts of words I could use to describe DiCaprio's performance. Captivating, exquisite, phenomenal, enthralling, etc, etc. DiCaprio shows his sheer ability to take any one character and create one who is developed beyond belief, with the ability to make you feel any emotions he displays, no matter what they may be. DiCaprio's character, Jordan Belfort, is a highly uncontrollable drug and sex addict whose lust for money and power often drives him over the edge of reality. We've seen DiCaprio portray some crazy and unique characters, but none like this. This already sterling actor goes to a new level to find his character, and the result is the best performance of his career. DiCaprio's acting ignites the movie, and it spreads throughout the film like wildfire. It's addicting to watch his talents unfold on screen, there's nothing DiCaprio can't do. Bar none the best performance by a male in a lead role this year, possibly of the last few.I have to also give approval to other cast members such as Jonah Hill (Donnie Azoff), Margot Robbie (Naomi Lapaglia), and Matthew McConaughey (Mark Hanna). These actors all helped fill out the supporting characters to a tee and gave the cast depth which in turn gave the film true depth.It goes without saying that Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese know how to create movie magic. The Departed, Shutter Island, and The Aviator, to name a few, are wonderful films done between these two. But The Wolf of Wall Street is a whole new beast. The story was captivating, the screenplay seemed to have been made from gold, the themes portrayed by the film are powerful and controversial and it shines bright. With Leonardo DiCaprio's sensational performance as the icing on the cake, The Wolf of Wall Street rightfully places itself as the front runner for my best movie of 2013.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese delivers yet another masterpiece.....,"The Wolf Of Wall Street was my most anticipated movie of 2013. I was very familiar with its story, having read Jordan Belfort's book multiple times, reading two drafts of the movie script and watching countless interviews with Belfort himself. Martin Scorsese is my favourite director (his movie 'Goodfellas' is my favourite movie of all time) and Leonardo DiCaprio is my favourite actor. Add to that a supporting cast with the likes of Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey, and you get the idea of how excited I was for this movie. I'm very happy to say that it did not disappoint in the slightest.Jordan Belfort's book has been adapted for the screen by Terrence Winter, and he does an excellent job of doing so. Having read the book, I noticed that there are quite a few differences in plot, specifically with things that happen towards the end of the movie. There were also some scenes in the book that were very hilarious, and I really wish had been put into the movie but sadly have not. This is my only minor gripe with the movie, but the content that has been included is so damn good that it pretty much cancels that negative out. Unlike other Scorsese films, The Wolf Of Wall Street is incredibly funny, there are some real hard laugh out loud moments. Not all of the comedy is dialogue between characters either, there's one particular piece of physical comedy that's easily one of the funniest I've ever seen. However, the story of The Wolf Of Wall Street isn't all fun and games, and there are some very dark and serious moments. Scorsese manages to perfectly shape a film that can meld the silly and the serious together flawlessly, with the silly being incessantly funny and the serious being incredibly heart- pounding.The acting is absolutely phenomenal, everyone is performing to the top of their game. Now, I certainly don't think that the Oscars are the end all be all of movie recognition, but if DiCaprio doesn't get a nomination this year, then it's just proof of the Academy's grudge against him. He delivers yet another career topping performance after last year's 'Django Unchained', he just consistently gets better and better, never to failing to completely blow me away. Matthew McConaughey has a remarkably short amount of screen time considering he's fourth billing in the credits, but for every minute he's on screen he's utterly captivating, delivering one of the most memorable performances of the film. Jonah Hill is incredibly funny, say what you will about him but the guy can really act and here he just proves that yet again. There are very few female characters in the movie, and Margot Robbie plays the main one. After hearing about her casting I was sceptical as if to whether she would be able to pull off the character, but she does it perfectly. Some may complain about how little character development the females have, but bear in mind the story is told by Belfort, and he probably didn't see the women in his life as much more than objects of desire so he won't show them as any more than that. Supporting cast members like Jean Dujardin, Rob Reiner and especially Jon Bernthal all give outstanding performances as well.Scorsese does a wonderful job directing, as he always does. Many people are saying that The Wolf Of Wall Street glamorises the criminal activities that Belfort gets up to, but if you think that then I seriously suggest you watch the movie again and take a long hard think about it. The film is three hours long, but Scorsese does the pacing so perfectly that it doesn't feel like it's that long, in fact I didn't want it to end. The cinematography and editing is great, and unlike many other Scorsese movies there is a very bright and vibrant colour scheme in contrast to the dark colours he very often uses, which was a very nice change. The soundtrack is flawless as Scorsese's soundtracks always are, and most things in this movie are flawless as well. It can easily be placed side by side with other Scorsese movies like 'Goodfellas', Casino', 'Taxi Driver' and 'The Departed'. Not only will The Wolf Of Wall Street go down as the best movie of 2013, it will be remembered as one of my favourites of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
DiCaprio at his best,"The wolf of Wall Street is a definite 3 hours of super humor and comedy outlining the life of Jordan Belfort. Grab a huge bucket of popcorn because you would not want to step out for a refill. Many names and characters have been changed or modified from the real version of the story but Martin Scorsese has left no stone unturned in making this movie an absolute watch.Ever since Titanic Leo' Di has carefully chosen all his movies and roles which have been blockbusters or could be watched again on a quite evening. I frankly was not expecting very much out of this movie ever since Wall Street 2, which was completely done up to pick up the extra change from the original series or by playing on the sentiments of the aftermath of 2008. But I was blown away. Di'Caprio has definitely set a benchmark for the new generation of actors that would come into Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Wildest Three Hours of Cinema,"Jordan Belfort was one of the most successful stockbrokers, but how did he get there? When he did get there, what did he do with the wealth he had so quickly accumulated? Martin Scorsese's newest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, recounts this shocking true story, exposing us to the monsters that our economic system- capitalism- has produced. To truly understand Belfort's (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) sheer insanity and criminality, what we witness herein is an energetic, 3-hour narrative that's fueled by sex, drugs, profanity, and hilarity. This is an exemplar of the paths the moguls and magnates pull through in order to finally reach affluence.As usual, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers another powerful performance; in fact, this could be his best yet. He's high, he's inebriate, he's irate, he's desperate or ambitious, he's dejected, he's just deranged- the list goes on. The Wolf of Wall Street is fitting proof of this brilliant actor's range, but it also proves how utterly pathetic it is that he's still not carrying a few, or at least one, Oscar's. In this case, he goes all out, and he goes to lengths and depths we haven't seen him touch yet. In addition, he's absolutely hilarious, discovering the perfect vehicle to showcase his comedic talent. What more can the guy demonstrate to grab the Academy's attention? Then again, since he hasn't won an Academy Award yet, it totally substantiates how essentially unimportant those awards are anyways. It evinces that actors shouldn't feel doubtful of their own talents just because they can't call themselves an Oscar or Golden Globe (to a lesser extent) winner. Jonah Hill also brings his A-game, giving us yet another remarkably unhinged character to exist next to DiCaprio's as we see them participate in some of the most downright outrageous sequences. In all honesty, the entire cast shines as we sight the likes of Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Jon Berenthal, Jean Dujardin, and much more.The screenplay is undoubtedly another profound strength of the film's, providing us with some of the most ingenious dialogue this year. Furthermore, it consistently brings out the richness of these characters- their personalities and relationships, incorporating irony and/or farcicality to each and every segment. Again, Wolf doesn't only cast us into the lowest depths of humanity and wrenches us until we cry foul (in consequence to the individuals' despicable acts), but it's also one of the funniest movies I've seen all year, absolutely overshadowing most of the comedies we received these past twelve months. It comprises a plethora of memorable and incredibly amusing scenes that left the whole audience bawling with laughter. Like American Hustle though, those scenes blur the lines between what's hysterical and what's just disturbing and dispiriting. Without those boundaries and sensibility, almost every scene is bound to induce laughter of some kind.As with Scorsese's numerous other projects like The Aviator and Goodfellas, a considerable portion of the protagonist's life is revealed with the plot's progression, spanning decades. With that, we begin to sense the 3-hour duration, and it's not exactly that the film drags out in any particular spots or hits a sluggish pace in general, it's merely that we're reliving a single man's history, advancing through the high's, low's, and more relaxed stages of his maniacal life. Understandably, a viewer would begin to feel the lengthiness after so many wild events have already transpired and yet it seems like the story is leading us to another one.Now, many critics have panned the production's willingness and, perhaps, eagerness to delve into persistent lunacy. Of course, what we see is excessive and imprudent, but that's surely what the film is attempting to convey in the first place- these lavish lifestyles are intemperate beyond remorse and the decadence seen means exactly that never is it all apparently enough in our culture - the copious money, the gorgeous women, the sensation of drugs, and whatnot. They just don't feel that temptation to quit the debauchery and leave it all behind for betterment. Anyways, The Wolf of Wall Street is definitely one of the best films of this past year and another exceptional entry in Scorsese's filmography. Considering DiCaprio's presence, Scorsese's directorial involvement, and a riveting story to top it off, the real question isn't ""why should I go see this movie?"" The question is: why, in any possibility, shouldn't I?",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Top Movie,"I had a feeling that I would enjoy The Wolf of Wall Street and that it wouldn't be another over- hyped blockbuster and I wasn't disappointed. The acting is phenomenal. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Jordan Belfort and depicts the demons that surface from huge wealth and unorthodox success. Jonah Hill's performance is also strong. Actress Margot Robbie has proved to be a great new talent and gives a powerful performance as Jordan's wife. I was very impressed with her Brooklyn accent as she's originally a native Australian.Scorsese doesn't play safe and this one in particular is the most controversial movie he's ever made.

Does anyone like Jordan Belfort character,"Well I had an open mind when I went to see ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" after such praise and ratings for this film/movie by the media etc. Yes it was a long film but this wasn't the issue for me, it was the main character Jordan Belfort played by Leonardo DiCaprio. In previous box office hits by Martin Scorsese you become involved in characters who are by no means pleasant but one becomes attached to the characters in some way which helps keep it buzzing along. There's only so much interest and intrigue one can have for a drugged up criminal with no real care but his own self importance in a movie that lasts this long. To sum this one up for me, it's worth watching for a finely directed and casted story of a unpleasant/unlikeable stockbroker with many LOL's moments. 7.5",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A Brilliant Story Without an End,"Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio combine again to make another excellent film. DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort and the story spans the majority of his life. Belfort starts with humble beginnings, but when introduced to the survival of the fittest world of Wall Street he thrives to become the top dog.Belfort finds the hand over fist way to make money with penny stocks, and gets a group of guys he knows together to start a hedge fund. In the process he links up with Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) who quickly becomes his right hand man. The story goes on to tell of Belfort's meteoric rise and how the riches enrich his life in all aspects: women, drugs, toys and travels.When Belfort and company get in trouble with the law the film shows how they try to maneuver around it. I won't go on to spoil anything, but for me the ending lacked a final blow. Scorsese and DiCaprio have come out and said that the final part of the film was to show how it was the common people who are being duped by the likes of Belfort, but it hardly seemed like that was the message.There have been articles telling of how this movie has spawned a high that some of the young generation are trying to attain. Belfort has become someone you strive to be, and that is exactly what the story isn't about.

I think both of these guys are up for some nominations and likely even a few wins. It may be hard once again for Leo to win best actor, simply because of Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance in 12 Years a Slave but Leo's performance was awesome.Simply put, if you're a fan of the old Scorsese classics, this movie won't disappoint.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Perfect in execution, but anything new.","The Wolf of Wall Street can be considered a flawless movie but I left the cinema with a bittersweet sensation.Lets start with the positive points: Firstly, the direction is outstanding. Scorsese at his best, he can manage the pace of the film to the extreme of not being a bit boring despite of the 3 hours of duration. Every shot, every scene has been done with extreme care and talent.Secondly, the main star, Leonardo Di Caprio's acting is stunning, absolutely Oscar worthy. Marlon Brando would be proud of his successor. The rest of the cast is great but, in my opinion, not amazing. Jonah Hill is not Joe Pesci, for example.Finally, production values. The target of this film was to show a luxurious, glamorous and excessive lifestyle of some new (very) rich men and I can swear that this film succeed in that.Following with the negative points I will start remarking that I feel I'm being a bit unfair. If this film was been made by another director I wouldn't give such importance, but this is a Scorsese's movie and a serious contestant for the best movie's award.The main flaw of The Wolf of Wall Street is, in my opinion, that the plot is good, sometimes brilliant, but anything special. It lacks of deepness and capacity of surprise. And the storytelling is quite conventional.I recognize the enormous effort of Scorsese in the way of how he tries to represent the cruelty of the extreme ambition and excesses of Jordan Belfort and his comrades and the visually magnificent representation of the effects of drugs. The ambiguous morality of the film is well received too.The problem is that there are already a lot of movies that manage both Wall Street and drugs stories in a better way that this movie does.In conclusion, a technically perfect movie, worthy of watching in cinemas and in the level of Scorsese's last films (which is not a bad thing) but it's sad to say that it seems we can't expect anything from our beloved director worthy of surpassing (or even matching) hits like Raging Bull or Taxi Driver.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Movie excellence provides a wolf of a time,"This would have to be Scorsese's greatest film, thine far. This is a movie pinnacle of a legendary career of great films. It's all so perfect like a well oiled machine. Here in another Goodfellas, Casino like movie, this time, Leonardo, driving the narrative, in a fantastic portrayal of money hungry, stockbroker/crook Jordan Belfort, in sure fire Oscar Winner mode, we see him quickly ascend to wealth, thanks to the 19th October 87 Wall Street slump. He revamps a chop shop on Long Island, where he basically retrains the employers and installs confidence in them, where soon they're living a dream of excess wealth of oversupplous partying and sex. There's a gluttonous amount of sex in this too, let me warn you, not that I have a problem with that. It's great how Scorsese has made this three hour film and story exciting, throughout, with many great performances, second to Leo's, Jonah Hill, as Belfort's right hand man and best friend, Donnie, and hot and strikingly impressive Margot Robbie from Oz as DeCaprio's new and seductive wife, who causes Hill to sort of unload. Matthew McConaughey has a small an unforgettable role at the start as a Wall Street giant, he truly leaves his mark here, as he's been doing with many other performances nowadays. A much stacked on Jon Favreau is good too. The Wolf Of Wall Street is very funny too, two scenes, one a trademark scene with De Caprio, smooth talking, bribing two FBI men on his boat, the other has a staggering Leo, trying to make it back to his car, after swallowing a Qualude at the Country Club, where the second time recounting, making it home, is not just a surprise, but almost side splitting. Violence runs short, save for two scenes, and there's quite a bit of drug taking, with a few foolish acts at the end of em' as you'll see. Here's one of the best movies I've seen in years, it's frightening to imagine Scorsese bettering this film. There will also be a director's cut, an hour more of extended sex scenes. One can only imagine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Brilliant! A must see!,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. Telling the epic which was the life of Jordan Belfort(The young stock broker in love with money,drugs and sex) in such a way that you must see it more than once. At 3 hours long it's a surprise that it is still entering from the start till the end without being bored once. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Now I know.,"I have always been very skeptical about those ""get rich (quick?)"" seminars we see advertised and formed my own conclusion that, if you're a charismatic orator and, perhaps, an author of a best-selling motivation book, and highly overrate your own value, it isn't hard. You don't need to be good in business (legitimate business, that is). All you need to be is a good con artist.I have heard it said that, if you make an A4 size flier with your picture filling most of it and just something like, ""MARVO the world's greatest hypnotist is coming to (your town)"" along with dates and venues in small type at the bottom and get a whole pile of them letter-boxed, even if you have no idea about hypnotism, you can do this. A couple of days after the fliers have been delivered, just go and knock on some doors until someone says, ""Wow!! You're that hypnotist on the flier I got the other day!"" Then just look the person straight in the eye and say, ""Sleep"" and they will fall down right there in front of you. The person saw the flier and believed what it told them so that, when they saw the person whose picture was on it, they were already pre-programmed. And that, in a nutshell, is how con- men work.And that is also what ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is all about. How Scorsese made it last for three whole hours is certainly testimony to his expertise as a director. But, strangely (for me) I thought he really missed the boat as far as the film's full potential was concerned. Maybe Bob Guccione would have done it better because he would have REALLY shown all the porn scenes without bed sheets and subtle camera angles to hide the juicy bits. Whether the movie would have been better for that is, of course, debatable depending on where you stand with regard to both porn and accuracy. (Maybe there is a directors cut version!)As it is though, ""Wolf"" is nothing more than (I presume) an insight into just how corrupt the world of big business is and makes me glad that I have never been there. It is nothing more than three hours of gratuitous profanity, drug abuse and naked debauchery and definitely not worth the time.How it got nominated for an Academy Award mystifies me. I can only assume that some members of the Academy related to it in some way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scumbag fest,"Over the top cursing, drug abuse, dirty talk, dirty act, lying, cheating people out of their money, homosexual and regular orgies, sexual masochism, public masturbation, drunkenness, over 700 profanities and blasphemy; adultery, child endangerment, reckless driving, incest, international money laundering, low level bribery, prostitution and occasional fleeting tender or dramatic moment. A scumbag's rise and fall and return to despicable life of greed, conceit and moral void. Scorsese and DiCaprio revel with the revelers in this flick to show...actually for an unknown reason. There is no moral reference point in the film, rather a neutral excitement about the cunning of the main character. There is not one good or sympathetic person depicted in this film. All are scumbags with no hope or desire for any form of redemption, remorse or a lasting human feeling. Very dark and depressing movie; actually misanthropic. The macabre disregard of any value is well hidden behind dark or foul humor and a blur of debauchery, crime and excessive luxury.The one thing that maybe deserves attention is the depiction of Belfort as a magnetic and captivating speaker, a preacher of mammon. He seemed to me more of a cult leader than a con man and a trader.Whoever made this movie hates man with a fiendish craftiness.

A near miss at being greatness,"Undoubtedly one of the best films of the year, there's only so much you can do with a movie based on a stock market while trying to keep it interesting and with that in mind, it delivered quite well.When comparing this movie to other great movies it may fall a bit short, but it's right up there with the best of em.The film could of been cut and made a bit shorter as it tended to drag out a bit near the end, but the acting scenes were so great that you really wouldn't of wanted to do that.The acting between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill were top notch and the overall plot of the movie worked great with the scenes playing out well, not much more one can say, it set out to do a job and it accomplished it very well. Probably not a movie for everyone due to the fact that most people wouldn't find a movie about a stock market interesting but it should still appeal to the strict action sci-fi lovers out there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Good satire, excellent performance, good directing, but not for everyone.","What is satire? Depends on who you ask, but to me it means enlarging or exaggerating certain aspects of something serious until it becomes hilarious. If perhaps in a dark way.I did not want to see this movie at first. I feared it would be one hour of hedonism and debauchery of an essentially loathsome character, followed by his inevitable downfall. I was wrong. It was two hours of hedonism and debauchery. But to my surprise Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio used that to tell a darkly comical story. True satire in my book.The story itself is quite simple: the rise and fall of New York Stockbroker Jordan Belfort, whose unethical business practices and excessive lifestyle make him a shooting star on Wallstreet; rising high, burning bright, until he falls down to earth, burnt-out.One high-point of the movie is without a doubt DiCaprio's performance of Jordan Belfort, who gave him aspects of a hedonist, shady 'used cars dealer' and an obsessive and unstable cult leader. This was not a subtle performance, which in other movies would surely be considered overacting. But for a character who is continuously high on success or drugs, it works fine. I cannot help but wonder if Mr. DiCaprio's furious acting gave him the same rush the real Jordan Belfort must have felt while closing a deal.Moreover, when the scene required it, DiCaprio's acting gave a dark but subtle undertone to very extrovert performances. In other movies, a scene where the criminal throws away a year's salary to gloat and mock the visiting FBI agents would highlight just how loathsome he is. Here it conveyed the increasing dread and desperation in Belfort.Other performances were very good as well. Jonah Hill is an actor I mostly associate with rather wacky characters and the role of Donnie Azoff, Belfort's even more unstable friend and partner fits him like a glove. Kyle Chandler fulfilled the role of Agent Denham well. Though his screen time was somewhat limited, his performance in the scenes with DiCaprio was not lacking, giving the character the introversion, integrity and stability one would expect of Belfort's complete opposite.That said, most of the other characters are not that interesting, mostly there just give Belfort someone to interact with and display his character and thoughts that that moment. As such, his inner circle of employees, while generally funny characters and sometimes even plot-relevant, are rather flat and mostly resemble obsessive cult followers (even more so for in regards to the rest of Belfort's employees, seem to be screaming fanatics, though one can argue it is part of the satire). The one character who was different was Chester Ming (Kenneth Choi). Though less screen time than his colleagues, he stood out for seeming to be much more composed and level headed, but also more brutal. I would have thought he would further develop into some kind of loyal enforcer, but noting more came from it.Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) fulfilled a role as one of Belfort's interaction partners as his wife and, as she took the brunt of Belfort's instability in the final scenes, arguably the most important one. Nevertheless, the character remained shallow at best (You met him while he was still married, Naomi. What did you think would happen?).The other highpoint of the movie was the Directing. As I said, the debauchery in the movie was excessive, but did manage to cross the line of overly lustful into disturbingly comical. The movie contains scenes and dialog that are not in any way relevant to the plot, but on second glance seem remarkably appropriate to Belfort's mental state. This includes non-sequiturs (the dialog on midgets), breaking the fourth wall (Belfort, repeatedly), slapstick (the scene at the country club), unreliable narrator (Belfort's little ride in a very expensive car, twice!) and even outright surreal scenes (the 'Popeye' cartoon). It doesn't always work. For example, I just didn't understand the purpose of the shot of the exploding plane (but than again, the character said I wouldn't believe it...).In all, this movie was a very pleasant surprise. On the story alone I would give this movie a 6, but DiCaprio's performance and Scorsese's directing each lift it to a higher plane, coming to comfortable 8.Still, this movie is not for everyone. The hedonism is very explicit, just short of pornographic. Substance abuse is abundant, and not portrayed as a bad thing in itself (though the movie loves to mock those who do not know when they should temper their impulses). Moreover, Belfort's character is essentially loathsome, preying on the vulnerable (and even the poor) to maintain his lifestyle, and one can argue if karma ever truly catches up with him. This is not a movie for those with sensitive morals.This movie does not convey that greed is bad. But it does show that one cannot gorge oneself indefinitely without bursting apart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"""Sell me this pen""...as it wrote a perspicuous blockbuster.","Terence Winters. Martin Scorsese. Leonardo Di Caprio.The trio made pretty much of what The Wolf of Wall Street is all about. Belfort penned it, Terence adopted, Scorsese gave his splendid vision to the book and well all of it and everything else wouldn't make a crumb of a difference, had it not been DiCaprio to act with such an ease yet be marvelous at it. His acting and presence on celluloid took it to an entire different level altogether.The movie is about a twisted robin hood, a tale which explores a swindled slice of life, its about a penny stockbroker who raised from nowhere and became an iconic figure for those who believed in him and themselves. He made a conglomerate where no one had a past from the same industry but yet were unanimous on the same platform. But as its said that when everything falls your way..you are in the wrong lane, and as every success has the failure standing at the door waiting for that one moment where you leave the doors open, Jordan Belfort was no exception. He falls, and falls hard.. so much so that he has to serve 36 months in prison..and with that, everything changes. Though I believe that this dwindle of Jordan Belfort could have been at least postponed (if not stopped), had he not been a doctrinaire which unfortunately he was that eventually led him to his own fall.The story covers almost all the aspects of the book (as I read it before going for the movie), and is well driven by Terence Winters (screenplay) as the length could have been a drawback but well, it just comes at your face the very minute and finds a place in your bones as the time passes by. Martin Scorsese provides humongous efforts to keep the plot alive and is outstandingly successful in doing so, along with which, you can always see his trademarks in the movie like the lead facing internal and personal problems (mostly marital concerns).I've always been a Scorsese fan, this was indeed not Scorsese cinema, nor was Shutter Island but well..as long as you get the dose and you like it..that's what really matters at the end of the day. And I totally enjoyed it as I'm myself a sales person and all my life, I've believed that sales is all about conversation and convincing, but this flick taught me an echt definition of sales. All hails to the trio. And I hope it bags at least 3 Oscars out of its 5 nominations this year.I'd rate this astonishing comic sensation of the year as 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Graphic, Hysterical, and Masterfuly Directed!! Quite Possibly the Best film of 2013","Though I wouldn't touch Hugo with a ten-foot pole ( just not my kind of movie), it seems like good-ole Marty has got his mojo back and with a vengeance. This film has all the Scorsese elements: drugs, violence, and greed, but in The Wolf of Wall Street they are jacked up on steroids. This movie was sooooo freaking graphic, and raw!!! Though such outrageous events transpire, they are all believable and usually hysterical.2013 really hasn't been cinema's year. Not too many great movies have come out. So I was really looking forward to this film and my god; I was not disappointed. This movie had fantastic camera shots, amazing Scorsese style, beautifully edited, and acting left me speechless. I cannot praise the filmmaking of this movie enough. I wouldn't say Di Caprio's greatest performance, but it's in the the top 3.I will say though, I wasn't expecting how graphic this movie was going to be. I don't mind sex scenes really, but this movie had some raunchy ones. Regardless I didn't really care because this film made me so invested in it and made me laugh my ass off.All-in-all, this was a unique, and amazing movie that blew me away and made every second of the 3 hours worth it.

A Crazy Riot from Start to Finish.,"I won't deny that I had no expectations at all from The Wolf of Wall Street. Martin Scorsese's films rarely work for me & the trailer for this one made it look like a cinema about party, sex & drugs on loop for 3 long hours. And The Wolf of Wall Street was exactly that. Booze, party, sex & drugs on loop for 3 hours and yet, I ended up really enjoying it & the biggest plus, never got bored for even a second, something that rarely happens when I'm watching this director's works. But this biopic of the infamous stockbroker Jordan Belfort has a lot of energy & madness written over it & is a crazy riot from start to finish.Although a biopic, The Wolf of Wall Street is actually a film about excess. Excess of everything; be it drugs, money or women. It's vulgar. It's loud. It's dirty. It's funny. Actually, calling it funny doesn't do real justice because it's downright hilarious. And it's extremely entertaining. There is so much in the film that could've gone terribly wrong & would've turned it into a complete disaster but Scorsese's assured direction has masterfully rescued this overdosed cinema from passing out completely. And if Scorsese's direction is brilliant, then the lead performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as the stock market maniac, Jordan Belfort, is absolutely show-stealing & one of the best performances of the year plus he is exuberantly supported by Jonah Hill who makes an impression of his own as Donnie; Belfort's sidekick.I think there is also a need to stress that this isn't a film that'll work for everyone. It never takes itself seriously and in a way, that's both a plus & minus for this film. What is going to work for one probably won't for another & what you want to watch in it is the criteria which will decide whether you'll love it or hate it. On an overall scale, thanks to Scorsese's stylish direction, hilarious script, clever use of music & insane performances by the cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on dope but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes and, despite all the bullshit that this cinema is full of, it still finishes as one of the finest & most entertaining films of 2013.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Raunchy, chaotic, hysterial, but worth every minute","I don't know how to begin to review this epic of a movie.Wolf of Wall Street is a 3-hour of drugs, sex, and financial crimes. It highlights some of the extremes of excess told in a way that Jordan Belfort would tell his own story.Wolf of Wall Street plays like a rollercoaster from one extreme to another. Its extremes keep its viewers attached to the screen not wanting to miss a single second. Chaos reigns supreme in this film.Leonardo DiCaprio did an astonishing job portraying Belfort. He grunts, yells, and f*cks his way to what should have been an Oscar win. Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie also deliver award-worthy performances.Many kudos to Martin Scorsese for what he did for the screenplay. This movie isn't like Martin Scorsese's bread and butter films, but he delivers and then some. His approach in this film is both refreshing, hilarious, and an absolute thrill.The moral message underneath the film also shines upon the second visit. The film also (subtly) asks if it's ok to celebrate villainy and excess. Of course, the audience wants to cheer for the protagonist. But upon further thought, the viewers, like many of Belfort's victims have allowed him to pull another wool over our eyes. The image of excess covers the true financial crimes that Belfort committed.5/5. Favorited. I wouldn't recommend to watch with family and kids, though.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
