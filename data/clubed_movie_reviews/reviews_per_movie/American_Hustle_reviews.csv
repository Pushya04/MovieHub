Amerian Hustle with the benefit of hindsight,"The performances are the safeguard for this movie to have a very long life. I couldn't care less about the characters but I loved the actors playing them. They, the characters, make choices that are as coarse as their wardrobe. Thank God for the people wearing them .Christian Bale is absolute perfection. His character is disgusting and irresistible at the same time. brilliant performance. Amy Adams is superb and Bradley Cooper an unnerving hoot - also the brief moment with Robert de Niro is simply delicious but it is Jennifer Lawrence who made me want to see the movie again as if to confirm what I seem to remember. Yes indeed. She is spectacular. A performance of such maturity - her laughter alone belongs to one of the great ones of yesteryear. - Totally present. A character actress/star.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Starts slow and gets better and better,"I'd heard mixed responses about this film over the years so I had to finally give it a watch. And I'm sorry to anyone that hates this film, but I really enjoyed this one!The first half an hour or so is quite bland I'll be honest. No obvious direction for the film to go in, I wasn't too sold on any of the characters and just generally the pace was really slow.But the film massively picks up and it just gets better and better and more interesting with every minute that passes. The ending I thought was fantastic, it ended all the characters arc's amazingly well and had a brilliant twist involved which I didn't see coming.The standout for me is the acting. When I saw the pretty extravagant cast lineup I was skeptical. Usually films that go all in with cast typically don't do too well. So when I saw Bale, Adams, DeNiro, Renner, Lawrence, Cooper and CK and more I was thinking just that. But this doesn't fall into that category at all! Acting from everyone was superb and a real standout, really added so much more to the characters. Just a great job overall.But yeah, overall it's a fun, interesting watch with a little touch of subtle humour added which is always nice. 8/10 from me, would recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Christian Bale, again abracadabra!","A well deserved movie for all the nominations, not to mention the actors. It had something missing from being undisputed the best of the year, but so far, it is way better than the actual winner of the oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
That was brilliant,The acting from all round was amazing. I find it very hard to believe that Christian bale didn't win a major award for his role I thought he was the stand out actor in this along side Jennifer Lawrence. It's crazy what Bale puts his body through for roles. The ending was perfect it ended exactly how I wanted it to.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Best Film of 2013,"It did not take an astronomical amount of time during my screening of American Hustle to realize I had found the best film of the 2013. American Hustle was not what I expected, but in the best way possible. Acting as almost a descendant of Goodfellas, it does not rip off the story or characters, but traces of Martin Scorsese's masterpiece can be found in the style and spirit of David O'Russell's now masterpiece. O'Russell keeps his controlled hand over the wild characters and fast-paced plot; for the crime movie it is, class seems high on the list of ""musts.""The commenters of the screenplay have noted how much of a blast the screenplay is; a blast it is, but most are ignoring the intricacy of the screenplay by David O'Russell and Eric Singer. The groundwork is the twisty fraud story, which is snappy, entertaining, and full of surprises. The next layer is the character work of the five leading roles, the screenplay inflames all the characters to reveal their unique cores. The third layer details those characters each with their own object of symbolism including a comb over, a British accent, hair curlers, nail polish, and a science oven. Layer four is the screwball comedy dialogue exchanges between the characters, which drives comedic artistry out of the actors leaving the audience cheerfully laughing.The most puzzling compliant about American Hustle many are holding against the film is a lack of deeper meaning. It confuses me because the deeper meaning is quite clear and abundantly there, Amy Adams and Christian Bale even have key moments of literally speaking it to the other characters. It's a story of identities, being unhappy with who you are and the different versions of ourselves we put on display as we encounter different people. We have numerous roles we must play in order to survive, whether it be for respect, love, self-worth, or community. We all do it.David O'Russell's sight of his screenplay dares him to capture his film in a particular fashion. The camera acts as a silent third party in scenes of where, if the audience were a character in the movie, our eyes would be during the conversations such as focusing on hand gestures, zooming in to characters as they speak, and the length from the characters to the camera in his editing. Where our focus would be in person is where O'Russell places us in his vision where and when he wants us to see what.The acting ensemble of American Hustle has been called the star of the show, collectively the five leading actors support each other through the two hours and fifteen minutes. Some have found it troubling to select one of the five as the most valuable player because all five do their homework and put the effort in. I anticipated the cast from the trailers and released clips, but I never found myself too terribly excited to see Christian Bale's work, yet he surprised me with how complete his characterization was of Irving Rosenfled. This is a trite way of describing an accomplished acting performance, but Bale warrants it here: I forgot I was watching Christian Bale, the actor, entirely.Bradley Cooper has made a career by unleashing the inner-asshole in himself; in American Hustle he's the ultimate shade of that character type with an added vibrancy and an immaturity of not feeling respected. Jennifer Lawrence oozes in her supporting role filling the juvenile Rosalyn with hilarity and loneliness. Someone who saw American Hustle with me commented on how unlikeable Lawrence's character is and in lesser hands it may have been more predominant, but Lawrence charms her way through her character's flaws and makes us empathize with her entirely. Jeremy Renner delivers great work as well, but with fewer money moments and less ""umph"" than his co-stars.The general consensus may have trouble finding an MVP of the cast, but it was no problem for me. Though I admired everything Bale, Cooper, Lawrence, and Renner added to American Hustle, it's an understatement to say the film belongs to Amy Adams. She's proved herself to be a great talent, but Adams delivers her most accomplished work here. In the Hollywood Reporter's Actress Roundtable earlier this winter, Adams commented how miserable she was during the filming of American Hustle because she was so consumed by her character's identity, or lack-there-of. I've never seen a performance like Adams or a character like Sydney. Adams slips in and out of Sydney's faux British accent as she keeps her cards hidden from all the other characters. We never knows who her loyalties belong to. Tears swell in Adams eyes as she pathologically tells the story of her character, without divulging enough information to be completely vulnerable. It's a sensational performance.""The world isn't black and white as you say, it's extremely grey,"" a line Christian Bale imparts to Bradley Cooper, another existential message that is driven by the screenplay. O'Russell exhibits his two main characters, con artists, and asks us to like them enough to follow them for rest of the story. By the end, we have not only accepted them, but love and root for them.At the heart of American Hustle is a love story between Irving and Sydney, an aspect that I found to be most successful. Adams is at her most gorgeous ever, Bale is balding and fifty pounds over. Their love is not formed around physical attraction, something magical happens in the first twenty minutes and we see and feel the way they fall in love. This supports the film's stance on appearances meaning nothing. With maybe the exception of Blue is the Warmest Color, try to find two 2013 film characters more in love than Irving and Sydney.",,Anonymous,Crime
Do not get ensnared in the hype surrounding this hustle....,"In the late 1970s, while America was swinging to rock n roll, exposing all its flashy jewelery over plunging necklines and under unruly hairdos, a scandalous entrapment planned by the FBI threatened several political figures and rocked the nation in its most oddly alluring time. David Russell reunites his cast from his previous best movies including 'The Fighter' and 'Silver linings playbook' to tell us the story of con artists who are led by the FBI to trap bigger fish in an attempt to expose corruption at high levels. This highly fictionalized version of the Abscam sting by the FBI has some meaningful conversations, witty dialogue and glorious nonsense in its overlong narrative.In an era of resurgent wealth and dynamic lifestyles, success is achieved with compelling ambitions amidst increasing competitiveness, only through some hustle. Right through his childhood years of conning people for his father's business, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) used the guise of legitimate businesses such as dry cleaning to conceal his beguiling loan schemes. Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), initially suspicious of Irving's businesses, soon becomes his partner in bed and crime. Her fake identity as Lady Edith Greensly not only attracts investors lured by her supposed British financial contacts but also by her revealing attire. Soon enough however, the con-artist duo is in the grips of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who intends to entrap a New Jersey Mayor along with several Congressmen. Aided by a wire operator and a bogus Sheikh Abdullah (Michael Pena) who was to provide the funds for the redevelopment, the hustling of mayor Carmine (Jeremy Renner) begins with Richie, Sydney and Irving hustling each other in the process. If that wasn't enough, Irving's loud mouthed, cleavage flashing housewife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) gets them all on the edge with her erratic outbursts and ignorance of the entrapment. This sexy looking inspiration of the Abscam operation lacks a fast-paced plot and intrigue that made other conman films such as 'Catch me if you can' and 'Argo', exciting movies. Loud characters protract several insipid sequences that outlast their importance from the script. The seriousness of the entrapment plot is often overshadowed with the digressed focus on the characters and their relationships and while this dilutes the story-telling, it isn't such a bad thing when you have such a talented cast. However, one can only go so far with just acting, good looks, sexy styles and 70s tunes. David Russell fails to engage the audience with a tight script and twists in a con-artist's story that are only few and far apart. Clearly, style over substance was his approach here with entertainment left solely upon the actors' talents.Christian Bale put on 40lbs for this movie. It isn't the first time he has transformed himself on-screen and won't be the last. This con-man draws a line on his wrong doing and hesitates on going too big with the plan. His love for Sydney grows through the movie but always comes second to his son's well being. Irving has everything likable about him, even his weirdly meticulous wig. His softer, more intelligent character is a sharp contrast to his unabashed wife. Jennifer Lawrence plays everything that is wrong and right with the film. Rosalyn can be a big mouth, whining incessantly and trying hard to prove her worthiness. But she can also be the one character whose presence just makes you nod in disbelief about what she will do next. That uncanny ability and its unpredictable deliverance is surely Lawrence's talent at work that doesn't fail to impress. Bradley Cooper is a hot-headed FBI agent whose ambition gets the better of him. There are many scenes where he clearly improvises, such as enacting Louis C.K.'s agent Thorsen and the epic moment when Sydney lays herself out on the table for him, he gets so close and simply can't handle it. The most striking aspect of Cooper's performance is that his character is so unconvincing. He is ambitious and he has the con-artists by their necks in his elaborate plan but he is still an amateur who is guided by instinct rather than experience. Jeremy Renner's Mayor Carmine shows his devotion to his city and while it took some major hustling to draw him into the plan, those interactions with Irving were quite a delight to watch. Amy Adams looks sensational and sizzles in the chemistry she builds with Irving and Richie. She portrays wit, grace and spontaneity as they adapt to changing scenarios during the sting operation and remains ever focused on the plan. Adams may not be as loud as Lawrence nor as multi-dimensional so to speak but her screen presence is equally alluring.David Russell hasn't showcased his fine talents in a script that needed to be funnier, wittier and tighter. The actors improvise on their greyish characters and provide more entertainment than the script possibly could. That certainly isn't the film-maker's achievement but he did choose the right cast that could pull that con off on the audience. Perhaps that is the year's biggest hustle from Hollywood that bends the audience into liking material that is portrayed to be far greater than it should be accorded for. Enjoy it for the gorgeous women, the committed actors and the stylish times but do not get ensnared in the hype surrounding this hustle.6.701 on a scale of 1-10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but over-hyped.,"While ""American Hustle"" has some nice performances, I was very surprised how unexcited I was watching this film. After all, around Oscar time, this was THE film that all the hype seemed to be about and the movie hadn't even debuted yet!! Critics were abuzz and the film got all the major nominations--Best Picture, Best Director, all the acting awards and four other nominations! If I were to create a list of most overrated films of all time, I would include this one simply because of all this hype. No film could be as good as this hype would indicate...and it wasn't.The movie is a HIGHLY fictionalized retelling of the Abscam affair where the FBI caught a lot of politicians on tape taking bribes. The ending, in particular, is pure Hollywood, not fact. But, instead of focusing mostly on the scam, the film tends to glamorize the characters involved in putting over this sting--the confidence people as well as the FBI.So why was I so underwhelmed by the film? The biggest reason is that I didn't like any of the people. And, oddly, the one I liked the most was the mayor (Jeremy Renner) caught up in the scandal. Any film about Abscam, even one as fictional as this one, needs to show bad people-- this didn't bother me. But the film so glamorized them and was all about them--and this left me flat.A few other things bothered me a bit. First, the f-word was not THAT commonly used in the 70s like it is used today. Historically, this is inaccurate, as it was used something like 27102391294 times. Second, while I liked the period music (as well as some new music by Jeff Lynne that sounded period), it was often too invasive--like a music video.In closing, I think if the film had never been hyped, I might have enjoyed it a lot more and scored it higher.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good movie with a lot of flashy acting,"Fictionalized real story of the Abscam scandal. It starts in 1978 with FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) using con-man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) to catch corrupt politicians. Irving is unhappily married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Eventually they set their sights on Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), the big New Jersey political operator.Director David O. Russell has gathered his gang of actors to wow us with a lot of flash. It's a lot of big acting moments, wild characterizations, era music, and crazy get-ups. There is a fascinating story beneath it all. All the flash makes the story look superficial when it's not. However the flash makes it fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hustle in to see...,"'American Hustle'. A amazingly entertaining and engaging experience. A successful (in my opinion) juxtaposition of art and entertainment. A wonderfully acted and directed film.Full disclosure: I loved both 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Linings Play', plus the cast are some of my favourite actors working in motion pictures today. So, I went in with a bias and a high level of anticipation for this film. This can sometimes work against you as a viewer as your expectations are too higher and you are disappointed with the results.I can say that I was not disappointed and absolutely loved the film. People take different experiences and sensibilities with them when they see movies, and mine led me to be engaged and empathetic towards the characters. Their story interested me and I came out of the cinema thoroughly enjoying myself.My only criticism is that it felt it lacked a little something with story. After seeing the film I did read that a lot of the film was improvised and Christian Bale commented to David O'Russell that this would change the story. His response was that he cared about the characters more than the story (paraphrasing). On reflection this is evident as the characters and acting are first class.I by no means acclaim this to be a perfect movie or the best movie ever made, but it worked for me. I loved it!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Over-rated and disappointing,"I really wanted to like this movie. I'd seen all the marketing, the plot interested me and the awards buzz seemed to indicate that the acting was second to none.On the acting, the film didn't really disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic, and all the recognition she has been getting is well deserved. The other leads, Bale, Adams & Cooper also performed extremely well. However, the material fell far short of the hype.The story was confused an awful lot of the time, and the screenplay was just bland (covered over with colourful language to make up for its deficiencies). I heard that much of the dialogue was improvised, which may explain why the plot was so unclear. The ending didn't quite allow me to forgive the dull spot in the middle of the film.All that being said, the soundtrack and production design were both great, so it was an excellent film visually. It just lacked a gravitas and a depth which I was expecting.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Hustle, Hustle, Hustle.","American Hustle is built as the 2013 revival of classic Scorsese gangster pictures like Goodfellas and Casino, but without the gangsters. It has the plot twists, the plethora of pop tunes, the conniving characters, the backstabbings, the high life, the low life, the disgruntled females merciless attached to crooked husbands, the stranded children, and so on. But it's new. Fresh out of the oven. Baked with wonderful performances and tight scriptwriting. And it has characters who inhabit the story and make it their own.The movie begins in medias res, with two con men -- and one con lady -- attempting to buy out a Jersey mayor. There's a lovely opening shot of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale, almost unrecognisable) carefully and painstakingly combing over his thinning strands of hair. This scene reminded me very much of the opening of Richard Linklater's Bernie, where a plump but serene mortician played by Jack Black joyfully lectures a scarce hall of students on the process of embalming. It's a slow scene, maybe too slow to open up a movie, but we are never bored, because we are given insight to a skill that we've never seen before, or don't know much about. It's the same with this scene. I've never seen anyone cover up bald. It's always bald being uncovered; wigs and toupees accidentally being ripped off, or blown away by strong winds. The scene also informs us that Irving is a certain kind of character.After jumping to a series of flashbacks, in which the history between Irving and his long-time girlfriend Sydney (Amy Adams, almost unrecognisable without her makeup) is revealed to have blossomed over a shared love of Duke Ellington, the plot begins proper. Irving and Sydney -- now posing as a wealthy British banker named Edith -- have been arrested by Richie (Bradley Cooper, fully recognisable despite his hairdo), an ambitious FBI agent who thinks he has the wit and skill to take down corrupt congressmen and casino gangsters with flimsy, ill-conceived plans. He ropes Irving and Sydney into his little schemes, and soon has them taking on an entire network of illegal tradesmen.Caught in the middle are two people: Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), and Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Carmine is the mayor whom the trio wanted to con at the start of the movie. He becomes integral to the plot when Irving develops a friendship with him. Do I tell him that I've been conning him all along, and that my innocent little scheme might get him arrested in front of his wife and six children? Or do I stay quiet, maintain the friendship, and face my conscience alone? What he does, I will not say.Rosalyn is an interesting character. Yes, she skirts dangerously close to the Sharon Stones and Lorraine Braccos of the old Scorsese pictures, but Jennifer Lawrence is able to lift her away from them by being more grounded. Stone always seemed to operate on her own terms in Casino. She was a third wheel, functioning outside of the overall story. Here, Rosalyn is fully aware of the situation at hand. She's right smack in the middle of the story. She doesn't love Irving. Irving doesn't love her. But they both love their son, and Rosalyn doesn't want a divorce tarnishing her solid family marital integrity. But she knows that the love festering in the household is only producing toxic fumes. Where her character goes is a place best kept hidden.And then there's a mix of other secondary characters, including perhaps the best cameo I've seen (not because of the cameo itself, but because of the meaning of the cameo). All of them dip in and out of this intelligent story with impact. Why, even Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.), is a lovely guy. He provides much of the movie's humour, and there is much of it. Director David O. Russell has said that his goal with American Hustle was to focus on the characters instead of the plot. Indeed, what a good decision. It's a rare moment when not a single character seems out of place. They complement each other, whether they're kissing, punching, clawing, or scratching. And they share so much chemistry that you could select any two of them at random, chuck them into an empty room, and watch them chatter till their throats went dry.I attended a screening of this movie in Mandurah, which is a lovely place. The cinema had maybe nine other patrons (weird, considering it was opening day). I'd been to Mandurah a few times before, and I watched The Counselor there. That was a poor movie, but the screening was smooth, which is more than I can say for the screening of this film. With about 15 minutes to go, the video jammed and stuttered slowly to a halt. It's the first time I've seen digital video jam. And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. The projectionist eventually rectified the problem, but I had already been sucked out of the moment. That's a pity, because American Hustle was shaping up to be one of the best movies of the year. You know what? Screw it. It still is.",,Anonymous,Crime
A film that cons you with a flashy façade,"I feel a little conned by American Hustle. They threw a bunch of likeable & charismatic actors in this movie, let them improvise a bunch of dialogue, and distracted the audience from the overly complicated plot. Every time I would start to feel confused by what was going on, the film would divert my thoughts with a witty line, an unusual hairstyle, a flashy new outfit, a fun song, or something like that. However, in the end, when it was all over, I felt empty and somewhat unfulfilled. This isn't a bad film. I just think that it's not all that it's reported to be when you look past the flashy façade.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"If seeing Jennifer Lawrence clean a house to 'Live and Let Die' is on your bucket list, then this your kind of movie","'American Hustle' is another movie that I've really wanted to see for a long time. It's probably because I love the 70s, or whatever. When it was finally released in good ol' England, it did not disappoint.Coming into this with only having seen 'Silver Linings Playbook' as some of O Russell's previous work, I didn't really know what to expect. Although that was very good, it is completely different on many levels, so whatever this was, it was going to be fresh.As not to spoil anything, I won't go through the film scene by scene, but I have to say this film met and (to an extend) exceeded my expectations. There was noting I didn't like about it, because everything and everyone was just so brilliant. First off, the acting was superb. The improv that the actors pull off made it all so much more real, because you felt that they were just letting themselves run with the story and script. When the tensions rise (which frequently happens during this film), you feel for these characters, because for a second they really are Riche Dimasso or Irving Rosenfelt. It also added a lot of the humour, which showed that, although it primarily felt like a drama, it didn't take it's self too seriously, which is so fresh and needed in Hollywood right now.For me, J Law's acting talent stole the show. I saw her in 'Silver Linings' and the first 'Hunger Games' a while back, so again I didn't have any real preconception of what she would be like. But in this movie, her acting was just on another level. Every scene she was in carried so many emotions, and you'd couldn't tell if she was going to explode at any point (a'la the bathroom scene with Sydney). The things her character gets herself into in this film, even while she's still at home, are just out right slap your knee hilarious, especially the argument scenes.Direction was a large positive for this. The way the camera moves is so subtle yet so effective. There are a lot of clichés that it could have fallen into, but O' Russell was very clever, and everything about the way he directed it was planned out perfectly. The camera seems to interact with the characters emotions, so you're really seeing this on more than one level.The story was another element that made it so brilliant for me. Well, that was at the end. I loved the way it ended. It's just as the film plays out, you're so engrossed in the amazing performances, style, characters and humour, it gets hard to keep track of the story. Not on the level of the new 'Doctor Who' episodes, which have plot lines so ridiculously convoluted. You weren't supposed to get it at the start, as your just thrown into this world of eccentric, self absorbed con-men. You get the general idea throughout, with what's happening and what they're aiming to do, but when it got to the end, I didn't get some of the things they were taking about that seemed important ('Did I miss all of that? Was that when that old guy walked in to the cinema with a 20 year old something girlfriend and I lost focus for a bit?'). I heard that O' Russell was more focused on the characters, and lost a lot of story to allow room for Improv, so I guess it's OK if you don't get all of it. I didn't and still thoroughly enjoyed it. There are times during the film when I thought ""Wow, that's a brilliant way to end a movie"", and then it suddenly carried on and wasn't over, and the story got even more compelling. The way it wrapped up was a feat of true story telling.I'm not one for movies about money and mafias and cons and all that, but aside from that, it's just as much a tale about relationships and what people are really like. The story of Irving's relationship with his family and Sydney plays out so well, and you feel things for them as their relationship changes, and when Cooper's character enters their unique workforce.This film really benefited from the actors improvising, as it lead to some very funny moments. Obviously meaning to be funny, like the scene on the the jet and Roselyn's explanations for everything Irving throws at her. I meant that scene where she cleans the house to Live and Let Die is hilariously awkward to watch, with her little son just sitting there and watching his mom give an angry yet powerful rendition of the Wings song.Bale portrayed Irving brilliantly. When things get tough for him, he excellently shows how a man of his status and ideology breaks down, bit by bit. You start the realize that even though he's so eccentric and rich, he still only human. I think Jeremy Renner deserves credit for that too. Not in the sense that his character goes through the same stuff as Bale's, but in that he was played with so much heart and honesty.Something that hasn't been seen for a while in Movie-Land, 'American Hustle' is a unique film that gets in the audience up close and personal with every main character they see. The story could have been clearer, but heck, 'Badlands' had little story and that was brilliant too. It makes way for the improvisation, which adds so much and another dynamic to the story and experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A big dose of strangely endearing entertainment,"American Hustle is all about large characters, outlandish fashion and awful hair. It may tease you into thinking it's some kind of smart con- artist movie with it's (very loosely) based-on-real-events premise (""some of this actually happened"", the opening credits inform us) and snappy trailer. But for all visual pizazz, this is in fact a very small movie, focusing on a small set of unique and frequently bizarre characters that just happen to cross paths amidst the ABSCAM operation in the late 70's and early 80's. Imagine if the characters from I Heart Huckabees (2004) were in fact the people who took part in the operation covered in Argo (2012), and you'll have something akin to American Hustle.Paunchy con-artist and loan-shark Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) hooks up with the beautiful Sydney (Amy Adams), an intelligent and ambitious American girl who improves Irving's scams by pretending to be an English aristocrat. When they are busted by creepy FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), they are promised leniency if they assist the Bureau in making four additional arrests. The plan is to entrap popular Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), who is looking to inject funds into gambling in Atlantic City, by having a friend pose as an Arab sheik looking for potential investments in America. As Irving, Richie and Sydney delve further into the sting, things start to spiral wildly out of control, as Irving's loud-mouth wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) can't seem to keep her mouth shut, and Richie develops feelings for Sydney.As said before, the plot plays second-fiddle to director David O. Russell's obvious fascination with this ensemble of weirdo's. Surprisingly, it's the slimy swindler at the centre of it all, Irving, that comes out of it the most recognisably human. In the opening scene, we see a shockingly bloated Bale, slapping his awful toupee across his head to cover up an embarrassing hairline. Is this the American Dream at work, a petty criminal posing as a sophisticated, honest guy? Well, no, American Hustle doesn't need to try and touch those metaphorical heights, but this is the type of person we're to spend the next two-plus hours with. An apparently successful sort of guy, covered in gold and eyes covered by tinted sunglasses, but hiding something fragile or dangerous that may soon reveal itself.The performances are spectacular, as one would expect. Bale manages to make you actually root for his slimeball character, and Jennifer Lawrence shows that she seems able to tackle any role or character with aplomb. Cooper does a job similar to his previous work with Russell, Silver Linings Playbook (2012), but even betters that. He seems to have the uncanny ability to make you instantly know there's just something wrong with his character, and when we see him at dinner with the fiancée he clearly doesn't love or respect, his hair bunched up in tiny little rollers, there's something simply tragic about him. And Amy Adams, let loose here to reveal an unseen feistiness, wins the award for Side-Boob of the Year.The whole thing is a rather strange experience, never really falling into a recognisable genre or taking a conventional approach to storytelling. It could only really come from the mind of David O. Russell, the only director that seems able to combine a mixture of mainstream commercial success, nominations and awards a-plenty, and independent sensibilities, never really moving away from his own vision. It's not a total success of course - Irving's admiration from the 'moral' Mayor Polito, who just wants to rejuvenate Atlantic City, seems a bit of a sympathy quick-fix, and no-one can out-Scorsese Martin Scorsese. Well, maybe Paul Thomas Anderson can. But American Hustle is a big dose of strangely endearing entertainment, that even when it outstays it's welcome towards the end still made me want to spend more time with the characters.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Excellent, and refreshingly so","I knew nothing about this film when we sat down in the cinema tonight to see it, so I had no expectations. But from the opening moments I found myself completely engaged by the acting, and interested in the characters straight away.Christian Bale has not done much for me in recent years, but he was captivating in this, and in every single scene. His physical transformation into a slightly overweight conman with a bad comb-over was enhanced by his believable character portrayal, and I have renewed respect for him now as an actor that can be damn interesting to watch.Bradley Cooper was brilliant, as was Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer Lawrence, and Louis C.K.. There wasn't a single person that didn't pull their weight, and it makes the film's more-than-2-hour-length fly by.There's not much in the way of physical action...in fact, I can't think of anything any action at all really...but the drama of the film is so well handled that action simply isn't necessary. Even the comedic moments were handled superbly.I'd love to criticise something, cos no film is perfect, but this is a tough one to find fault with...maybe I would have left out Lawrence's dance scene when she mimed to Live and Let Die, cos it felt slightly at odds with the rest of the film in my opinion, but that's being seriously harsh.So, to sum up, if you want a movie with top acting, big stars, brilliant dialogue, no over-the-top action and a well thought out story (with some historical truth mixed in), then this one is for you.Trust me, you won't be sorry!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Brilliant Performances, Over-rated Flick!","I'd seen American Hustle soon after its release and till this time I'd been pondering what to make of it. I just couldn't figure out why it was acclaimed so much.David O Russell has become a go-to guy for Oscars it seems. No matter what movie he makes, its bound to win at least one Academy Award or at least get a couple of nominations. He's being doing it in a row and American Hustle has undoubtedly ended up on everybody's favorite list, some even preferring it more than Martin Scorsese's debauchery epic The Wolf of Wall Street or Steve McQueen's period drama on slavery, 12 Years a Slave. Myself having seen American Hustle, though, would stand on the other side of the fence.Silver Linings Playbook was one of those fine movies which captured my short attention span from start till end. Owe it all to the fabulous performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper coupled with David O Russell's offbeat injection of comedy. While I could be called a Jennifer Lawrence superfan, I was not a big fan of Bradley Cooper, thanks to Alias, I could never shake off the image of Will Tippin from my mind but what can I say Silver Linings Playbook did make a fan outta me, well at least of his performance more rather than him. The Fighter was another film that had everything going for it, solid performances from Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, David's direction and a brilliant script. David O Russell, far from his I Heart Huckabees days was indeed churning out finely made movies.American Hustle held a lot of promises having pulled the inexplicably talented stars from both Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter. A slew of arguably the best actors from Hollywood but were they put to best use? I'll stick with 'Nah'. The actors however were at their best, having fun with their respective roles. American Hustle has a lot of style as well, the actors and the settings were all set ablaze with genuine looking costumes and props. I mean the direction was good, actors were plenty and performed well but all that doesn't make a great movie? I was irked by two issues: 1: The Pacing. Compared to The Wolf of Wall Street's 3 Hours which felt like a breeze, American Hustle's mere 138 felt laboring. It did have its fast moments but at times it felt excruciatingly slow. And problem number 2: The obvious predictability. I don't know if it was intended that way but the predictability this movie carried made me question O Russell. Considering this was a con movie, everybody would agree the final revelation wasn't the least epic Hey, I was brewn so, expecting something revelatory is totally normal and would have just made American Hustle GREAT. a la Oceans Eleven!Christian Bale's amazing sincerity towards his role had been evident from frame one. We've seen him get emaciated in The Machinist then get beefed up for his Batman roles then again get thin in The Fighter. Here we've got a flabby potbellied balding Bale in the role of Irving Rosenfeld. Bale has once again shows us that he can take on any kinda role, superhero or not. Bradley Cooper yet again displays off his acting prowess and shows that he's come a long way from his Alias days. Amy Adams proves that she can sizzle both as a commercial or art-house actress, be it Lois Lane or the insanely glamorous Sydney Prosser. Her side bosom gets a special mention as well. Jennifer Lawrence as the raunchy Rosalyn Rosenfeld was so adorable despite her slightly grey tone in the movie. Its impossible not to like her even when she plays a horny, yammering, naggy wifeand does it near perfectly. To see C K Louis was a pleasant surprise and scenes with him and Bradley Cooper did pack a lot of laughs. Jeremy Renner ends up in a solid role, this guy had been looked upon post his Hawkeye role but I am glad that he did an excellent job as Mayor Carmine Polito.American Hustle's soundtrack, though was thoroughly enjoyable, be it along with the visuals or not. The score composed by Danny Elfman really stood out and kept a admirably fast pace for an otherwise slow procession of things. The selection of songs featured on the OST was also noteworthy.Agreed, American Hustle had great performances, a decent storyline and excellent direction and in all sense its a perfectly watchable flick but does it deserve an Academy Award just for affixing 'America' to its title? Not quite. I have nothing against the Academy's incline towards American movies or directors but there is a roster of much better movies nominated this year which genuinely deserves it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Intoxicating and dangerous,"Watching American Hustle one of the things that truly got to me was how back in the day when J. Edgar Hoover ran the FBI nobody like Bradley Cooper's character could ever have gotten employed in that agency. Let alone have the FBI use someone like Christian Bale as a pawn in a sting. Hoover was such a stickler for straight arrow types that Cooper could never have gotten in the door. Of course Hoover also never went after organized crime, but I can't help thinking that his quirks about dress and deportment weren't completely bad after seeing American Hustle.American Hustle is the story of the Abscam scandal and with a lot of poetic license it's an account of how it was almost an accident that several members of Congress were ensnared with bribery charges.Our protagonist is Christian Bale who plays a low level conman, but one who is good. He's got as a sidekick Amy Adams who affects an English accent as part of their modus operandi. He and Adams are both trapped by FBI agent Bradley Cooper who in his own way is as much con artist as they are. Instead of arresting them, he admires the way they work and turns them into his own operatives.It's impossible to proceed with further plot description. The investigation just gets away from any control and instead of mobsters they're taking down members of Congress who are bribed to get citizenship for phony Arab sheik. In the end Bale has to use some of the techniques employed in The Sting to get out from under.American Hustle is about a world that is intoxicating and dangerous. Bale and Cooper are evenly matched pair of allied antagonists. Amy Adams sure gets her innings in. There's also Jennifer Lawrence whom you will not forget as Bale's wife who with her own selfish dizziness may get them all killed. All four were nominated for acting Oscars and not one of them won. In fact 10 nominations went to American Hustle and it did not take home a winner.All four of these players sublimate their own personalities into their characters to a degree rarely seen. Christian Bale in most of his films does that to a degree I've not seen since Paul Muni. But that all four did here is a tribute to director David O. Russell.Like the Scorsese classics Goodfellas and Casino, American Hustle changes all the names so a lot of license can be used. And of course with Robert DeNiro playing a small, but unforgettable role as mob boss, the identification is complete.American Hustle is a film not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Was ok but nothing more,"The movie was ok, it was not a bad movie but also not an extraordinary movie. I am probably the only here who didn't like the movie that much. There is not much happening in the movie and it is a lot of talking.The story is about a FBI agent who is a little bit crazy and who forces two small hustlers (hence the title) to work with him together to arrest some big fishes. The movie is - if I got this right - basing partly on a true story.I can't say anything bad about the performance of the actors, as always Christian Bale was excellent in the movie. However American Hustler is not a movie I would watch a second time, but I can still recommend the movie though, I am sure other people will like it, I guess it was just nothing for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Cetinich Review (#2 - American Hustle) - Brilliant Throughout,"American Hustle, starring Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper, is about two con artists forced into working for an FBI agent as he pushes the two into a world of New Jersey mafia. Directed by David O. Russell, the director who brought you Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, American Hustle is most probably Russell's best movie he's ever put together.American Hustle is set in the late 1970's - early 1980's, revolving around the Abscam scandal, where FBI agents and con artists would join together to take down politics for illegal cash. The casting and acting is brilliant. You couldn't really picture anybody else playing the characters that have been casted. Each actor gets their own chance to shine in the spotlight, and nobody is left out. Jennifer Lawrence blows everybody away once again - she really is a rising star in the industry with her performance as Rosalyn Rosenfeld. This might be Bradley Cooper's best movie so far as well - he really brings his A-Game for the movie as Richie DiMaso.The movie has cleavage, drugs, money, quirkiness, great actors, comedy, drama and lesbian kisses which makes for an amazing and unbeatable combination. Five losers who all think they are winners, American Hustle is up there with great movies like Goodfellas, but is definitely an original creation.Acting: 10/10Writing: 10/10Directing: 9/10Setting: 9/10Overall Rating: 9.5",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great Acting, OK Plot.","This movie has gotten a lot of buzz, and I decided to watch it after it won the Golden Globe for best comedy. For me, the movie itself was just OK, but the acting, costumes, and music were all amazing. Christian Bale is at his best as the lead in this film, and Jennifer Lawrence has some of the best scenes in the movie. All in all I am a little confused about how I feel about this movie. It starts well, I was initially engaged and interested to see what happened. The middle dragged a little bit, and it was hard to keep my mind from wandering. Thankfully there is a great cameo by Robert DeNiro in the middle that grabs your attention and gets you back on track for awhile. By the end of the movie though I was happy that I had sat through the whole thing, I really enjoyed how everything ending up playing out, and found myself smiling at the end of it all. So while I wouldn't call this movie a must see, it certainly is not a waste of time either. If you have a night to kill, give this movie a shot and at least enjoy the great performances, if not so much the slightly slow plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great performances in a mediocre, poorly paced and written film","Frankly, the movie itself does not live up to its hype. I never was fully engaged with any character even though it takes more than enough time and delivers a tedious and often painstaking pace. Honestly, it felt to me like the film dragged and that the ending would never arrive. Even though not fully engaged and not empathetic towards any character depicted, there is enough style that I somehow cared about how the story ended. Every scene seemed to me like an exercise in an acting class. It feels like a professor took a group of talented actors and gave them this over-the-top 1970's assignment. Everyone gets an ""A"" because they are that good but it barely felt like a coherent film to me. It's like their assignment included constant references to try and deliver a ""Goodfellas"" type tone without having a script to back it up. The events of the conclusion were so easy to spot that I'm sure most everyone will see it coming a mile away.Overall, interesting but there is far less substance than I was expecting. I have to say this was a let down.",,Anonymous,Crime

It's really impressive how O. Russell has became such an 'actor's director'!,"'AMERICAN HUSTLE': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director David O. Russell's new comedy/crime drama film (set in the 1970s) about a con man, and his partner, who are forced to work with a crazy FBI agent as part of a sting operation. It stars Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence and Cooper recently starred in O. Russell's 2012 hit 'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' (which is my all time favorite movie) and Bale and Adams co-starred in his film before that 'THE FIGHTER'. Bale and Lawrence won Oscars for their parts (Cooper and Adams were nominated). Lawrence, Cooper and Bale are likely to be up for Academy Awards again this year (Lawrence is a frontrunner and a win would be back-to-back Oscars for her). The film is also a major Academy Awards contender itself (as is David O. Russell) and has received almost universally positive reviews. I love the film and think it deserves every bit of the hype and praise it's been getting!Christian Bale put on 40 lbs to play the role of Irving Rosenfeld (based on real life conman Melvin Weinberg). Rosenfeld was an intelligent and successful con-artist in 1978 when he met Sydney Prosser (Adams), a stripper who was also very good at the art of 'hustling people'. The two teamed up and became lovers, despite the fact that Rosenfeld was married and had an adopted son named Danny (played by Danny and Sonny Corbo). Danny was the son of Irving's dimwitted wife Rosalyn (Lawrence). All went well for Irving and Sydney until they were caught in the act by an undercover FBI agent named Richard DiMaso (Cooper). DiMaso forced them to help him bust four bigger con-artists and Mayor Carmine Polito (Renner, who's character is based on Angelo Errichetti) got caught in their hustle as well. Adams' character Sydney Prosser is also based on Evelyn Knight, DiMaso is based on Anthony Amoroso, Jr. and Rosalyn is based on Cynthia Marie Weinberg.Lawrence (my favorite actress) is a scene stealer in the movie (once again) and she lights up the screen every time she comes on it, especially the first time she appears, when she really takes the film up a notch! What's surprising is that the film continues to stay at the same energetic level even when Lawrence is off screen (which is a large part of the movie, given her part is a smaller supporting role). For the first 20 minutes or so I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy the film that much but it really picked up in pace (and entertainment value) and I think that's largely due to O. Russell's flawless direction. While the movie is not quite as classic as 'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' it is O. Russell's most impressive directing job to date (in a visual and stylistic way at least). The performances are all excellent as well, especially Lawrence and Cooper (who are once again the two craziest characters in the movie). Bale and Adams make great straight men (and women) though; Adams looks more beautiful and acts better than she ever has before and Bale really went all out gaining the weight he did to play this unattractive balding criminal. It's really impressive how O. Russell has became such an 'actor's director' (especially given the history he has with actors he's worked with in the past, like George Clooney and Lily Tomlin). His script is brilliant as well (based on a screenplay by Eric Warren Singer, which is in turn based on historical events involving the FBI ABSCAM operation of the 70s and early 80s). It's yet another amazing masterpiece from David O. Russell and one of the best films of the year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDElhat3XPM",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
possibly the best film of 2013,"From the opening scene in American Hustle, I knew I was going to go on a unique, fun ride of a film. The first ten minutes of American Hustle was already exciting and fun enough to have my attention and investment throughout its entirety. The story centers on two con men, or one con man and con woman, played wonderfully by Christian Bale and Amy adams, get caught red handed by officer Richie dimasso, and are forced to help him con corrupt politicians, in exchange for avoiding jail time. This sets off an array of trouble, as they find themselves getting revolved in a world of dangerous men, and vulnerable situations, including the wife(Jennifer lawrence) of Irving (Christian bale) Who can destroy the whole operation. The strongest element in this film was the strong performances and it's what drove this Films success.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"American Hustle: 5 parts style,1 part substance, a chigger of period music, dirty with an expected twist","American Hustle: 5 parts style,1 part substance, a chigger of period music, dirty with an expected twistAmerican Hustle attempts to be a David Mamet script filmed by Martin Scorsese. It's a nice try, but it doesn't live up to the challenge.Sure, there are a couple of memorable lines, but the timing is off. Sure, there is some great period music, but it is at times awkward and plays because ""we need a song here"" and not because it fits. Sure, the costumes are great. They are also great costumes in San Francisco's Castro on Halloween. Sure, the characters are whack, but we don't care about them.You don't have to care about the characters in a movie, but if you don't care about them, they have to be interesting. The characters in American Hustle are neither empathetic nor fascinating. They are retread characters from an old seventies television cop show like Baretta or Kojak. While that's not bad, it's not enough for a major Hollywood film to sustain it.The movie starts at a climatic scene at the end of the second act and cut back to the beginning of the story, not unlike Good Fellas. However, unlike Good Fellas, there's no payoff, so to speak, at the end. The beginning is confusing and it lacks back story and development. The film is at once overly complex and predictably simple.Sure, this movie will get its share of nominations for acting and Danny Elfman's sound track (a bright spot), but it's just not that soulful, ground breaking or hard hitting. Nor is it that entertaining.Rating: Rent it.It's not terrible, and the costumes are fun. However, unless you need to see wide lapels, bad comb-overs, caked on eye-shadow and long lashes larger then life, see it at home on the cheap. Better yet, rent Good Fellas, Casino, Heist or Glengarry Glen Ross to see what you, and the film makers of American Hustle, are missing.Peace,Tex Shelters",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A great film, not to be missed!","In American vernacular, ""hustle"" has several definitions. One of the definitions is ""to cheat"". Another reference is a type of dance, popular in the 70s disco craze. ""American Hustle"" is about a con job that is choreographed better than any dance move you can think of. The first screen capture read ""some of this actually happened"". The true part of the film is easy to recognize. During the waning days of the 70s, the US Feds operated a sting operation meant to capture corrupt US politicians. ABSCAM generated a lot of headlines and, if you're interested in the details, Google is your friend. The good part of the film, though, is a fictional story of how a couple of grifters get recruited by the Feds. Robert DeNiro is on screen less than a minute, in an uncredited role of a possibly corrupt casino owner, and he's substantially more menacing than his role in the execrable celluloid cesspool ""Malavita"". Jennifer Lawrence portrays a completely out-of-control wife, and her performance reminded me of Elizabeth Taylor in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"". This movie is a gem, and I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of the worst films,"this film, to me, is a joke and an ultimate insult to the viewers who still got some reasoning abilities and basic taste buds enough to distinguish between good and bad film. first of all, very bad casting that none of the characters looked convincingly enough to be who should be or would be. if you tried to con rich and powerful people, you must let them to believe you were who you were, the con and the scam must allow them to believe it was true enough and profitable enough, because rich and powerful people were not naive and stupid, otherwise, they would never got to the top of the social ladder. the rich and the powerful pack were a special species who usually got a very sensitive nose to smell fishy deals, they were always on the fence to protect themselves, and they always knew they might become the marks of scams. partner with a low class woman and claimed her with London banking connection was the first pitfall of this stupid film, because she didn't have the least believable ingredients to fool people that she was a British, she didn't look like a British, she didn't talk like a British, she didn't show anything that could prove she got the foreign financial connections. it was laughable that she could con any man just by wearing some expensive clothes or showed people with some fake deposit certificate. then, again, all the make-up works were horrible, the hairdos of the cons and the marks, especially the so-called mayor, what funny cartoon character! the horrible screenplay just took everything so conveniently granted, feeding stupid scenarios and plots to viewers like they got no brains, carelessly put together. the male and the female cons only gave you an impression that they were white trash from the trailer parks. the politicians and the mafia, all looked like characters from the disneyland. the storyline, nothing but a project from a high school student, submitted a homework overnight. there's nothing worth praising at all for this film, and after a whole year's viewing experience and the last film watched end of the year, it has spoiled and ruined all the good memory of some good films of 2013. we viewers should be always picky and always got the attitude of not so easy to be pleased or satisfied to any film, because only with such principle, the Hollywood movie industries would take us seriously and never take us for granted as brainless morons that they could keep dumping garbage on us. you should always treat the gangs from Hollywood as con men or scammers, always suspect they might treat you as stupid mark. only by such serious once-bitten-twice-shy viewing attitude, they might have the luck to fool you once, but never twice.",,Anonymous,Crime

The star-studded cast makes you think this would probably be the best movie of the year but it is not even close. The acting, the story, the directing it's too pretentious. I think Mr. Russell needs a lesson in humility, so does Mr. Bale and Ms. Lawrence. What is this movie? a con movie, a movie about struggle to survive, a movie about revenge, It's hard to decide. It's a piece of S##T for sure. I am still giving it 6/10 for Ms. Adams' and Mr. Coopers' almost over the top but still an average performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hustling at its apex!! No lie!,"What a horrific movie this is! Yuk!!! Get away from this monstrosity of a picture! Kidding! Just conning you because everyday I'm hustling LMFAO!!! I am no pun hustler, well maybe a little, but one thing I know that is real is that ""American Hustle"" is one of the best if not the best movie of 2013. Director David O. Russell strikes gold again with another impressive playbook in orchestrating a motion picture. ""American Hustle"" stars a top-of-his-game Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, a lifelong New York con artist who teams up with the beautiful Sydney Prosser to con desperate men asking for loans. Amy Adams plays Prosser with exact precision. Not to mention, Amy has never looked better in a movie; Will Larry Flynt be calling Amy for a Hustler cover? Who knows? But she is better than that. Anyways, when Irving and Sydney get busted by FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (masterfully played by Bradley Cooper), the con game goes into a governmental level. DiMaso uses Irving and Sydney to seize elected officials in taking bribes; this was all based on the real life Abscam scandal of the late 70's. The movie is set in the 70's and it is presented also as a love letter to that ""won't play by the rules"" decade, and that is the way uh-huh uh-huh I like it. Jennifer Lawrence also is on target here as Irving's showy wife Rosalyn. Jeremy Renner contributed a major Mayor performance as the targeted Mayor Carmine Polito. The entire acting ensemble of ""American Hustle"" was spectacular, but my favorite performance of the movie was of Cooper's as DiMaso. David O. Russell co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Singer, and what a money script it was. Sure Mr. Russell did incorporate a few Scorseseisms in his direction and writing of ""American Hustle"", but he did inject his own Russell muscle to it also. This movie should garner a plethora of Oscar nominations for Acting, Screenplay, and Direction among many other categories; and if it doesn't, there has to be some type of con going on in the Academy. So get on your Con-Air vehicle to witness the cinematic brilliance of ""American Hustle"". In other words, do the hustle!!!! ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

At This Point It's Not Overrated It's Underrated,"David O Russell's American Hustle is an extremely controversial film and I don't understand that controversy because I think this is an amazing crime thriller that reminds me of classic Scorsese movies. This movie on the wrong hands could have been very boring but it's not this movie is one that entertains me from start to finish and that's because of Russell's direction he maintains a fast pace and consistent tone that keeps me loving this film every time I watch it. The performances in this movie are all fantastic for one Bradley Cooper absolutely steals the show here he's amazing in this movie because he makes his character so unpredictable and unhinged but you can't help but be excited for when he gets back on screen. Amy Adams should have got the Oscar for this movie because she is such an unpredictable character your never completely sure where she's standing but you still route for her. Christian Bale gives another one of his legendary Body transformations in this movie and he gives one of his finest performances here because you can't just help but like him despite all the bad things he's done and continues to do. I love the fact that this movie was set in the 70s it just makes the film look more glamorous and Russell captures the period perfectly I didn't live in the 1970s but after watching this movie I feel like I have. The narration in American Hustle works which is good because if done wrong it can become very frustrating and overloading but helps you understand that characters mindsets and motivations. But without a doubt my biggest issue with this movie though is Jennifer's Lawrence's character don't get me wrong I love Jennifer Lawrence she gets way to much hate and she's fantastic in this movie but her character has far to much screen time than is necessary and it gets on the viewers nerves quickly.

And the Oscar goes to...cleavage,"It would be unfair that the only reason for so many Oscar nominations for this movie are the cleavages and the mere names of the cast. This movie is very watchable, good fun and gives you a thought or two. But not much more than that.It's the classic switcheroo – con artists get conned and then manage to up-con their rivals. Even though the movie is based on real events, there's not too much else to say about the plot. The cast however deserves a mention and Christian Bale in yet another of his body transformations is definitely the lead man. He does a good job and gives his character depth, even makes us feel for the guy. For a man so inclined to overacting, he's quite subdued.But Bradley Cooper makes up for that: he's the overacting throughout the movie and succeeds in making the FBI agent the sleaziest character in a movie about con artists, politicians and mobsters. Quite an achievement, really.Amy Adams' character motivation seems to have been: cleavage. I'm aware it's in line with the character, with the character's line of work where showing skin is meant to put off the guy on the other side of the table, but I can't shake the feeling it somehow took away from arguably the most interesting, the most layered character in the movie.Jennifer Lawrence is on the other hand the most annoying character and I guess that's an indicator she did a good job – but definitely not award material. Louis CK was brilliant, who would've thought he can actually act? De Niro plays a mobster, which means he was good.Jeremy Renner deserves a mention. Very convincing performance of the loser in the bunch, a sincere character who navigates through this story about the shades of grey.That's actually what the movie is about: it's another confirmation that the world is just shade upon shade upon shade of grey, and there's much more than fifty of them. David O. Russell conveys it in a light-hearted way, with nice period costumes and a great soundtrack, and, it gives you a thought or two, but not much more.Is this Oscar material? No way. Is it good Hollywood fun and should you watch it? Absolutely. I'm being benevolent and giving it a 7 even though it more deserves a 6.5, but definitely not a 6, though.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Of course if I was enjoying the film the length would not be an issue. The film did not hold my interest and I was bored for most of it. I read that most of it is improvised, and I think this lead to it feeling very fragmented and disjointed. My mind drifted often and I checked my watch many, many times.

"Runs a little long but is stylish, well acted and generally engaging, but you need to leave the awards hyping at the door","It is that time of year again, the time of year where films are talked up for their awards potential, where good films are hyped as the greatest films ever and so on – so it is a time to be wary of publicity. This is the case to a certain extent with American Hustle because it is a film whose marketing doesn't quite make it clear what it is, but does make it clear that it is probably the most brilliant thing you'll ever see. Of course it doesn't live up to this hype and I can understand why many viewers going in with these words in their brains came out disappointed, which is why it is important to try to leave this in the lobby and see the film for what it is.This also helps because from the trailers it isn't clear what the film is; whether it is a slick caper movie, a comedy or a true-story drama or thriller. Part of the reason I think they struggled to really pigeonhole it when selling it was that it does rather sit across all of these genres and surprisingly it does so pretty effectively. The story is based on truth and this is something that the film makes pretty clear from the very start with the ""some of this happened"" legend. The film is also effective as a comedy since the characters and rather out of control situations are often amusing and sometimes very funny. However more than this, the film is a drama because although you laugh, you are not laughing at the characters because they never lose the tragic cores that so many of them have. Although the film does not quite have the heart that could have added more, this aspect does draw you into the characters and it supports the drama as it unfolds. The story does build well even if it is a solid pace rather than a thriller; ironically the weaker moments of the narrative come towards the end and it maybe doesn't have the climax one would have hoped for.The strength of the film is the delivery. Much is said of the cast and they are all good because they do not let the period costumes, hair and narrative excesses turn them into caricatures. Instead all of them really seem to ""get"" the comic-tragic mix and deliver on this very well. Bale does it the best and is really good in a subdued role, giving his best turns opposite Renner, who himself is very good in a smaller role. I've no great love for Cooper but he is also good here. The two female roles are both very strong too, with Adams impressing and my opinion of Lawrence only increasing. Russell's direction and indeed the whole style of the film is very much owing a debt to others – in particular Scorsese and Goodfellas. Although these influences are very clear, I didn't really ever feel it was a copy because the film made it work for itself. The costumes, hair, sets and all aspects of the production come together really well to create a very effective sense of time and place.The hype has not helped this film – well, maybe it helps for votes in awards but not for the viewer. It isn't as flawless as some would suggest, but it is still a well done film that walks a fine line and delivers a mostly engaging story. The mix of comedy with the tragic characters is very well done across the board, adding some grit into the film and preventing it from being just slick superficiality or comedic caricatures with big hair. Leave the Oscar hype at the door and you'll find this an enjoyable film for many reasons.",,Anonymous,Crime
Conning plentifully,"This movie develops itself in a captivating atmosphere of conning and swindling that involves not only the conning characters but also such types as FBI agents, mafia men, Congressmen and a mayor of New Jersey. The performers act very well in their roles convincing us of the portrayed figures. The set schemes are too complicated and sometimes their details become somewhat incomprehensible for the unguarded viewer. A FBI agent obtains the help of a couple of conners (a man and his smart and cunning girlfriend) to catch some corrupt politicians red handed but this generates a lot of complicated relations that involve the sentimental relationships between men and women with some unexpected consequences to the planned schemes. These conners and swindlers are not presented like the usual stereotypes of bad people but like normal people instead with human feelings and reactions from love to anger. The story is quite believable in terms of reality and well directed and acted in filming terms.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle,"Christian Bale has always been prepared to go the extra mile for his art, but I am not sure it was worth it for this rather lengthy and messy crime caper. He portrays con-man ""Irving"" who works a series of scams with his glamorous British partner ""Sydney"" (Amy Adams). They are quite successful, until - that is - they fall foul of aspiring FBI investigator ""DiMaso"" (Bradley Cooper) who decides he can use their skills to infiltrate the murky world the Mafia. Add to this potentially toxic scenario the politically savvy and aptly named ""Polito"" (Jeremy Renner) and the omni-presence of ""Rosalyn"" (Jennifer Lawrence) who just happens to be the wife of ""Irving"" and who is none too pleased about her husband's antics with his new colleague. What ensues here now is a clunkily thrown together series of escapades that all hang on certain aspects of the story and characterisations that just don't really work. The attempts at humour miss much more than they hit; the faux-gangster plot falls flat and lacks grit or plausibility and Adams' British accent (and therefore her identity) is all over the place - I doubt it would convince even Dick van Dyke let along the FBI! The attempts at building an intricate domino-style plot where it could all come a-tumbling down at any time are too contrived, and that jeopardy presents it's self once too often and with ever diminishing effect as the story rather lurches along to it's almost slap-stick denouement. Though it features an A-list cast, there is not much chemistry on display for us here and the whole thing just takes far, far, too long to get up any head of steam. It does look good, and the soundtrack offers an enjoyably eclectic mix of songs, but I just wasn't sold on the very wordy suckering and scheming, sorry.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great piece of art - the promo ruined it,"Before I start writing about how much I love this movie, let me criticize on thing: The movie was advertised as an entertaining movie for everybody. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The movie cares more about the needs of the actors themselves, than the viewers. There is no typical story arc. I was shocked as I saw all the advertisement, because I could not believe that David O. Russell made a movie that meets everyone's needs. And it does not.Now let me make clear why I ADORE this movie:1.) THE ACTORS! I can't understand anyone who says that Jennifer Lawrence sucks in this movie and that her performance is totally overrated. In her 20 minutes screen time she shows a bunch of emotions, and what is really important: She built a character. She made her character become real, and this is what I call great acting. In addition, she really dominates the screen, as soon as she appears. All in all, I think she made an astonishing performance and I prefer it over Lupita Nyong'o's. (Just in order to refer a little bit to the Oscars) Then, Bradley Cooper was really amazing! Again, he really built a character. A loser, who thinks that he's the big boss. He drives his performance in so many directions. He is funny and somehow heartwarming. In the other second he becomes this reckless and crazy wannabe. Amy Adams and Bale did a similarly great job and complete this perfect cast. The actors truly are the heart of this movie.2.) The screenplay. I think it seems so authentic, funny and dramatic. Maybe not that good as in Silver Linings Playbook, but absolutely great!3.) The atmosphere. I left the cinema with a big smile on my face. You get this naughty feeling while watching it, and it simply makes you feel good; as we are used to, when watching David O. Russell movies.All in all, I can say that this an unique and remarkable movie, that makes me feel good and that lives from its actors. If you are looking for entertainment with a structured plot, I would recommend ""Wolf of Wall Street"". Otherwise dive into the world of 4 losers, who all think they're big deals!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not Perfect, But a Lot of Fun","If you took the wittiest and most entertaining parts of Ben Affleck's Argo and amped them up to Monty Python levels of farce, you'd get the basic feel of David O. Russell's American Hustle. With all the controversy surrounding Hustle's Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, I walked in expecting an out-and-out drama. But a comedy it is, and a darn funny one, at that. It's practically a throwback to Preston Sturges, in that the plot doesn't really matter; it overlaps, contradicts itself, and loops back around in a glorious mess.Christian Bale is absolutely dynamite as overweight con man Irving Rosenfeld, who is introduced to us in a lengthy scene wherein he combs his hair. Well, combs is an understatement for the elaborate comb-over and toupee patchwork that sits atop his head. It's a brilliant introduction to a small-time con, a sleazy character in a movie brimming with them.While Rosenfeld and his assistant/mistress Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams in her best role to date) may be sleazy, they certainly aren't stupid. They are successful in their line of work, which happens to involve duping desperate people into giving them $5,000 to secure a nonexistent $50,000 loan. When the lovebirds are picked up by hotshot FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper, playing dumb quite well), they become embroiled in a series of stings in exchange for their own immunity. DiMaso is a man who wants to wield power he doesn't possess. He is only intimidating because his lack of foresight makes him volatile. He is three steps behind everyone else, and he realizes it.The first thing you will notice about American Hustle, except for maybe how well-done the period details are, is the caliber of the acting. Bale and Adams rise above the rest, but the performances are strong all around. Jennifer Lawrence, as Rosenfeld's kooky younger wife, shows up here and there to throw a wrench into every plan. She holds her own, though I am still not sold on her playing older than she really is: Lawrence is 23, and she shows it. She is gifted at improvising, but against world-class acting from the likes of Bale and Cooper, her portrayal seems more like a pretty mask worn by Katniss Everdeen than a lived-in character courtesy of an Oscar-winner.Jeremy Renner is superb as the target of DiMaso's operation, New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito. In Renner's hands, we see no ulterior motives lurking beneath the surface: Polito is a genuine guy who really wants to see his city take a turn for the better amidst the crime and violence of the 1970s. He is aware that he must deal with unsavory characters to get things done, but isn't interested in skimming off the top. In DiMaso's eyes, though, it's enough to be called corrupt.This is certainly Russell's most entertaining film in years, although his penchant to let the actors improvise gets a bit out of hand. There are many instances where it becomes clear that the actors are off- script, and such transparent improve tends to pull the viewer out of the film. Still, American Hustle is hugely enjoyable, a very funny and often very tense story that crosses elements from GoodFellas and The Informant in the best imaginable ways.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Godfather meets The Sting,"American Hustle is a stunning epic with a repeat cast from the Silver Linings Playbook, is perfectly paced film that lets the viewer in on just enough of the joke to feel smart enough to be engrossed, but not so much that anyone could say ""I saw that coming."" While both a dramatic tour de force and a comedic parody, this film has all the grip of Godfather I or II which ever you favor. This stellar cast delivers A Sorkin-like plot with the comedic aplomb of an Apatow spoof, and left me wanting more.

"Ridiculous, boring, uninteresting - seriously, who enjoyed this film?","The vast majority of critics and (thus?) moviegoers reacted differently, but I actually consider American Hustle to be an effective argument against improvisation in films. Because, whereas I'm a great fan of it when it's executed amusingly by talented stand-up comedians, unscripted babble can thoroughly blacken a film's quality – and that's exactly what happened with this one.David O. Russell has an increasingly strong penchant for preferring characters over plot, which he and his actors have stated numerous times and which worked in some of his earlier stuff. However, the New York writer/director oversteps the bounds of aforementioned conversation technique in his 2013 release and makes it a hopeful contestant for the most boring ""comedy"" I've ever seen in my life. The almost two and a half hours of running time have a promising start with a ridiculously long take of Christian Bale adjusting his hair, but the only thing American Hustle remains after that is ridiculous. Each and every role is cast with a talented actor or actress, but in my humble opinion, this is irrelevant, as none of them are realistic, likable, or even interesting and impromptu doesn't suit any of them.I haven't had a tittle of insight in the making of this surprising Oscar nominee, but, from what I saw on screen, I assume that the actors had a great deal of fun with it. Be that as it may, none of it relayed to me as an audience member and I was merely at awe how Russell could possibly neglect his task of directing that much, apparently delightfully accepting all ideas he was presented with, regardless of their absurdity. Some scenes, for example Robert De Niro's one and only, are totally void of sense and some of the biggest ""Plot? Screw that."" moments I can remember to have seen in all my life. The abundantly great amounts of improvisation would have led to something wholly incomprehensible and thus, Russell (due to his producers' demands, maybe) reacted the way you could expect: filling a perceived third of the film with explanatory voice-over, a trite and overused compensation for poor storytelling.Granted, American Hustle does have good-looking costumes and set design as well as fine cinematography and editing, and if you find joy in the over the top of over the top portrayal of characters– well, go ahead, watch it. I just think that most of the people claiming to like the film are being overtly pretentious and following critics' opinions, since there isn't really anything about it to enjoy.",,Anonymous,Crime
Mixed feelings about it.,"I really do have mixed feelings about the film. There are some superb performances Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner are nothing short of superb especially Jennifer singing. Hilarious.But at times it is fairly confusing and I found some parts hard to follow. And hair rollers appeared rather too frequently! I have been told that these were to show that everything is a superficial image but I am not sure that the film is that deep.There is great attention to detail in so many aspects of the film that it is unfortunate that they neglected the women's fashions of the 70s. The ""women's wardrobe"" on this film need to do some SERIOUS study on 70s fashion! I don't understand how they can get the room sets looking so authentic and then have 21st century glamour sitting in a 70s set.IT was anachronistic.Although the film is a fictionalised account of a real event, I feel that Jeremy Renner's character was not sufficiently sympathetic to the real person on whom it is based; the man was a hero who just ""fell of the box "" and paid for it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Game On!,"This film is highly recommended.The comb-over, that not-so-subtle way of camouflaging your own flaws so that others might see you in a different light. Perhaps, it's just a self-fulfilling prophecy, a means of vanity over delusion, a fight against the helplessness of aging. Literally, it's all a slight of hand, a desperate attempt at concealing the obvious truth and garnering personal acceptance at any cost. This startling opening image, that of a con man named Irving Rosenfeld (a portly Christian Bale) preening before a mirror, begins American Hustle, David O. Russell's dramedy about grifters and their schemes to get what they want.Even before this clever opening shot, American Hustle begins with the following disclaimer: Some of this actually happened. This title card zeroes in on the perfect comic tone for the film and the Abscam sting operation of the late 1970's becomes Russell's inspiration. The film uses fictitious characters to show the ongoing corruption of governmental leaders during that era. And characters they are, fully realized and played for our utmost farcical enjoyment!The film's characters are of the Guys and Dolls variety, a screwball assortment of Runyonesque endearing quirks and lowlife mobster stereotypes. Besides Irving, the mastermind of the scam, we also meet Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) Irving's sexy and cunning moll and mistress, their target, Carmine Politio (Jeremy Renner), all swagger pompadour and good intentions as an ambitious New Jersey mayor, Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence), Irving's trophy wife (if the trophy in question is Best Dimwit of 1978), a modern reworking of the Miss Adelaine type of gal, and FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), a vain and obsessively slick operator out to get them all.The ensemble is wonderful. Bale literally carries the weight of the film and creates a complex character driven by greed and his need for living the high life. Cooper energizes the film with a fervor of zealousness and brashness that sets all the antics in motion. Renner plays his character as a sincere dolt wanting his share of fame and glory with an exacting ineptitude. This male trio play off each other so very well. But it is their female counterparts that spin the film into the comic and strangely tragic stratosphere. With her many accents and characterizations, Adams' Sydney conveys a full range of emotions from her street smart petty criminal to the elegant and sophisticated Lady Edith. Lawrence's Rosalyn is a wonderful ditz, a floozy who is quick to react without realizing the consequences from her words or deeds. She steals every scene she's in. (The film's high point is when these two actresses have a memorable altercation in the ladies room about their role in Irving's life.) Strong support by Louis C.K., Michael Pena, Jack Huston, Alessandro Nivola, Shea Whigham, and Elisabeth Rohm round out this perfect cast.Russell's script, co-written with Eric Singer, is a throwback to the quick banter of the Hollywood screwball comedies of the 40's. The dialog is quick-witted and sly, even if the situation causes more serious repercussions for all those involved. The direction is concise and detailed, from his larger-than-life characters down to the polyester period costumes and 70's pop music soundtrack. Russell's production team outdoes themselves with special mention going to costume designer Michael Wilkinson, the fine art direction of Jesse Rosenthal, and Linus Sandgren's fluid cinematography.American Hustle is a delightful con game that keeps the movie-going audience guessing right up until the film reaches its foregone conclusion. Russell has added yet another fine film to his impressive resume that already includes: Three Kings, The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook and I Heart Hucklebees (well, let's not include the latter). American Hustle may will be this prolific director's best work to date. It certainly is one of the best movies of 2013.

A great movie in an quiet genre,"Let's face it; the crime genre has been pretty much dead for the past few years. However, American Hustle brought it back in a much needed reinvigoration; and a great one, for that.David Russell's movie is a great portrayal of the Abscam scheme, something which was brand new territory for me before I watched American Hustle. Despite it being very much of a dramatization of the scam, American Hustle captures the real essence of political crime in the 1970's.The characters in the movie instantly interested me; I wanted to know how this unusual group had come together, other than the obvious reason of an imminent hustle. These characters were well portrayed by their actors and actresses, which was expected when I saw the well known and reputable names of the lead cast.Despite this, I felt that Jennifer Lawrence seemed to be a little out of place in her role as Rosalyn - moreover, Rosalyn seemed like a slightly unnecessary character, placed only to drag out the plot.Overall, however, the movie is great. The directing performed by Russell is fantastic and captures all the emotion of the movie, something not commonly seen in this genre. American Hustle is an excellent movie, and, despite it's lengthiness, a great watch for those interested in the crime/drama genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best movie in years,"I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since ""Inception."" I've read the critics' reviews and the user reviews here - I encourage you to believe the professional critics on this one. I don't quite understand the negativity of the users, unless they just want to be contrarian.What you have in this film begins with perfect performances by Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner. Jennifer Lawrence is very good, but just a bit over the top. She's the only one where you ever ""see"" the acting. The others - as great as they are - disappear into their characters, especially Bale.The overall direction of the plot is constrained by the fact that the movie is loosely based on the ABSCAM sting of the late 70s. However, if you remember the news from that time, it was a very controversial operation. Even many members of the law enforcement community believed that the FBI crossed the line into entrapment. As a result, it is very natural that this movie about con-men helping the FBI con public officials into taking bribes has a wonderfully calculated unevenness. The line between good guy and bad guy is a lot less clear than the line between legal and illegal.A con is all about improv, and this movie feels like it. Great characters making it up as they go along. The classic con movie of all time, ""The Sting"", was beautiful for its ultimate sense of how well the plan was choreographed. The joy of American Hustle is that it doesn't feel choreographed at all - it feels natural, reactive. And that's brilliant filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mediocre yet not quite bad,"I don't usually try to buy into hype. It's led to some underwhelming results, both in life and in following the film industry. Life is full of disappointments.Around a year ago, I posted my review for Silver Linings Playbook, joking about how with an all-star cast and a notable director, a film can still fail (even though I do like Silver Linings). Here we are, a year later, with a film more star-studded than Elton John's wardrobe that manages to be a disappointment on a number of levels, one of which being the acting.Christian Bale is fantastic in his role as a leading con man, and while I never considered him particularly charismatic, he definitely retains that quality with Hustle. Bradley Cooper does what Bradley Cooper is supposed to do, and Jeremy Renner is fine, but the rest of the parts fall short on a number of levels. Amy Adams in particular is a letdown, with many of her lines seeming forced or clumsy. Jennifer Lawrence can't determine how to make facial expressions half of the time, and it's not due to ""indecisiveness""; it's a matter of not portraying emotions properly.But still, Hustle retains an interesting plot that is ultimately lacking in depth but it makes up for it somewhat with scattered humour and The Big Sleep-esque plot maneuvering. I'm not one to complain about not sympathizing with lead characters, but I didn't sympathize with the lead characters. Yes, we see how an unexpected couple fall in love, and how someone from that couple falls in love with another, who is in love with another, who may or may not be in love with another, etc. There is no depth, however, to these relationships. There's a reason why the love- triangle is one of the most popular plot devices; it appeals to a broad audience, it creates plot tension, but also it allows for thematic depth. There is none of this in Hustle.Still, the biggest issue with Hustle is perhaps its script. It seems like the script a 20 year old film buff would write. For some people, that's great. For me, I expect more out of my films than something oozing clichés and immature dialogue (immature as in lacking depth). The reason why Tarantino is an excellent writer is because he recognizes these tropes and is able to channel them into his highly unique style. Russel simply churns out a mediocre script that attempts to beat the audience over the head with the plot.It's entertainment enough, however, and the costumes are convincing as is the makeup. Watching Christian Bale for an extended amount of time is always a good thing. But I couldn't see myself recommending it on any serious level beyond that.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best film edits I've ever seen.,"The film was on my watchlist for almost two years. I received a list of films with the best editing at the film school where I unfortunately did not enter, but at least I thank them for the list.
I think this film was underrated. But I can understand why you can hate this film, firstly it is the image of the characters who seem very caricatured, in this film they PLAY and they do not play themselves. It seems to me that the director conceived it, take, for example, Bradley Cooper's hairstyle, or Bale's hairstyle or his belly that he had to grow, or he insisted, doesn't matter how, it wasn't important for the plot. David O. Russell seems have a great sense of humor with his wonderful ability to write stories. Only recently in an interview I heard that he started as a writer.
Great script, very good story, the actors did their job for 100%, excellent camera work, the costumes were too shining for me, but again, I think this is a cartoon film and it was so intended. And, of course, editing from which you can endlessly extract techniques and learn how to edit stories (for those who are engaged).
In general, the film resembles the style of Guy Ritchie, but it differs in the soul of the story, if the films of Guy Ritchie are simply caricatures that focus on the story of the adventure, then this film plunges into the feelings of the characters, the detailing of their relationship. The film evokes understanding, empathy for the characters. It does keep in tension, but there are also funny moments, for example, when Bradley Cooper parodied his partner, it was very funny for me.
There is no doubt that the film will remain in history with its excellent editing, in general I found out that Gravity received an Oscar for editing that year - I doubt that was deserved.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Flippant Stepchild to Wolf of Wall Street,"There are those who say AH is a cinematic masterpiece ; others contend its preposterous crapI fall into the latter category. These are not people but garish caricatures. I thought I would never hear myself say Where's Leonardo DiCaprio when you need him which is what I said at the opening scene of the con being set.Sting sang Why Should I cry for you? He could have said Why should I care?And for these , I cared nothing. AH is treated as if this idea of scamming scammers is something unique. It isn't. These individuals care only for themselves, saving their own butts at the expense of their object of desire:Carmine Polito.Much has been made of hair/makeup/clothes- Oscar here we come. For a more accurate portrayal of 70's attire, take a look at Ron Howard's excellent Rush. In Rush, the clothes complimented the story. Here in AH- they are the story.Bale, who I generally like, is clearly acting here save for a scene where he expresses regret, trying to make it right for Carmine. Adams- anyone could have portrayed her role, Lawrence is way over the top and too young to convincingly play a matronly sort of woman. Her sashaying in the bar scene was laughable at best, cringe-worthy at worse. But she is clearly a camera favorite and Russell's muse, so much so she distorts the picture.Cooper, another Russell favorite, is the worst offender of all. And what of the rookie in this mess:Jeremy Renner?Renner has said everyday they swung for the fences and this approach of Russell's might be his preferred way of directing. But the film clearly comes across that way too. Renner has said it was a challenge for him to portray a character who wears his heart on his sleeve. And Mr. Renner, please do this more often, if you are given the chance for how wonderful you are!In the hands of a Branagh, his performance might have been elevated to near Shakespearean tragic heights, recalling to mind, the line from Merchant of Venice- ""To do a great right,do a little wrong"".Like Tom Hardy, Renner conveyed much with simple gestures. So much so I wanted to scream 'get out of the car', you are being taken for a ride!""Of course if he does, the cynic in me says, there is no film! I don't think Russell really knew how to handle Renner's quietly affecting performance. And he is heartbreakingly terrific!I am surprised no charges of misogyny/objectification of women has been levied against Russell as it has been against Scorsese in Wolf of Wall Street. I wonder why that is? The women in AH are busy flaunting their assets as if to make up for their lack of acting talent.AH might be considered the flippant stepchild of Wolf. Wolf is concerned with one thing and one thing only:EXCESS. And because Leo and Marty have corroborated many times in the past, their bond/ trust is palpable here. Leo is/was comfortable in doing certain scenes here for Martin that he otherwise would not have done. To put it simply, white collar crime as depicted in Wolf is rendered OK in the sense this is how one man chose to lead his life and his cohorts who merrily went along with it. But Scorsese does show the downside; perhaps not as much as he should have.With the single scene of one individual going to jail, , Russell altered two character's outcome. At least Belfort served time in federal prison as did his primary cohort.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

It felt fake, contrived and half-baked from the first scene to the last, and as others have noted you just didn't care one bit about anyone on screen.The performances were decent except for the lead FBI guy (sorry but neither his screen nor real name is worth looking up) who tended to overact.

Watch it and weep,"Spoiler alert – I really dislike films with improvised dialogue, in fact I downright hate them. Yes I know there is the odd gem like Spinal Tap but for the most part they just make cringe worthy viewing.American Hustle should have been a thing of genius. It has an excellent cast, great story (plot details are in the title), brilliant production design and attention to detail. So for this reviewer it is just a massive shame that the prior mentioned ingredients are ruined scene after scene by the cast's improvised dialogue.Instead of sharply observed insightful gripping scenes, we have the cast repeating the same thing three times just to make the point. When they don't know what to say, hell, they just say the first thing that comes into their heads.The worst part is that I don't know who to blame – the cast for arrogantly thinking they are script writers, the director for not taking a tougher stand or the producers for just allowing the thing to evolve in the way it did.American Hustle will win Oscars, not because it deserves to, simply because it has that awful thing called the big momentum. For me, it is simply the emperor's new clothes circa 1975.",,Anonymous,Crime
A Good Movie to Watch Once,"To tell you the truth, I only went to watch this movie in the cinemas because Jennifer Lawrence is my favourite actress, but I had doubts, if this film would be good, because usually films which have to many good actors in it end up being not so good at all. But this film wasn't so bad at all. It started out a bit boring, but by then end I couldn't wait what the end will be. All in all it was a very interesting film with quite a few sexual content but not too many to be rated plus. I haven't seen any other Christian Bale films, but I think I will watch more from now on, because he did a good job in this film. I've seen like three-four films from Amy Adams, but so far I've only seen her play the good girl, so this was a surprise from her. I think Bradley Cooper's and Jennifer Lawrence's character was sort of like what they always play, but they didn't act badly. Jennifer actually made me laugh a few times, I think she sort of lit up the movie. I admit i didn't look through the cast too closely this time, because when Robert DeNiro appeared in the middle of the film I was quite surprised, but after all his character was quite typical too. To sum up, it's a good movie to watch once, especially if you like these actors. It isn't bad, but isn't the best film I've ever seen either.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Russell (Three Kings), American Hustle stars Christian Bale (The Dark Knight), Amy Adams (Man of Steel), Bradley Cooper (A Star is Born), Jennifer Lawrence (The Hunger Games), and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker).This movie is an absolute blast. The depiction of the era-with its attire, hairstyles, and backdrops-is so much fun. The cast is tremendous, and everyone delivers an outstanding performance. The dynamics between the characters are highly entertaining, with a nice infusion of humor throughout. Bale's over-the-top performance really works here, and Jennifer Lawrence had me laughing in every scene she's in. The plot has numerous twists and turns but feels authentic and realistic. The ending was perfect.In conclusion, American Hustle is a fun ride and is definitely worth your time. I would rate it a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dramatic Art At Its' Best!,"Okay, I read a few of the reviews, some loved this movie, some were quite disappointed, and some were lukewarm... I get it, different strokes for different folks, but for me this movie was a nice change, I loved it. I also understand why it would have been hard for me not to.First of all, I'm 56, from South Brooklyn, went to High School in Bay Ridge Brooklyn, Bernard King was in my home room class, Harry Chapin was in my Church Choir, I'm as New York as Junior's Cheese Cake, oh, and I was a theater geek too, wanted to be a professional actor, loved the music and the dance craze of my time, still love to dance and yes, I enjoyed the whole disco scene - so, for me, I loved everything about this flick, the music, the accents, the story line, the clothes, the braggadocio, it was all very familiar to me, was outstandingly so, not only appropriate to the time, but reflective of all my dreams and heartaches.The acting was out of the park, the drama was real and heartfelt in a nuanced way, subtle yet pervasive throughout the film. I forgot I was watching a movie several times, the humor was not laugh out loud guffaw type humor, this humor was instead very human, but also very melancholy and often bittersweet, very much like life... I get this movie, it was like I was watching a movie reel of my own life that had some additional scenes and some different characters, but nevertheless, it was my life...I get this movie...I found it very entertaining, wasn't bored once.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The ballpark is a small dot,"I didn't really want to like this movie. And after reading some of the reviews it seemed people were disappointed there wasn't enough action. Well - maybe because I detest action movies - this was a huge plus for me. Now we can concentrate on good storytelling and character development, of which there was plenty. The improvisational method with which the director chose to film was very fitting. As one reviewer mentioned, it made it more believable rather than a too perfect plan that doesn't let one piece slip up. The actors surprised me as well. Before I saw it I thought the roles of the wife and mistress should have been reversed. But Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence owned their respective parts and now I can't imagine each one playing the others character. And what can you really say about Christian Bale? He just excels in any film he's in - thereby stealing the movie. If I were an actor I would hate to share screen time with him. As far as the other common complaint here of why this movie is not like Goodfellas or the Grifters - well, there's a good reason for that - because it is not! If you're expecting Robert DeNiro blatantly blowing gangsters away - you won't find that. Instead what you will find is Robert DeNiro in one of the most chilling and intense roles he's had in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Movie..See It.,"Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, ""American Hustle is an urban eruption of flat-out fun — the sharpest, most exhilarating comedy in years. Anyone who says otherwise must be conning you."" Peter Debruge of Variety was critical of the film and questioned the nearly unanimous praise, calling it ""a sloppy sprawl of a movie"" and criticizing the plot, complaining that the improvisational performances overwhelm instead of adding to a coherent plot.As for my opinion, there was 10x more drama than comedy in this movie. The acting, character interaction, and dialog were above average, and it held my interest from start to finish. It was hard to determine which character was the lead and which were supporting as they were all so very good. It had sort of an amateurish feel to the cinematography at times, like it had been filmed by a hand-held video camera and that I was being made privy to some clandestinely taken FBI film footage...very engrossing. As I left the theatre, I was thinking ""I need to go and read the book."" But there isn't a book, so seeing it twice, and then again, is my only option which I certainly intend to do once it's released to DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Completely unbridled fun, with one of the great ensemble performances and a complex plot","While American Hustle absolutely has some significant flaws, it's just so much fun to watch and with such great acting that I can't help but love it. This is probably my favorite actor (Bale) and actress (Adams) at their best, and Cooper is also phenomenal. The characters are intense and layered and the actors bring emotion and investment into each of their interactions. Each relationship in the movie felt uncertain and volatile, and each had real weight to it. The plot and themes are also both very good - many of the ideas of morality and what one is willing to do to succeed, and how to use other people to have your own success, really hit home. The final con did surprise me and was a fitting ending, encapsulating the bizarre, unfair, and dishonest world of politics and financial dealings. One of my big problems with the film was its oversexualization of women, as they were too often used as purely sex objects, and this took me out of the story several times. I also thought some of the relationship drama with the very blatantly polyamorous dealings going on and nobody really confronting each other about it, just accepting it as normal was strange to me, though that may have been more normal in the 70s? The story progression could've been a bit more precise and demonstrative in the major plot points, but between the wonderful performances and the fun, unpredictable nature of the plot and characters, American Hustle is a fun, wild ride from the feet up.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Worth A Watch? Absolutely. Best Film of the Year? Nope.,"Some hustle for respect. Some hustle for love. Others hustle for truth. But we all hustle to survive. American Hustle was one of the most anticipated films of the year & even though it turned to be a very well made crime drama, I really doubt if it's a great one. It had all the ingredients & potential to become the best film of 2013 but in the end, it still felt short of complete on the satisfaction level for me & was definitely missing something, probably a more tightly structured plot.David O. Russell is one of those directors whose number one priority while making a film isn't the film's plot or its progression but the intricate study of its characters. The screenplay makes brilliant use of humour, the character arc is nicely developed and the film is greatly helped by its cinematography & more so by costumes & hairstyles to create that 1970s ambiance. And when it comes to casting, American Hustle boasts a cast that's far more star-studded than what any other film of its year had to offer.Christian Bale looks immensely convincing here as the con man Irvin Rosenfeld with that slouch posture, combover & huge tummy but in the end, it wasn't him who was the best thing in the film. Bradley Cooper is steadily turning out to be a rising star. And Jeremy Renner plays his part well. But this time, it's the ladies who stole the show. Amy Adams gives a strong & enthralling performance here but even she is overshadowed by the new tour-de-force in cinema today, Jennifer Lawrence. The part played by Lawrence here is so spectacular that it might bag her another Oscar this upcoming season & in case it does, it's a well deserved one.On an overall scale, American Hustle may not have lived up to my expectations from it, due to the script's inconsistencies & minor flaws, but thanks to David O. Russell's kinetic direction, its finely developed characters, superb use of sly humour & its star-studded cast's exuberant performances, it is nonetheless an incredibly entertaining motion picture that lives up to most of its hype, if not all, and is fine enough to satisfy majority of its viewers. Worth a watch? Absolutely. Best film of the year? Nope.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Crime
Good but not amazing,American hustle did not live up to the expectation that was originally put to me. The film starts off very slowly and for the first 45 minutes you are fed a long story before the real action of the main hustle begins. The film could of really caught the attention of the audience but it just didn't do that.Despite the bad start the American Hustle really did get exciting once he big hustle began. It was clever how everyone was hustling each other under what was suppose to be one main hustle. The film is brilliantly cast and each character feels necessary. I loved the quick wit in the film which separated the seriousness of the whole film aside. American Hustle could of been a solid 8 but the build up to the main hustle drags.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant  performances for an edgy and captivating story,"The picture recalls an outrageous political scandal which rocked American history in the late seventies, and which is treated here with a very sharp and intriguing touch. Despite the plot, what is remarkable here are the brilliant performances offered by the whole cast: I think every actor had a great chance to shine and they all used this chance greatly, also thanks to a solid direction which prevents them from becoming caricatures, despite their evident and searched for exaggeration. Bradley Cooper had a difficult role as an ambitious and out of control FBI agent, and did a very good job, Christian Bale was also great in interpreting a very fragile and yet complex character, Amy Adams was also surprisingly convincing in a erotically charged character, very unusual for her, and the promising Jennifer Lawrence seems once again really fit for psychologically frail characters. The script is very strong and edgy, and yet captivating with strong scenes and dialogues full of pathos and emotion. The music is involving too, with great tracks from those times and a very captivating dance scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Actors Kept Me Going,"Who woulda thunk that a politician would be the most likable character of the movie?""American Hustle"" is about a con man, his wife, his mistress, a federal agent, and a mayor. Every one of them was a POS except the mayor.Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) was a POS because he was a con man and he cheated on his wife. Sidney Prosser aka Edith Greensly (Amy Adams) was a POS because she was also a con artist and a homewrecker. Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) was a POS because she was a lazy, low class, manipulative wife. Agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) was a POS because he bent the rules and he tried to cheat on his fiance with Edith urging him on (which made her a double home wrecker). Which leaves Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). He seemed like an honest genuine guy who wanted to improve the community he worked and lived in. For that, he got wrapped up in a sting and had to serve time.The performances were good all around, with the exception of Amy Adams. She has never impressed me in anything, and walking around in revealing clothes and donning a British accent isn't impressive.It's a cluster of a story that was benefited by many known actors: Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner, Shea Wigham, Louis C. K., Michael Pena, and Robert De Niro. That's a lot of names. The presence and professionalism of the cast raised the movie up from a D to a C.

"Ingenious, refined and crisply scripted","A movie's fate is driven somehow by a powerful factor of the star cast; a kind of actors that people would love to see interacting on screen. David O Russell uses this over utilized cinematic weapon of an ensemble cast for his con-film 'American Hustle'. Along with Eric Warren Singer, The Silver Linings playbook director also managed to have a lion's share in formulating the screenplay. Impeccably refined, masterful performances and reflection of sheer ingenuity is what American Hustle offers to the audience. The film gets us through some clichés and prodigal deviations but overall it bestows a worthwhile experience for the cinema lovers.The pot-bellied Irvin Rosenfeld sets up a fake company to grant loans to the needy people thereby having an expertise in money laundering. His success reaches a capstone when Sydney Prosser walks into his life. Posing as the British lace curtain 'Edith Greensley', Sydney assists Irvin and both gradually become the 1978 con experts who succeed in controlling various scams but finally end up getting caught blatantly by The FBI. FBI agent Richie Di Maso (Bradley Cooper) arrests the duo on the charges of earning money by fraudulent schemes. He offers them immunity but in exchange wants them to aid The FBI to conduct a massive bust which will put the Mayor Carmine Polito and other politicians including the congressman behind bars.Di Maso falsifies the identity of an Arab Sheikh who apparently is his Mexican friend. He, guided by Irving and Sydney together indulges in convincing the Mayor Polito about Sheikh's active interest in conducting business with him. Carmine Polito is the one to be struggling to assemble funds to resuscitate the Atlantic City. The trio uses Mayor's very keen desire to invest into Atlantic City as the driving force to bring him and other corrupt politicians to ground. Jenifer Lawrence plays Irvin's wife Rosalyn who is rather a piquant personality rather succumbing to being impulsive & manipulative throughout. Robert De Niro who plays a Mafia kingpin Victor Tellgio makes an impressive cameo. The most striking factor of the film is that deeper the film takes you inside the plan; more layers of this operation begin to unravel making it completely embellishing.American Hustle has a crisp screenplay as the characters spring to live and engages you throughout the duration. David o Russell's direction poses as a strong reminder to Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' following its narrative which enhances the experience throughout thereby giving Russell's ambitious nature a strong highlight. The script is sleight but lucid. The movie however successfully manages to break the monotony of action sequences and burlesque comedies in cinema and provides a rich perpetual experience.However, I sincerely feel 'American Hustle' strongly exemplifies how a con-film should be presented on the celluloid.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Con Is On,"Based on true events from the 1970's Abscam case, this is an ingenious con movie and Russell's best film to date. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, costume, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast are in top form. Bale, Adams, Cooper, Lawrence and Renner deliver outstanding performances with Renner offering the best of his career. Bale's method acting is unparalleled. The plot revolves around a conman, Irving Rosenfeld and conwomen, Sydney Prosser who are professional at short cons such as art forgery and loan sharking. They are apprehended and are recruited by FBI agent Richie DiMaso to bring down crooked politicians in order for immunity. The target is New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito. That is where the real fun and long con begins. Along the way Richie who fancies himself a hot shot is being seduced by Sydney and Irving's jealous and semi-psychotic wife Rosalyn is threatening to expose Irving's con without even knowing she is doing so. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it's hard for this viewer to choose a favorite. If I had to pick two scenes first would be when Irving comes clean to family man Carmine whom he has truly befriended that he set him up. The second would be the look on Richie's face when the long con is revealed and he realizes he has just been hustled by the best. The film is witty, clever, insightful, duplicitous, blazing, ingenious and has a cathartic ending. It is a nearly flawless and mesmorizing film that keeps the viewer guessing throughout. Dramatization aside, it's truly amazing how intelligent and duplicit these professional gifted grifters were.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Mass-Marketed Hair Care Product,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film. I enjoyed the performance by this SERIOUSLY in demand and hot cast. These people are huge in Hollywood at the moment. I enjoyed the nostalgic music, I enjoyed the nostalgic clothes, the performances were riveting. I mean Christian Bale knocked me on my bum. What a performance. What a method actor. But besides its surface value, besides the music and costumes, what was there? It would be a serious, serious stretch for me to put much meaning to this movie. What, ""Don't con the guy that cons you, um, conning isn't great, be careful of redheads, um don't wear hair pieces guys."" ""Watch out which nail polish you use, cuz um, be careful."" The film is just like Christian Bale's hair piece; its for show. They're making a lot of money, and most people think that a movie cannot get much better than this. But any human being can realize the difference in emotion you feel after seeing a film like 12 Years a Slave and American Hustle. At the end of American Hustle, you're content, maybe you chuckled a bit, but nothing more. At the end of 12 Years a Slave, its like someone shot you in the chest, you're just thrown a back.

Each scene is well conducted and they do fit into an overall story. Some scenes are quite good. Yet somehow, there is still a feeling of incoherence. It seems to be missing an broader theme or concern for any of the characters even if they happen to be sleazy on the surface.It's certainly not a bad film.

One of the best films of the year that's riotously entertaining and ceaselessly captivating thanks to an A-list cast at their best and a director at the very top of his game,"If there was yet any doubt in your mind from his previous two films 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Linings Playbook' that director David O' Russell is on a creative streak, then his latest 'American Hustle' should convince you unequivocally to put these qualms to rest. Taking an unconventional approach to the loose retelling of the Abscam scandal, a late 1970s FBI sting operation that led to bribery convictions for a U.S. senator and several members of the House, it sees Russell at his most invigorated yet, a wild and woolly ride through the dark and dizzy heart of American ambition brimming with so much unbridled verve that it is quite impossible not to get caught up in its rapture.Co-written by Russell and Eric Warren Singer, it begins on a definitively offbeat note with a paunchy Christian Bale painstakingly putting together his hair with some glue, a forlorn toupee and a comb- over. Bale's transformation into the balding and bloated con man Irving Rosenfeld is a revelation in itself, one of his character reinventions that demonstrate his commitment as an actor and his astonishing ability to disappear into just about any role that he takes on. But more about Bale and the rest of the ensemble later on – what is apparent from this very opening scene is Russell's screwball exuberance to the material, which recalls both stylistically and spiritually the spirit of vintage Scorcese.That sequence thrusts its viewer into the same frame with the rest of the key actors - Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) and Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) - whose roles in relation to Irving become clearer after Russell rewinds to recount the events leading up to that terse and tense exchange. Allowing his characters their own voices, Russell lets Irving and Sydney narrate their own individual livelihoods - the former as a con artist with a dry cleaning business on the side and the latter as a knockout stripper from New Mexico - before the pair bond at a Long Island pool party over a shared passion for Duke Ellington's ""Jeep's Blues"" as well as a mutual belief in reinventing their respective lives.Making use of an alternate identity as Lady Edith Greenleigh, Sydney builds a fake loan scheme with Irving using the company guise of London Associates. Their grifting enterprise becomes so successful that they attract the attention of Richie, an ambitious FBI agent whose latest target is white collar criminals and whom arm-twists the pair into setting up a scam involving a fake sheikh (Michael Pena) to reel in some bigger fish. What follows is an increasingly elaborate - and dangerous - sting operation that calls into question their shifting personas and motivations, especially as the all-too eager Ritchie works his way up the food chain with New Jersey mayor Carmine as his prime focus and eventually unwitting pawn.While the title ostensibly refers to Irving and Sydney's business, the brilliantly written script slowly peels back the layers of each and every one of its characters to reveal each as a 'hustler'. For Ritchie, that means refusing to see through the delusions of his FBI glory to recognise the good intentions of Carmine and the rest of his targets. It also is refusing to accept his hen-pecked life in a working-class home with a mother and fiancé, and finding distraction instead in his growing attraction for Sydney. And for Irving and Sydney, their hustle lies not only in their schemes but also in their personal lives, what with Irving being married to a much younger but also much more unhinged wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) whose young son is the apple of his eye. There are no perfect characters here, no saints or heroes or role models to look up to; rather, each in his or her own way inevitably resorts to some form of hustling in order to survive.It is evident from how richly Russell sketches these characters that he loves each and every one of them, and his passion for the material is matched by the enthusiasm and creative energy that each one of his actors brings. Reflecting that perfect synergy between actor and director, Russell and his ace cast share a trust and confidence in each other that is demonstrated in the boldness with which they take to their roles. Not one of these actors is a stranger to Russell - Bale and Adams from 'The Fighter' and Cooper and Lawrence from 'Silver Linings Playbook' - and their combination sets off an explosive chemistry that counts as acting fireworks.Indeed, 'American Hustle' might very well be Russell's best film that boasts a perfect balance of the director's spontaneity and control. He gives his gallery of strays, cheaters and deceivers plenty of room to roam far and wide, and yet nothing feels superfluous at any point. And in that corral, we see Bale's magnificently understated performance, one that grows in pathos and dignity as he is called upon to be the film's moral centre; we also see Adams' most versatile act yet, showing a depth in a darker and more dangerous role than she has ever played; we are also treated to Cooper at his funniest and liveliest, digging deep to unearth a maniacal side yet unseen; last but not least, a simply magnetic Lawrence who is mesmerising as ""the Picasso of passive- aggressive karate"". Exceptional performances from some of the finest actors of our generation, a director at the top of his game, and an intriguing subject that finds its relevance even today, this is one movie that belongs on your must-see list and every critic's best-of list of the year.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Come for the actors, stay for the actors","David O. Russell knows how to make a good film with great actors, even if his antics behind the scene can be described as cruel, especially to Lily Tomlin (look it up). He has a quick style, almost like Scorsese, where he rapidly follows the characters through their journey. It's worked plenty of times before with films such as The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, and it works here again in American Hustle. With an assembled all-star cast and a great script with some truth to it, Russell's film will surely further his status as one of modern Hollywood's most successful directors.The film follows five main characters during the late 70s and early 80s. The first is Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale). He's a born con man who has spent years building up his dry cleaning empire along with an art forgery business on the side. Next to him is Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), a scrappy and resourceful woman who gets romantically involved with Irving. They both start running a loan scam business together, which after a while attracts the attention of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). Knowing he has two expert criminals by the leash, Richie forces Irving and Sydney to participate in an FBI operation to crack down on political bribery and gambling.The two other characters to show up are Irving's actual wife, Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence), who's always on the rocks drinking and smoking while she lays the day away in her house with her and Irving's child. The last is Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), mayor of Atlantic City and the prime target in the FBI sting.The overall plot and pacing of the film are very character focused. Every event is either from a main character or from a side character that affects a main character. This is both a pro and con that the film carries throughout.The pro comes from the actors making the best of their characters. Every actor has great chemistry and skill to carry the action and emotional wright. The whole film would have probably fallen apart if lesser actors were cast instead, but luckily that never happened.The con that comes from the character-driven story is that all the characters have a wide range, but very little depth. We only really get surface details and never any real background or striking motivations. The characters are really only memorable because of the actors playing them, which is probably while watching the film I referred every character to the actor. I always saw Christian Bale and Amy Adams, never Irving and Sydney.David O. Russell is an actor's director and he shows it here. He expertly lets his cast do what they want while also staying within the confines of the script, which can be a bit overlong at times.The camera acts as a spectator to the action as it reacts and follows whatever the actors do. The frame is only filled with the actors because nothing else is more important. It's a strategy that works perfectly in this case since it keeps the story focused and free-flowing.The biggest reason you did or probably will see this film is for the performances, and that is definitely what you get.Christian Bale goes through another one of his trademarked body transformations to play the overweight con man with an elaborate comb-over. Bale is hardly recognizable from his Dark Knight trilogy days and makes every scene his own.Amy Adams plays almost like a seductress that is out to overpower every man with her looks and brains. She brings the ferocity to make her character both dangerous and intriguing.Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both play sort of eccentric characters that keep interfering with our main pair. They both have great energy and an ability to steal scenes at any given moment.Finally, Jeremy Renner jumps in and out of the film at times as Carmine Polito. He has charisma, power, but also a heart and genuine love for his city. He's a troubled character that you really don't know if you should be rooting for or against.American Hustle definitely boasts some of the best performances for each of the actors involved. While it never really develops its characters enough, the film is still a fun ride because of the good story and great people. To sum it all up quickly, the actors are not part of this film, they are the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great character development, interesting plots and witty lines based on true events","I love movies based on true events. American Hustle is more than that as it is also filled with character development revolving around interesting plots and witty lines. What's more, it leads us to question our basic assumptions in addition to bringing us black humor. I highly recommend this thought provoking comedy.The main characters are not lovable but they are all fun to watch and brilliantly portrayed by the excellent cast. The plot is basically some schemes in the 70s and the FBI arrested two cons and used them to attract more cons in politics.Christian Bale put on 40 pounds to play Irving Rosenfeld, an experienced but unattractive con since his childhood. Irving meets smart and sexy Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party and decides to team up as partners, in business and in private.But Irving actually has a passive-aggressive wife Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence) with a son whom he cannot leave. Rosalyn, though self-proclaimed socially handicapped, effortlessly becomes the center of attention in any social gatherings. When suspicious Rosalyn overhears Irving's phone conversation with Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), she invents many stories in her head which ultimately affected everyone's fate.Because Richie is a neurotic and impatient FBI agent who tries to leverage on Irving and Sydney's con skills, even though it means ridiculing his supervisor. Dragging into the scene is New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) whom is set up to lure more congressmen into a trick involving the mafia although he, a happily married politician, has been working very hard for his community.Dotted along are some hit songs from the 70s which make the whole experience so nostalgic. Full of surprises in cast, lines and plots, American Hustle is very entertaining to watch and urges you to question your normal logic, making you more critical in interpreting the news and whatever that is happening around.

It's not a great movie like they try to show on the advertisements. It's an Okay movie to watch on Netflix after you finish all Breaking Bad Seasons for the second time. I question all this great reviews under mine, are they real? Are the written by people connected somehow to the production? Is IMDb legit or just a tool for commercial purposes? Do this same people rating great Anchorman 2? This movie was for an actor like Bruce Willis, Vince Vaughn, or a B list or less actor, not Christian Bale. It's the first cheap movie that he makes that I know off. The movie was boring at first, and then you get a little bit interested. It's not a bad movie, the problem is that the whole build up of greatness with an awesome cast and great theme is just to upscale for the final product. Christian Bale is Awesome, Bradley Cooper have his moments, the Blond Girl Over Acts like a Dumb Super Bimbo (Maybe she is not acting) and the FBI Supervisor Guy I was sure that in some part of the movie he was going to turn into a Vampire.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"YOU, Just Got Hustled","How in the hell is this one of the most loved films of the year by the critics? The answer is, you just got hustled. You just got hustled if you paid to see this trash that is. The hype, the glitz, and almost no substance whatsoever seems to be the main theme of this film, also confused and senseless characters are another main theme.We have come to an age where film critics are set up in four star hotels and wined and dined by the Hollywood film industry before red carpet events in order to help them make record profits. The critics and big film producers these days sleep in the same bed so to speak, and that's why you can't trust most modern day critics anymore than you can trust a two bit hustler, because really when you get down to it, they are one and the same. Only money separates what is good and bad for many of the pathetic sheep of society today.To me Bale was the only thing that really stood out in a good way in this film. He delivers a highly consistent and believable character, in fact I would say he was flat out great. Amy Adams was also pretty good and Renner was again strong in a limited role. Did Cooper and Lawrence even have characters? Their character's were so unbelievable and terribly written that they just basically ruined the film for me. Lawrence pulled off the terrible character fairly well, but I couldn't help but cringe almost every time Cooper tried to play his terribly written part. I always liked Cooper in other films, but here his character is just too unbelievable, it's like he's an inconsistent cartoon man or something. I've heard that much of the film was improve, so perhaps the writing isn't all to blame.The plot itself is so tired and here almost completely pointless. I would say that there's a two layered plot here and the inner hustler is the only interesting aspect of it, however it isn't nearly enough to save the film. The story lacked depth and the film had virtually no feeling to it at all, the direction is totally jumbled in my view and just went for appearance and flashy scenes. There really is nothing here besides a few good performances and a half-ass inner hustler aspect to the plot that mostly falls flat because of it's lack of depth and consistency.Don't get hustled by the Hollywood hypsters, watch this film for free, if at all.5.5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, but they've all made better","Watched this on a large screen last weekend.Liked it, but not over-the-moon for it, like most critics have been. Might be due to missing a couple of plot-points, but hey, I think Russell/Bale/Cooper have made better. That being said, it's probably the best release in months (not counting '..Llewyn...', of course.Starting off, right from the beginning, the movie became meta, not in a good way, where attention was being called to Bale's physical characteristics. It seemed more like a treatise on what the actor had undergone in prepping for this role, rather than a look at the character himself. No denying his effort, but subtlety is an art that was Not practiced by either the star or the director in these few sequences. Very self-indulgent, and took me right out of the movie.I loved 'The Fighter' as well as 'Silver Linings playbook', even though there were moments of self-indulgence in the latter as well, they were not put in to the point of being overwhelming.As it has been said many times while referencing this movie, Jennifer Lawrence steals every scene her character's in, and she could well give stiff competition to other Oscar noms in the BSA category. One of the things being missed by most critics/reviewers, is the fact that every scene with Louis CK's a hoot, and Cooper's interplay with him is very, very hilarious. Sadly, unacknowledged.A cameo by another scene-stealer has the intended effect, and added to the overall charm of the movie. Renner does well in a very thankless role.Conclusively, definitely a great watch, but not one of Russell's best, and definitely not deserving of all the Oscar love, IMHO.A shout-out for the editing, for though the movie's a tad overlong in hindsight, it never outstays its welcome. Go watch it at a local cinema close by.....",,Anonymous,Crime
It was OK.,"I didn't know anything about this film and found it on a cable channel I rarely watch. My synopsis would be that it was trying too hard and that the ending was predictable.There are some huge names in it, but somehow, although everyone's performance was good - Bradley Cooper was a bit over-the-top, though - they just didn't seem to gel together.The opening scene was sort-of funny, but went on too long. There were several episodes where things should have been funny, but just weren't. One instance was the FBI man in hair curlers - it just wasn't that amusing and it really should have been. I imagine other things were thought to be done in a ""knowing"" way, but it was just a bit cliched.It felt like they were out to make this decade's Boogie Nights, but fell short.I didn't even watch it in one go - I watched the second half two days later so it wasn't exactly gripping!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
This movie is no con.,"American Hustle tilts its head high and proud to lead the pack of ambitious, brilliant movies of 2013 to their fate on Oscar night. But why does American Hustle feel so highly of itself? and why does it seem even more likely that David O. Russel has created his cinematic magnum opus? The answer is, he just did.American Hustle is without a shadow of a doubt the best picture that David O. Russel could ever make, and that says a whole lot due to the caliber of excellence already under his belt. Its a sprawling epic of a crime movie that hearkens back to some of the greatest cinematic techniques utilized by Scorsese and Altman. Its a brilliant screenplay of sorts that only increases with cultural flair and dramatic tension with every frame. Its easy to really pin down the plot of the film since this certainly isn't the first time a movie has been made about successful and or unsuccessful con men in the midst of their ""crime of the century"". But what makes this movie shine the most is its performances, which are without a doubt the greatest of the year, or any year.Christian Bale is absolutely flawless. I want to say its his greatest, but movies like The Fighter and American Psycho challenge that theory.. and perhaps this role simply didn't trump those roles. But I think we can agree, it stands proudly among the two aforementioned roles. Amy Adams is captivating as a ferociously sexy redhead with an insatiable appetite for conning the people she holds closest to her. Jennifer Lawrence soars as the dimwitted wife of Christian Bale who just about ruins every possible chance of keeping this highly secretive con successful. But it was Bradley Cooper who shines the brightest in this masterpiece. This is the greatest role of his career. You could guarantee that this will bring him home an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He's simply unbelievable as an unnervingly demented crooked cop on the verge of a mental breakdown.American Hustle is an American treasure. That being said, I think it absolutely has a lock on many Oscars on Oscar night. However, so does Four Years a Slave. Regardless, do not miss your chance of seeing this film in the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good Enough but misses the target,"Don't get me wrong, this movie has it all, the laughs, the twists, the drama...but I think it misses the target. American Hustle tells us about the historical Abscam, but instead of focus mainly on the scam, the film ends up prioritizing the characters' novels a lot of times, and that isn't what I signed up for.I'm not saying the characters aren't good and interesting (actually they are), especially counting with that superb cast, but I think they chose ""Hollywood"" over the essencial.Although the film's great pacing and storytelling, the final twist and the overall scam don't hit as hard as they should due to that prioritization, which is a shame because there was so much potential.With that being said, this movie is a very competent production, good story, nice characters, excelent pacing, phenomenal acting, fun and emotional but in the end it fails to deliver the product that it promises.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Be hustled. It's worth to,"The adjective ""American"" appended to a ward in a movie title usually implies something with instant design-classic status with a good dose of irony and modernity. So in this ""American Hustle"" David O.Russell has really done it. For starters the unreliable narration and urgent zooms, the 1970s milieu of flashily dressed scammers and mobsters, the carefully chosen songs underscoring key emotional moments; It's all just there! But unlike Scorcese, Russell infuses them with his unique brand of insanity. Russell is obviously fond of characters on the brink of imploding or exploding and with ""American Hustle"" he's assembled his own posse of stars from his last two films as his personal acting troupe:Christian Bale and Amy Adams from 2011's ""The fighter"" and Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence from ""Silver Linings Playbook"".Russell's latest is based on the Abscam sting operation of the late 70's in which a con artist helped the FBI catch members of Congress taking brides. ""Some of this actually happened"" a title card warn us at the film's start, and then Russell introduces us to Irving Rosenfeld a con artist and an either paunchy version of Bale. To play this swaggering Rosenfeld,the owner of a small chain of Long Island dry cleaners who makes his real money through fake art and fraudulent personal loans, Bale seemingly downed all the food he denied while shooting ""The Machinist"" and ""Rescue Dawn"". He meets his partner Adam's Sydney Posser, a young beautiful woman attracted to his monument of calm and confidence.While Sydney kicks Rosenfield's cons in high gear, the in love and crime partners are forced to work for an FBI agent Richie DiMaso who's confidence and arrogance lead them straight to world of mafia and gangsters which is as dangerous as enchanting. In this messy situation which also affects the good friend and idealist political of Irv's, it's the unpredictable (and dimmer to a few of us) wife of Irv's who could be the one to pull the thread that brings the whole world of Irv's falling apart.The film is probably a tad overlong, but it's a blast to hang out with these people, and Russell creates such an infectiously zany vibe around them that if even you notice the running time, you probably won't mind. For all its brashness and big personality, ""American Hustle"" is a character study at its core—an exploration of dissatisfaction and drive, and the lengths to which we're willing to go for that elusive thing known as a better life.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Over-hyped Pretentious Garbage,"Why this film has such praise is beyond me! Yes, there is amazing cinematography and great performances from Amy Adams and Christian Bale..but that's literally it! The story is unbelievable slow and drags like you can't believe. I was patient and sat through the entire film, hoping that the sh*t would actually go down in the end and compensate for the lack of entertainment throughout... But nope...none at all. I love drama and am not an action guy at all, but I was at least hoping for some intense scenes or serious drama to happen by the end of the film. Everything is so light hearted and ""fun"" so you naturally just don't care what happens to anyone...there are zero stakes!If you are familiar with the film ""Get Him to The Greek"" here's a reference for you... This movie is the ""African Child"" of films this year. It's like everyone is afraid to say that they didn't like the movie!

"I Was ""Hustled"" by the Hype!","I am absolutely astounded by all of the fantastic reviews this movie has gotten by the critics and users on this site. Did we not watch the same movie? I was so bored about an hour into this show that I almost fell asleep watching it. This movie was at least 30 minutes too long and so over acted it was ridiculous. It looks to me like the only reason this movie had all of the big name stars in it (Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Robert De Niro, etc.) was to insure a big box office draw because they could have done this film just as easily with mostly unknowns and saved themselves about 30-35 million dollars.The critics made such a big deal about Christian Bale's physical transformation but as far as I'm concerned... WHY??? What was the point of him gaining 40 pounds for this role? It did not add one single thing to the plot of this movie. He could have done the exact same performance in his natural state and it would not have made any difference to the movie or his character.Usually I love Jennifer Lawrence in anything. She is so talented and beautiful, but her character portrayal was way too over the top and cliché as a self absorbed, loud-mouthed New Jersey housewife. You might as well have been watching an episode of The Real Housewives of New Jersey or watching Snooki on Jersey Shore.Then there is Robert De Niro playing (shocker) a mobster! Talk about type casting, I'm surprised they didn't just include Joe Pesci and Michelle Pfeifer as his sidekicks.I understand that this movie is up for some Academy Awards. They should not award this movie or any of the actors awards for this. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they have about 2 hours and $10 to just throw away.

'Hustle' for the performances but little else...,"The stars seemed aligned for David O. Russell's highly anticipated American Hustle in which assembles some of Hollywood's most sought-after talent that includes Oscar-winners Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence along with Oscar-nominees Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner. He teams up with scribe Eric Singer, whose only feature writing credit is Tom Tykwer's The International, and based on the popularity of last year's Silver Linings Playbook, this was suppose to be Russell's masterpiece. Sad to report that the final product is an anti- metamorphosis of filmmaking that prohibits any consistency for the viewer to relish. What remains intact and palpable are the outstanding performances by the cast that Russell put together. All of them are dedicated to their roles, even when development and direction are lacking, and they truck through much of the narrative successfully.One of the largest areas of opportunities is the script composed by Singer and Russell. Despite scene-chewing performances from our principal actors, an absence of insight and cohesiveness, along with an irregularity of interesting dialogue plagues this once promising Oscar hopeful. In the first twenty minutes of the film's opening, I said to myself, ""this is going to be my favorite film of the year."" When the film ventures off into back stories and character origins, it plays like a parody of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, lacking any emotional connection. The film isn't overtly dreadful or horrendous by any stretch, just mostly disappointing. All the pieces are there, they just didn't take the time to make sure they all fit. It's confusing in tone, though very funny at times, especially coming from Cooper and Lawrence, but by the end, Russell feels he's warranted an emotional reaction from the audience when he's done anything but.Christian Bale is terrific, magnified in charisma while still keeping mostly all his ticks and mannerisms he's created for Irving in perspective. His work is also an impressive counterpoint to his other well-executed performance in Out of the Furnace. Bale proves once again that he's one of this generation's most gifted actors. Not only in the way he packs on the pounds, or rocks a comb-over better than any wannabe gangster I've encountered on the streets of Little Italy; he's the one performer that has a character that goes through an authentic evolution that's believable.As the spunky and crude wife of Irving, Jennifer Lawrence gets the biggest laughs and commands the most attention from the viewer. Better than she was in last year's overly praised turn in Silver Linings Playbook, for which she won the Oscar for Best Actress, this is a role that suits her well, both for her range as an actress and what she excels in with her fiery demeanor. I'm still a bit unsure about how old Rosalyn was suppose to be (that may be a fault of these directors thinking she's old enough to play these older women). Lawrence owns her role and has enough naughty sex-appeal and delivery to land herself an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. I'd argue if she hadn't JUST won last year, she would be a formidable threat to win. Probably a more appropriate representation for her acting arsenal.I have fallen hard for the abilities of Bradley Cooper following his role as Pat in Russell's Playbook. Subsequently, the 38-year-old actor has sought dynamic and challenging roles that you can tell he finds exciting and prolific in its nature and candor. His turn in The Place Beyond the Pines earlier this year proved that notion and in American Hustle, Cooper is simply dazzling. Delivering the best performance of the cast, Cooper nails moment after moment, infusing his strict and intense line delivery while having impeccable comedic timing. One sequence in which he imitates the great Louie C.K., who plays one of Richie's frazzled superiors, engulfed the movie theater in non-stop laughter.The actor I feel the most for is the talented and beautiful Amy Adams. If the script was more developed on a writing level, this role could have been the performance of the year. Adams is given an opportunity to enrich herself in a woman, full of layers, that prevent her from losing sight of her own identity. However, being short-changed as her character builds, leaves the audience unsatisfied with where she ends. On a pure performance level, Adams is top-notch, conveying one of her strongest turns yet. I wished more for her but ultimately was let down.David O. Russell used to be able to excite, in the way that Quentin Tarantino would when ventured off into a new realm of his imagination. His 2010 film The Fighter was his most ambitious outing and I've waited, patiently mind you, to see when he top that endeavor. I'll always award his efforts as a writer. I Heart Huckabees, Three Kings, and Silver Linings Playbook succeed mostly on the merits of his storytelling ability. American Hustle levels out a lot of the time, enabling the viewer to connect and engage the world convincingly. There are other times though, where honestly, I almost fell asleep. Even when Russell demonstrates uneven filmmaking, I've remained bound to the story. This is the first time I found myself bored, especially in scenes involving Jeremy Renner, who I adore.Read more @ AwardsCircuit.com",,Anonymous,Crime

Some of this actually happened,"""Some of this actually happened"" is the opening title, there are no credits, on the most pitch perfect movie since Argo and before that Magnolia.It's a mob movie with grifters.The ensemble cast is led gloriously, no miraculously, by Christian Bale (really? Christian Bale?) in perhaps the most astounding physical transformation since De Niro in Raging Bull.And what an ensemble. Bradley Cooper is hilarious throughout, not least because of his Starsky-esque tight perm and outrageous swagger.Amy Adams is simply electrifying – in so many movies she is brilliant but in this she is radiant. (Surely she will win at the Academy Awards at the fifth time of asking in the Spring).Jennifer Lawrence is gearing up to win as many awards as Meryl Streep as she glides effortlessly from franchise movie to big American Drama via the odd art-house number. She is wonderful.And then there is the unsung star; Jeremy Renner who plays an important leading subplot character role as the mayor of New Jersey.Maybe it's not surprising that the ensemble works so well because this cast has been Oscar nominated no less than 17 times; Cooper (once) Adams (4 times) Bale (Once and won for O'Russell's The Fighter) Renner (twice) Lawrence (Twice with one win) and in a supporting role De Niro (seven times winning twice). By the time March comes that will be at least 20.And then there's O'Russel, who is on fire. In my opinion he is now as good as PT Anderson with Oscar nods for this (surely), Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter; his last three movies.It's a film you never want to end with a plot that twists and turns like a mongoose in a sack with a cobra. So it's impossible to plot spoil because it's so complex. But the writing is nailed on in every scene so that you are carried along on a wave of gasps and belly laughs (it really is very funny indeed).The camera-work (Linus Sandgren) is beautifully evocative of time and place (late 70′s New York).One scene in particular sees Amy Adams just about have actual real life sex in an ecstatic Studio 54 washroom trap, to the thudding soundtrack of ""I Feel Love"". It had me open mouthed. Indeed she achieves this effect more than once.In another, late in the film, Lawrence kisses Adams on the mouth so hard that she leaves all her lipstick behind. Spraying her territory. Marking Adams' cards. It's brilliant.(The kiss of a spiderwoman.) ""You're nothing to me until you're everything."" says Adams' character, Sydney Prosser, to Cooper's FBI agent. And this is possibly the central thought in the film.It's all about possession; of power, of women, of money.And it's what blinds the foolish and drives them to make wrong, ill thought out decisions that can have, and do have, monumental implications.The moral is; don't play with the big boys unless you've got your wits about you.Christian Bale most certainly has his.A resounding 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, but well below expectations.","When your cast list comprises of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner, and you have David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook) behind the camera, expectations are naturally going to be high. Apparently too high. Based loosely on the Abscam scandal, this period drama (set in the swinging seventies) with thriller trimmings is solid but nothing more, which, considering the talent involved, is undeniably disappointing. It's tonally uneven and the dramatic elements are subsequently diminished, whilst the sorta-scheming- and-conning plot is bizarrely underwhelming and lacking a worthy payoff. Nevertheless, Hustle scores big with some well-timed comedy, Linus Sandgren's beautiful cinematography and an absolutely cracking score; and the top shelf ensemble cast, with Amy Adams in particular, are reliably watchable (and boasting humorous disco-era makeovers to boot). There's enough here to recommend a DVD viewing, although forking out the big dollars to see this on the big screen is unnecessary.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great Acting, Mess of a film","What really made this movie for me was Jennifer Lawrence. She stole every scene that she was in. Whether she's accidentally setting her kitchen on fire, angry dancing to ""Live and Let Die"" or walking around with a neck brace, she was absolutely hilarious. But she was also very charming and made me feel for her character. I even teared up a bit when she was at the restaurant with Pete and she started crying about how ""she doesn't like change"". I mean, she was wonderful. I would love to see her win another Oscar. Her accent was pretty spot on too. All of the other actors were pretty good too. Although, I thought Amy Adam's British accent was distracting. I don't know if it was meant to come across that way...but it wasn't good.I also really loved the costumes. They all looked authentic 70s garb. I actually really dug a lot of Amy's ""booby"" costumes. The hairstyles were awful....but purposefully awful and they too worked. Even the atmosphere, and the colours they used for the filters had a 70s vibe to it.However, I thought the rest of the film seemed like a mess. I didn't like how the story played out on screen. And I thought the voice-overs were annoying. Like, they would say stuff like ""I thought he was charming"". ""I met her 2 years ago"". And I would sit there like....Who are you addressing this to? The audience? Why is this necessary? It was distracting, annoying and not needed. Im sure you can properly convey this to an audience without actually having to actually say it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good movie but not a great,"I went into this movie with great expectations because, well just have a look at the cast and you expect nothing but greatness. At the end of it, I was more or less satisfied but I couldn't help but feel that this movie could have been much greater. However the cast were all terrific in their own roles, with Jennifer Lawrence being the standout performer in spite of probably having one of the lesser central roles in the plot. Both Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper were solid and Amy Adams was lovely as always. These great performance were mainly the reason I rated this movie above average because they were certainly a joy to watch. I liked the plot, twist within twist with a whole lot of mini-twists here and there and it did allow all characters to develop to a certain extent. However in my opinion, it was at times a little too complex for its own good. Don't get me wrong, I like a movie with a deep plot that doesn't give everything away to the viewer straight away. Even then, American did seem to lose to me for brief periods here and there, in spite of me trying to pay a great deal of attention to the movie. A great example of a similar type movie is Sting, which keeps twisting you around till the last minute without actually over complicating things. At the end of the day, I'd say American Hustle is a good movie and is definitely worth a watch but it could have easily been much bigger with a little tempo injected in some parts and a more direct approach in some other parts.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Going for the big one,"American Hustle is one of the best acted films in a long time. Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner and Bradley Cooper are all excellent. Also Robert De Niro makes an uncredited cameo as a mobster in flashbacks that makes you think the scenes were lifted out from Goodfellas.The film is a black comedy-drama set in the late 1970's period revolving around the the true life Abscam scandal, where FBI agents and con artists joined up to frame politicians for taking money 'to help grease palms.'It focuses on Bale as an out of shape hustler with bad hair and Amy Adams his soul mate who passes off as an English Aristocrat. They both have been making big money in a scam where they dupe arrangement fees for loans that never materialise.Cooper is the FBI agent with big ambitions and a big ego who wants to go after a bigger catch and more by accident has the mafia in his sights.In the mix is Bale's wayward wife (Lawrence) and stepson. A Mayor of New Jersey (Renner) with a big heart and charisma who has been caught up in the sting operation which Bale feels very guilty about.Directed by David O Russell who has worked with many of the cast before, this is an interesting take on con men and law men.However the film feels flabby, it has plenty of narration which is essentially exposition. The film needed to be leaner, more playful and sharper, the humour is sporadic.You quickly get a good idea that given some of the crooks are shown to be very nice that it is Cooper that might be the one who ends up being the mark. He is arrogant and can be boorish. (Cooper at one point beats up his superior officer who constantly tells him to be careful.)The movie has sassiness from its female leads, quirkiness from Bale and Renner. With De Niro's steely gaze it should had been better than the final product.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

They soon find themselves in hot water after being set up by Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) a slightly crazy and overly ambitious FBI agent. In an attempt to keep their freedom they help DiMaso bring down corrupt politicians as well as the mobsters that seem to control them.The movie relocates to New Jersey where the scam gets deeper and involves an Arabian sheik impostor, chest hair, lots of bling and some high maintenance 70s hairdos. The characters are extremely interesting and the viewing pleasure is provided by them rather than the scams themselves. Sex, affairs and a lot of flirting combined with Irving's gorgeous yet utterly disreputable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) , provide us with as much character depth as one could hope for.I was left with a sense of uncanny admiration similar to that of Oceans Eleven or Catch Me If You Can.Once again David O. Russell knocks it out the park with another high end movie.Highly recommended 8/10MattRigby",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
It was OK,"American Hustle feels like a good movie that is a retread. The performances are outstanding, Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence are given the chance to shine and they don't miss. However, the story (who is hustling who?) is thinly veiled. It's well done, but nothing that hasn't been done before (""The Sting"").The story is essentially Bale and Amy Adams are con artists. Eventually they get picked up by the FBI (Bradley Cooper). They set up an operation designed to implicate the mayor (Jeremy Renner) but eventually seem to be knee-deep in trouble as the mob and politicians get involved. Then the question becomes who is the hustler, and who is being hustled.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""I feel love."" A love story, well, several, in fact.","""That's the boat, Donnie.""When FBI Agent Joe Pistone, posing as jewel-thief Donnie Brasco, and attempting to infiltrate the Mafia, wanted to impress Benjamin 'Lefty Guns' Ruggiero of the Bonanno Crime Family, he got the use of 'The Left Hand', a big boat that was being used in an FBI sting-operation called ABSCAM.This film is not about Donny and Lefty, or the boat, or even about ABSCAM, rather it is very loosely based on the sting-operation.Everything that I have heard about this film, the trailers that I saw, everything, made this reviewer want to see this film.Film opens with a couple of studio credits. They look a little old and naff, and combined with the quality and the texture of the film, cause us to be immediately transported back to the seventies. There are no further opening credits, except one, which states ""Some of this actually happened."" Film is actually set right at the end of the seventies and the start of the eighties. In the seventies a device was invented for bald men. It was called 'The comb-over'. The opening shot of the movie is of Irving, a bald man, played by Christian Bale. He adjusts his hair before getting into his role. He is bald, fat, and middle aged. He is also working with Richie played by Bradley Cooper. Another man with an interesting hairstyle. Actress Amy Adams makes up the trio. She too will sport some spiffing hairstyles. Together they are trying to do a business deal, but things are not clear. They are in fact, running a con. Film now backtracks to explain how they got together.This film is like 'Donnie Brasco' (1997). Like that film, this is as much about undercover work by the FBI as it is about the other subject matter. So we see, like FBI Agent Pistone did, the problems associated with running an undercover operation in that era. Decades later FBI Agent Joaquin Garcia, aka 'Big' Jack Falcone of the Gambino Crime Family, would similarly struggle. How Pistone and Garcia must wish they could've sorted out their problems in real-life as happened in this film.The job of the con-artist is to exude confidence, to convince the person they are dealing with, that they are the genuine article, that what you see is what you get, whilst all along it is not. The same applies to undercover-work by FBI Agents. This film, like 'Donny Brasco', has arguments, betrayals, confrontations, and dangerous exposure threats. It is unclear who is conning who.However, we the audience, know more than the actors/players. We know that the con is on. Know too that the FBI is involved. So we know more than the marks and can enjoy seeing the actors in their dual roles. They had dual roles in real-life too. Jeremy Renner has a very poignant role. It was in fact specially written for him due to casting problems. Bale, Cooper, and Renner, were all cast for more than one role. So not only were they acting two roles in one part, in real life they switched parts too.Thus this, in 'American Hustle', was not deliberate, it just happened, but it must enhance the film. So too, that much of the film is improvised, this was deliberate, perhaps it was to capture the feeling of the con. Film then is like a con, it is unclear what will happen next, improvisation is always a possibility.The film was written and directed by David O. Russell who also did the great 'Silver Linings Playbook' of 2012. Both films share that same mix of comedy, drama and romance. Writer/Director Russell also reunites some of the cast of 'SLP'. Jennifer Lawrence who was so good in that, here again gives a superb performance. She plays a young mother who is stupid, sassy, sexy and sultry. The role is comparable to that of Sharon Stone in 'Casino' (1995). We have too, Bradley Cooper of course, who even gives us another dance. Robert De Niro, also puts in an appearance with a great performance.In real-life Christian Bale added over 40LBS to his weight for his role. When Robert De Niro met him he didn't even recognize him. However all actors, with parts large and small, were all great.This film has been described as a 'fictionalization'. A google after viewing the film, showed me that the film is somewhat different from the source material, but not in a major way.In real-life New Jersey has been described as the most corrupt state in the USA. In real-life too, the casinos brought Atlantic City back to life. An era captured well in 'Atlantic City, USA' (1980).In this film the characters are less black and white, less good guys and bad guys. The colouring is much more that of shades of grey. The dividing line is not clear.This is a great film. In the style that Martin Scorsese created, we have apt use of period music. Actors play characters who exhibit much warmth, and as they exude great love to each other, so do we fall in love with them. But be warned: just like Jennifer Lawrence's nail-varnish, this film too is bitter-sweet. We too will experience the highs and lows as do the characters. Having said that there are some nice twists. Some clever twists too. This is after all a con film. So do try to keep your eye on the ball.The only mistakes in this film are, one badly placed moustache (I can thank Donny and Lefty for spotting that) and two badly delivered lines. Not enough to mark this film down for.""Hey, did they get us? We're sitting here, Left. We beat those FBI guys!""The con is on. Enjoy! 10/10.",,Anonymous,Crime
"American HUSTLE (David O. Russell, 2013) ***","As it turned out, I left for last in this year's Oscar race the two best movies – the other being Martin Scorsese's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET – even if that still does not make them masterpieces in my book! Interestingly enough, this is very much styled like a Scorsese picture – and, if one had any doubt for a second about this, a surprise cameo toward the film's last third cements that fact unreservedly! Director Russell has consistently proved himself a deft co-ordinator of ensemble pieces (back from the time of THREE KINGS {1999} and I HEART HUCKABEES {2004}), but especially with his impressive last trio of ""Oscar bait"" efforts – namely THE FIGHTER (2010), SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012) and, of course, the title under review.With respect to American HUSTLE, this latter element emerges as both its strength and drawback: it obviously creates some well-defined characters for the talented actors to sink their teeth into but, at the same time, it necessitates that they often take a back seat in order to allow the others to shine or for the complex plot to unravel; this suggests that, in spite of having four nominations in the acting categories (Best Actor Christian Bale, Actress Amy Adams, Supporting Actor Bradley Cooper and Supporting Actress Jennifer Lawrence – it is worth noting, and that in itself is no mean feat, that Bale and Lawrence had already won under Russell's guidance, while Adams and Cooper also received previous nods!), their chance of taking to the Dolby Theatre stage tonight is pretty slimapart, perhaps, from Lawrence, thanks to her wacky antics as the proverbial ditzy blonde! All things considered, however, the performances here do come across as a tad overstated; likewise, while the late 1970s atmosphere is impressively evoked throughout (helped in no small measure by a killer soundtrack that includes Steely Dan, Todd Rundgren, Elton John and David Bowie), the film's visuals seemed inordinately drab to my eyes (unless there was simply something wrong with the print I watched!).The plot, then, is a mix of THE STING (1973) and GOODFELLAS (1990 – yeah, another tip of the hat to Scorsese!): though the con (among those being 'taken' are Jeremy Renner and veteran Anthony Zerbe) took some time to draw me in, it became quite compelling once the Mob was roped in, with the suspense quotient rising in view of their inevitable retribution if the F.B.I. operation's cover were blown. At 138 minutes, the film can seem lengthy and repetitive, but the surface style succeeds in keeping it all together – and, as I said, the characterizations are solid (and, individually, entertaining) enough to anchor the fanciful (albeit true) events in reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good Watch,"Overall, good movie. Honorable mentions to Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence. They did a fantastic job with the props as well as acting (everybody). The story itself was pretty descent up to the resolution in my opinion. I had a problem with the overall ending and thought it was unrealistic, but thats my take. I think it still is a pretty good watch for the big screen and I would not be surprised if any of the actors win academy awards for their performance. The movie was enriched with a good plot. I thought that the way that corruption is played was very realistic in that sense. The movie also had shades of grey that depict how fighting against crime isn't as black and white as many of the gangster movies have tried to do. But this movie definitely makes you feel for all of the characters at some point.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
superb performances but oddly unsatisfying,"American Hustle is a real con-artist/hustle/heist type of film, and one of the best for plot, writing and complexity of the story, it has you guessing all the way through and is very suspenseful. I had absolutely no idea how it would be resolved... well, until the bit in the lawyer's office. Its a ""period"" piece, set in 1970s America, and the fashions and styling of the film were very good. The soundtrack was great.Bale, Cooper, Adams, Lawrence and Renner ... and De Niro ... were exemplary of actors incredibly deep into character; they were all barely recognisable and each performance was gripping, believable and impressive. Jennifer Lawrence, girl du jour, was luminous as the unstable and rather irresponsible wife of Christian Bale's overweight, balding hustler; he was quite gross in many respects. Cooper was the over zealous FBI Agent who you sort of wanted to win out but the whole film was back to front in that good guys were perhaps the crooks, or were they? It was a little of a grey area. He was sexy, funny and obnoxious in equal measure. The script was great, the plot was great ... as a con-artist movie this is up there with the greats BUT it was largely unsatisfying emotionally. It was a really good film but not really all that enjoyable. Sure, it was entertaining and laugh out loud funny in places but it wasn't a comedy, was definitely drama, and watched more like a documentary than a film. It was good but one came away feeling a bit underwhelmed. None of the characters were particularly likable and whilst the story was gripping, you weren't invested in the characters, just curiosity about the story. It was, I can only describe it as, an empty and unsatisfying experience and the ending... I don't know, it didn't please. A film with cracking potential but just doesn't make its somehow, and I can't really put my finger on why.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Favourite Film of the Year!,"I'm just going to come right out and say it - ""American Hustle"" is my favourite film of the year.I had been looking forward to this ever since I found out it was happening. David O. Russell is a fantastic director, and the cast is top notch. Let me tell you I was not disappointed by the end result.Right from the opening scene with Christian Bale, his performance pulls you in and leaves you in awe of his incredible acting. I may sound like I'm overselling it, but he is truly brilliant in this film. (Personally, I believe he deserves the Oscar for Best Actor, and I am aware of the tough competition this year - Still, he was fantastic) Everyone else - Adams, Cooper, Renner, Lawrence, heck, even Louis CK, are great, and you wouldn't expect anything less.I realize this is a very positive review, but I enjoyed it so much I don't think I could bring myself to say anything negative about the film.Sure, if you enjoy special effects and high speed car chases - this isn't the film for you. But if you love a great story along with great acting, you NEED to see this movie.In conclusion, David O. Russell once again hits a home run with a great film, sprinkled with one of the best ensemble casts of the year in what I consider to be a top two or three contender for this year's Oscar race. Go see ""American Hustle.""",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle is a grand success at nearly every level,"The 'based on a true story' we so often see at the beginning of a film has been a recurring Bête Noire of mine for some considerable time. I have argued before that the licence it gives to film-makers is open to the widest interpretation. It is a specious use of language. It allows writer and director to re-frame events, dissemble, misrepresent people, and, if challenged on points of veracity, hide behind the fact that it was never claimed to be a truthful recall.The Butler was one of the biggest culprits in 2013. This film was based on THE true story rather than A true story - whatever the difference of the definite article might imply. The only problem was that most of the major events portrayed in the life of Cecil Gaines never happened – his mother's rape; his father's murder; his son in the Black Panthers; his son killed on active service in Vietnam. All poppycock.So David O. Russell's wonderful American Hustle had me on-side from the outset with its tongue in cheek advice at the film's beginning that 'Some of this actually happened'.Set in the 1970s, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a con man skilled at depriving the needy from cash they can ill afford to lose. Not wishing to restrict his activities to the lower socio-economic demograph, he sells forged art works to the well-heeled as a lucrative sideline. Joining him in these activities is the seductive erstwhile stripper, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), who poses as a royalty-connected member of the British aristocracy to give the operation some class. Their ill-gotten trade is broken by federal agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who then turns the couple in order to ensnare corrupt politicians on the take whom he wishes to expose and incarcerate in furtherance of his career. DiMaso's inordinate ambition is hampered only by his lack of tactical nous as he has to rely ever more on the wily Rosenfeld.American Hustle is a grand success at nearly every level.The ensemble cast appears to be without a weakness: Christian Bale, with a heavy paunch and comical comb-over, always suggests that he is far more in control then he is letting on; Amy Adams, about whom I was scathing as the demure Lois Lane in Man of Steel, is pitch perfect as the cleavage-showing Siren oozing sex appeal – her ability to separate salivating men from their dollars was all too believable; Bradley Cooper with another comical hairstyle, this time a tight-knit perm, clearly enjoyed his role as the obsessive and flawed FBI man; Jeremy Renner as the well-meaning Mayor, Carmine Polito, (collateral damage in Cooper's crusade) came across as an oily and cheesy lounge singer as a reminder of an era before professional spin doctors homogenised the political class; Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's trailer trash and manipulative wife, aware of the lien she holds over her estranged husband, gave a fantastic performance of tragic comedy. An uncredited cameo from Robert De Niro exuding septuagenarian menace was the cake icing.Direction from David O. Russell was consistently fast-paced with no lulls in its 138 minutes and without ever being confusing. The cinematography and editing were first rate.It would be nit-picking to mention that the excellent 70s soundtrack was occasionally just a little overblown.But what raises American Hustle well over the bar is its screenplay from David O. Russell and Eric Warren Singer. Humorous throughout, the film has several laugh out loud moments while also delivering both dramatic impact and thought provoking concepts. As Christian Bale becomes ever more ambivalent about what he is being forced to do, he very deftly leads the audience to share his growing but tacit realisation that sometimes an end can very much justify the means. That the film is bound to have a final twist is never in doubt. If, when it comes, it is not totally innovative or unsurprising, quite frankly – who cares?The producers of American Hustle can start hiring the limos for Oscar night.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Disappointed, well acted, but story just not there","I was really looking forward to see this movie as soon as I saw the first preview.I thought they got the look and feel of the 70s right on. Great job with wardrobe, hair, make-up etc. I also thought the performances were very good, especially Bale and Amy Adams. The problem with this movie was the story. It just didn't move. It seemed that from the beginning, they were sure to point out that this was not supposed to be a true telling of the Abscam scandal. It starts with a line saying, ""Some of this actually happened."" A clever way of telling us that ""we embellished the story a lot"". Great, they can get creative. The problem is, you didn't feel like you were getting a history lesson, but you also didn't get an entertaining story. It was too slow, too long.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cinema Fun At Its Finest (But Is It Really Worthy Of All The Awards?),"Going in to see ""American Hustle"", I really had no idea what to expect. To be honest, it didn't look like the type of movie I would usually be interested in, but that dynamite cast mixed with overwhelmingly positive reviews got me in a theater seat. I enjoyed the film and thought it was an exciting mix of cast interactions, period (1970s) references, and some really great music. I just don't understand why it is being nominated for so many prestigious awards.For a basic plot summary, ""American Hustle"" tells the story of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), two individuals who, after a chance meeting, set out on a life of ""hustling"" (mainly by charging fees on loans that will never develop). When they are eventually busted by F.B.I. agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), they are given a deal to work together with the government to take down some ""big boys"" of crime.The reason this film works so well is because director David O. Russell is such a master of character interactions. He just has that innate ability to pick a perfect cast and then make literally every interaction between them mean something (whether dramatic, comedic, or any other range of emotion). Plus, the 1970s atmosphere is fun to be flung into, complete with vintage clothing, music, and set pieces. There are some negatives to this film, but its main positive is that it has the ability to completely sweep away the viewer and engulf them in every aspect of the movie.The reason I can't give ""American Hustle"" five stars or consider it a ""classic"" movie? The story is a bit weak. I left the theater (despite being dazzled by the things I described above) thinking ""what was the take-home message of this film?"" I felt as if the plot meandered a bit and wasn't as rock solid as perhaps it could/should have been. Maybe this is somewhat of a Russell ""trademark"", though, as I gave a similar four-star ranking to last year's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" for similar reasons.Thus, my overall verdict for ""American Hustle"" was that it was a rip-roaring good time at the theater...but nothing worthy of major awards (perhaps with the exception of Amy Adams, whom I thought gave the best performance of the show). I still think that ""The Fighter"" is the best movie directed by Mr. O Russell. Other than that, though, this is a picture that can (and probably should be) watched twice in order to catch all of its complexities.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
IMDb's 7.8 rating deceived me: A bad movie is a bad movie is a bad movie....I want my money back,"Where do I even start? Like another reviewer just mentioned, it would have been more fun watching paint dry. So, I saw this 7.8 rating on IMDb and thought this one is just going to hit the spot for the week-end, especially after Wolf of Wall Street, I thought there is another surprise in store for me. For a movie that is supposed to be all about con-men and con women, the only thing they managed to con was the money you spent to watch this drivel.It seems the directors themselves were not very convinced of the script that's why the lame precautionary note in the beginning reels, ""Some of the events depicted in this film are true"". They spent too much time trying to build a background for those characters and those irritating voice-overs didn't help matters. I was deceived into watching this crappola as the trailers were misleadingly interesting: turns out they used up all the funniest portions in the trailer itself. The rest of the movie was as boring as watching a cat take a poop next to your neighbour's window.Know what, the only character that was remotely natural and convincing turns out to be Jennifer Lawrence in her role as a housewife suffering from attention disorders. She outdid the other veteran actors like Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper and was not an eyesore exactly. The other girl, some Italian actress I suppose, all she does on screen is trying to pretend to be a ""con-woman"" and flash her two little assets whether or not the occasion calls for it. And that Arab Sheikh played by a supposedly Mexican guy, I didn't understand the twisted logic but they should have just picked a mannequin and covered it with those thawbs that Arabs wear, it was as unconvincing to the audience as to the supposed con victims.In all fairness, for Jennifer Lawrence alone, this movie deserves maybe a 3 or 4 stars but I'm giving it a 1 to somehow balance out all those outrageously false ratings.Don't waste your money and time, you'll thank me for it.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Laughs, Tension and Twists","American Hustle (2013)**** (out of 4)David O. Russell's story of a con artist couple (Christian Bale, Amy Adams) who are forced to work with a FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to try and bring down a mayor (Jeremy Renner) taking illegal money to try and build up Atlantic City. The only problem is that the agent decides to go after some even higher rollers. If you take THE STING and mix it with GOODFELLAS you're going to end up with this film and under the loving care of Russell and the terrific performances you're really left with a true gem of a film. There are so many wonderful elements to this film but I think the greatest thing has to be the screenplay, which constantly leaves you guessing as to where the next twist is going to come from yet it never out smarts itself and it certainly never gets too confusing for those watching. Russell has proved himself as someone who can take a worn out genre and make it seem fresh and original. He did this recently with boxing (THE FIGHTER) and oddball romance (SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK) and he's done it again here. You really do get the feel that you're watching a film taking place in the 70s as the atmosphere is just perfect, the cinematography flawless and the music selections are just brilliantly used. Of course it also helps that you've got such a stellar cast and everyone of them doing excellent work. This includes Bale who is just simply amazing at the way he can transform himself into any role no matter how big or small. There's not a single frame of this film where you don't believe he's this character. Then you've got Adams and Cooper doing some of the strongest work of their career and the same can be said for Renner. Then there's Jennifer Lawrence in a small but very important role as the rather dimwitted wife. How many times have we seen the dumb wife role? Countless times but Russell and Lawrence bring a fresh and original take here. There's also a surprise cameo that I won't ruin for those not wanting to know it but man is it powerful. American HUSTLE is without question one of the best films of the year and it's also a perfect example of being able to mix laughs with slick twists and some tense drama.",,Anonymous,Crime
Scorsese Light,"It's so obvious that director David O. Russell was trying to make his own Scorsese movie that I am stunned that more people haven't pointed it out. The use of music, the editing style, the use of narration, the way he directed his actors (and the way Christian Bale aped Robert DeNiro in his performance) - it's all VERY Scorsese. Or, more accurately, like Scorsese on auto pilot (or Scorsese light). Bringing in DeNiro for a cameo was almost like an admission of guilt on Russell's part. As if he were saying, ""Yes, I'm trying to make a Martin Scorsese type movie."" Don't misunderstand, American Hustle IS a good movie. Very good at times, but it is completely unoriginal in it's style and it is about fifteen or twenty minutes too long.But throughout the movie I kept noticing the Scorsese-isms and the DeNiro aping from Bale. It became distracting.Ultimately, American Hustle is a well made movie. It's just a well made homage to Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro more than anything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Top Movie of 2013 Contender,"A con man, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), along with his seductive British partner, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), is forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey power brokers and mafia.To best review this film, we need to talk about what the film is and what the film is not. Generally, it is a fictional retelling of the FBI's Operation Abscam, where they used a fake sheik to bribe politicians. However, the emphasis is on fictional, because a great many things have been changed -- most notably, Amy Adams' character is completely invented, along with the love triangle aspect. There is also little evidence of Mafia involvement in the actual operation.So, the storytelling is quite good with a more than adequate script, but it is not by any means a realistic presentation of the facts. If such a movie exists, I would love to see it, but this is not that film.What this film is: a strong showcase for some incredible actors. Adams is at the top of her game here, and easily earns herself the Oscar nomination if not the win (though it is a competitive category this year). Bale, who is always good, also gives a respectable performance, though maybe not his best. Jennifer Lawrence continues to expand her talents and it is no wonder she has quickly become a regular on the red carpet. Even Louis C.K., not generally known for his acting, is top notch here.Bradley Cooper, who I slowly warming to, is the weak link. He plays his part well, but not ""Oscar well"", and I am more than a little surprised by his nomination. In my estimation, Adams could win if Bullock does not run away with the statuette, Bale has a shot, Lawrence may squeak by, but Cooper is unlikely. The Globes awarded Adams and Lawrence, which seems about right. If there was an award for ""ensemble cast"", they would be a shoo-in, but individually it is a tough call this year.I have a hard time accepting this as a best director nomination for David O. Russell. He may be a great director, and some credit must be given for being the man in charge, but again, this is an actor's film. There is no inventive camera work or lighting or much in the way of technical achievement. With such an impressive cast, I suspect Russell's role was relatively easy. I do not see a best director win for Russell, especially with Alfonso Cuarón as his competition.The film editing category is too difficult to call with my limited knowledge of the process. As for best costume design and best production design, I can see why there were nominations but I suspect a win is unlikely. Maybe for costumes (though it is up against some films that want it badly) but not for production.On to the biggest nomination of all: best picture. Although I have not yet seen all the Oscar nominees, I feel comfortable in saying this not only deserved the nomination but could possibly win. Being up against ""Gravity"" and ""12 Years a Slave"", I suspect a win is unlikely, but it is probably the best film of 2013 I have seen so far. This is a dramatic improvement over ""Silver Linings Playbook"".Moreover, I think a best picture award is fitting. Despite the plethora of nominations the film received, it will not win most of the acting categories and probably not the directing category. But the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and its final form transcends the individual performances and crew achievements.For a great 1970s throwback with action, romance, double dealing, and some of the finest acting of the year, you cannot do better than ""American Hustle"".",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
An intelligent and funny movie with a great cast!,"""American Hustle"" is a comedy/drama film that tells the story of Irving Rosenfeld, a con artist, and his partner Sydney Prosser, who are forced to aid FBI agent Richie DiMaso in setting up a sting operation on corrupt politicians in exchange for their release.The movie is partially based on the FBI ABSCAM operation of the late 1970's and early 1980's. The characters featured in the movie are fictionalized versions of their real-life counterparts.The movie is directed by David O. Russell and stars Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner. The original script by O. Russell and Eric Warren Singer combines elements of drama and comedy to present the story of Irving Rosenfeld, since his early little crimes as a child to his adult life as a con artist, which led to his forced involvement in the sting operation.David O. Russell wrote the principal characters having in mind the actors that would portray them, that's why each character fits each actor perfectly. The main cast does an excellent job, Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, the intelligent and resourceful con artist; Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser, Rosenfeld's seductive and equally intelligent partner; Bradley Cooper as Richie DiMaso, the ambitious FBI agent; Jennifer Lawrence, always amazing, as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, Irving's unpredictable wife and Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito, the naïve mayor from Camden, New Jersey. The film presents a character-driven story that is greatly benefited by the excellent direction of David O. Russell, who encouraged the cast to improvise throughout the shooting of the movie, which is what made the final result so unique.All this elements make ""American Hustle"" a great film, a movie that manages to be both intelligent and funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Saw it Twice....and then I bought it!,"No apologies! Yep, I bought the DVD set that includes the digital copy. Admittedly, the first time I saw ""American Hustle"", I was taken back, annoyed, confused, and uncomfortable---during the first 15-20 minutes. Then I settled a bit. As I became familiar with the roles played by Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, it became interesting and entertaining for me. Following this first viewing, I also saw other nominated films of 2013, which led me to wonder had I seen any yet worthy of Academy Award, and if so, which ONE! So I returned to see American Hustle again. That's when I fell for this movie and it became my choice for top movie. Movies that I would never want to see a 2nd time can not qualify, by my standards, for movie of the year. There were actually several that I would see again. ""Captain Phillips"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" are not among them. Kind of reminds me of my rage when ""ET"" did not get movie of the year!! ""Gandhi"" did. I ask, ""what's your score on multiple viewings of these?"" OK, my ""review"" is basically defending my ultimate enjoyment of ""American Hustle"". What was confusing was, of the four actors, who was ""Best"", and who was ""Supporting"". They were each incredible. But the gals were stunning in there roles. And ""the mayor, Jeremy Renner"", was outstanding. I'm just glad the DVD set came with the iTunes digital, so I can truly watch it anywhere, anytime....

American Bore,"I didn't get into the flow of this movie. I could see what they were shooting for, but, for me the movie was flat and boring. Great actors...perhaps given too much room to improvise...loads of meandering scenes. Perhaps with a tighter script and focused direction it may have capitalized on it's promise.It's as though the director thought if he put a bunch of talented actors in front of the screen, put in some popular songs and plenty of cleavage, he would produce something entertaining. I found myself fidgeting and shuffling about in my seat, trying not to fall asleep. Not to sound prudish ,but, what's with the cleavage? I know it's the 70s..but, seriously...overkill!. Close ups and make-up (or lack of) made beautiful women look hideous. Definitely the most overrated movie I have seen in a while.

Don't get conned by the hype.,"I could not wait for this movie to end. It was a complete atrocity. The overly-indulgent, sloppy chaos amounted to nothing in terms of character or story. A vague lesson spoon-fed to the audience during the first 20 minutes is I'm guessing what is supposed to excuse the senseless and bumbling bore of a circus for the next 100.I absolutely do not understand the praise of the acting in this film. I never bought into the actors as their roles, though, honestly, there was not much else holding it together for me. Was there a script? Was there a director??? The entire sad excuse for a film seemed to be the improvised work of the actors themselves contrived in a garage somewhere after a long night of drinking.I never was really motivated to read into the movie, and I was never really fully engaged or entertained by the shallow antics, long-hanging scenes that go on way too long, or 70's retro-obsession. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be mesmerized by watching makeup applied to Christian Bale's head or how cool walking into a 70's themed wardrobe would be. It seemed none of the actors could keep their accents. I would never label this as a comedy-- I did laugh from time to time because of how badly I wanted it to be over.For a respectable story about individuals trying to reinvent themselves please see The Great Gatsby, The Departed, or The Town (and I'm sure there are many more).",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Exhilarating, spectacular fun!","I want to start off with this... I love this movie. Why? It's true what so many are saying, it's just incredibly entertaining and just so, so much fun! That's really what it comes down to. The only other O Russell films I've seen are The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. The former I thought was decent if totally formulaic, and the latter I thought was fantastic although still somewhat formulaic. Russell shows a different kind of energy here that I hadn't seen from him in those two films, and he shows that he has a more distinct vision than I would have imagined. The plot here really is messy and sometimes hard to follow, but what keeps it endlessly intriguing is the cast and many single individual scenes that manage to work completely on their own. This shouldn't be how a film functions, and it's a surprise the film is as great as it is because it really is all over the place sometimes. But it all works.There are many great performances here, but the single best is Bradley Cooper. Who would have thought two years ago that the Hangover jerk- looking guy could actually act, but wait, that he could actually have an incredibly likable screen presence and steal a film from so many of his co-stars! That's what he does. He releases a kind of energy here that he didn't reach in Playbook and steals away most of his scenes. The other comparable to Cooper is Lawrence, who's also having a blast with all of this. It's like someone let these two come up with their own things and weren't given rules to go by. There's a spontaneity to them and the whole film really, and it pays off tremendously. They both benefit from having some of the funniest material. Bale is great, as expected, but for me, Amy Adams resonated more. In the past, she'd always been hit-or- miss for me, but after last year's wonderful work in The Master and now this, she's becoming someone I'm actually liking a lot. Jeremy Renner has much less screen time than the other four, but he nails the role in his limited screen time. In short, these five make up the strongest ensemble of 2013, unlikely to be challenged by any other cast.That's pretty much what the film's success comes down to. Its cast (and I didn't even mention all of the other great supporting turns) makes this a roaring great time. It may not have the emotion or gravitas that films like 12 Years A Slave or Gravity have, but it might just be better as a more accessible movie-going experience.",,Anonymous,Crime
competent but derivative,"This gets a pass, but only because I didn't feel like walking out after 20 minutes, like I normally do when I make the mistake of going to see a movie. Some are comparing American Hustle to Goodfellas - this comparison is plain redundant. The problem is that it has none of the panache and (controlled) manic energy of the Scorcese classic, therefore its attempt at pastiche is a failure, and it ends up just being painfully derivative. However, this does not prevent the director from indulging in a woefully egotistical self-reference regarding a forgery of a Rembrandt painting. The line goes something like ""Who is the master, the painter of the original, or the forger?"", ie ""Who is the master here, Scorsese....or ME?"" (!!!). The use of music is too deliberate, and falls easily into the 'soundtrack in search of a movie' category. We're also a bit tired of over the top depictions of 1970's fashion, hairstyles, etc. Overall,a rather klunky piece of self-indulgence.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Highly Overrated.,"American Hustle.The movie is about a con artist and his partner who are given a deal with the FBI for their freedom.This movie had an all star cast. You have Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renners, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence. All of them delivered good performances, Christian Bale especially. He even gained weight for this role, got out of shape, that dude is a hard core actor, definitely deserves an Oscar Nod.The movie execution was sloppy because it just left me unsatisfied. Seriously, when it finished, I was like that's it?? There were some great moments here and there but overall it wasn't that interesting, especially considering I watched it after Wolf Of Wall Street. I liked that the movie focused more on the characters and they were likable, with a better execution, it could have been a great one.It has a 90 on metacritic and 93% on rotten tomatoes, VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED.

a failed attempt to be in the league of directing legends,"i think this movie it's the most direct attempt to David o.Russel, from producing a genre film that could be iconic somehow. the photography, the cameras, even the music and the costumes are in that level. the problem is the lack of substance in the characters, and the level of dialogue that leads nowhere. we understand the characters temper at the beginning, and they all act in the same way until the end. that's it: you're always expecting the character in behaving in a specific way, and he behaves: no one surprises or amazes us, even though o.Russel wanted that in that twisted but no twisted ending.maybe Jennifer Lawrence's character is the only one that changes yes, but not that much and in a predictable way in the beginning. Bradley cooper is not enough actor to play a role like this, bale and Adams are good, but they don't have much to work on.anyway, that's why if you see it like that, you can get nice entertainment for it. nothing fancy or special, but not a bad way to spend the 2 hours. but it's not a Oscar movie, it's not even a movie that should have any kind of hype. i don't think history will remember this, because it needed way better dialogues, it needed stronger characters, it needed a narrative structure lost in all the style, and lights, and camera movements. not a big deal.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The cast, the music, the story, the sets, the costumes...perhaps you had to live through that period to fully appreciate how ""right"" they got it. I did. And some of the actors I had not particularly liked in previous movies. This movie changed my opinion about their abilities rather completely. That did not apply to Christian Bale.

"Character Development at its Finest,","American Hustle is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast that all deliver magnificent performances.Every actor delivers a performance unlike any role they've aged in the past,you won't believe that Irving Rosenfeld is played by Christian Bale,he went through a massive transformation,he clearly put on so many pounds for this character which shows how dedicated he is,amazing and unique performances were also delivered by Amy Adams,Bradley Cooper,Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner.I also really appreciated they they put Louis CK in this movie,I'm a huge fan of his stand up and his series Louie,he is one if the funniest people on the planet and he clearly got the improvise a lot of his lines because a lot of the things he says are completely his humour.American Hustle is an outstanding movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great crime drama.An FBI agent forces a con man and his wife to get involved with the mafia in order for him to solve his case.Best Performance: Christian Bale Worst Performance: Michael Pena",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Conning the Con,"I would have to buy into the criticism that the people who frequent this world are so hard to praise (although the female leads are quite striking, especially Amy Adams) that it is hard to gain an affinity for them. We see a sort of Bonnie and Clyde scenario (although the violence is not there) as a couple of odd bedfellows find each other and attempt to make big bucks until an FBI agent gets involved. Their future depends on their willingness to expose corrupt politicians and mafia types. There are several twists of plot that make things interesting, but it is often hard to clearly see what the endgame is. Now you don't have wrap everything up with a ribbon, but I'm still not entirely sure what happened and to whom. There is chemistry between Christian Bale and Amy Adams who has this sultry sort of Veronica Lake thing going. I enjoyed those scenes the most.

Not Interesting,"This is the second movie of David O' Russell that I've seen, and the second time I have been incredibly bored and disappointed (the first was the Fighter). This movie had a cool concept, but the actual ""hustle"" part of it was dry and stupid. I just wanted the movie to end. It was barely about the actual crimes they were committing, and more about stupid, repetitive drama between Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, and Christian Bale.Another problem I have is when directors hire a bunch of crowd pleasing actors and just expect the movie to be good.

Great: 9.0,"At the tail end of what has been an undeniably great year for movies, American Hustle is a fabulously entertaining mix of great performances, energetic direction, and black humor. Director David O. Russell has made what is arguably his best film yet, and considering that his previous works include The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, that's a remarkable feat indeed. A semi-fictionalized account of the ABSCAM scandal of the early eighties, Hustle follows an overly-ambitious FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) who enlists the help of two expert con men (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) to expose a corrupt mayor (Jeremy Renner). What follows goes from being a relatively small-scale operation to roping in the American Mafia, a handful of state representatives, and a US Senator. All of which is presented with an abundance of wit and charm, brought on by the perfect cast and sharp script. Ultimately, despite the merest hints of incoherence, American Hustle is easily one of the year's best, a film that can be enjoyed by practically anyone old enough for the subject matter.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fragmented and bizarre story on the American farce, replete with overacting","After seeing a few David O. Russell films (in spite of his personal problems, especially the infamous bipolar-type outburst on the set on ""I Heart Huckabees,"" the movie I never saw because the word of mouth was bad referring to the complaint of pretentiousness), especially the stellar and moving The Silver Linings Playbook, I went to see ""American Hustle,"" piqued by the reading of the stranger than fiction story on political corruption.The movie is middling at best, harmed by some disjointed editing and structure, which explains the near-incoherence of the story. Non-linear is intentional, but it's difficult to follow the movie with complete comprehensibility the first time, befuddled by frequent ensemble overacting and rapid-fire dialogue (often profane) that only serve to annoy.The film probably contains the most overacted ensemble in the history of the movies. Everyone overacts to the painfully embarrassing effect.Despite suffering the flaws, the movie is half-riveting and half- tedious. I can't decide which, but it is simultaneous. I noticed a few walkouts of the young adult moviegoers to return 15 minutes later, in the middle of the movie, completely missing the story, probably to their confusion arising from the short attention span.""American Hustle"" demands attention throughout to comprehend the plot with the dizzling turns and twists that even confound me as to the plausibility. It asks the audience to suspend disbelief momentarily, which is stretching the truth, typical of Russell's penchant for comical exaggeration that throws the allegation of the true story in question which is true and which is completely made up.The movie, being inane and implausible with the elaborate scam conspiracy followed by the police entrapment, reminds me of the cheesily produced television show with Jonathan Flake, ""Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction,"" which I recollect I saw at the turn of the century. That is now the staple of the Sunday morning cable programming with the marathon programming, which brought back memories.Watching the movie conclude, on a spectacular note despite the bizarre structure of the movie in terms of pacing and dialogue, with the insanely clever plot twist reminds of this television program.Pursuant to Russell's style in allowing freestyle improvisation, the movie is consequently strange and frequently off-color, that makes it a little boring to watch, trying to pay attention to the story without getting lost in the process.As aforesaid, everyone overacts, even the uncredited role of Robert De Niro, for what reason I wouldn't know. The director lets them act as they like, without the measure of control by both artists.It shows to the degree of shtick. Even Jennifer Lawrence overacts in this movie, in contrast to her tempered and nuanced acting roles, including her Oscar-winning role in the other Russell movie.I was fascinated by the constant action of the movie as directed, being freestyle but also formless that lend to the palpable tedium and confusion as the result of recklessness at the vain attempt to achieve the artistic value.There's not much to be said about Christian Bale being deliberately overweight, imitating Robert De Niro's Oscar-winning role in Raging Bull. Bale is a fine actor, but in this movie, he's forgettable, as is the guiltily overacted Bradley Cooper. (There is the scene towards the ending with Cooper that is so overacted it was weirdly off-putting.)The noteworthy stars of the movie are the quietly commanding character of a FBI field office director played by the (foul and frequently antagonistic) comic C.K. Louis and the ""is-she-British-or-is-she-not"" scam artist played by Amy Adams, who emoted superbly in vulnerable characterization without being phony deserving of an Oscar (like Jennifer Lawrence in another emotionally taut role), a departure in 180 degree turn from the innocuous Disney movie ""Enchanted"".Not a bad movie, but not a great movie either, blamed on the director's inability to maintain control, letting the actors go wild like mustangs, with the strange and non-linear structure, resulting in the incoherence and near incomprehensibility of the point of the movie.Overrated, but serves as a good study how not to screw up the production with freestyling, which may explain the lack of necessary disciplined filmmaking in artistic and technical collaboration. I know how editing works, being directly involved in work, but the structure is a mess. It took three editors to make ""American Hustle"" as close to coherence, and it almost doesn't come close, which may explain the nature of the rushed production.** 1/2",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"It weaves a fantastic gripping tale of fraudulence with colorful characters, dancing with the tune of greed.","It's truly a rare occasion to have such prominent cast in one movie, each capable of a leading role on their own, the amalgamation of these talents, coupled with extraordinary directing, make American Hustle a deceptively dark yet charming comedy. In a commentary on how far people are willing to use others for own selfish purpose, these illustrious characters seduce, lie and cheat in an orgy of deceit. It's ludicrous, self-deprecating while still able to be funnily relatable and thoroughly enjoyable.American Hustle is a story of two con artists, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosse (Amy Adams), who make a living by setting up small fraud businesses. Unfortunately for them, they are caught red-handed by an FBI agent Richard DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). Now faced with heavy charges, both have no choice but to aid the agent in capturing more high profile targets. The operation soon becomes out of control as they try to manipulate increasing amount of victims and also outmaneuver each other, while dangerous and powerful men caught whiff of the sting operation.Every time a scene plays out, the actors passionately perform at excellent caliber. Christian Bale transforms himself into almost a completely different person. He looks plumper, wears hair piece and struts with somewhat slouched posture, it's realistically impressive. He shows complacent cautious behavior to mask his sly ambitious side. I admittedly didn't recognize him at some points as he almost merges in the character. Bradley Cooper plays the suave agent, who is Irving's counterpart, brimming with confident and unbridled ambition. The way he portrays his character is explosively brazen, almost obsessively erratic in his endeavor.Amy Adams as the role of sensual mistress, trademarked by how unwilling she is on wearing bra, has another persona as Edith, the supposed British lady. She shifts between the roles so convincingly, weaving layers of lies with great British accent; she may very well elude the audience. Jennifer Lawrence plays Irving's overly defensive, disturbed and near batshit insane wife. She seems so broken with habitual reliance on dubious men, both using and being used by them. There is one scene where Adams and Lawrence loath each other with such malicious intensity, it's almost creepy to witness.I like the addition of Louis C.K. as the reluctant cop and DiMaso's supervisor; he brings organic humor to the table, mostly on his own character's expense. Jeremey Renner rocks a flamboyant haircut as the seemingly philanthropic mayor Carmine Polito. Sometimes Renner looks genuinely motivated to do good for his city, also rather too innocent to mingle with the rest of suspicious characters. Robert DeNiro, however, portrays an old mob boss, calculatingly dangerous in short time he's on-screen.Every minute of the movie practically boasts high level of talent, they are simply captivating, even as they desperately claw their ways by forging fictional version of themselves. Director David O. Russell succeeds in presenting these talents in near over-the-top scenes, which are fairly ridiculous but will make audience can't help but feeling there's a glitter of glamor on them. The movie is clever of its use of twist, although characters' personal struggles are still the essence.There lie few movies that can rival American Hustle in the quantity and quality of its actors. It weaves a fantastic gripping tale of fraudulence with colorful characters, dancing with the tune of greed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Extremely fun to watch...!,"I will try to say as little as possible about the plot and let you enjoy on your own. Story is set in year 1978. On the beginning of the picture we're introduced to out of shape but charismatic Irving Rosenfeld (played by Christian Bale), Sydney Prosser and her British accent (played by Amy Adams) and FBI agent Richie DiMaso (played by Bradley Cooper). Irving and Sydney are hustlers who... well, hustle to survive. But after a chain of events they end up being forced to help out FBI. How and why you will have to see for your self.Other notable characters are Irving's wife; Rosalyn Rosenfeld (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and Mayor Carmine Polito.I gotta say, this movie is extremely fun, really good and natural dialogues, interesting characters, great performances (everyone brought their A-Game to the table), some really good camera angles that serve the story... I can go on but i think i should stop now. It has this Scorsese/early PTA feel to it, you can pot quite a few homages to Goodfellas and Casino in this one. Some may even say that this one succeeded at being more Scorsese than Scorseses The Wolf of Wall Street, movie surrounded by a lot of controversy but is in my opinion better than kind of overrated American Hustle. Like a lot of movies it is influenced by, it is also very character driven and less plot driven, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have good plot with really good resolution. To some it may seem like it's unfocused at times, but to me it didn't matter because each and every character is a delight to watch on screen. All the actors had great chemistry with each other, especially Christian Bale and Amy Adams. And, don't let them fool you, this movie IS NOT A COMEDY!

Side Shows intended to take your attention away from many inherent flaws.,"What do you get when you put together accomplished actors like Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner and Robert De Niro? Answer – Not much.OK, another one. What do you get when you throw together Directors like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and Wes Anderson? Answer Forgettablefellas oops I mean ""American Hustle"", broadly speaking a poor imitation of ""Goodfellas"".Based on the mostly true details (there is a disclaimer to that exact effect, right at the beginning of the movie) of the well known ABSCAM case of late 70's, Director David O. Russell picks up actors from his previous movies (The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook) and also brings in Robert De Niro for a quick cameo appearance but fails to recreate any of the past magic. It is evident that Russell is heavily influenced by fast talking, profanity spewing, dysfunctional and flawed con men/women characters of Scorsese, Ritchie and Tarantino. The movie does have the scope of being ambitious, fun, entertaining, smart, darkly comic, sophisticated adult fare however it fails to live up to the hype and expectations because at the core of the movie is a weak and crumbly script. The narrative is uniformly murky and poorly paced, even incoherent at times.So what does Russell do? To keep the audience engaged he indulges in amateurish and pointless distractions (Jennifer Lawrence doing a cringe worthy imitation of Wing's rendition of ""Live and Let Die"" and many such examples.) I would love to see J Law appear in a musical in near future. Talking about the music score, there are many little gems here – Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Santana's Evil Ways, Led Zeppelin's What is and what should never be, Killer Papa was a rolling stone and others.But soon the viewer realizes that the movie is deliberately trying to distract you (garish costume, smelly nail polish, boob show necklines, fake accents, over the top hair-do's, side stories et al) as it has very little to offer you by way of substance. But to give credit where it is due, Russell keeps the movie visually engaging what with overall production design, coiffure hairstyles, garish costumes and some funky 70's music.However, what truly stands out in the movie is its two lead female characters – Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence. Both are absolutely glorious, conniving, terrifying, manipulative, sexy and spectacular all the way. Adams has an edge over Lawrence. While regrettably, Lawrence does not get enough screen time, Adams' is a more nuanced character with a lot more screen time. Adams takes her character and does magic with it infusing it with flesh, charm, vulnerability and her own personal touch. ""American Hustle"" is owned by Amy Adams. This is probably her best performance ever. Amy Adams is definitely the front runner for Academy Award for Best Actress (at the time of writing this review she had already picked up a Golden Globe).While ""American Hustle"" disappoints sorely from a story, script and direction point of view it still managed to hold my attention on the basis of its entertaining characters and its visually appealing look and feel.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The cast absolutely rocks,"what you have is one of the best performances of the recent times by the ""entire"" cast (not just couple of them). Christian Bale is the master of makeover and is so much into character and at times hard to believe that the same guy played the famous caped crusader. Amy Adams was fabulous in ""The Master"" and is completely convincing as a conniving ruthless seductress. Jennifer Lawrence is adorable, playing that crazy, eccentric and loud mouthed wife - she might be the best female actor to have happened in last few years and next decade or so belongs to her. Bradley Cooper is great with his funny hair playing that over-zealous fed who wants to shake the whole system. I might be stretching it, but Renner has that aura of Joe Pesci. I absolutely loved everyone in the movie.For me the story/plot was not the most original of all. If you have seen many of these, you know how it is going to end and who is gonna win. Sometimes, the predictable trying too hard with the cover of unpredictability (and all those twists and turns) can be off-putting. But, script is extremely tight and gripping. The chemistry between all the characters is almost natural. The dialogues are well thought and are timely hilarious. The camera and lighting, the costumes, hair-dos all take you to that 70-80s era.

For a movie about a con-men and a sting, it's relatively geologic in it's timing. Music is perfect (no exaggeration. Perfect=The exact fit, more than flawless). Bale gives a heartful performance like always, Cooper shows his comic chops but Adams is the best, showing her range. Lawrence's part is overstated in the trailer, but nonetheless and excellent catalyst for trouble, with hilarious timing to boot.

"Slick, smart, quirk, irreverent, decadent... it tries desperately to be!","I don't know if I have a bigger problem with O' Russell's films or the ecstatic reception they meet. His last film I saw was ""The Fighter"", and while I didn't dislike it, I couldn't get all the praise, it was a passable movie with solid acting but too many loose ends to make the whole experience satisfying. Yet this director made the extraordinary achievement to have two movies in a row nominated in all four major categories, which has never been done since ""Reds"", in 1981. I'll check ""Silver Linings Playbook"" soon, but from what I discovered in ""American Hustle"", what stands for great acting is the capability to act weird and over the top while in super disco disguises, well, then give a honorary Oscar to the wardrobe and that'll be enough.But the film is supposed to be a comedy!And I'm sorry but it is NOT obvious that the film is a comedy, as a matter of fact, the tone of the story goes all over the map and you can't really figure out whether it tries to be a lighthearted con-tale or some multi-layered character study. If it's a comedy in the sense that we shouldn't take it seriously, well, that doesn't say much about the film. But it could have been both funny and serious, this is not the hardest stunt a film can achieve, especially with a good script, but David O'Russell goes in too many directions for the film's own good. In the end, too many scenes, too many improvisations, too many jump cuts and cheap turns and twists, made the experience of watching the film extremely disorienting.Speaking for myself, just when I started to get emotionally hooked to Amy Adams' Sydney (and her chemistry with Christian Bale's Rosenfeld), there had to be the character played by Jennifer Lawrence popping up and getting increasingly 'important' in the plot. And this sassy bitch, obviously meant as a comic relief, would even get on Freud's nerves. As if it wasn't messy enough, you've got someone who's obviously not part of the solution, and keeps on nagging and shouting.. well, if that's supposed to be funny, just give me drama. And don't get me started on the ""Live and Let Die"" part.I know the music is an inevitable element when you make a period piece, and on that level, O'Russel has a pretty good taste in music, but music feels like noises superposed to other noises, not just a background. Now, it is obvious that this is a wannabe Goodfellas and Casino, but it turns a rather banal scheme into something of labyrinthine complexity, just to milk the acting of the four stars and justify the awards nominations. I'm pretty sure that each of these characters were interesting on their own, but in terms of effects, they all cancel each other, we can't individually root for them, since they all spend their time acting like jerks, trying to outsmart each other and win the 'quirkiest character' contest. If you make a film about swindlers, a minimum of likability is vital, otherwise, to the degree that you'll start to understand what's going on, you won't really care for the outcome.It's not about having likable characters as morally right but providing enough perspective on their lives so you ca genuinely care for them. And this is why ""Goodfellas"", or ""The Sting"", are still acclaimed masterpieces, first, these films are easier to follow without being ""less complex"" than American Hustle. But more than that, you have a clear view on Henry Hill's backstory and you see why Hooker wants to get Lonnegan. In ""American Hustle"",, we have to assume that Irvin and Sidney had no other options in their lives, and that Rosalyn was actually smarter than her husband, the film asks us to take many things for granted, which could have been possible if the editing wasn't so deliberately chaotic. It's a pity because some parts were nothing short of cinematic brilliance. I, for one thing, loved the friendship subplot between Carmine (Renner) and Bale, culminating with that funny 'oven' scene. And it's very revealing that the only one who didn't get any award buzz was Renner, the one who played a straight and realistic character.It's like acting was elevated to some carnival level. All the others were just dressed as if they were invited to a 70's themed party and spent their time shouting and overacting, Amy Adams being the constant subject to an obvious fetishist cameraman while baby-faced Lawrence was forcing herself to convince us she was some mature thirty-something woman. And I know many directors have their darlings, but it was too distracting to see the same actors again playing again for the same director no matter how chameleonic or versatile they are, it is distracting. Renner was the good thing about the film, so was Bale to a certain extent, and the last twenty minutes were good but not as emotionally rewarding as they should have been if the rest of the film matched that quality. Maybe there's something to blame on the directing, editing, or storytelling, or maybe I'm an idiot who doesn't get the brilliance of O'Russell.But there was a similar film directed the same year, a co-nominee named ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", it was a wannabe ""Goodfellas"" too, but as Hitchcock would say, self-plagiarizing is style. And there's another thing that gives the edge to ""Wolf"", it focused on one main character, and two supporting ones, and Leo was the pillar, the film could get over the top, it never lost its focus. O'Russell wanted to pull a Scorsese style-wise, but it's like he was intoxicated by the exuberance of his characters and the flashiness of the 70's setting. That he convinced the world this was a masterpiece is perhaps more fascinating than the titular hustle.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle,"I was lucky enough to be able to see American Hustle, twice in theatres and each viewing made me like and appreciate the film even more. Because there is often so much going on in this film, I feel that most people would probably do better with a second viewing as I did, as I understood things better, picked up on more things and also appreciated the sense of humour the film has as well as ultimately enjoying it a lot more than on my first viewing. I still liked the film the first time I saw it, but after a second viewing I can safely say that it was one of my favourite films of 2013. In the wrong hands this film could have been your average Hollywood type grifter and con man film, but talent like David O. Russell and his amazing cast make it ever so much more than that. The original screenplay by O. Russell and Eric Singer is brilliant. I loved the way it combined the crime elements of the story as well as the drama and some of the most delectably offbeat humour, some of the best I have seen in awhile and I smiled and laughed out loud many times during the film. It's one of the more original and unique films of this year and that is one of the reasons I liked it so much. Here is a film where you have some very strong components that all seem to work to perfection. You have great acting from the main cast right down to the supporting characters. They are all great in their roles here and with a lot of these characters they have been given a couple of more dimensions than your usual Hollywood characters, so there is more to them than you may think and after the film is over and you have thought about it for awhile, you really start to appreciate everything this cast and crew did with these characters because they are so interesting, offbeat and sometimes charming at the same time. Once you piece the entire film together after you have seen it, it really makes you appreciate everything that went into it with the great writing, cast and directing. I love when you have a film such as this where the writing is so sharp and you have an excellent team of actors knocking their performances out of the ball park and delivering top notch material to already top notch writing. It is often a joy to watch. I enjoyed the 1970's setting of the film with the interior and exterior shots of buildings, the flashy clothes the characters wear and the selection of pop and rock songs that were popular at that time, which play in the film's background. All of it helped enhance the mood and made you believe that either it was the 70's, or you were watching a film from that time. I also really liked the stylish nature of the film's cinematography and direction. There were a number of camera shots and editing that I really enjoyed and found both interesting in a visual kind of way, but it also gave the film style and it's own unique way of getting this story across. I personally feel that director David O. Russell, is on a hot streak. I really enjoyed I Heart Huckabees, when I saw it back in 2004 and I loved The Fighter and readers of my reviews will know that Silver Linings Playbook, was one of my top 3 films of last year. This is a guy who can tell an excellent story and gets the best possible acting out of his actors. Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar last year for Silver Linings Playbook, and I have no doubt that she will be nominated for her performance this year in American Hustle. All the performances in this are awards worthy, it has just been an impressive year and Lawrence, is so far the only for sure lock as far as awards nominations go, but the whole cast is absolutely fantastic here. At one point I read that David O. Russell, was considering doing a biopic of cult director Russ Meyer, but I have not seen, or heard any more about that project. Seeing what he could do here with his humour and take on the 1970's, I would personally love to see that film get made, being a personal fan of Russ Meyer and now of David O. Russell as well. I am sure however that whatever his next film is, that it will be a hit because he seems to be on a hot streak with no signs of slowing down. As it stands, American Hustle is one of the most original and fun films of 2013 and I recommend if you have a chance to see it more than once as I did, because you'll appreciate it even more and I think that is the way the film was meant to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Stylish Screwball Crime Comedy,"""American Hustle"" is all about deception. Every character is hiding something from every other character, manipulating their relationships to get what they want. On top of this, there seems to be trickery of the film itself on the audience. Is this a crime/heist film? Yesbut only just. Above the hustle and bustle of the plot is a wonderful array of bumbling characters and neurotic screwball-esque dialogue that is sorely missing in our modern day Cineplex's. In the end, we get a crime-comedy-drama that is full of laughsintense, unsettling laughs. Nostalgia for the 1970s is extremely thick here, not just in the costuming and set pieces, but in the filmmaking itself. Yes, the style and music are perfect in putting us within the era, but even the camera work, editing, and jazzy directing scream of ""Mean Streets"" era-Scorsese. Russell struggles at times with some of the potential convolutedness of the lies, but this is minor. Lucky for us, Russell can pair this madcap style with some great touches of reality, grounding us back in the mundane as we are facing the insane. However, Russell is barely interested in the plot or even the real life Abscam scandal. He is interested in quick and brilliantly repetitive dialogue. He is interested in tone and style. He is interested in giving his actors surprising and authentic characters, and then letting them playand play they do. Everyone brings their A-game, especially Cooper, Bale and Lawrence who are truly outstanding, hilarious, and convincing. This is must-see awards season viewingbut it will also just be an entertaining and engaging night at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Prepare to get Hustled.,"There are no spoilers in my review:I have never been so disappointed in a film. With all the hype, I expected another House of Games (1987) or Grifter (1990) or maybe a hard edged drama like The Departed. Instead I saw a very boring film that had no idea what it was. Before I went in, I read that it was a drama. Others said a comedy. Others said a dark comedy. It attempted to be all of the above and succeeded at none. The movie was so boring, after 45 minutes I started to watch the reactions of the viewers around me in the packed theater. It was very telling and far more entertaining than the movie. Over and over, we would be presented a dramatic scene with deep consequences to the plot and to the characters that is then immediately followed by what was supposed to be a funny scene. For example, we have a deep complex scene of someone worried he is going to get killed at anytime. Well done writing and scene. You'll be invested. It's then IMMEDIATELY followed by a housewife cleaning her house while humorously singing and dancing to the song ""Live & Let Die."" Do you laugh? What just happened? At the very end of the scene when you realize the director is holding up the ""laugh"" sign, you uneasily chuckle- just a little. In another scene, you have a character do harm to his superior. The superior is beaten badly. Not only is the subordinate not punished, it's played for laughs. Not knowing what reaction I was supposed to have (laugh, cry, be concerned, be worried) actually made my stomach queasy - and I eat habaneros for breakfast! I said several times to the people I was with that this is boring and bad and made no sense. This is not well done. They all agreed. The ending and wrap up will leave you in awe at its lacking.So much talent and potential wasted.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

If you've seen this film and you haven't seen Goodfellas, rent it. Goodfellas blows this movie completely out of the water. Hustle is derivative, uninspired, brimming with one-dimensional acting. The music felt intrusive and too on the nose (although most of us liked the songs themselves). Granted, Bale is always at the top of his game, but the rest of the cast? Meh. We all did agree, though, that Louis C. K. actually felt like a real character. The set design was exceptional. But the costumes, hair, felt too ""perfect"" for the times depicted.

Not that good.,I've heard nothing but praise for this movie but to be honest I don't get all the hype for this film. It starts slow by introducing us to each character and gradually it improves into the second half of the movie. The performances were really good but the story just fell flat. The comedy part of the movie wasn't funny and the run time was a bit to long. True story or not I found myself bored with the movie at time's. If it wasn't for the cast in this movie it would've been god awful. Giving it a six is being generous. Even the ending couldn't save this movie.

For me, the movie missed something. I can't really say what exactly, the word 'action' is not right, but I don't know how to say it another way.Several times during the movie I found myself a bit bored. Lots and lots of dialogues, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but just is not something I am a big fan of. Of course I did not go to this movie with the mindset of an action-thriller, but still I missed some tension during the film.I, however, did really like the end of the movie. I won't go in details but it was really well written. Because of the 'boring parts' I rated this movie with 7 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I would have never recognized Christian Bale, or Elisabeth Rohm. Jennifer Lawrence had to dig deep for her inner white trash sleaze, and she was remarkable.

Acting buffet,"David O. Russell, returns with his ensemble cast from his previous 2 films, The Fighter & Silver Linings Playbook. So we have Christian Bale & Amy Adams returning from 2010, whilst Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro (yes don't miss his cameo) from last year's Oscar winner.Bradley Cooper reprises his role as executive producer, after the successful Limitless.Set in 1978, New York, this ABSCAM inspired story, moves with local small time dry cleaner-cum-glass vendor-cum- con artist, Irving Rosenfield (Bale) and his new found associate-cum-lover Sydney Prosser (Adams). After being busted by FBI Agent, Richie DiMaso (Cooper), the duo are forced into hunting white collar criminals as a pay off. There begins the hunt, starting with Mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) as bait to nab the politicians on the take.Like Russell's previous 2 films, the film, inspite of having a strong story, is run completely by 2 things...a strong screenplay and even stronger all round performances! Coupled with excellent camera-work by Linus Sandgren and music by Danny Elfman, you can feel the characters' emotions on screen, be it the nervousness of wannabe DiMaso or the vulnerability of the supercon Irving!As a matter of fact, you can feel the terror by just looking at De Niro's eyes, in the party table scene, nearly expecting him to chop off a head or two.Co- Written by Eric Warren Singer and Russell, the film has unleashes, yes you read right, unleashes its primary 4 characters at one go, hitting us like a wasabi shot! Just by the time you have absorbed the 4, you get hit by the unpredictable, volatile, voluptuous Rosalyn (Lawrence).Russell takes the cast of Soderbergh, the narrative style of Scorsese, the dryness of the Coen Brothers, shakes it all up, adds his sour humour and presents a cocktail which will hit you like a shot!Bale, in yet another physically transformed role, makes no bones to flaunt his paunch and his elaborate combover. As a matter of fact, he shifts between the role of the completely in control person in the room to the least in control, especially while confronting Rosalyn, with such ease.Adams as the sexy sultress, is the game changer in the film. Her constantly shifting loyalties and heartburns, make her the least trustworthy character in the film. not once will you feel pity for her, but yes, you will always be wary whilst she is on screen.Cooper as the loudmouth, fast talking, wannabe is simply top notch. Whilst his scene with his mother, sums up his character's ambition, it are the scenes with his boss, Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K., in a fantastic performance) that add the actual humour in the film. The Ice fishing story is sure to get your goat.Alessandro Nivola as Thorsen's boss, the guy we all remember as Pollux Troy from Face / Off is a pleasure to see.Jeremey Renner, the new entrant to the Russell team, portrays the family man Polito with super finesse. You feel for him throughout his entrapment and wish that there was some where you could redeem him, cos he is the only guy in the entire plot who has his heart in the right place and for the right cause too. The treatment that Renner gets doled out with, is a realistic portrayal of life by Russell, that not necessarily that the good guy will win in the end.Jennifer Lawrence, after the mega successful Catching Fire, delivers yet another knock out of a performance. Although the least in terms of screen space and the last of the main entrants to come on screen, she lights up the screen with fire, literally, whenever she comes. Her childish yet vampish of a wife attitude makes you want to smack and hug her at the same time!Russell has developed a track record of winning the acting accolades for both his last ventures, Bale and Melissa Leo for The Fighter and Lawrence for SLP.Definitely a movie worth your time at the theatres, for repeated viewing and a worthy contender at the Oscars!Does it have The Y Factor : YESRating : 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Maybe I was conned?,"When you see the trailers and posters the first thing you notice about American Hustle is how many nominations it has including best picture at the Golden Globes! So it's quite hard to go in with low expectations.The film starts with a slow almost boring pace and the only thing that holds your attention is the superb acting performances particularly from Christian Bale and ​Bradley Cooper. Yes it is funny and rather slick but it seems the set up of the story is just rather dull and for some lazy reason the scriptwriter chooses the characters to narrate for nearly half an hour. I found myself wondering if I was watching a nature programme rather than a film.However, the writer then let's the characters come to life and the film finally gets going, the pace picks up and the acting becomes even better. As Bale's character Irving and Amy Adam's character Sydney go deeper and deeper into the world of 'conning' you begin to join them in this unpredictable, dangerous world. Cooper who plays Richie DiMaso is a cop blackmailing them into framing some very dangerous people!Overall it's a good film but definitely not worthy of the best picture nomination. The acting however is. Bale is superb but to be honest Cooper totally steals the show, and we shouldn't forget Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence who are both exceptional.A fun and enthralling film but maybe needs a re-cut on the first 30 minutes!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Confusing Story and Great Performances,"American Hustle follows two con men who are caught by an FBI agent who decides to use them to catch corrupt politicians.The movie features an all-star cast, and most every one of them is worth mentioning. Bradley Cooper is fine, probably the worst performance of the bunch. Not to say he's bad, but he doesn't stand out. Same with Amy Adams, I can't tell if it's her acting style or what, but she was just fine in this movie. She brought more to the table than Cooper, but not much more. Jeremy Renner is good, but in my opinion the two best are Jennifer Lawrence and Christian Bale. Lawrence is fun to watch on-screen, as is her character. She had a level of depth to her especially that I just really enjoyed watching. Christian Bale, on the other hand, is magnificent. He's the most convincing and intriguing character of them all, and he pulls it off beautifully.The movie looks beautiful as well. The colors, the clothing, the settings, everything looks great. I don't know how accurate it is, but I don't really care. It looked great.One of my only gripes, however, is the story. It's not that it's bad, but it's one of those movies that you have to pay extra attention to to understand. I didn't actually understand what the characters were trying to accomplish until they'd accomplished it, at which point it made sense but it also took a while. Would I have caught on if I'd paid more attention? Probably. Which is why I'll definitely be seeing this one again. Chances are I went in with the wrong expectations.Overall American Hustle is a good movie. The characters are interesting and well-played, the actors range from good to amazing, and the movie as a whole looks great.

An historic event altered into a good screwball thriller.,"Real facts stories always have attracted filmmakers. Historic tales offer some feeling of truth to the cinema stories. Always will be controversy among moviegoers about fidelity and treason to the historical truth. Whenever a historical person o era is portraits somebody will question the fidelity to the facts. Warren Beatty was probably aware of this and populated REDS with interviews to a gallery of real people, as they were at the real time of the movie-making. They were present, somehow, during the life of John Reed. They commented about those times with their own thoughts. Watergate turned to be a wonderful thriller about the work of two journalists and not about Nixon. Both journalists were credited with William Goldman as responsible by the script. Serious, committed filmmakers have realized good movies out of historic events and moviegoers have shown to be attracted by them. Actual facts give a structural base to the script, a generating point from where it could come up an interesting, brilliant movie. Now the important thing in this genre is to deeply develop such factual themes and relate them to the movie story, which by now will probably become tinted with the filmmaker's ideas. American hustle has been successful in processing the material of a once newsworthy event from late 70,s early 80, which now is not totally installed in the country's collective memory. The real Abscam was in itself an official cover operation and its planning notes could have been the synopsis of a B-spy movie. American hustle used the blueprint of the scam as the movie line and from it created a cast of characters and sub-plots very complex, rare and chaotic converted into a web frame from where develops a story that is credible thanks to the intelligent construction of scenes with characters moving and talking organically and in unison with the screwball spirit of the story. Apparently there was a real Irving (Bale character) and a real mayor Polito (Renner character) who were functional to the factual story both with personal traits and history to nurture these great actors' work but the final product was the task of profoundly creative study of characters and its integration to the story. Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams are extremely accurate in their roles. Bradley Cooper had a great composition of a FBI agent unlike to most typical portraits of Intel agents. He is success- hungry, probably to vindicate his own history as a person and have not scruples and little dignity in achieving the goals he is setting for him and the operation. At one point early in the movie we have forgotten the actual history and we are immersed into a movie rich in textured characters and attracting script with an organic discourse of tension and fear, going much faster and complicated than the characters and spectators have asked for. The film's look expresses with precision an era and an event that it is not to far removed in time. David O. Russell was able to organize a chaotic storytelling by keeping a consistent atmosphere directing a cast of odd characters in a space that is dangerously edgy. As moviegoers we sense the climate and fell the uncertainty of the unknown next step. American hustle is a film that proposed an unusual historic thriller and it was accomplished.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

They might be good and well rated, but I still find them boring at points. So I wasn't expecting much. As David O Russell say, he only like characters and hates plots, it is fairly evident in this venture of his. The film is totally character driven with some excellent performances, whereas the plot seems a little messed up and haphazard especially in the first half. The comic moments were rare and only came with Jennifer.Along with excellent directing and acting, the film has eye catchy costumes and hairstyling, particularly Amy's dresses and Lawrence's hair.

Denial leads to destruction, Unwillingness to change leads to loss, and Arrogance leads to destruction are the premises I found that were trying to be portrayed through this movie and its characters.

Why should I care that the story is slow to get going and ultimately predictable?

To her credit, she does 'eccentric' really well.For gosh sake - Louis CK?

Top of the Line Hustle Film - American Hustle,"I am a sucker for hustle films; including classics like House of Games, 21, and others. Scams, when well-done, can be very entertaining. Scam artists, on the other hand, are a bit more complex. American Hustle covers the ABSCAM sting operation of the FBI in the late 1970s. It may not be completely historically accurate, but we are not watching films for history lessons, we are watching them to be entertained. If we get some history from them; then that is just a bonus. The entire cast, including all the secondary actors, do a superb job of convincing us they are who they pretend to be. The cameo by Robert DiNero is excellent as well. One lesson learned from this film is that it is never wise to try and out-hustle a hustler. You will see what I mean when you view the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Entertaining, but so predictable","'American Hustle' tells the story of a pair of con-men induced to help the FBI trap some bigger fish, a shaggy dog story told mostly straight and with some genuinely funny moments. It also features explanatory voice-overs, a heavy (1970s) period soundtrack and a final twist I found underwhelming, to say the least, first of all because if you've seen any conman movies before, the double-cross is only to be expected, but secondly because the film is so obviously playing for entertainment, and makes little attempt to lure the viewer into the trap. And indeed it is entertaining, albeit in a rather predictable way - but it falls well short of the standard of Mamet's 'House of Games', or even 'The Sting'.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great idea and outstanding performances wasted in an attempt to create drama and effect,"In this movie, David O. Russel puts together a terrific cast in a thrilling and rather dramatic adventure based around love, lust, power and most importantly, cons.My problem with this movie is the fact that it is way too focused on showing all the different relationships' problems and the evolution of these relationships throughout the movie. Therefore, it sacrifices potential comedy or action (the movie lacks both of these in my opinion) for unnecessary drama.I was very disappointed that Jennifer Lawrence didn't get more scenes as obviously I think she is an amazing actress but also because her character was the only truly comic one and she got me at least smiling in each and everyone of her scenes. I could say the same for Robert de Niro but at least it fits his character to not appear in lots of scenes.To summarize, a great movie with interesting characters but brought down by poor storytelling and a slow pace.

Read one of the ""trivia facts"" stating that wardrobe made several duplicate dresses for Lawrence to wear because she liked to eat Doritos and stained her wardrobe.

Jennifer Lawrence the best reason to see this,"Fresh from winning awards at the Golden Globes - including Best Comedy, this didn't really work for me - especially not as a comedy.American HUSTLE wants to be a sort of update of THE STING. But what THE STING had, in abundance, was a deftness of touch which HUSTLE only serves up in fits and starts. It gets off to a slow burn and it's a half-hour too long. Christian Bale is clearly trying to outdo John Travolta's comic sleazeball in PULP FICTION, but although his predicament is funny, his performance isn't. Bradley Cooper relies too much on his looks and misses the chance to be entertaining as well as gorgeous.The women are wonderful, as the Golden Globes have recognized, but I would have given the Best Actress award to Jennifer Lawrence rather than Amy Adams: Lawrence's blonde bimbo is in the league of those memorably fruity creations served up by the late great Madeline Kahn. The supporting men outshine the stars, especially Jeremy Renner as Mayor Carmine, venal rather than corrupt, a hugely likable 'Jack-the-lad'. Robert de Niro delivers an uncredited cameo as the 'Boss of Bosses', neatly spoofing Don Vito Corleone.There's a non-stop soundtrack of 70s disco and soul hits which helps carry the movie past some of its longueurs. Costumes and cinematography are ace, but for my money American HUSTLE just doesn't come off as a comedy. It's not as stylish as THE STING, which had pitch-perfect performances from its male stars, and it lacks the 'gothic' touches that allowed PULP FICTION to provide a whole new definition of the crime- caper movie.Jennifer Lawrence is the best reason to see HUSTLE. If she was up against Cate Blanchett in the Oscars (where there can only be one Best Actress), it would be a close call.

Casey's Movie Mania: American HUSTLE (2013),"The acting ensemble is a joy to watch for, with a few lively sparks here and there in this entertaining but uneven crime drama.In just a year after writer-director David O. Russell hits jackpot with his winning quirky comedy SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, he's back with the highly-anticipated American HUSTLE -- a movie which has already receiving tons of accolades from many critics and even hailed as one of the Oscar frontrunners come next year.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Loosely inspired from the FBI ABSCAM operation in the late '70s/early '80s (hence the opening title card that reads ""Some of this actually happened""), American HUSTLE first introduces Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), a potbellied owner of New Jersey dry-cleaning stores who is also a slick con man. He meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party where they instantly falls for each other and ends up working together to con people's money with their elaborate scheme. They become so famous that one day they get caught red-handed by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). Instead of putting Irving and Sydney to jail, Richie uses them to help him capture the New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) as well as other corrupted congressmen and mobsters for bribery.THE GOOD STUFFI'm particular loved the way how David O. Russell incorporated various storytelling techniques such as flashbacks and voice-over narrations to introduce his four major characters -- Christian Bale's Irving Rosenfeld, Amy Adams' Sydney Prosser, Bradley Cooper's Richie DiMaso and Jeremy Renner's Carmine Polito -- in a lively Martin Scorsese-like filmmaking style. Technical-wise, American HUSTLE -- from Linus Sandgren's fluid camera-work, excellent song choices (e.g. America's A Horse with No Name and Wings' Live and Let Die), and right down to the meticulous re-creation of the 1970s location settings, hairstyles and flamboyant wardrobes -- is top notch.But it was the actors that shines here the most. Christian Bale, who previously collaborated with David O. Russell in 2010's THE FIGHTER (which won him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), looks almost unrecognizable behind his sunglasses, large belly and combover. It's refreshing to watch Bale in a laidback and warm performance that doesn't requires him to brood all the time like most of his usual roles in many other movies. Amy Adams is captivating who cleverly alternates her dual personalities -- one is Sydney, and another one is a British character named Lady Edith Greensly -- in such graceful manner. Bradley Cooper is energetic as FBI agent Richie DiMaso, while Jeremy Renner delivers a likable performance as the New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito. Finally, the biggest scene stealer here is Jennifer Lawrence, who excels in her mesmerizing and showy performance as Irving's estranged wife, Rosalyn.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The hilarious scene where Rosalyn quarrels with Irving over a broken microwave, and the tense moment where Rosalyn and Sydney comes face to face together.THE BAD STUFFAs a crime drama about deception and duplicity, it's kind of odd that David O. Russell and his screenwriter Eric Warren Singer doesn't deliver much in the subject matter, especially when everything is stripped down in mostly all-too-lightweight manner. The story feels lackluster while the movie takes time to find its proper footing after the wobbly first hour (apart from its lively opening scene).FINAL WORDSWhile American HUSTLE is hardly a great movie that I hoped for (which is definitely not in the same league with David O. Russell's previous two efforts, THE FIGHTER and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK), it remains a worthwhile entertainment best seen for its colorful cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle (2013),"Directed by David O. Russell. Starring Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer Lawrence, Louis C.K., Jack Huston, Shea Whigham, Alessandro Nivola, Robert De Niro, Michael Peña, Elizabeth Röhm. (R)After getting busted by the FBI, con artists Bale and Adams are forced to work with volatile agent Cooper so he can make additional arrests, including the mayor of Camden, NJ (Renner). Loosely based on the ABSCAM sting scandal of the late 70s, the film opens with the message: ""Some of this actually happened,"" meaning that it's more honest than most other Hollywood true stories about how a lot of it has been changed, condensed and outright invented for the sake of a good show. And for the most part, it is a good show; a bit too ungainly in its narrative sprawl--encompassing not just the complex nature of the operation, but also the messy lives that the characters navigate on a daily basis (repeated scenes of jealousy get redundant after a while)--but smart dialogue and the gaudy/glitzy production maintain interest all the way. Top-notch ensemble cast delivers, especially Cooper and Adams, though the real star of the film is the men's hairstyles, some of the (intentionally) worst one would find in a major motion picture. De Niro went unbilled for his small role as a mafioso who gets involved in the swindle.80/100",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A film on drugs. But sub par drugs... Potentially just sugar?,"American Hustle is a film on drugs. But sub par drugsPotentially just sugar?Its hyperactivity sweats fun. So much FUN, that I sunk into a jealousy suffused funk. The on screen action jarred with my viewing experience. O'Russell is a connoisseur of artificial emotional explosions. We're served an I-can't-count-how-many-course meal of undiluted synthesis; A thematic on screen orgy. And yes it was that uncomfortable (Disclaimer- I do NOT speak from experience). The incessant barrage of bluntly delivered ""Oh hey this is fake"" was exasperating. The pinnacle of this irony contoured falsity was reached in a kiss under the coats scene. Plastic coat wrappings swirled around lovers in a delirium drenched dreamlike sequence. It was pretty. But the mid scene punctuation of ""I felt I could be myself"" was too cheeky. A sneaky tear may have been shed at the deathbed of subtlety. And this was just ten minutes in Point of irritation number two: The acting. Primarily, Bale was miscast. Even the almighty accrual of a gut failed to veil his uncomfortable knowledge of this. He portrayed his character without any discernible emotional attachment. It was insipid. However, 'un amigo mío' argued that this brought a childlike quality to the performanceNO. A child could not claim such a curiously botoxed style of acting. Similarly, Cooper well he was just Cooper, and the hair didn't make me laugh. Yet O'Russell's smothering presence was most acutely felt with the actresses. Amy Adams is talented (Go watch Junebug ye naysayers!); this talent was felt. And then O'Russell decides to detract from the delectable ambiguity of her character, tossing in a cheap British accent, Cunnilingus gags (I know) and banning the use of any dress which didn't exhibit TITS. And trust me that mandated capitalisation. Later, he doubles back and decides to abandon any provocative murkiness at all and reduce her role to template. Jennifer Lawrence's seething frailty was also asphyxiated by O'Russell's infatuation with everything hyperbolic. But hey, at least she looked like she had FUN. But not as much fun as anyone in Goodfellas, to which this farcical Xerox treads too close. Although hold up every one, am I being too mean? Perhaps. I suppose I should list some more balanced points; the score was phenomenal. The attention devoted to Ellington's Jeep's Blues is very much merited; it's an addictive brassy little number. And the music is only surpassed by the zealous recreation of the fashion, furniture and feathered locks. No doubt producers are currently embroiled in legal battles denying that the volume of hairspray used on set will hasten global warming (GO TEAM GREENPEACE!). American Hustle is flawed and I begrudge it for trying so overtly hard BUT, if only to gauge the depth of my bemusement that this is the bookies Oscars darling, you must book a cinema ticket.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Quite an experience.,"I'd heard lots about this film but never seen it until it popped up on TV the other night. The plot (such as it was) sounded intriguing, so we cracked a bottle of wine and settled down to watch. It quickly sucked us in, but we had great difficulty following the dialogue due to some of the actors gabbling and mumbling their lines. My wife nodded off, but I decided to stay with it for the sheer spectacle and drama as the set-pieces and the music came together to make an almost hypnotic experience. Incredible, and at the end of the picture I was so wound up by the experience that I woke up my wife to tell her she'd missed a real treat. I'd give it 10, but the difficulties with the incomprehensible dialogue mark it down. It may be an English/American thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

That movie grabbed me, it inspired me, and reeled me in.. I can't say the same for Silver Linings Playbook or this one. I might give David O. Russel another try in the future.. Only if he uses Christian Bale again but that's about it. In the end, this movie was a big let down for me. With all the raving reviews around it, i expected more.

"Good look at the real life world of scandal, bribes, corruption, and greed with ever lasting power struggle.","""American Hustle"" is one of those movies that when you watch you feel entertained and fresh still you feel a little sour and down to earth after you see what the world of greed and power struggle can do to people as each person and every organization is full of corruption and must figure out their own way and methods to survive. Based on the real life scandals of the 1970's mid to late of the 10 year period in New Jersey a con man named Irving Rosenfeld(Christian Bale)meets up with a sexy social kitten Sydney Prosser(in Amy Adams's best and most sexy role)and together they form a team that lures scandal and con games to make money for them as each and every way each scam is tied to different organizations and cruel underworlds. Even when FBI agent Richie Dimaso(Bradley Cooper)enters the investigation he joins the team with a plan to oddly enough set up a crooked and corrupt politician and that's a New Jersey city mayor named Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and you guessed with politics it's dirty laundry that involves power brokers and the mafia. All along Rosalyn Rosenfeld(Jennifer Lawrence)the wife of crime king Irving just drinks up her pain and sorrow of sin in distilled spirits. Overall ""American Hustle"" rings true to life as every person is for him or her it's a way of life with greed, corruption and scandal as director David O.

I have seen this film 3 times and I still don't fully understand the plot...,"If ask me to piece together the plot from point A to point B I don't think I could do it. I am still not entirely sure when and if characters are being sincere. I am not convinced that the entire film isn't just a giant cheat. None of this matters through because this is a film of moments; of scenes and atmosphere onto itself. It is a film where each sequence is given the proper time to breath and it is delightful to being involved with being conned. It goes without saying that it is a very funny film.Obviously the acting is the best part of the film. Each of the principles, include Renner, gives transfigured performance. Bale is at his slimy and most invisible best. Cooper needs to do more comedy; he is a great jerk in this. Lawrence continues to be the most interesting person when she is on screen. And Adams is utterly unrecognizable. This is a film that patches up some of the weaknesses in the writing by cast the right performers all working at the top of their game. I almost want a sequel just because the characters stand apart from the film itself.Now don't get me wrong. The film's over look and feel are great. The 70's have been done a lot but Russell and his team manage to find a really cool slice of the decade that is obliviously 70's but is still different.

Balding Batman,"American Hustle is a pretty good crime/con caper, but I can't go on without mentioning Christian 'greatest Batman ever' Bale's getup. He looks truly ridiculous. However, this is totally intentional, as he plays someone as far away from Bruce Wayne as he's ever likely to get (his hairpiece alone deserves its own credit at the end of the film). Bale plays a conman, operating in the swinging seventies with his lover (behind his wife's back, by the way), Amy Adams. They're happily scamming away when the fall foul to FBI Agent, Bradley Cooper (with almost as great seventies hair as Bale, only more of it). To keep them out of prison, he enlists their help setting up a scam to catch the big, political fish with their fins in the proverbial cookie jar.It's fair to say that things don't go according to plan (for anyone!). And, what you're left with is watching all the main leads doing their best to stay one step ahead of those who they're trying to rip off, while also staying one step ahead of each other, before finally staying one step ahead of anyone who might be trying to put a bullet in the back of their heads.When you get a film with a fair amount of main characters (all vying to make their mark on the picture), you get more plot lines than your average ninety minute movie. Therefore, you have to stay focused to work out who's currently double-crossing who. Plus, despite all the A-list leads giving naturally excellent performances, it doesn't mean you'll go away actually liking any of them. It's hard to find too much sympathy for people who make their living ripping others off. Even those representing 'the law' are a pretty shallow (and some might say 'borderline psychotic') bunch.However, if you're looking for an adult con/crime caper with plenty of great (if a little weird-looking) A-list stars then you'll certainly find what you're looking for here.Oh, and if nothing I've said convinces you it's any good, it also has Robert DeNiro thrown in there for an extended cameo – always a bonus!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
If You Like Film Noir Genre Films...,"What makes this film unique and memorable is the irrepressible flaws of each character.

There is wonderful humor in the film all designed to make us laugh at ourselves as a broken culture struggling through the '70's.

"Hustling with style, and an unfortunate lack of focus","Could there be anything better to start off with than the absolute critic favorite film of the year? I find it funny how moviegoers constantly refer to this film as overrated, when it actually makes American Hustle seem underrated in the end, getting hatred from non- critics the moment the Oscar nominations were announced.I expected this movie to include everything movie critics are stereotyped as loving, and I wasn't disappointed. Heck, even I paid attention to those things, which made me really like American Hustle.Two successful con artists gets put to the test when they go from hustling desperate people, to being forced by the government into conning powerful politicians of New Jersey and mafia overlords. The entire situation is risky, and could end up chaotic when not even the con artists can trust each other anymore and the desperate FBI agent pursuing them starts getting personal with one of the con artists.Christian Bale absolutely kills it as con artist Irving Rosenfeld, while Amy Adams also does a fine job playing Irving's assistant full of dilemma, Sydney Prosser, though her British accent seems to wear off at certain points. Overall, the acting ensemble is one of the greatest I have seen in quite a while. Cooper's way of speaking and mumbling in different tones also makes his role as wild FBI Agent Richie DiMaso greatest performance so far, if you ask me, and he also gave me the most laughs. Jennifer Lawrence, while overreacting at certain parts, is damn good as the unpredictable wife of Irving, Rosalyn Rosenfeld. I still don't know if she was a genius all along, or just a dumb blonde.And that is the biggest strength of the movie's rather long plot, the hustling. The whole point of the movie is how hustling to survive is a possibility and director David O. Russell successfully expresses that. This is also what is worth talking about after the credits roll; was it all planned from the start or was there actually any dilemmas?Unfortunately the movie falls when the plot feels way too long. I thought we were nearing the climax when the con artists were going after the mafia overlord, and then I unfortunately figured out that only one hour and a quarter had passed. It definitely starts to drag on and 20-30 minutes could easily have been left out, like I feel we get way too much information from Irving, Sydney and Richie's lives when it would have been better if it had been more mysterious, like Irvings wife.This is overall my biggest gripe with Russell's otherwise great directing. He definitely knows how to create stunning settings with great and memorable characters, whose performers act fantastic. He also manages to use the movies' great soundtrack whenever it needs to be used, and the last used piece of music fits perfectly with the ending. But most scenes simply don't flow together as well as they should, and they end up becoming many great scenes instead of a fantastic motion picture. For these reasons, a re-watch can be tiring.So I love the setting, the soundtrack, the dialog, the acting and the ''Hustle'' of the film, and if only the movie was cut shorter and had flown better together, American Hustle would quite possibly had become one of my favorite films of the decade - 8.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A superior film - glossy, beautifully acted and with a great script","As director David O Russell how to you follow the critical and financial success of Silver Linings Playbook? The answer is with American Hustle, and boy - what a double bill that is! American Hustle is set in the late 70's - big hair, loud clothes and a disco beat. Bradley Cooper plays Richie DiMaso, a maverick FBI agent stressing-out his more mainstream boss but impressing his ambitious director with his wildly optimistic plans. He recruits (read 'frames') small time con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his girlfriend Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) to run an entrapment scam to catch local mayor and family man Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) who has been righteously greasing a few too many wheels in his ambitious bid to re-build Atlantic City as a Vegas of the east. A simple FBI playbook (you could even say it was silver lined?) but one that comes under ever-increasing stress due to too key factors: firstly, DiMaso's wild ambitions that starts to encircle not just low-level shysters but increasingly higher levels of federal and mafia targets; and secondly Rosenfeld's unstable and unreliable wife Rosalyn, played by Jennifer Lawrence.Where does this film succeed? Well, first and foremost the original screenplay by Eric Singer and David O Russell just drips quality with every line like a beef joint oozing juices. The opening title card says ""Some of this actually happened"" but the truth, as much as it was true, has been skilfully extended and embellished by the writers. This must surely be a shoe-in for a screenplay Oscar nomination, and will be in my predictions for the award.Secondly, the performances are just top notch. Christian Bale has never looked less like Bruce Wayne. Piling on the pounds and having the dodgiest combover since my Dad, his opening scene is just brilliant. Then Amy Adams (Man of Steel, Enchanted) wades in with such sass and style that you are mesmerised as you watch Adams and Bale bounce off each other. Nowhere is the acting better than when Bale encounters the most senior mafia head: played as a cameo (brilliantly) by someone you'd fully expect to play that role (no - not Joe Pesci). Bale's terror at realising the depth of water he is in is brilliantly portrayed and your mouth turns as dry as his no doubt is.In a supporting role, Jennifer Lawrence makes her first appearance and you think ""yeah, she'll probably get a best supporting actress Oscar nod by default"" - she is 'flavour of the year' after all. But that is before her performance really kicks in in the second half of the film - - and suddenly you realise you are in the midst of something really special here. Seeing her clean her kitchen in yellow Marigolds belting out ""Live and Let Die"" after stitching up her cheating husband is a sight to behold. Surely this WILL be another Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination, and never more deserved.Jeremy Renner also impresses in a more understated role, but with a never less than impressive performance at the film's denouement.I haven't mentioned pretty-boy Bradley Cooper yet. Although he has some great scenes (for instance, when cruelly mocking his morose boss during a victory celebration), overall I was never as completely convinced by his performance in the film as his in his role in Silver Linings Playbook. Perhaps he was trying a bit too hard.Finally the music is great: Danny Elfman does the soundtrack, but the smash hits of the 70's, including Elton John, Wings and the Bee Gees carry the story along with verve and vigour.Where does the film falter? Well - hardly at all in my view. Perhaps Irving and Sydney's altruistic tendencies at the end of the film - given their sociopathic and immoral roots at the film's start - seem a story step too far. But overall this is a glossy and deeply involving story that is my best film so far in 2014. I appreciate that on January 6th, that's not saying much! But I fear I might need to wade through a good few dark auditoria this year before I find a film that surpasses this one. Go see it!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

American Lining/Line-up,"Actually it's not really American actors playing all those roles, but I tried something witty with the summary line. Something witty is also what Russell is trying to do and it's not his first time. If you consider Three Kings and I (heart) Huckabees and what he has delivered the past few years you can't help but notice a director getting better by the minute (movie).It's not easy to juggle a movie about con artists, especially when it feels like it's build entirely on something that really happened (which apparently isn't the case, which makes this even more intriguing). But whatever the case and however you feel about some of the actors, this is brilliant. For one I do love Jennifer Lawrence, but the character she is playing could not be more despicable and appalling in my eyes. So while I'm still very fond of Lawrence herself, she (and Russell) actually made the impossible possible! I kind of hated her.There is a reason why there was Oscar buzz and nominations and what not. I know I myself get sometimes tired of buzz like that. But Russell is one to look out for and I for one cannot wait for his next movie. Whatever it is, it will be good ... whether I like it or not",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
smartest film of the year?,"I really needed this film two days after watching and being so disappointed with Gravity. I am pretty sure that American Hustle will make ways less money than 'Gravity' and will get less Academy Awards if any. It is however a much better film in my opinion, smart and sensitive, funny and entertaining, and in its way represents much better today's (or yesterday's) America.The story happens in the late 70s – early 80s in Manhattan and part in New Jersey, these two settings which may provide the background for more than half of the movies about America today, and is based in part on the real story of an FBI investigation that discovered wide-spread corruption in the local and national politics. In order to infiltrate in the local environment the Bureau investigator (Bradely Cooper) devices a scheme in which he blackmails a couple composed of a con man (Christian Bale) and his partner and lover (Amy Adams) are sent to lure a local politician and then other by offering them bribes. Same as in director David O. Russell previous film Silver Linings Playbook, (also set between NJ and NYC) none of the characters is really normal, they all have their non-negligible dose foolishness, malice and stupidity.There are two reasons for which American Hustle works well. The first is that the structure of the script is well designed, and the characters are very credible with all their goods and flaws. The second is that Russell's style of directing his actors enhanced the feeling of authenticity. Russell picked a team of very talented actors whom he knew well from previous films and let them create and improvise each their own roles. The result is bright. Christian Bale is hard to recognize physically, he is a smart and pathetic, loving and cynical con man. The actor of so many feel-good movies Bradley Cooper is mean and dark. For the first time I have seen here Jennifer Lawrence in a role (Bale's wife) that justifies the praises he received from many critics. Last and best – Amy Adams is unbelievably beautiful and vulnerable – she looks like a 2013 version of the best of what Jane Fonda could be. The cake has a glazing, and it's called Robert De Niro (uncredited for some reasons) – he does the older and tired version of the role he played so many times, and I hope that his devastated looks were just make-up.Smartest, maybe best American film that I have seen in a while.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"If you must see only 1 Christian Bale film from this (or last) year, this is it","7.2 of 10. What amounts to a mystery with politics and big business woven into the normal crime and police angles. Even a touch of the much lesser used mafia elements that once seemed forced into any crime film.Besides benefiting from being based on reality and not simply being a story pulled out of the imagination, it also provides an unusual mix of low-lifes and high powered FBI officials intermingling and trying to hustle one another in addition to the more powerful and wealthy.It's something like a story focused on the middle class of crime and punishment instead of the top and bottom.For style, in addition to cars, hair spray, and bra-less clothing, it provides an excellent mix of 1970s music to help set the mood and time, much more so than this year's other 1970s film, Rush. In terms of the films getting released with Oscar hype, only AH seems in the same league as Dallas Buyers Club and The Activist, though other award-deserving films include Closed Circuit, Elysium, The Great Gatsby, Warm Bodies, We Are What We Are, and Best Offer.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle is all I need,"American Hustle is one the big frontrunners this awards season having won a number of critics awards and been nominated for seven Golden Globes.In 1978 Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) are con-artists running a banking fraud scheme when they are arrested by FBI agent Ritchie DiMasco (Bradley Cooper) who issues an ultimatum, either be arrested or help him get four arrests to clear their records. Soon the trio are working together with a scheme to prove political corruption through a senior New Jersey politician, Cermine Polito (Jeremy Renner) who wants redevelop Atlantic City. But the operation is complicated by a mutual dislike between Irving and Ritchie, Irving's developing friendship with Cermine, Irving's wrecking ball of a wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and a love triangle between the trio.American Hustle is a excellently acted film as you would except from the cast of this talent. Bale goes through another physical transformation, giving himself a massive beer belly and Lawrence went to full gusto as a dizty, yet very manipulative woman who has Irving wrapped around her little finger. Adams also gave a surprisingly strong English accent for her character's false identity.David O. Russell is a director who has had great recent track record and actors want to work with him. Russell does inject energy and wit throughout the film. There is a Scorsese style to the film as we see multiple story lines, the use of multiple voiceovers and different viewpoints and even the brief flashbacks. Russell was able to bring us back to the 70s with the period details and he does want to replicate the look of a Scorsese film. American Hustle also has a great soundtrack.Throughout the film the questions of who is really in control of the situation and the constant manipulation and power plans between the characters as Ritchie and Irving trying to gain control of the situation and show they are the one who knows how to handle the operation whilst the women in between the men also look for their own self-determination and in Sydney's case her own survival.Renner does play a small supporting role in the film but gets to play an interesting character, a politician who wants to do the best for constituents and his state, sees redevelopment of Atlantic City as a way to give people jobs. But he comes up to a system where he cannot get support from the Federal government so has to turn to act illegally to do what he thinks it is best. It would have been interesting to have seen the film from his point of view, exploring political morality and reality. This investigation also raises the question about whether the operation was entrapment, making someone an easy target so they can get an arrest and result instead of someone who is actually bad.American Hustle is a very well made and acted film that does provide a crime film fix. But it is a good film, not a masterpiece that some critics are claiming it to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
American HUSTLE - Not much excitement because of too many inspirations,"A fine plot set in 1970s. To add more of the 70s mood, the director drew his inspiration from Scorsese, and Christian Bale copied De Niro. There are 10 nominations for the film at the academy on Sunday in which 4 nominations for the actors who did main characters. Being a huge fan of 70s-80s movies I personally felt the flavor of films like Godfather, The Sting and of course The Goodfellas (almost a re-take on its screenplay). It was entertaining to listen to songs like Yellow brick road by Sir. Elton, I feel love by Donna, Live and let die etc. in number of scenes.The bottom line a great half fiction/half fact movie to watch (Not with Kids due to s**ualty/nudity and drug use) with shortcomings of its own.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tulip Or Turnip,"There were many stylish and deep movies made in the '70's with thoughtful plots and acting and poignant soundtracks from The Godfather way down to The Story Of O – to go over the same ground again so soon takes some balls. It has to be special in some way to drag me back to that modern stone age while I still remember it so well, but unfortunately this isn't the film to do it.Comedy? It's a pretentiously complicated and generally boring tale of conmen, politicians, gangsters, in fact all very similar people and their molls loosely based on fact. Very stylish photography and undeniably wonderful acting by all the leads doesn't help me – it's deadly dull, flat, stale and unprofitable from start to finish. The story is so tedious and the comedy is so grim that what should be interesting is not and it just left me cold. So what if people wore big curlers, were suspicious of microwaves and phones had wires way back then; now film itself is redundant, audio sound is so perfect but there's nothing new worth hearing and soon we'll be able to converse with our coffee cups. As the Kinks sang in 1977 Life Goes On! The whole enterprise was probably aimed at the billions of people who have no pre-digital experience at all, billions who it must be hoped have more patience than me. Wasn't there any room for the Eagles' Desperado or one of Dean Friedman's songs or hairdo's? Or more to the point the Who's Won't Get Fooled Again or even better, Let's See Action?! I recall the Duke Ellington band's classic question posed at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1956, not on the original LP shown so lovingly in this film though but just after the second Jeep's Blues on the 1999 CD release: Tulip or turnip/rosebud or rhubarb/fillet or plain beef stew – tell me dreamface/what am I to you? Tulip Jennifer Lawrence's great performance is perhaps the only reason to watch this - but even a quick snog between her and Amy Adams can't save this overall from being a Prize Turnip.I'd be surprised if the DVD isn't remaindered and if it's ever on the telly more than an obligatory twice in the next ten years. It definitely is a well made film but presumably mainly for self-declared clever and arty people and not me; for this even to be in the running for Awards only tells me some hustling has been going on.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Its good but not as per the expectations raised by the wide appreciation.,"Based on one of my favourite subjects on conmen & heists, probably I was expecting a lot from this widely appreciated film, nominated in many major categories of 2014 Academy Awards or maybe I am the only one having a different opinion about the film as it seems. Anyway in honest words, I found American HUSTLE to be just a good film with a lot of noticeable merits but not a great path breaking or exceptional movie to be applauded that loudly.Mentioning it worthy points first, the film has been shot well and written beautifully, especially focusing on the witty dialogues which in fact become the major highlight of the film throughout. Actually it's a thriller which focuses more on its characters, their mannerisms, their spoken words or their way of living life on their own terms and less on any major events or happenings as such. So if you are looking for any great con sequence in particular (as it is always there in such films) then you are not going to find the same in an exact from, but there surely are many enjoyable, worth watching, and commendable performances working as its major triumph card arguably.The largely convincing acts are led by Christian Bale, who has amazingly got into that shape to play the given character brilliantly and then there is Amy Adams sensually playing his con partner with all her sexy, glamorous looks and elegant dresses having long, open cleavages. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as Christian's nagging wife and Bradley Cooper is great as the confused FBI agent along with the veteran Robert De Niro, who weaves magic in his only one scene in the second hour. Reportedly based on the real life Abscam scandal of late 1970s, it's about a secret FBI operation to investigate illegal transactions of money involving many politicians, wherein the FBI agent takes help from few con-artists. Director David O Russell uses that familiar kind of backdrop to make an engaging film which is surely great as far as performances and their mutual conversations are concerned. But it frankly cannot be rated as a thoroughly entertaining or a fast paced, thrilling con drama to be precise.At around 140 minutes, the film turns out to be a bit lengthy and gains its real momentum like an exciting, crime drama in only the last 30-40 minutes of its script. So before that one can only enjoy the film if he focuses more on the characters and their amusing interactions without expecting any great engaging sequence involving the con team. In other words, I found it to be a film where perhaps the ensemble cast and the director was having a more enjoyable time than the viewers. And that should easily give you a hint about the experience I had watching it in the theater. However in case you are the one more interested in enjoying the performances alone then you can sure opt for this over-appreciated movie for just once.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
'The art of survival is a story that never ends',"David O. Russell and his entire crew created one of the most impressive films of last year. Strange it was so highly honored by everybody but the Oscars. If ever there were a candidate for Best Ensemble Cast American HUSTLE wins hands down. Loosely based on the Abscam, which for those who have forgotten, 'Abscam—sometimes written ABSCAM—was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the Bureau's Hauppauge, Long Island, office in the late 1970s and early '80s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI, aided by a convicted con-man, videotaped politicians as they were offered bribes by a fictional Middle Eastern sheik in return for various political favors. The investigation ultimately led to the conviction of a United States Senator, six members of the United States House of Representatives, one member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.' Given that bit of reality, Russell and cast and crew created a stingingly brittle yet funny movie.American HUSTLE is set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock our nation. It tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down. Elisabeth Röhm is Carmine tacky wife, Louis C. K. plays Stoddard Thorsen, Michael Peña is the Mexican man pulled in to impersonate Sheik Abduklah, Alessandro Nivola is the smarmy Anthony Amado, and Jack Huston is the guy Rosalyn goes after – Pete Musane.The costumes, hair, clothes, and sets mirror the tacky 70s and make us all remember how over the top we were.

The whole sub-story about catching some corrupt congressmen, that plays such a minor role.

Riveting and Compelling,"This film is not for everyone. It demands that you pay complete attention to what is going on because so much is happening so fast that you practically sit there with your head spinning trying to keep up with it all. It is probably the most complex script I have ever been subjected to and it is just that complexity that is both riveting and compelling. The cast is uniformly superb - a true ensemble film - but Amy Adams steals every scene she is in because she is so beautiful - truly gorgeous - but beyond her knock-out looks there is a true magic to her that Disney certainly used in their film with her. There are a couple of scenes with her and Bradley Cooper that have to rate as the sexiest ever put on film and they will definitely get your heart pumping in a way it probably has never done before. Christopher Bale, on the other hand, proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is just about the best actor around he is so convincing in his part and in fact he manages once again to look so different you don't realize who it is at first. All of the elements of this film are excellent - the music - the settings - everything is first rate and top notch.

I wish it had just been a caper movie.....,"I liked parts of American Hustle quite a lot. The title works on several levels. The performances were outstanding. It looked great. I just think it tried to do too much. It's basically a story about Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser, a couple of pretty good con artists who ran some pretty good cons, how they got caught by the FBI, and what they did about it. That's a foundation for a neat little caper movie.BUT, Mr. Russell had Bradley Cooper attached, so he spent a lot of time on Mr. Cooper's FBI character, Richie DiMaso, Richie's fractious relationship with his supervisor and his growing obsession with Sydney, without really providing any motivation for him other than a hint of a drug habit and a suspicion that his ambition might be out of control.Irving's wife, Rosalyn, plays a small but pivotal role, but Mr. Russell had Jennifer Lawrence attached, so her role became expanded to the point of becoming a distraction. About one tenth of Rosalyn's histrionics would have been just as effective.When the story finally comes full circle, back to Irving and Sydney, the denouement seems to come out of left field. I'd have liked this movie a lot better if it had stayed with Irving and Sydney throughout. Then the payoff would have been a logical progression of events and a great deal more satisfying than it was.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A little slow, but fascinating story....","Overall I did enjoy ""American Hustle"" and particularly loved how it was filmed (storybook style with flashbacks, etc). The mostly 70's soundtrack was a perfect fit as well. My only gripe would be the movie's pace, which I thought dragged a little at times. Could have been shorter than its 138 minutes.The acting for the most part was terrific. Christian Bale in particular was fantastic and definitely award-worthy. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were very good. Bradley Cooper's performance I thought was a little over-the-top, and Jeremy Renner an odd choice as the Mayor of New Jersey (he was too young, particularly after seeing his children). Robert De Niro's almost unrecognizable cameo was memorable and reminded me (physically) of Laurence Olivier's ""Szell"" character in ""Marathon Man""!Overall, an entertaining movie and interesting story.

Who's the swindler and who's the mark?,"American Hustle is a better than average con movie- although I'm not sure worth all the hype- that's mostly down to the amazing performances from the leads who keep this so watchable, as does the late 70's music and clothing. Its stylish and genuinely funny in parts but also tends to be a bit long winded and drawn out.Honestly its also never quite clear who's the swindler and who's the mark and it doesn't really matter. At some point I just gave up trying to figure out who was heisting who and just went with it.The story follows Christian Bale & Amy Adams, two con artists recruited (after getting busted) by Bradley Cooper and the FBI to infiltrate the world where New Jerseys politics and the mob intersect. Bale's unpredictable wife Jennifer Lawrence could be the one to bring the entire operation crashing down.All that you've heard about the actors here is true...Lawrence is a definite scene stealer, very funny, Amy Adams is seductive and just amazing, Christian Bale is very fat and Bradley Cooper has very curly hair while also surprising with his cool disco moves.All-in I would sat say worth a watch but its long winded in its delivery and overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
'Love and Theft' – American Hustle (2013) A movie review,"BackgroundI was not a big fan by any stretch of the work of director David Russell. I liked The Fighter a lot, but I detested the second half of Silver Linings Playbook. I came the long way round to watching this recent critics' favorite. I was aware some months ago that Martin Scorsese was making a new movie called, The Wolf of Wall Street. I quickly got my hands on the book by the same name this movie is based. By the half way point, I was very disappointed splurging whatever I had to procure this garbage.What didn't make sense to me was why Scorsese would put all his effort on promoting arguably one of the most vial, detesting and uninteresting characters in recent memory, that being Jordan Belfort. I had decided if The Wolf movie even closely resembled this scumbag's book, I would not pay to see it since I felt it a moral sacrilege to give my hard earn money to promoting his name in anyway shape or form. Criminals from Goodfellas I can understand, heck they were interesting and paid for their crimes. This guy Belfort as one reviewer put it, 'kills people's dreams - that's much more insidious'.Don't worry there is a connection coming. As I browsed reviews of The Wolf on Wall Street movie, I noticed an interesting connection in what people were writing about it and David Russell's, American Hustle. What was this Scorsese connection between the two? I had to find out. As I mentioned, David Russell's previous attempt Silver Linings Playbook didn't resonate well with me and I was unsure if American Hustle would live up to the hype. I wrote a review about Silver which you can find under my movie reviews here.Anyone even remotely familiar with Scorsese cannot deny that David Russell has lent heavily from Scorsese's quintessential best movies to make American Hustle . The narratives, the music and editing, in particular the first half of the movie all point toward a seeming homage to Scorsese's 90's work, specifically Casino. Even De Niro makes a key entrance in a role so reminiscent of Casino wearing the same ginormous glasses Scorsese left us with in the final scene. Many have described that Russell has borrowed more from Goodfellas, but I don't see it as much I do with Casino. Borrowing and immersing material from populist culture is not new to David Russell's work. I noticed in Silver Linings how a lot of the writing involved character's spilling their theories on popular books, quoting from classic literature, recalling superstitious notions regarding football teams, blatant marketing of iPods and musings about the greatest music. It seemed as though Silver was more a satire or social commentary about how materialistic and consumer obsessed our society is.There is no denying that Russell in his new movie, American Hustle has once again demonstrated his passion for heightening the senses regarding materialism and social trends given its almost perverse saturation of 1970's references. He tries so hard to draw his audiences in by fairly superficial materialistic means like the barrage of 1970's music, John Travolta dancing, the uncanny focus on men and women's hair styles, cleavage, drugs, money, quirkiness etc etc and of course that's fine, the movie is based in the 70's. But how much of it seems real? Does hearing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road in the middle of the movie connect with what we are seeing on screen or is it thrown in because it will strike a chord with audiences?One could argue, the movie eventually does stand on its own two feet. Unlike Silver Linings which leads to an eventual Strictly Ballroom squeamish sequence, this movie does the opposite. It leads to some great plot twists which enhance the explosivity of the situations our protagonists find themselves. Thank God, it is not predictable. American Hustle eventually does becomes its own beast. The acting is very good. Christian Bale as always is exceptional and the female cast, Amy Adams worth noting is excellent. I liked her seductress ways in The Master as well. Their are a lot of comical undertones and at times in your face laugh out loud moments you might find yourself questioning, 'Should I actually be laughing at this'? Ironically, there isn't much physical action in this, but the script is so super solid you wonder how a director could screw this up. There were apparently lots of improvisation in this movie which undoubtedly enhanced its spontaneity and feel of realism. The cheeky manipulation and seductive powers of the female leads was expertly delivered and how the embattled men craved their scanty approval was almost the stuff of Shakespeare.These are modern times and this movie is for modern audiences. I admired Russell's The Fighter because of it's originality and I detested Silver Linings Playbook for the exact opposite reason. But American Hustle broaches the two. Love and Theft I call it, like the title of Bob Dylan's 2001 classic album which also borrows heavily from other sources, but still stands up on its own as something quite fresh. Fresh, how? That's hard to place your finger on.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Completely Enveloping and Fascinating, But Ever-So-Slightly Underwhelming.","Filthy, immense personalities with a shared lack of moral compass own the driver's seat in this lingering peek at a late-'70s government sting operation and the flawed individuals caught up in its net. While the titular hustle is, obviously, the driving force behind this film's plot, the lion's share of its effort is spent inspecting the players themselves, rendering each from a variety of different angles and lights. In fact, the first two acts concentrate almost exclusively on the cast, to the detriment of the heist itself - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a different approach than I'd expected. Of course, that ratio is flipped on its head in time for the climax, when our slick set of con (wo)men abruptly realize they're in way over their heads and the audience lets out a collective gasp; ""Oh, crap."" Predictably, the A-list actors hit all of their notes with sly ease, with the best - Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence - completely disappearing into their roles. Poor Bale has transformed his body in this way so many times over the years - an enormous gut, meticulously bad combover and slumped posture epitomize this particular role - that it's hard to imagine he won't pay a steep price later in life. A few scenes are slower than they need to be, and the focus could stand to be a touch sharper, but without both indulgences this wouldn't be the film it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorsese sans Scorsese,"David O. Russell, coming off the heels of his success with ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" works his talent on the crime genre of films with ""American Hustle."" Too bad it was a better film 20 years ago...when it was called, ""Casino."" Or was it ""Goodfellas""? Nevertheless, this crime drama/comedy comes across as a day late and a couple bucks short, yet still manages some entertainment factor despite a ""been there/seen that"" approach.Christian Bale stars as a con man in late 70's who's scam is basically the precursor to ""I'm a Nigerian Prince"" emails of the late 90's. He eventually teams up with a bored secretary played by Amy Adams, and the two beginning tricking desperate chumps into pouring money out to get a bigger loan amount. Naturally, they are caught red-handed by the FBI, and pushed under the thumb by agent Bradley Cooper, with his Serpico beard and Garfunkel hairdo. The FBI cut a deal with Bale to sting a couple of corrupt politicians in lieu of jail time, because in the Hollywood world, the FBI loves to screw other people into screwing other people. Eventually the operation, titled ""ABSCAM"" (for ""Abdul Scam"") involves convincing a New Jersey mayor, played by Jeremy Renner, into accepting a bribe by an Arab Sheik for revitalizing the Atlantic City boardwalk's casino empire. But, being that this is a crime flick and the stakes are so high, things get muddled and messy, and not everything goes to plan. Along the way, other parties become in involved, including Bale's bored, unsatisfied housewife, played by Jennifer Lawrence, and the mob themselves, lead by a cameo'd Robert DeNiro.The main problem with the film is that it feels almost out of touch with today's audiences. Had this film been released back in the mid-90's, it would've starred DeNiro, James Woods, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci....ah hell, it would've basically been the entire cast of ""Casino,"" with Martin Scorsese at the helm.

Russell's homage to Martin Scorsese (who ironically, released ""Wolf of Wall Street"" late last year and was as much as an homage to himself).Christian Bale's performance is a bizarre impersonation of Robert DeNiro (and gets even stranger when he's sharing a scene with DeNiro himself) and is more or less Bale attempting to wow the audience with his method acting of gaining 40 pounds, shaving his hair bald, and putting on a Bronx accent that is still stymied due to his mouth breathing. Bradley Cooper is reminiscent of a coked-out, neurotic James Woods who despite being the federal agent of the film, comes across as the least likable character. Amy Adams does well with her multi-layered performance, but there's something about Adams in every film she does that despite her being an Oscar worthy actor, she never accomplishes any standout performance. Despite her Oscar winning performance in ""Silver Linings,"" Jennifer Lawrence is woefully miscast in this role. I'm not saying she doesn't do a good job (she does), but her young age shows too brightly in this role as a single mom, which ironically I thought she was older in ""Playbook"". Her accent was also too minuscule for playing a working class Long Island princess. Jeremy Renner does fine as perhaps the most sympathetic character in the film, being a corrupt yet good intended mayor. Louis C.K., Alessandro Nivola, Jack Huston and Michael Pena round out the ensemble cast.All in all, ""Hustle"" is a decent film and is in no way Russell's worst (that honor goes to ""I Heart Huckabees,"" which incidentally I enjoyed). But when your film credits include the intensely poignant ""Three Kings."" masterfully crafted ""The Fighter,"" and the strong but sweet ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" your reputation is always on the line after back-to- back Oscar winners. No doubt ""Hustle"" will be a good contender during the Awards season, but that's possibly because this year has been a drought for artistic merit. It's never good to win by default.Rating: ***1/2 out of *****",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Energetic crime-drama with top level acting,"An FBI agent recruits a pair of con artists in a scheme designed to ensnare some corrupt politicians and gangsters.This 1970's set, New Jersey based crime-drama is a definite success from director David O. Russell. His direction here is unmistakably influenced by Martin Scorsese in full flow and this is of course a very good thing. There is a real energy and inertia to a film with, on the face of it, not an awful lot of action. It succeeds on account of Russell's strong direction combined with a set of superior performances from a great ensemble cast. In fact, it's probably the acting more than anything which powers this one over the line. Christian Bale once again shows his high calibre and totally loses himself in his character, once again going the extra mile physically by putting on a lot of weight to the point of obesity to play a potbellied, balding con-man. It's a great charismatic performance and yet another bit of top level work from Bale. Bradley Cooper is also impressive as the slightly out-of-control FBI agent who also happens to sport a perm. Amy Adams is wonderful as a con woman who feigns a delicious English accent in her role-within-a-role as an upper class British aristocrat who uses her charms to ensnare unwary victims. She also sports an outrageous wardrobe of sexy 70's clobber, which doesn't do any harm. Then there is Jennifer Lawrence in a scene stealing performance as Bale's loose cannon wife who has a knack for manipulating the con man. Those four all put in sterling work and are a joy to watch, and that is to say nothing of Jeremy Renner as the Mayor, a character who would be a one-dimensional villain in most other films but here is probably more sympathetic than the 'heroes'! While we also have an unbilled turn from Robert De Niro as a nasty crime boss – it's probably the kind of thing he could do in his sleep but he is still impressively threatening nevertheless. Additionally, the 70's period detail in which the drama plays out against is another major plus point with great décor, hairstyles and costumes on display throughout.The story is told partially in flashback which always adds a nice extra dynamic and here is no different. While I would certainly say that the screenplay is very good, I would also be inclined to suggest that the story just falls short of greatness. The plot trajectory has a few twists and turns but doesn't necessarily amount to as much as it promises. Still, this is a relatively minor complaint as the story is still more than decent. The tone is often on humour with some of the comedy being very funny. But it's a good mix of the comic with the dramatic, with the story having enough overall seriousness for the drama to still resonate when necessary. Overall, this is a very entertaining and well delivered movie with its superb acting performances defining it most.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the funniest and smartly written movies I've seen in a long time,"American hustle is just purely entertaining. Something that a lot of movies struggle with now. It's well written, very well acted, laugh out loud hilarious and you'll just have a good time whilst watching it. American Hustle's tone is very similar to Martin Scorsese movies. It's very real and sometimes is over the top but it finds the right balance between the two. The performances are fantastic all around. Christian Bale is great as the good hearted but troubled con man. Amy Adams ( who in my opinion delivers the best performance of the movie) is great as Bale's associate. Bradley Cooper is good as the naive Fbi agent. Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence are also very good and I would've liked to have seen them get more screen time. Even Louis C:k is great as Bradley Cooper's cynical FBI supervisor. Overall American Hustle is a great movie with lots of quotable lines and memorable scenes. It's a movie you won't want to miss and you'll remember it for a long time.",,Anonymous,Crime
A near-perfect film victimized by too much critical hype,"There is a tendency in America to assert one's individuality by refusing to listen to ""the so called experts"". Whether it be from an academic or a film critic, no one wants to be told what to think or how to feel. The problem with this anti-intellectualist attitude is that it causes those who hold it to often overreact to many things that the ""experts"" almost unanimously agree on. In extreme examples, one is forced to deny hard scientific evidence, as in the case of evolution or global warming. In milder examples, it means giving a one star rating to a film that quite clearly deserves more. I believe that is why you find so much hatred toward this film in the user ratings and reviews on this site.Like many, I had high expectations when I first saw this film. After hearing all of the critical praise, much of which did seem a bit over-the-top, I felt somewhat let down. A few years have passed, so I decided to give it another chance, this time from a more objective position, and with much lower expectations. I was truly mesmerized. It was as if I had seen a completely different film. Everything from the Scorsese-esque directing by David O. Russell to the actors completely disappearing into their characters was as close to perfection as one can ask from a film. Watch it without an agenda and you will enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed, because in the end it was made to entertain, and it certainly did that for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
It coulda been a contendah!,"It's a very good film about ABSCAM, but the real scam is why he tries to tack on a love triangle to it. David O. Russell seems to want his film to be everything to everyone. This could be a great drama given the inherent drama of ABSCAM. I would have liked a more straight ahead drama because ABSCAM is a fascinating case whose innovative law enforcement work and colorful villains would make a great movie in and of themselves.There is some great acting in this film. Jeremy Renner conveys a lot of heart as the mayor of Camden. Robert DeNiro absolutely steals his scene as a mob boss' right-hand man. It's the best role he's had for some time. Christian Bale is so versatile and is able to completely inhabit the characters he plays. He is one of the best actors working these days. Jennifer Lawrence is great - very brave and passionate. Shea Whigham is very good in a small role business associate of Bale's character. Elizabeth Rohm is great as Renner's wife. Amy Adams is fair but she doesn't command attention in the way that Lawrence does. I don't think Bradley Cooper showed a lot of range in Silver Linings Playbook or in this. When he tries to convey anger, he just sounds desperate.The film is well written and the final twist is great, but this seems like it should have been divided into two movies. The tone of the film is so uneven that I can't give it a higher rating. The plot has a lovely twist at the end, but for me, the love triangle plot line was a big distraction. Some of the awkwardness among the characters is even played for laughs which also seems to detract from the possibility of showcasing how ABSCAM was investigated.David O. Russell is a fantastic director. I have enjoyed all of his films, but to me, his earlier films - most especially Flirting with Disaster and Three Kings showed his great ability to establish a consistent tone throughout complicated movies better than his last two. He needs to simplify a bit.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Film that Brings Back Class To The Big Screen!,"Finally!! A classy picture for those tired of watching up-to-date modern garbage. This movie is for those wanting a classic feel of a movie that actually contains human emotion. I enjoyed this film so much, I've already seen it seven times, and counting because I plan to watch it again very soon. This movie made me feel as if I were thrown back into the old days.The Cons: Okay so the only thing that bothered me about the film were some of the bribery scenes, they seemed very forced, very awkward to watch, just a little thing in the beginning of the film when he moves the case towards Carmine (Jeremy Renner), other than that there was really nothing wrong with it at all.The pros:The script is beyond engaging and entertaining making the characters all the more intriguing to watch, the colors are very beautiful, the cinematic value even better. The person who made this movie truly respects what movies used to be and meant, it really does tell a story. No matter how lost you feel in this movie when you first watch, there will always be something you missed when you watch it again. It is witty, and again, I say this again because it is the truth, it is a classy film, it doesn't make you feel like you just watched recycled material from the oldies, it is a movie all its own, creative and original.The characters, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starring in another movie is FILM GOLD! You cannot go wrong with a film starring either of these, especially Jennifer Lawrence, who is an important presence in films at the moment. Christian Bale plays a con artist who tricks the desperate into falling towards pointless loans with an outrageous advance price of $5000. ""I give 5, you give 50, right?"" He gets caught up in a scheme plotted by another desperate FBI agent (the film revolves around the desperate, because they are easy to be tricked, (you give them all the power, they become yours to mold) hence the ending, where the con artists con the very man who hired them to take down big names in politics. The stories in between and the drama are just to add to the atmosphere of the seventies, which is incredibly written and beautifully executed. This film is very poetic, (the story of survival is one that never dies) and if you are an avid lover of film, you will not pass this movie up, because I guarantee there will be something you loved about it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
You work for me now!!,"Brilliant con man Irving Rosenfield and his alluring partner in the con, Sydney Prosser are forced to work with FBI agent Richie DiMaso in a high stakes con that eventually involves New Jersey power brokers, U.S. politicians and the mob. Loyalties are tested as the lines blur between control and chaos, where the con eventually becomes the only reality that they can trust...Gripping in its semi true story, you will find yourself watching as these characters spiral into a world of chaos. Brilliantly acted by Bale and company you slowly become to realize that you are watching some of Hollywood's best actors today. Though this movie of crime, cons and passions is slow at first, it eventually picks up steam. Director David O. Russell holds nothing back and neither do his actors. Transported to New York/ New Jersey of the 70's the sound track brilliantly authenticates this movie, and serves as a perfect companion to the film. The set pieces, the wardrobe even the grittiness of the film itself reminds one of a movie straight out of the 70's Alluring and sexually charged in certain scenes as well as good points of humor to ease the tension. Not a full drama, and not a full comedy but a blend of both that delivers, not the best movie I've seen but indeed on that is worthy of the praise it receives.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Interpersonal conflict, thy name is ""American Hustle""","American Hustle had such a star-studded cast that I knew it couldn't be bad - and I was right. It was awesome. I enjoyed everything about this movie - the cinematography, the music, the setting, but most of all - the characters. The character development is so good it seems like you could travel over to New Jersey and meet them - not that you'd want to! Which brings me to my next point - don't expect to see an upbeat caper movie, like Oceans 11 or The Italian Job. This movie is a gritty and sleazy story about cons, excellently told.The dialogue is witty and fast-paced. Every conversation is a battlefield, and each character is constantly trying to win the upper hand. The women in particular (Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams) deviated considerably from their previous roles, and to great effect.I don't think this genre of movie gains too much from the big screen, but I highly recommend purchasing it on DVD when it is released.",,Anonymous,Crime
Glamorous With a Top-Class Cast,"I had high hopes for this film having seen the line-up, and I wasn't disappointed. Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner pull together to create a story that is fast paced, smooth and witty. Each character is so strong and brings something totally different to the film, and the quality of acting was some of the best I've seen.The entire film has a beautiful relaxed 70's atmosphere which complements the pacy dialogue, and hits the ground running with a flashback opening scene. Atmosphere provides a real escapism here: the sets, costumes, music and dialogue are glamorously old-fashioned and authentic. Straight away the audience is drawn into the world of con artist Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and his relationship with partner in crime Sydney Prosser (Adams) and the mysterious FBI agent Richard DiMasio (Cooper). The film unfolds slowly and smoothly moves between various hustles and more explosive character interactions. It really is the incredible dimensions that each character has within the story that makes it so enjoyable: the contrasts between Adams and Lawrence, and Bale and Cooper's roles provides some wonderful moments of comedy, emotion and drama. There's also a great minor role for Robert De Niro to watch out for.Slick and glamorous, American Hustle boasts an excellent cast and top- class acting. This pacy and dramatic film is sure to keep you captivated throughout the many plot twists through its engaging characters and beautiful styling.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not as great as it could have been,"American Hustle is the latest project from Hollywood's recent rising director, David O. Russel. I wanna start by saying that I loved both The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. This was supposed to be Russel's step to something even greater, with perhaps a best director and best picture win at the Oscars. I'm sadden to say that this isn't that movie. Although it has grown into a major contender, it will probably walk away with few awards or even empty ended. As far as the movie goes, one of the things I enjoyed the most was Christian Bale's performance of this con man. Bale gives a stylistic feel to his character and is by far the richer in the film. Amy Adams also gives a good performance as well, and Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner are solid. I am a huge fan of Lawrence, and while she showed yet again her maturity in the role, she could have brought more to the table. Despite its cool imagery and decent performances, American Hustle fails on one important issue and that is its plot. The premise is good, but the plot is basically unattached to the con world and all its tactics. It misses the key element to fully entertain given its genre and I for one am a a little disappointed in this.Rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Perm Curlers and Chapstick !!!,"Hooked from the very first frame of a man doing his hair in the bathroom, we get to see something very intimate, yet its laughable and sad and for me summons up the con man, hiding behind things, covering up the truth. The women in this movie are given such strong parts they almost overshadow the male dominated seventies but the wife and the mistress are so sassy, stunning performance from Adams and Lawrence. The Richard character was totally believable with his ego driven eccentric drive to be someone, then we see his mother and his real life, so well done. There were so many things, I think I just have to go see it again, when I was in the pharmacy yesterday the girl was applying some chapstick to her lips and I just started laughing as I remembered the couple who were having dinner, she is insisting he uses her chapstick, for this one liner alone its its a BRILLIANT movie.

Brilliant story and dialogue. Hilarious acting performances. Cutting edge editing based on a swooping soundtrack. Dynamic and playful photography. Brilliant!. I love it!!!,"Man oh man,this must be one of the most hilarious con stories. I truly applaud the writers, who based this terrific plot on real events. During the opening scenes of this movie one can read a statement saying: ""Some of this actually happened"". And it did. Christian Bale's character was loosely based on Melvin Weinberg, an international con artist and informant, and his girlfriend Evelyn Knight, who both helped plan and conduct a FBI sting operation. These 2 con artists were both facing a prison sentence at the time (the seventies) and in exchange for their help, the FBI agreed to let them out on probation.The plot is genius, but wait until you hear the dialogues! These dialogues are what makes American Hustle such a hilarious thrill to listen to over and over again, because rarely ever before have I heard such absurd, hilarious, yet still true to life dialogues, that are just to die for. One line after the other is just sheer joy to listen to.I must applaud the acting as well. How could I not applaud that! Robert de Niro has a very small ghost part in this movie. One of his most perfect and creepy roles ever! But no credits at the endtitles for his performance! NONE. They sneaked De Niro in...and he is scary as hell. Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence reach the stars with their performances which are so incredibly funny, but still so believable and adorable at the same time. Director David O Russel proves with this movie again that he definitely is the new born director star of the new American cineman. After ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Lining Playbook"" he hits the jackpot again with ""American Hustle"" in which Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper both star again.Everything is perfect in this movie. Everything. American Hustle has won dozens of awards around the world, won golden globes and got 10 oscar nominations. I have seen this flick now a dozen times or so and I still enjoy it as much as the first time. American Hustle is truly up there with the modern classics. It is a feast for the eye, because of the hilarious, yet serious acting performances, portrayed onto the silver screen with mesmirising photography and cutting edge editing, based on a fantastic seventies soundtrack. The story is simply to die for. Genius. And you wont stop laughing. I am in movie heaven. Sheer Brilliance !",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great Performances, but Ordinary Film!","David O. Russell, the supremely talented filmmaker of films such as 'The Fighter' & the instant classic 'Silver Linings Playbook', brings us the much awaited crime-comedy 'American Hustle'. Now, does it work?The Answer is neither a yes or a no. To begin with, the film is blessed with Great Performances by its amazing cast. Its also blessed with O.Russell's Stylish Direction. But what it lacks, most importantly, is a Solid Script. The Writing Material is clichéd, though often funny, its never out-of-the-box or awe-inspiring. Though the film begins brilliantly, the momentum keeps going down, especially, in the last hour. One Expected Much More!'American Hustle' Synopsis: A con man, Irving Rosenfeld, along with his seductive British partner, Sydney Prosser, is forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso. DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey power-brokers and mafia.'American Hustle' begins so well, that I thought I was in for a joyride! Unfortunately, the Writing surrenders to clichés & the pace drops. Though the characters & their darker-side kept me engrossed at parts, the story as a whole, isn't captivating enough. Eric Warren Singer & O. Russell's Screenplay underwhelms, though there is some genuine merit in it. O.Russell's Direction is Stylish. He handles this crazy-con affair with much style. Cinematography is fine. Editing isn't sharp. Art & Costume Design are excellent.Now Coming To The Performances! 'American Hustle' works primarily due to its cast, who deliver so wonderfully. Jennifer Lawrence is astonishing as the nagging wife. She delivers a performance that deserves her an Oscar Nomination for supporting actress. Despite limited screen-time, The Academy-Award-Winner is the show-stopper here! Bradley Cooper enacts the overenthusiastic FBI agent, superbly. Christian Bale as a con-man with a bad hairdo, is simply terrific. Amy Adams as Bale's seductive British partner, bares it all, quite literally! She's first-rate, yet again! Among other performances, Jeremy Renner is not in form this time around, while Robert De Niro is spellbinding in a surprise cameo.On the whole, 'American Hustle' works in parts, but Fine Acting is undoubtedly its biggest attraction!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hollywood Hype,"Should have read more reviews before wasting my $$$ and time. Admittedly, all the pre-release hoopla conned me.Boring, little to no action, dialogue so long-winded my ears hurt (Bale can do that), and a plot that seems the result of ""improv acting"", i.e., anyone with lines just delivers them.Despite already being overly-long, the audience keeps waiting for something to happen . . . it doesn't . . . if that's a ""spoiler"", consider yourself very lucky, i.e., you've been warned by a 68-year old lifelong movie buff.What a waste of good actors.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Dry, arch comedy with a straight face. 72.5+%","The basic story in this movie is relatively straightforward...a couple of con artists (Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld and Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser) are nabbed by an ambitious F.B.I. Agent (Bradley Cooper as Richie DiMaso) who promises not to charge either of them so long as they can help him catch bigger criminals by using their skills as con artists. Irving and Sydney agree to this...Irving's wife Rosalyn (played by Jennifer Lawrence) isn't really privy to all of Irving's activities...illegal or adulterous. The start of the movie informs the viewer that ""some"" of the movie is based on actual events. Presumably accuracy hasn't been kept at the expense of good fun.During the movie I frequently laughed out loud as the situation went from bad to worse for Irving and Sydney, or the stupidity of Rosalyn later in the movie (Lawrence shows a talent for character based comedy in this movie). Despite this humour, the movie did strike me as being a dialogue driven piece...a wall of dialogue. It's also 138 minutes long...putting those two things together, it was quite demanding of your attention, perhaps at the expense of just providing pure entertainment. It's not exactly intellectually taxing, just demanding of your attention. Even though I don't usually watch movies again, the thought of watching this movie again due to its demanding nature made me think that I wouldn't want to do that again in a hurry. I'd have to wait a decade, maybe. The way the characters relate to each other perhaps has a 'Brooklyn' vibe to it. Maybe some people might find that taxing too.A way that the movie attempts to keep you intrigued is by making you question the motives of the various players...are Irving and Sydney using each other? What is real? Where does the con begin and end? Who's conning whom? This may provide pleasure for some as a viewing experience.Can't say that I knew how to interpret this movie...initially I missed the introduction explaining that it was partly based on a true story. Without that knowledge, I was wondering whether the movie was a comment on the Hollywood factory (e.g. Bale putting on the bat costume, pretending to be a superhero as a kind of con) or a metaphor for the American dream...in the guise of reinventing oneself to reach higher...if that is indeed the American dream...I'm Australian...I don't know these things. If the latter, maybe that has something in common with the novel ""The great Gatsby"", which is regarded as a classic in America and has also been turned into a movie...multiple times. Would still be inclined to think that on some level this movie is 'saying something' about the American experience, beyond merely fictionalising a true story.Another thing that struck me was how often the look of the characters reminded me of other people in movies or TV or real life. E.g. when I caught the start of the movie, with Irving elaborately doing his hair, I was reminded of Tom Cruise in ""Tropic thunder"", I think it was; Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito reminded me of a young Liberace perhaps...or that kind of Teddy Boy look...if that is the right phrase; Louis C.K. as Stoddard Thorsen reminded me of Bill Bailey (the English comedian); one guy kind of reminded me of a young Michael Douglas; there's one mob guy who kind of had a George Clooney in ""O brother, where art thou?"" look to him (that I don't remember these character's names just reflects on how demanding of your attention this movie is); Bradley Cooper in one scene (or two) reminds me of Kevin Kline's turn in ""A fish called Wanda"". Sort of related, perhaps Bale channels Gandolfini as Tony Soprano in his performance at times. Jennifer Lawrence sort of reminded me of Renée Zellweger in her looks at times...but maybe that's just me?Speaking of self-referential moments...I got the feeling that a member of the crew had the same surname as the lawyer who appears in the end of the movie...something like ""Tellegio""...if that is the case, perhaps it's a sort of in-joke or something? Maybe there's more of that too?There is some good 1970s music etc. in this movie but it's not quite in the same league as ""Boogie nights"" on that front, which was stacked with the kind of songs I love from that era.""American hustle"" is a true ensemble work and I suppose in a year in which no particular movie or performance has screamed ""Award!"" to me, the extra yards Christian Bale has put in to perform his role (putting on a lot of weight, by the looks of it...assuming it's not a fat suit), he'd be as worth a winner of a Best Actor award as anyone else. In other movies of his I've seen it occurred to me that he was often overshadowed by minor characters in star vehicles for him, like The Dark Knight (Heath Ledger's brilliant turn as the Joker) and Terminator: Salvation (Sam Worthington's character Marcus Wright was more interesting than John Connor). It's perhaps ironic that Bale may win an Oscar in a movie/character which isn't a 'star vehicle' for him. Unlike Batman, Irving is an interesting character...more filling and nutritious, acting chops wise than the caped crusader.One last thingthe endingI did wonder if the film took a morally dubious stance on the targets DiMaso was chasingi.e. not sure that I share those sentiments.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great Scorsese imitation,"David O. Russell does Scorsese, and he does it pretty damn well. Christian Bale stars as a con artist who, along with his girlfriend, Amy Adams, is forced by FBI agent Bradley Cooper to work for him. He wants to use their talent at scamming to rope in bigger targets, and he sets his eyes on Camden, New Jersey mayor Jeremy Renner, who wants to get gambling legalized in New Jersey. Bale and Adams have little choice but to go along with it, but waiting in the wings is Bale's loudmouth wife, Jennifer Lawrence, who keeps trying to horn her way into their shenanigans and ruin the whole plan. The story here - which is based on real events, at least somewhat - isn't the greatest, but the film is an absolute tour de force, bolstered by some truly brilliant performances and an assured hand behind the camera. There isn't a better cast this year. In addition to the four I've listed, comedian Louis C.K. is just brilliant in the deadpan role of Cooper's disapproving boss. The film is funny and just plain fun. I think the final twist is kind of predictable, and it kind of limps to the end, but this is great stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hustled by its own director,"I am reluctant to award this film a score as high as a 6, but I could not in good conscience rate it any lower because there are very earnest efforts by some of those involved that outweigh the bad taste left in my mouth by others.Rarely before have I seen a director torpedo his film so spectacularly. David O. Russell is competent, often incredible, but, alas, American Hustle, alongside I Heart Huckabees, suffers at the hands of his tremendous hubris. His direction is clumsy, plodding, and erratic.Thanks to his cinematographer, however, the frenetic camera-work is effective in establishing tone and setting. The soundtrack choices are spot-on, though there are long stretches of non-diegetic silence in scenes that would have benefited from some musical momentum. The production and costume design are the perfect icing, but therein lies a problem. Russell is more concerned with recreating the era, which he does, than telling a coherent story.Much of the film was reportedly improvised and a story was derived from that. The opposite approach should have been taken because Russell does not how to handle a heavily improvised product. Some great films have come from spontaneity, but he director needs to know what to do with it, which Russell never does here.Throughout the interminable and floundering first act, the viewer is hammered with flashbacks and exposition. In themselves, those elements are essential, but writers Russell and Singer forego weaving them into the plot, and instead throw as many things as they can onto the screen to see what sticks.The multiple voice-over narration is overdone and most likely could have been omitted without any hindrance to the story. We hear about a character or a plot development as we see it. We hear about characters' inner thoughts but then they are said out loud by those characters on screen. It's superfluous, it's distracting, it's arrogant, it's plain unnecessary.It is when Cooper's character becomes integral to the plot that the film gains direction and intrigue. There is never any huge revelation, twist, or really a main climax for that matter, but Russell is known for telling stories driven by character. It's not a bad thing, especially here, because the cast is able to handle it.In spite of, or perhaps because of, Russell's misdirection, the cast picks up his slack and carries the rest of the film. Chemistry is near impeccable, and most of the actors are at the top of their game.Amy Adams proves herself as one of the better actresses working today. Her seductive and mysterious performance commands the screen. Cooper's character is the most complex and he takes to task and absolutely delivers. He raises his game from last year's Oscar-nom turn in Silver Linings Playbook and, at last, is fulfilling his promise as an actor.Lawrence, while minimal in her role, gives the best performance of the film. She offers plenty of comic relief, and fortunately rises above what could have been a role of sassy one-liners (e.g. Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny). She gains more out of the script than was probably written and gives her character depth and appeal. I've yet to see more of the award frontrunners of 2013, but I would be remiss to neglect her furious housework to the tune of ""Live and Let Die"" as one of the greatest scenes of the year.And then there's Christian Bale. The man has a presence, certainly, and he is by no means a weak actor. He is an uninteresting one, which is debatably worse. He is so self-aware in his method that nothing feels authentic or organic. Like Johnny Depp, he confuses physical alteration, makeup, and costume with actual acting, and graces us with the same performance we've seen a dozen times before. He bases his character on a series of mannerisms, mannerisms that don't belong to the character but Bale himself. He tilts his head, grins evilly, breathes heavily through his mouth, and has an occasional screaming rant before returning to composure. He's Patrick Bateman. Only fat. With a combover.Is American Hustle watchable? Certainly, once you get over the hump of the first act. I recommend it highly for the stronger elements as they are worth watching. I can't decide whether the whole was greater than the sum of the parts--I did leave the theater satisfied, after all--or if the sum of most of the parts were greater than the whole. Either way, Russell does this film quite the injustice because it could and should have been something incredible. As it stands, I give it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Some of the finest acting performances of the year,"Reminiscent of light-hearted caper films such as The Sting, American Hustle captures the look and feel of Hollywood films of the seventies and can boast of some of the finest acting performances of the year. The film starts off with two scam artists in cahoots with each other but, before we are through, we have met a Mafia kingpin, a fake Arab sheik, a popular but corruptible Mayor, several on-the-take Congressmen, a dangerously honest wife, and some personally unbalanced FBI types. It is played mostly for laughs, however, and nothing to get upset about, that is, unless you think that depicting predators without empathy, who do not care much about the law and about who they hurt, ought not to be so much fun.Directed by David O. Russell and co-written by Russell and Earl Warren Singer, the story is loosely based on the Abscam case of the late seventies where an FBI sting operation, partially directed by con artist Melvin Weinberg, used fake Arab sheiks to convict a New Jersey senator, six congressmen, and the mayor of Camden for taking bribes. Coming not far after the political fallout from Watergate, the dubious credibility of the Warren Commission, and the illegal and unpopular Vietnam War, the scandal further contributed to the decline of the American people's trust in their government.Beginning with a tongue-in-cheek inter-title that tells us that ""Some of this actually happened,"" American Hustle is filled with a relentless energy that does not flag throughout the film's 138-minute length. We first meet middle-aged pot-bellied Irving Rosenfeld portrayed by a bulked-up Christian Bale. Irving has a dry cleaning business which is a front for his lucrative art-forgery scam and his illegal loan shark ""business"" where he promises to get desperate people the loans they need, then bilking them out of their money without providing any service. Things look up temporarily for Irving when he falls in love with Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), a stripper who has reinvented herself as slick con artist Lady Edith Greensly, an upper crust British executive.When one of their clients turns out to be FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), however, they are threatened with jail time unless they agree to use their scamming abilities to work for the bureau. Richie is an ambitious schemer who has set his sights on the higher ups in the political and crime world and is busy working on a plan. The idea he comes up with centers on rebuilding the Atlantic City waterfront to make it a haven for casinos and organized crime. To this end, DiMaso sets a trap to bring down the popular but corruptible Mayor of Camden, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), along with a few Congressmen and some upper echelon crime bosses.Richie doesn't count, however, on the loose lips of Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who does not look too kindly on her husband's partnership/affair with Sydney and who uses Irving's adopted son to hold onto their marriage. Rosalyn's sing-along rendition of Live and Let Die achieves a mixture of humor and sadness that is one of the film's high points. Things go further downhill when the fake Arab Sheik Abdullah, in reality a Mexican Fed named Paco Hernandez (Michael Pena), is caught in his Sheik act by Mafia kingpin Victor Tellegio (Robert de Niro) who, to the surprise of everyone, speaks the Arab language.As the film goes on, the characters become more over-the-top and the plot becomes more and more convoluted. By the time it ends, everyone's veracity is so compromised that it is hard to tell the difference between the swindler and the victim. The performances are such stand-outs, however, and the fun so contagious that it hardly matters anyway. American Hustle may not be the most profound statement ever made about the corruption that lies just below the surface of the American dream, but it is definitely one of the most entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Full of Twists and Turns - Con-artists at their best,"I was invited to Special VIP screening of American Hustle as the closing movie for Dubai international Film Festival Yesterday December 14th and after watching the movie, I can see why the Festival chose this movie to be it's closing act - The movie was to say the least Amazing.The acting was top notch. It was like watching 5 wonderful actors/actresses go blow by blow to the 12th round. Amy Adams was unbelievable - she nailed the role spot on. I loved her role in ""Trouble with the Curve"" but wow she was amazing. Bradley Cooper was on top of his game and so natural. There were a couple of scenes were he made me crack with laughter after an intense exchange with his boss - totally unexpected in a very heavy movie with drama and twists.But the one that surprised me the most was Jennifer Lawrence - For me her role was amazing. She justified winning the Oscars last year and in this movie, I would say she topped Amy Adams even she had lesser scenes compared to bale, Cooper, and Adams.Christian Bale played his role well, but I have never been a big fan of his but he also played the ConArtist role to perfection.All in All, I loved this movie although some might find it slow at some points but the character buildup and the unexpected twist at the end made me hooked9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Actors run amok in an excellent recreation of 1970's period detail,"American HUSTLE is a movie which is only nominally about the Abscam sting operation in late 70's/early 80's. The real heart and soul of this movie lies in the many fictional characters created for it, who are all conning each other in one way or another. Basically, the movie is about what people do in order to survive. This is a very compelling theme which is suitably explored over the course of the film, but it lacks enough narrative focus to really leave an impression. Yes, it is wonderfully acted and has some funny scenes (as well as one tense scene with a great cameo), but David O. Russell let his actors run amok with the script and it shows. On the positive side, the film features some of the best period production design and costumes I've ever seen, as well as an impeccably chosen soundtrack. Tonally, Russell seemed to be going for a Scorsese feel. This was nice, but I would have rather that Russell put more of a personal stamp on the material like he did with his previous film SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK. Still, despite being a gelatinous mess of a story, American HUSTLE is a well-made, well-acted film but not much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Well, it was boring, I fell asleep","Having read all the good reviews by critics, I cannot disagree more.. The movie is boring, and I literally fell asleep after 30 minutes of the movie. My friend tried to wake me up, and yes, I did try to make myself awake, but I just couldn't. The progression of the movie is really slow I fell asleep again. The first 15 minutes was fun, another 15 was boring - fell asleep - 20 minutes before the ending was great. Wasted £7.50 for cinema ticket.The idea of the story is not bad (but anyway, it is not a super authentic story, its another ""based on true story"" movie). But I think people expected something more from this movie merely because of the casts and nothing more. Especially the youngsters, they go gaga for Jennifer Lawrence nowadays.Lastly, the cast, however, did a good performance, especially Christian bale. But i do not think its the best performances of the year. There are many other actors and actresses who did a lot better job. So overall, it is pretty disappointing.

The film's greatest hustle is making you think it's better than it is. The performances are enormously enjoyable though.,"There are cons, hustles, lies, tricks and conspiracies aplenty in writer-director David O. Russell's Oscar-baiting American Hustle. It comes with the territory, of course, in this ostensibly based-on-a-true-story film about con artists working with the FBI to take down corrupt government officials. But one of the biggest hustles Russell pulls off is, quite simply, convincing audiences that they've just watched a great movie. There's no denying that American Hustle is filled with sizzling performances and some of the year's best scenes. But it's also a bit of a hollow, sprawling mess, strung together with great moments that don't really add up to a coherent whole.Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a small-time con artist who's figured out how to swindle his way to moderate success. Unexpectedly, he finds a soulmate in Sydney (Amy Adams), who's equally adept at lying to people and winning their trust and life savings. Rumbled by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), Irving and Sydney - the latter in the guise of her British alter ego, Lady Edith Greensly - agree to help the FBI catch government officials in the act of taking bribes. Around the hapless form of genuine good guy Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) evolves a crazy scheme comprising a made-up Arab sheikh, greedy mobsters, opportunistic politicians, real and fake money, hidden cameras... and the potentially disrupting influence of Irving's slightly unhinged wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence).At its best, there's a loose, loopy charm to American Hustle. It's a story of bad comb-overs and even worse decisions that starts out strongly, as Irving and Sydney take turns narrating their unconventional love story. Several scenes are so outlandishly silly - pretty much any involving the cooked-up Arab sheikh, Rosalyn and Richie's beleaguered boss Stoddard (Louis C.K., hilarious) - that it's impossible not to be swept up in the giddy swirl of confusion and double-crossing in which Russell's characters have wilfully trapped themselves. In those moments when the black comedy peeks through the pretense of its plot, American Hustle approaches the sublime.But Russell's film - which he's revealed is about one-third improvised - is almost too loose and it's certainly too long. The moments that everyone will remember are padded out with narrative convolutions that don't add all that much to proceedings. Most of the scenes drag on a little longer than they presumably would have if the actors had stuck to a script. It's exactly as if Russell let his actors off a leash, and couldn't bear to excise some of their more free-styling moments - even if it would contribute to a smarter, tighter final cut of the film. As a result, the considerable zip, charm and joy of American Hustle's best sequences dissipate from moment to moment, making for a curiously deflating viewing experience.There's no denying, however, that Russell has amassed a clutch of impressive performances from the combined casts of his last two films (The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook). Bale anchors the entire enterprise with a knowing, vanity-free turn as a follicly-challenged hustler with a hidden heart of gold. His silent reactions to the insanity going on around him - whether it's Richie's ego bursting through the ceiling or Rosalyn arguing him into submission - are pitch-perfect. Cooper, too, continues to prove he can actually act under Russell's direction. He has a fine handle on Richie's enormous ego and burgeoning delusions of power and control, delighting in the sheer absurdity of this lawman who gets drunk with delight when he takes a walk on the unlawful side of the street.Awards buzz has been heaped upon Russell's leading ladies as well, and for good reason. Adams spends rather too much of the film off-screen (especially in its second half), but she's so raw, brave, vulnerable and brassy - often in the same scene - that she provides the film with an unexpectedly truthful emotional core. In Adams' hands, Sydney is a rounded, sympathetic creation: one who loses and finds herself again amidst all the lies and deception.Lawrence is a hoot as the mouthy, delusional Rosalyn, tottering through the entire film like a bleached-blonde time-bomb that could explode at any second. She's scintillating, maddening and frequently hilarious, even if it's hard to shake the feeling that she's just not right for the part. Lawrence is talented, no doubt about it - so talented that she almost makes the role work - but she just can't help coming off as precisely what she is: a young girl playing dress-up. Imagine an older actress - say, Julianne Moore, Naomi Watts or heck, even Amy Adams - playing the same role; she would lend the sad, dark weight of age and experience to Rosalyn's kookiness, something the sadly miscast Lawrence can't quite muster (through no fault of her own!) at the tender age of twenty-two.Watch American Hustle for its plot - or a faithful re-enactment of the FBI's Abscam operation in the late 1970s - and you'll be sorely disappointed. Its story is a jumbled mess that isn't half as clever or complicated as it thinks it is. But Russell's cast shine brightly nonetheless. Their bold performances - and gleefully terrible hairdos - are the real strength and energy of Russell's film. For many moments, they make it easy to believe that American Hustle is the real thing. But take a closer look and it becomes clear that this diamond was really just cubic zirconia all along.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""The art of survival is a story that never ends""","American HUSTLE is a whimsical social satire on greed and the amoral rat & mouse game of FBI/governmental entrapment, with a lot of insightful stuff about the world of appearances, selfish human agendas, and the phoniness in general behind them all. Set in the late 1970s, it captures (and ridicules)that era very well, especially with its use of 70s theme music for specific scenes.While American HUSTLE kept my attention throughout its two-plus-hour length, it may move a little too slowly for some tastes and could definitely use more hard tension. Much of the persistent humor is of the smirk-guffaw variety. There are also frequent attempts at lol-slapstick, but the exploding microwaves and one guy beating another over the head with a telephone just aren't particularly funny. This film would probably have worked better if it had just stuck to dry satirical humor, keeping the one hilarious exception of the impromptu after-the-big-bust party by the feds. Anyway, there are some twisty surprises here and there, not all of which are very believable, and it ties up a bit too easily at the end. Though American HUSTLE works well as light but meaningful entertainment, the fact that it just doesn't go as far and deep as it could have keeps it from being the rip-roaring success it might have been. Better plotting, more suspense, and sharper surprise elements could have won that Oscar.All the same, Christian Bale (as not-so-bad-a-guy con artist Irving Rosenfeld), Amy Adams (as Rosenfeld's indispensable cohort Sydney Prosser), and Bradley Cooper (as self-serving FBI agent Richie DiMaso) give some nice performances here, with special kudos going to Jeremy Renner as Mayor/FBI target Carmine Polito.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great flick,"This is really a solid picture.All the performances were brilliant, but especially those of Bale and Renner. I have never seen either of them in roles such as these, and to me they were the most believable, at times crazy organic, characters that stole the show. Bale in the very least should get an Oscar nomination. Renner is so damn good, it was refreshing to see him step away from the action flicks. Even the minor players did a fantastic job, including Louis CK adding a surprisingly amazing acting performance. We know he's funny, but who knew he could act! Listen, the story is great. I had all my questions answered and nothing was left on the table. Yes, the story is a little lazy in some points, slow in others, but those few moments didn't distract from the environment that you were drawn into. Great script and direction.I guess my only gripe holding me at an 8 out of 10 stars was the performances of Cooper and Lawrence. Don't get me wrong, they were both really great, but their performances felt at times a bit copycat. Cooper didn't bring anything new to the role, I felt like I had seen him play this role a dozen times (look at his body of work before you disagree). There were even a few moments where I felt like he was trying too hard. Lawrence was the same for me. I understand she has an Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook, and that was well deserved, but this time she bit off more she can chew. Her character was inconsistent with her accent, and along with her Silver Linings costar Cooper, her performance at times felt forced and unbelievable. There is one particular scene where Lawrence and Bale are fighting in their kitchen that will make you cringe. She goes way over the top, making it cheesy. Thankfully, Bale kept the scene together, which is why I am sure it didn't end up on the 'cutting room floor'.Amy Adams was solid and I found her to be as equally mesmerizing as she was visually stunning. The film is called American Hustle because you never are entirely sure who is hustling who, and to me Adams was the most convincing. You never knew whose side she was on.Great art direction, wardrobe, and decent acting. The story was fun and interesting, and I am sure it will rake in some well-deserved awards.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Ham,"American Hustle is a fine movie, I suppose. I'm not really sure, to be honest. The problem is it's such a hamfest of a movie, it's hard to focus to know for sure.This film has a lot going on beyond the characters and the story. It's set in the 70's, and such a horrendously clichéd version of the 70's it distracts you from those characters & story. You've got the red velvet leisure suits; the badly-fitting toupees; the ridiculously over-sized automobiles; the tight-curl perms; the bra-less, droopy dresses (OK, some distractions are worth it). Folks use ""ham"" to describe over-the-top acting, but here we have undeniably ""hammy"" use of sets, costumes, props, and locations. It's as if someone said ""find me everything 70's and dump it in this movie!"".The problem is they don't just use these clichés for setting and atmosphere (like ""The Ice Storm"", for example), they just pile them up throughout the movie, right down to hackneyed scenes involving 70's-era mobsters late in the film. It's a cliché fest, and that distracts from the rest of the story. It's hard to take the main protagonist seriously under those ridiculous glasses.Then again, it is a fairly shallow plot, with a somewhat weak ""surprise ending"", wrapping up the con inside a con inside a con. You've seen it all before, in movies of the ""con man"" genre over the decades. I'm guessing the writers wanted to dump all the 70's clichés into one film and wrote tossed together a con-man script to tie them together; OR they had a fairly weak script and felt they needed to dress it up with 70's nostalgia to generate interest.The movie is OK. It has some funny moments. But it's not worth a full-price movie ticket, and is definitely not worth an Oscar nod.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Flawed for a Certain Audience,"American Hustle (2013) tells the true story which can be seen as bizarre enough, yet it's clear from the outset that director David O Russell's primary touchstones are cinematic, most notably, Scorsese's Goodfellas as seen through the refractive prism of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, with a smidgen of Whit Stillman's The Last Days of Disco sprinkled in as seasoning. In terms of awards fodder , it also owes a debt to Argo, following its winning formula of handsome stars with outlandishly retro hair arrangements reliving American stories from the late 70s that are too implausible to be entirely made up. What makes the film work are the stellar Oscar nominated performances from the main cast, which is why American Hustle is a stellar yet over flawed film. For a rewatch 07/05/17' American Hustle is quite the film, as it's story and plot are quite confusing at times but overall the acting performances and chemistry from the cast is what makes it standout. It somewhat drags on and the story isn't very typical which is why we see such hate from casual film fans, calling this film ""boring"" and ""overrated""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A whole lot of fun despite it's lack of sophistication,"Not a whole lot about American Hustle will be seen as something done differently and creatively pushing the medium of movies as we know but damn is it entertaining. With it's absolutely tasteful and enjoyable 1970s setting and the charming performances by the entire cast, it's hard to not find something to like about this film. On top of that, it has wonderful camera work with some stylistic choices from David O. Russell's previous film, Silver Linings Playbook carrying onto this one, most notably is the usage of fast paced movements of the camera either backwards or forwards that I love each and every time it is used.The story itself tells the tale of two con people, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams). The movie opens in a very interesting way with a title card saying, ""Some of this actually happened."" For one thing, it made me laugh. For another thing, it sets the tone for what is obviously a black comedy and that to me is a great way of both telling the truth (it only takes partial aspects of a real story) and getting the movie off on the right footing. The main plot of this film takes off after we establish the two main characters, most notably through Christian Bale's narration which at times really works in a very Scorsese sense but at other timesfeels a bit force. Although, some very notable pieces of dialogue come from it and probably the most thought-provoking parts of the moviewhich there isn't a whole lot of, not that every movie needs it.After the beginning of the film, Irving and Sydney eventually get caught by Richie Di Maso (Bradley Cooper) but they can be dropped of charges if they help him catch four guys, congressmen and a politician played by Jeremy Renner. This leads to some comedic events. Some serious ones. But, overall entertaining ones. Most viewers of this movie will be able to love the 1970s atmosphere with it's music and clothing as I did. Two other notable characters are Irving's wife played by Jennifer Lawrence who provides some fun, comic relief at times but is still a key component of the story with Irving and Sydney carrying an affair. But, probably the true piece of comic relief and a pleasant surprise is Stoddard Thorsen played by the always wonderful Louis C.K. who needs to be in lots and lots of movies after this. He is just so damn hilarious and plays off Bradley Cooper's character the best with a story about ice fishing that is constantly mentioned. Overall, this is a good, entertaining piece of cinema. Is it sophisticated? No, not really. To me, it is a combination of David O. Russell and Martin Scorsese and that comes off as a good thing. The cast is stellar. The comedy works. The narration sometimes works. And it's overall, a really good time, with some occasional thought provoking aspects.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I enjoyed watching this film about con artists out- conning each other. There was so much fun watching the out-of-this- world hairstyles and over-acting of each of the main cast (all Oscar pedigreed), so unlike anything we have seen them in.Christian Bale had gotten so much out of his Batman shape for this role as the Jewish conman with the elaborate comb-over hairdo. Amy Adams was no Princess Giselle in her constantly cleavage-revealing dresses. It was quite a hoot seeing Bradley Cooper in hair curlers, going more bananas than his role in The Hangover. Too bad there was too little of Jeremy Renner in his teased-up bouffant hairstyle.The best performer here is Jennifer Lawrence in a supporting role that is not directly within the main plot, yet she does so well to steal the thunder from her other co-stars by being so audacious and wild.

Superb acting - wild story,"American Hustle is one of those movies that you will spend time afterwards thinking - what happened, who did what, why? You know, similar to Memento when you keep thinking about what was real versus flashback or future view.The strongest part of this movie is the incredible acting delivered by all the characters. Christian Bale is fabulous - how does he go from Batman to a fat con man? He delivers big time, as does Amy Adams as his co-con in crime. Jeremy Renner also delivers as this somewhat crooked politician who is trying to do good, or at least, you think so. I didn't like Bradly Cooper as the FBI agent, but maybe that's why he was good. He comes off as a total dufus. Finally Jennifer Laurence delivers a fine performance as a messed-up housewife used to living the lie on Long Island. Bought and paid for, but she always wants more. And somewhat of a ditz who insists she's smart. Yeah right. Terrific acting all around.The plot is what kind of drags the movie around. You try to hang in there and figure out who is who, good or bad guy, FBI, mobster. Mostly it keeps you guessing who is the con and who is being conned. This movie may have you recalling The Sting, with Paul Newman and Robert Redford, if you want to see something similar.I am not surprised this didn't win any big awards at the Oscars.

Dirty Work,"Greetings again from the darkness. Over the years, there have been some very entertaining con artist films, and they range from outright comedy (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) to cheeky (The Sting) to dramatic (The Grifters). My personal favorite is David Mamet's House of Games, a very quiet and subtle look at the con. The stylistic opposite of Mamet's gem is the latest from director David O Russell. It's like comparing Duke Ellington to Donna Summer - both of which are featured on this soundtrack.For the past few months, I have said that this film's trailer is one of the best I have ever seen. The energy and visuals were enthralling and have had me anxiously awaiting a chance to see the film. So please understand when I say that the movie does not quite match the expectations, it's not really a criticism ... more of a tip of the cap to the marketing efforts. This is one showy, flamboyant, often frenetic wild ride that is also a bit messy and sometimes even clunky.Hair, clothes, cars, music ... the best and worst of the 1970's ... are on full display. Christian Bale sets a new standard for worst (and most elaborate and labor-intensive) comb-over in film history. Bradley Cooper's perm wins the contest for tightest curls over Emma Thompson in Saving Mr Banks. Jeremy Renner's pompadour would make any rockabilly performer envious. And let's not forget the women. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence provide a steady stream of flowing and floppy locks that would keep any shampoo or blow dryer company in business. The soundtrack, usually coordinated to story events, also includes Steely Dan, Jeff Lynne, Elton John and many others.Director Russell's most recent films include The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. He is obviously infatuated with odd characters who are slightly off from society. What better topic than con artists so desperate to be liked that they spend all effort trying to rip off the gullible types? Now mix that trait with the ambitious persona of Bradley Cooper's FBI Agent and the US Attorney played by Alessandro Nivola, and you have a collision of worlds that results in a fictionalized account of the ABSCAM events of the late 70's and early 80's. I say fictionalized because the film starts with a banner that states ""Some of this actually happened"". What did or what didn't really doesn't matter here.Who is playing whom? What is real and what is part of the con? Those are the questions that we as viewers ask, and oddly enough, these are the same questions the key characters ask. If they can't tell, we certainly have no chance.This one is all about the characters. Mr. Bale (40 lbs heavier) bears no resemblance to Batman. He embodies the falsely confident con man. Cooper is a bit over-hyped in his role, while Adams is at her best in a role that is the film's most diverse. The real explosion comes every time Jennifer Lawrence is on screen. Not only do things blow up in her kitchen, but she jolts the film in each of her scenes. Some may be tired of Ms. Lawrence's recent success, but as a film lover, I put her screen presence very near that of Marilyn Monroe. She grabs our attention and holds it. That's talent that very few possess.Supporting work that should be noted includes Louis CK as Cooper's reluctant supervisor, Michael Pena as a fake sheik (can they do that?), Jack Huston and Shea Whigaham (both from Boardwalk Empire), and the great and rarely seen Anthony Zerbe (one of the all time TV villains). There is also a high profile cameo that seems right in line with Russell's adoration of Scorcese's Goodfellas.If you are looking for a film to analyze and dissect, you will be most disappointed in this one. If you are looking for a fun, wildly visual and very entertaining retro film, this one should fit the bill. Just keep your hand on your wallet and don't be one of the suckers.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hilarious and Larger than Life,"All of the leads are outstanding in this film. Amy Adams as the soul- searching and sharp witted lover, Bradley Cooper's FBI agent jumping between violence and using his perfect timing for hilarious comedy, Jennifer Lawrence's absurd and over-bearing housewife and Jeremy Renner's big hearted good intentioned Mayor who balances out some of the more insane and unrealistic characters. Finally Christian Bale, who at this point I pray, pray, pray will continue to work with Russell to develop a relationship of continuing to bring us these over top, multi-layered characters like which we've seen here and earlier in THE FIGHTER. This is a wondrous film filled with over top characters which the film has plenty of time to really study and peel apart.

American HUSTLE -the Art of Seduction and Survival,"Suggested by actual events of the Abscam sting in the 1970s, the FBI plans to setup and arrest corrupt politicians. How they get the officials and the professional con artists that help the sting operation are the basis of a nostalgic film. As directed and co-written by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, The Fighter), American Hustle is an acting clinic highlighting a convoluted tale of men and women who are looking for a big score.In 1978, ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), forces con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his mistress, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), to help arrange a con on white collar crime, specifically targeting corrupt politicians. Richie wants to make a name for himself, and he is immediately attracted to Sydney and has designs on her beyond the con. Starting with a local, beloved mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), high level political figures are drawn in, and there is the possible organized crime connection. Further, Irving's wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), threatens to derail the sting. As Richie's grand plan comes together, things get more complicated and risky, and Irving and Sydney must rely on their skills to survive.These are very well etched characters. Each has something to gain, and each has an angle to exploit, whether it's Richie's dreams of a big bust or Rosalyn's threats to expose the operation. Kindred souls and survivors, Irving and Sydney have mastered the art of deception and manipulation. You feel a degree of sympathy for Irving despite his criminal past and his marital discord. Not only does he love his women, but he tries to save a friend from jail. Irving turns out to be someone to root for. In fact the world is not black and white especially when an FBI agent breaks the rules and gets involved with one of the principals. Carmine is the noble, elected official who truly believes in doing good for his community. Just who are the good guys and bad guys? Just who is conning who? Memorable scenes include a catty confrontation in a women's restroom, the face off between Richie and his beleaguered boss (played to great effect by Louis C. K.), and an incredibly tense meeting with a head mobster (Robert DeNiro in a lethal cameo).Acting is superior throughout as expected in a Russell ensemble with the principals at the top of their game. Bale transforms his physical appearance as an overweight, balding schlep (a far cry from The Dark Knight's Batman). A sultry Adams (Doubt, Her) has a great time playing a kindred con artist with a British accent. Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover) has a ball as the gung ho agent with a 1970s perm who will step over his boss to get his time in the sun. Lawrence (The Hunger Games, Winter's Bone) excels as the wife who exhibits a bold brashness in public which delights her onlookers but risks blowing the sting.There is liberal use of 1970's pop songs which blend with the costumes and hair styles seamlessly. The camera work is fluid and is reminiscent of early Martin Scorsese films. There is a very carefree attitude in the film's look and feel which is consistent with this loose, uninhibited decade.A slice of the seventies with freewheeling hustlers and loose morals, at its core, American Hustle is a love story centering on Irving, an imperfect con artist and the women in his life. The film is essentially a con within a con and keeps you guessing until the end. Although the film's narrative is not as tight as it could have been, Russell has sacrificed a tiny bit of substance for style. Do admire this film for the many scenes that pit flawed characters against each other. Acting does not get much better than this.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good movie with Great acting,This is one movie that can explain how good actors can turn a relatively floppy plot in to a good movie. Cristian Bale was amazingly absorbed in to the character making this movie to an engaging one for every one to watch. Amy Adams was also great with on & off distractions of the audience by her cleavage. Bradly Cooper was really impressive & now he is coming up with more characters that he can do something other than those last couple of dull character in Hangover. Jennifer Lawrence once again proved she's grown up more than to her age as an actress and the way she annoy the viewers in this movie with her voice and acting was superb.After all it was a good movie mostly because of the actors who had given the maximum to this.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
HK Auteur film review - American Hustle,"David O. Russell's latest caper American Hustle is fundamentally more interested in its characters than doing anything with them.The story is a fictionalized account of the FBI ABSCAM operation in the late 1970s. Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale), a con man, falls in love with Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), and the couple start running a con operation together. Everything seems perfect at first, but Irving refuses to leave his adopted son and wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), who refuses to divorce him. When FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam, they are forced to help him make four arrests for their release.What happens with the characters never matches the depth of their characterizations. As the narrative switches perspectives and cross-sections into the inner monologue of several characters, it keeps the viewer perpetually wondering who is the main character of the story. The con, or more specifically the plot, is cast to the side. The joy of watching the construction of the con is not present; O. Russell is not interested in those nuts and bolts.Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are all very good and very free in their parts. Louis C.K. even has a funny supporting role as Bradley Cooper's FBI superior who is frequently bullied. Despite of the nominations, the acting is not Oscar worthy. It just seems like it should be.O. Russell directs like an acting coach running a class exercise, having the actors improvise scenes and go off script to no end. The scenes do feel raw and unrehearsed. At its best, energy is building and chaos seems to be imminent, like a lit fuse burning its way to the end of a dynamite stick that we cannot see. At its worst, it feels plodding and going over information we already know. The inverse effect is it makes the actors, as good as they are in their parts, look like they are playing dress up. So as much as it wants to be an anarchic character study, the final result is oddly shallow.American Hustle does not quite live up to its awards hype. The truth is, it was over-hyped from the beginning, and somehow David O. Russell has everybody believing he has made something good. Or somehow the people just want to believe he has made something good. Good for him, but I really doubt anybody will be talking about this film six months from now when the hype dies down.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Walked Out,"I suffered through an hour of this attempt at a movie. I am befuddled by its high rating. I was the second party to walk out. I am not sure what they were attempting to do here as the movie failed to pull me in. The acting was fine, however it could not overcome a lame script. The big joke is that I was the ""American that was hustled"" ha ha I was hustled out of 12 bucks and an hour of my time. In my opinion the humor was stupid and predictable. However, there were some in the audience that seemed to enjoy it. Watch the trailer and if you like that kind of humor then go and see if you get hustled like I was. On top of sitting through a very mediocre movie my popcorn was less than stellar. My comments are in line with many others. So I remained confused, how did it get such a high rating? Do not get hustled like I did. Go see ""Philomena"" a movie that has a story that connects.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great acting,"I just end to saw this movie for second time, (once in the theater, once in BD). This is a great movie. Maybe the story is not so great, but the acting i superb (I look for the details the second time). All the actors are great in their roles, is a pity that no one get the Oscar, all deserves of them deserves. They really transmit the inner felling of their characters at any moment, (specially while they have to con someone they don't really want to con). This movie deserve to by watched for the acting of this five actors, and if you like the genre you really would enjoy this masterpiece recreating the 60's end 70's starting period.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Funny, Clever, Shallow, Gimicky","""American Hustle"" is a laugh-out-loud funny, very clever, well-produced, well-acted movie about conmen, crooked politicians, and an FBI sting operation. I enjoyed it while I was watching it but it left me empty. I didn't care about any of the characters or the plot points. I wasn't rooting for anybody and I wasn't involved in anything. Ultimately ""American Hustle"" felt been-there-done-that to me, and gimmicky and shallow. It reminded me of a lot of previous films about lovable gangsters and conmen, like ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Sting,"" and ""Guys and Dolls."" Christian Bale as petty conman Irving Rosenfeld reminded me of Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit.The gimmicks begin as the movie opens. It opens on a shot of Christian Bale's fat and bloated stomach. Bale is famous for losing weight for his role in ""The Machinist."" Then he became buff and muscular for ""Batman."" For ""American Hustle"" Christian Bale gave himself a fat gut. His fat gut takes up about thirty seconds of screen time and Bale could have played the role without it. His gut took me out of the movie. I started thinking, not about the character or the plot, but about Bale's tendency to gain or lose weight for roles. I assume he's pushing for an Oscar. I felt manipulated.The plot is pretty pointless. A small time conman, Irving (Christian Bale) and his conwoman girlfriend Sydney / Edith (Amy Adams) are recruited by FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper) to snag crooked politicians, including the mayor of Camden Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) gets in the way and causes some comic mayhem. Robert DeNiro shows up as a dangerous Mafioso.The production values are very high. The costumes are outrageous: velvet tuxedos and open shirts revealing hairy chests and gold chains. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are all decked out and paraded like models. In ""Night at the Museum 2"" Amy Adams wore tight, flesh-colored jodhpurs. Everyone talks about her butt in that movie. In ""American Hustle"" she wears plunging necklines and slit skirts. Everyone will be talking about her breasts and legs.The direction is fluid and musical – you feel like you're on an amusing ride. 1970s pop hits make up the soundtrack and action is choreographed to fit the music.The movie is laugh-out-loud funny, funnier than some films billed as comedies. It's hard to tell what genre the film is meant to be, because there are scenes where characters are obviously in pain.The audience is conned as well as the characters on screen. There is a surprise. The surprise felt pretty cheap to me. The surprise was executed not by cleverness, but simply by hiding information from the audience.The performances are all fun to watch and very strong. Problem for me was that each performance seemed to exist in its own world. Christian Bale is doing comedy and parody. He is mocking the character he plays, and low class conmen in general. Jennifer Lawrence is weak. She is pretty, pouty, and young, but I didn't catch any acting talent. Bradley Cooper, as the FBI agent, is intense and grating in his hyper ambition and lack of smarts and caution. His character never came together for me, never achieved any coherence.Amy Adams is the heart of the movie. She is fiercely intelligent, deadly, really, in her amorality and her love for her man. The real standout is Jeremy Renner as Camden, NJ, mayor Carmine Polito. Renner is from a completely straight, serious movie. He comes across not as an actor playing a role, but as the ""real"" Carmine Polito, though Polito is a fictional character based on former Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti.""American Hustle"" depicts conflict between straight, square people who tell the truth and con artists who lie, cheat and steal. As is often the case in Hollywood films, ""American Hustle"" comes down firmly on the side of con artists. ""Everybody's a con artist!"" the film wants you to believe. ""Everybody lies, cheats, and steals!"" Hollywood would take this stance because Hollywood manufactures illusions.""American Hustle"" alters history to make this position believable. ""American Hustle"" becomes heavy-handed in its insistence on manipulating its audience into liking two characters and disliking a third. Camden's mayor was not the saint the film wants you to think he was, and the real Irving didn't do the kindly things the film depicts him as doing. Camden, NJ, is a horrible place to live. Its population is shrinking. It ranks first in violent crime. Political corruption is rampant. In making a saint out of the mayor of Camden, David O. Russell sticks his Hollywood finger in the eye of New Jersey's poor and crime victims.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scamming movie filled with love and dogged by ethics,"This movie will ultimately take its place as an American classic like Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, and Moonstruck.The acting is in a league of its own, especially that of Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro.I was not aware of Christian Bale and Robert De Niro acting. I totally believed they were the characters they played.But those 3 are just slightly more stellar than everyone else. Every single character leaps off the screen and is right there with you. They're almost in your seat.The story boarding and plot are masterful and brilliantly creative--lots of clever twists, lots of human tragedy humor, lots of big drama interspersed with quiet drama.The script is sometimes like great literature but almost always more natural and conversational than most scripts. The characters talk with each other not at each other. There's something new and fresh about the entire movie.And surprisingly, it is filled with love and ethics.Plus a fun bonus--there are two moments when the characters sing along with the songs being played as background music.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worth seeing for the clothes and the comb over,"Once again I went expecting too much and once again I did not get it. Bale was magnificent as the leader of the con, Bradley Cooper was also first rate. The women were just not on the same level. I think this is an interesting and entertaining movie, but there is very little to root for or even care about. I am also now sure that after Silver Linings Playbook and this I am not seeing the fascination with David Russell. They are decent movies but the lavish praise he gets just doesn't make sense to me!I did enjoy the music and Jeremy Renner does fine work as the mayor. Will someone please tell Robert De Niro he is no longer effective as a tough. I have seen him in too many roles to think of him as anything other than a caricature of himself.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A whopping success,"Its not like me to usually agree with the films that are up for the most Oscar nominations. But I've got to admit to being impressed with ""American hustle"" before I even knew it had been so widely praised by everyone else.Yes, I went into the cinema (making myself go because I hadn't been for a while) knowing only that Christian Bale was probably going to be great in a film I knew very little about. Except that it was set in the 70's.Little did I know the whole film was going to be a whopping success. ""American Hustle"" has a decent story, is unexpectedly funny, and is jam packed full of great performances. Which got me really into this, as even actors I previously thought were over-rated, or nothing more than good looking stars were great here.I'd go as far as saying ""American Hustle"" has single handily changed my opinion of at least 2 actors I previously had little interest in. Amy Adams in particular is amazing in this. While Bradley Cooper was also good, as a character who surprisingly adds a lot of laughs to the film. But perhaps unsurprisingly the stand out stars are Bale and Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence in-particular steals every scene, while Bale, as usual, puts everything he's got into his main part.Just go into ""American hustle"" with an open mind, like I did. Don't let the hype that is now behind the movie build it up to some sort of impossible standard. It is simply a funny, classy, well made flick, that I couldn't take my eyes of off for over 2 hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle was pretty compelling if a bit overrated,"Today, I watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen it previously. I knew of its Golden Globe wins for Best Picture-Comedy or Musical, Best Actress-C or M: Amy Adams, and Best Supporting Actress: Jennifer Lawrence. And this morning, there were Oscar noms for Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, and all four acting categories for Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper as well as Ms. Adams and Ms. Lawrence. Now, my friend said it was okay after seeing it for the second time. Me, I'm pretty much the same in reacting to it. I mean, there were some funny moments and some compelling scenes and dialogue exchanges but after a while, I did admit to feeling confused at some tone changes and whether we're supposed to feel for some of these characters or not. I thought the Bale character the most compelling of them and if he wins, I'll be glad. The other nominated performances don't seem as compelling but I wasn't too bored even when some scenes seem to not have much of a point. I suppose I would have to watch again to maybe get a better flow of what this picture was trying to accomplish. Still, American Hustle is worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

considering all the pub...,"I was expecting it to be better. I thought this was fair, but there have been better movies made about the fbi, mob, and swindlers. And this movie clocks in at over 2 hours, so if you devote the time to see it, pay attention; otherwise, some of it won't make sense.You have Irving and Sydney scamming people out of money. The fbi come in and agent Richie gives them a deal. Help the fbi bust some dirty players, and they will get off scot free. So they get mixed up in politicians, bribing senators, and the mob. They are wearing wires to try to get money exchanging hands. Then you have Irving's wife thrown in for sex appeal since she just wears low cut tops. So I guess the big twist is, will Irving give up the mob and possibly risk retribution. Will the plan work with the fbi so he gets out of prison?

My favorite director to hate,"I went to see American Hustle and expected a lot. With that cast, who wouldn't? Especially with Bale, as I cannot recall one single bad movie he ever did. Well... now I do! This movie is terrible. The script is meaningless: These guys ain't con artists. They are small time crooks. The story is based on a con by those con-artists, but you just cannot buy it. No cons are shown, nothing to impress us.And the acting... they are all just yelling. Just like a really bad Almodovar movie. After seen 50minutes of the movie, with all the yelling, stupid acting by great actors, actors that also played in the equally terrible 'Silver Linings Playbook' (Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro) I connected the dots. It was Mr. David O. Russell that did the directing!! I did not know that before going to see the movie. After 'Silver Linings' I must have erased this director from my personal universe, a mistake I will never make again.This movie is a great example of huge marketing and a bad bad movie, that will even go to the Oscars, just cause people are so idiotic to think they actually liked it, cause it was promoted so much. Silver Linings Playbook did not belong to the Oscars... did not belong to the theaters either. Neither does this movie.Avoid at all costs!!! Don't watch it even for free, cause your 2 lost hours cannot be paid off. Don't buy every shitty movie they are trying to sell you.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"All form, not enough substance","I'm one of the minority who didn't really enjoy this movie all that much. The laughter and clapping at the viewing I went to (in Florida) surprised me. I actually fell asleep for about 15 minutes during the first half.This is a movie that hinges on dialogue, character development, writing and setting. There were some amazing character-driven scenes in this movie. It's very strong on these points.As everyone has noted, the acting was astonishing. I enjoyed these performances, just as I enjoyed the 70s music. I'm glad I've seen Jennifer Lawrence's unforgettable performance as Rosalyn Rosenfeld. However, I'm wondering about the casting of Bale and Renner. They both did excellent jobs, but what is the point of taking actors to these strange places?I suppose part of my problem with this movie was that I simply didn't like these characters. All this talent and effort, just to show us the world of these unlikeable, pathetic people.Also, this movie had themes I have little interest in. Small-time hustling, sting operations, New Jersey, political corruption, the mob.

Pay Attention,"A film that polarises opinions, I see. I watched it cold, as it were, not having read any reviews before walking into the theatre, so I was able to see it without expectations or preconceptions.It is about manipulation, about players playing, about situations spinning away from characters with their own agendas. FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) browbeats small-time con artists and lovers Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) into helping him set up a sting designed to entrap corrupt politicians. Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) is the streetwise but sincere political wheeler-dealer at the centre of the operation and Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) is a wonderful wild card, an engaging loose cannon functioning as a kind of neurotic deus ex machina.The direction (David O. Russell) chops up real-time and flashback action, post-modernist style. Much of the dialogue was apparently improvised, and it shows - in a good way. Jennifer Lawrence in particular comes out with several choice, laugh-out-loud lines, but you don't know which (if any) are hers and which come from the laptops of writers Russell and Eric Warren Singer. The interminable, episodic ice- fishing shaggy dog story of DiMaso's exasperated boss, Louis CK (Stoddard Thorsen) is almost certainly scripted and worthy of Lawrence Sterne.The late-1970s setting is meticulously observed, from Bale's ludicrous oldest-swinger-in-town comb-over to the whalefin lapels to the many medallions nestling on hairy chests (Did we really dress like that in the 1970s? Er, yes). The starring chest of the film, while we're on the subject, is the one constantly over-exposed, from every angle, by Adams's navel-deep cleavage. (Insert your own golden globes joke here.) It actually got a bit distracting over the 138 minutes. But I survived somehow.American Hustle is an ensemble piece with no clear-cut heroes or villains, no white-hat-black-hat dynamic, no good-girl-bad-girl dichotomy. The characters think they are being proactive but in fact they are reactive; they wobble on shaky ground, their tumultuous allegiances, expediencies and relationships swirling in confusion, emotions running high, sexual tensions at snapping point. Who's playing whom? Is anyone really pulling the strings? What's the real scam? There is no telling. Complication mounts on complication as Russell scatters expositional red herrings all over the screen, the big tease.And therein lies the film's chaotic genius. Pay attention to it. American Hustle is a work that repays concentration. Hell, you've paid for your ticket, get your money's worth and engage. This is no glib, easy, sit-back-and-munch-your-popcorn caper movie; it is demanding and difficult. The actors' performances are utterly convincing, without exception, and the characterisation sufficiently excessive to be human - which is to say, the characters are realistically fallible, occasionally over the top, and often none too pretty. They mess up. They get things wrong when the situation runs away from them, and it is always running away from them. They're just like the rest of us.I came away firmly on the pro- side of the polarity. I'll be buying the DVD so I can backtrack over the detail I missed. Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Classic Film making. I wish it could have been done so well, without some uncalled for dialogs.","Classic Film making. I wish it could have been done so well, without some uncalled for dialogs.Yes, there is a plot, there is a twist and there is more to add to characters than what they are, and there is style. This is what classic films are made of. Interesting characters, good plot and good production values. Yet, there is something missing called good dialog and good screenplay, that would have made this good film a great film.I liked it, but I was OK with it and did not feel any better after watching this. The dialogs are made up of nail polish and hairstyles which seem so irrelevant actually. Yet, they are made to fit into the plot. What role will a nail polish play in a con man's life. Indeed I dozed off midway through the first hour and when I woke up 10 minutes later, nothing changed, I could catch up with the film pretty easily. That's the pace of the film. It's slow and involves lot of talking.I have no problem in listening to dialog, but dialog of this kind is tough to bear. The plot is about money and the dialog seems to deviate all that. So that's the main thing that did not work for me. Else, unquestionably it is a good film technically. The art direction, costume design, make up are wonderful. Cinematography was good but at times, there was noise on screen. My biggest crib is editing. Was it deliberately made into such a long movie? I am sure if I were the editor, it would have been considerably less in time.The best part though is acting. All the actors have performed exceedingly well. From Christian Bale as Irving, the protagonist to Robert De Niro who comes in a guest role. It is terrific acting. I do not want to say anything about the plot, but just giving the meaning of hustle here.The music used was also good, the Jefferson Airplane song ""White Rabbit"" is in Arabic and is nice.

...........WOW!!!,"First of all, I really want to know how Christian Bale is getting thin, muscular and fat in no time.. is it only me, or everyone is wondering how does he do that?American Hustle is directed by David O. Russell, written by Eric Warren Singer and David O. Russell, and starring Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence.American Hustle tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down.With no doubt American Hustle is one of the best movies of 2013, and it's also one of the best Crime/Drama movie ever! I loved it so much that don't even know where should I start from! Everything with this movie is so amazing, very close to be perfect... It's well-acted, strong story, surprising, rewatchability, funny, great script but the direction isn't so perfect, and here's the only flaw and what made this movie not perfect is the direction! It's not bad at all, sometimes it was energized and exciting, but in some moments it felt like a mob-cam caption, and I didn't like that, but still David O. Russell did such a great job writing with Eric Warren Singer, and with the direction though!This movie is full of great casting, like Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper, beside Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. Everyone I mentioned or the rest of the crew was so convincing and talented, especially these 5! They are so memorable, with lots of lines which're going to stick in you memory for very long time, not only because it's a very good script, also because it has a very convincing cast!The story is very catchy and entertaining, with a very surprising finale, beside the hooking two acts, American Hustle did them all right, beside how powerful the story is! The story is so realistic, nothing overreacted or not real, nothing. A 2h 18min movie with no boredom or even looking at the clock to know what time is it. Some movies have a very good story with a terrible script, and American Hustle isn't one of them, it has the strong story mixed with well-written script combined with humor, presented to us by some very amazing cast!American Hustle could've been better if David O.

Fantastically well assembled 70's set hit,"(68%) Good film, no doubt about it. The writing is so far beyond the average flick that it's almost uncanny, really damn good dialogue, and very funny too. The cast is fantastic, and they are running on all eight cylinders, with the always impeccable Mr Bale anchoring the entire movie perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence almost steals the movie, she is truly brilliant and playing way beyond her years. There is a somewhat similar feel to this and ""GoodFellas"" in terms of great actors acting great, along with the way it's all put together with the setting being about 40 years in the past, the use of music and character narration etc, and maybe this is not as bold or as ground-breaking as that movie, but this is still quite an accomplishment.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Alright,"In this movie Russell let the actors improvise. Christian Bale, who plays Irving Rosenfield, said that he was worried that they will lose the plot at the script, but Russell told him that he is not so interested in that as much as the expressiveness and development of the characters. Unfortunately, Bales anxieties came true, and throughout the film there's a bunch of unnecessary sentences and sequences that do not have too much to do with the main course of action, so that the viewer inevitably at times loses attention. The film itself does not carry any special message, or forces us to any thinking. It's a bunch of over-expressed characters in one place with witch the observer cannot identify himself with. The great things are the costume and set designs that are carefully presented and authentically reflect the atmosphere of the time they talk about.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
opportunity missed,"This is a very basic review of the movie and in my humble opinion a GREAT opportunity missed. The plot is excellent, the acting is genuinely outstanding: Bale, Adams and Lawrence are absolutely at the top of their game and could make an argument for being the top three actors around at the moment - this is not to slight Bradley Cooper he is excellent, but the level the others are at is fantastic.The miss? Well great plot and amazing actors SHOULD mean a better film. I am no expert but the Director must take responsibility for this. There were SO many scenes where the acting made it work but you always felt it could have been even better - damn was annoying. Additionally. ""support"" actors were for example Robert De Niro - doing something for which he is ""the man"" and Jeremey Renner for goodness sake.a film not compared to this so far is The Departed -which is stellar cast great acting AND great directing.

Not a simple plot movie,"American Hustle it's a treasure. From the beginning, you feel identified with any of the characters. The good order of the history, the excellent actors performances, a good environment, makes you feel back in the time, like you live back in the 70's.All actors performances was perfectly acting. Amy Adams feels so engagement with her character, at the point that you feel's that she's Sydney in real live. Cooper was cool, but not one of my favorites. But Bale, god! He's acting performance was incredible. At the beginning you maybe feels that he's absent, but in the development hes take's his site.If you want to compare this movie, I guess you need to think a little in Catch Me If You Can (2002).

"A movie rich of complicated, well-developed, and fascinating characters!!!!!!!!!!!","A fictional film set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock our nation, American Hustle tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down. Like David O. Russell's previous films, American Hustle defies genre, hinging on raw emotion, and life and death stakes.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good acting in the mediocre movie,"I think that ten Oscar nominations are really too much. Some nominations I cannot comment because I have no knowledge about those specific fields in cinematography, but nominating this for the best movie of the year and the best original scenario is absolutely ridiculous. Bunch of movies has been made about con artists and mainly they are better than this one. The movie is interesting, but mediocre. Leading four really did a good job. In my opinion, in this movie, Jennifer did not deserve to be nominated for Oscar, but Bale, Adams, and Cooper nailed it. I would give it somewhere between five and six, but because of Bale and Cooper, I had to increase it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The hustle is not what you think it is,"THE GOOD: performances, technical values, several good scenes. THE BAD: weak narrative, worst overuse of classic rock songs since ""Elizabethtown"".Now that the award season is over, maybe we can move past the hype, the anti-hype, the plants, and the trolls, and have an actual discussion of ""American Hustle"".David O. Russel's trait is tragicomically focusing on characters and relationships with their families, both real and surrogate (similar to Alexander Payne and Paul Thomas Anderson), and how their particular psychological issues affect those around them (a la Woody Allen). What sets him apart is that his characters' relationships are dynamic, fluid, changing. For ""American Hustle"", he attempts to marry this to a riff on ""Goodfellas"".The result: while ostensibly being a fast-paced, witty, sprawling semi-biographical tale about cops, robbers, politicians, and scams in the 70s, with very stylized directing and boiling tension, it really is something else. Russell focuses on two themes, the first being how its characters deceive themselves and others, carrying facades, multiple identities, double-relationships, hypocrisies, and false beliefs about themselves - all while striving for attention and recognition. This is started with the first shot, that of a character assembling his daily false appearance. The second theme is about characters vying for power, alternating between becoming the lead player and secondary players. When they are secondary characters, they blend into the background, sulk, form new alliances, and strike back. Russell gets great performances from his actors as they navigate these dynamics, with Amy Adams perhaps getting the heaviest work-out.What we get is almost two movies, going back and forth. We have some clever, well-made scenes of a con set up and its dangerous potential aftermath, and then some artfully crafted scenes where the characters bond, boil up, and fall apart. Russell rarely succeeds in getting these two movies to work together, and when transitioning, tries to throw in some stylish moves. Some of these work well, at other times he makes some awkward decisions, particularly with an overuse of the soundtrack. I liked the movie, but it would often disengage me, and I was wondering if we had arrived at the end. Some scenes felt repetitive. I am not certain is the disjointed narrative is due to the editing, or it is due to Russell re-writing a different screenplay.There are more pluses and minuses. The wardrobe and set design are outstanding. However, Russell is less successful at portraying southern New Jersey (Camden is essentially East Philadelphia, but is portrayed as Newark/Western New York) than he was at portraying e.g. Boston and Philadelphia in his recent movies.There are several unforgettable scenes in this movie (e.g. Adams' character's seductions of Cooper's character, the mobster interview with the fake sheik, some of Jennifer Lawrence's character's tirades of unaccountability). If only it had been glued better together.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A cocktail that left me high !!,"I was waiting for this film and finally got to see it last weekend.Simply put, its a cocktail that hit me well and I was on a high when I left the theatre.A nice story with a brilliant screenplay and some terrific dialogues. Add to this, Russell's direction and fine performances from its cast. Frankly, all the 5 actors are my favorites.Bale shows why he a terrific performer. Unrecognizable with a paunch and wig, he's brilliant as Irving. A wrong man but you feel pity for him because of the circumstances he is in by the end credits.Adams is sexy and uses her eyes beautifully to express herself while Lawrence is brilliant as Bale's nutcase wife. Lawrence has some of the best dialogues in the film and she uses her body language to the tee. She is 22 yrs old but plays the mother's part with perfection.Check out the scene where Adams and Lawrence meet in the washroom...Mindblowing.Cooper is excellent as the success crazy and jerk FBI officer. He shows his desperation well while Renner plays his part well as a man who innocently gets caught in this muddle.Loved the film and a must watch !!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Bummer to hear that Christian Bale got a herniated disk in his back because he gained so much weight and had terrible posture. I was upset that it was a bust.

Not bad but Average.,"The only great thing about the movie is its IMDB rating!
It's a pretty ordinary movie - 20% bit too long and 80% lesser comedy than what could have been there. Christian Bale is a great actor but he fails miserably to make you chuckle, let alone a laugh! If I recall, only Robert de Niro in that table scene and Bradley cooper here and there occasionally were able to make me laugh. One admirable thing is the love story of Bale and Amy Adams. It was a bit unexpected but it's likeable. Also a few twists were unexpected you like it when it happens.
Hence, it's not a bad movie by any means. So you can definitely watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle,"In David O. Russell's American Hustle, Christian Bale plays a conman who works - and is in a relationship - with Amy Adams, although he's also married to Jennifer Lawrence's character. When they're caught by Bradley Cooper's FBI agent, a deal is made for their freedom if they'll cooperate and put a sting on the local mayor, played by Jeremy Renner. Set in 1978, American Hustle is brimming with style, confident performances and astute direction mixed with a terrific soundtrack that features Duke Ellington, Wings, Frank Sinatra, Elton John and Ella Fitzgerald, amongst others. It's well written and perceptively clever, although it's more akin to being a showcase for the broad performances of its stars than a clear narrative. A narrative that may have more to say about post-Watergate political corruption and underworld influence had it remained more focused on singular story-telling aspects. Instead, Russell doesn't allow the intricacies of the plot to easily settle, keeping the performances taught and the audience engaged in those performances in spite of any subtext that may be culled. And the performances are excellent on every level, although Bale does look quite similar to Tom Cruise's Les Grossman -- and there are broad comic strokes abound here. Especially in a character we first see gluing down a piece of turf-cum-hair onto his head before working on the most elaborate comb-over you'll ever see. But that's key to the narrative and a world in which the characters exist solely on what they outwardly project -- Amy Adams is particularly good here, with dual accents and a a sexual allure that has who she wants doing what she wants. Although Jennifer Lawrence's performance reaches moments of tour-de-force bringing her own sexuality met with a coy duplicity and a touch of naivety amidst the scheming. Cooper and Renner have more straightforward parts, but bring a strong and vibrant presence to key roles. Whilst the feeling for the period, complete with garish and revealing outfits, works a treat and adds its own facet of curiosity amidst flared trousers, gaudy jewellery and plunging necklines. The ultimate payoff may not have the sting one would hope for, but this is vibrant and knowing film-making that asks for repeated viewings and faulters only in making an apology for the kind of characters we enjoy spending time with.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Bring a pillow for the first 30 minutes,"Good Performance by the Batman although not the best of his career, he did just as good if not better in Out of the Furnace. Renner's hair looks too fake for not being your typically old mayor. He could have appeared with a more natural look. He looks like he just dyed his hair but was not necessary because he is not old in the movie where you can justify that he probably was getting rid of the gray. What was up with Amy Adams British accent? Way overdone on the accent and unnecessary. Great performance by Jennifer Lawrence. The DeNiro cameo by far the best part of the movie. If I have to associate this movie with Oscar in the same sentence it would have to include Jennifer Lawrence she was amazing and finally a woman.

fun plastic world,"In this exaggerated, over the top world the human drive is to get one over and out hustle the fellow man. The hustle is the theme of life in this 1970s New York City world. The convoluted plot was fun to follow, seeing where it meanders with tensions intensifying ultimately crescendo-ing into chaotic surprises. The chaos of the film may reflect the chaos the characters are feeling as the ""hustle"" ignites and explodes into danger.A boring beginning with not the most thrilling characters ever created evolves into a more fun tricky plot. In order to preserve the mystery of the hustle we must be kept at a distance from some of the characters. We are never quite able to enter some of their heads until the very end, so throughout the movie the characters are vague and lack substance in our eyes. This distancing makes connecting with them difficult. So you ultimately don't really care too much about these characters.American Hustle glorifies its actors and actresses. The overly exalted Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are showcased in many scenes strutting their stuff with haughty confidence and moxy in slow motion. These are all good actors and I'd like to see them brought into more of a reality instead of put on pedestals and thrust down our throats. Overall each of the actors had their moments and at other times they were over the top.American Hustle can be watched for a fun plot that makes you think during the viewing about the motivations of the characters and who is trying to hustle who.

Superb performances by Bale and Adams,"American Hustle Review By Kenneth Billings Valley Thunder ProductionFrom the moment I saw the trailer for American Hustle, it leaped to the top of my ""must see"" list. Boasting the most impressive ensemble cast of any film this year, this story of a clever anti-hero and his literal partner in crime promised the potential to be a contender for either the top prize either the Oscars or the Razzies, leaving no room for middle ground. As the honors continue to stack up for ""Hustle"" during awards season, it is obvious that the talents of David O. Russell, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, and Jeremy Renner more than delivered. Though billed as a ""comedy"", ""Hustle"" does not fit so neatly in this genre and should only cautiously be considered alongside 2013's other laughter-seeking fare. While ""Hustle"" has some definite ""laugh out loud"" moments and you will without question find yourself smiling as you leave the theater, Russell's story is much deeper than the typical jokes, gags, and one-liners relied upon by films in this category. In ""Hustle"" you will find yourself rooting for the criminal cheating on his wife while empathizing with him for his choice, longing for the good-guys comeuppance, heartbroken and hopeful for the co-conspirator/mistress, and being equally appalled, sympathetic and happy for the selfish, self-indulgent wife. Lastly, you will find yourself pondering (and ultimately discovering the answer to) the great life question posed by Russell – ""What the hell is the relevance and importance of a damn bottle of fingernail polish?"" As equally impressive as Russell's carefully crafted story, and possibly more so, are the performances delivered each and every member of the cast. When a film boasts an ensemble such as this, it is often a victim of its own provenance falling woefully short of its potential. In ""Hustle"" however, the obvious chemistry between the actors, coupled with the masterful individual performances and Russell's storytelling set a new high-water-mark. Though much of the press surrounding individual performances in ""Hustle"" has centered on Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, I find myself scratching my head at the fact that Christian Bales performance is being so overshadowed and that he is only considered an outside contender for the Best Actor Oscar. Perhaps it is because I am partial to character actors, but to me it is the artists who truly transform themselves into the character they create who are the elite artists and master craftsmen of the screen – performers like Daniel Day Lewis, Jauqin Phoenix, and Johnny Depp. These are performers who go beyond playing a role to becoming the person they portray. Christian Bale has become one such performer. Bale impressed me immensely with his portrayal of Dicky Eglund in ""The Fighter"" but in ""Hustle"" he solidified my respect and admiration for his craftsmanship. In portraying Irving Rosenfeld, Bale, in my opinion, reached a level few actors attain. In his performance, Bale became ""lost"" in his character in a way that had nothing to do with costuming, comb-overs, or prosthetics. Staring at the screen, I saw not an actor portraying a character, but an individual coming to life on screen so believably he could have stepped onto a street in 1979 New York City and no one would have raised a brow. From his dialect, cadence, mannerisms, and gestures to his accent and appearance, Bale disappears into Irving Rosenfeld leaving us with a performance hard to match by anyone. Like Bale, Amy Adams continues to deliver performances that seemingly overshadow each one before Adams turn as Sydney is no exception. In portraying the con-artist/co-conspirator/mistress of Rosenfeld, the most naturally beautiful woman in Hollywood turns in another knockout performance giving us a mere glimpse at the emotional range she brings. I have long admired Adams talent as an actress. I believe that her star will only continue to rise and ultimately she will be considered one of the greats. However, when it was announced earlier this year that she would be taking up the role of hell-raising, hard-partying rock pioneer Janis Joplin I found myself scratching my head. Adams is a beautiful, refined woman in every sense.Janis Joplin – not so much. How the hell was that ever going to work? True, Charlize Theron's transformed from blonde vixen to the rough around the edges and everywhere in between serial killer Eileen Wornoss, but like Bale she disappeared thoroughly into the character. How on earth, would the astoundingly beautiful Adams be able to pull off a transformation into the more than ""plain Jane"" Joplin? Watching ""Hustle"" however, I soon had my answer. As I watched Adams portrayal of ""Sydney"" at her most emotional and vulnerable stage – crying, with puffy red eyes, un-coiffed hair, etc – I got it. Though much has been made of Lawrence's performances of late, I'll confess – I have never been a big fan. Not that she isn't a talented actress, I just haven't seen examples of her ability to the extent to find her living up to the hype. In ""Hustle"" however she earned a great deal of respect from me as she displayed an emotional range I had not yet seen, and her role in the film afforded her the opportunity to more fully explore a more complex character than those she has portrayed in the past. Ultimately, ""American Hustle"" promised a big bang for the buck and delivered on every count. Russell's carefully crafted story combined with stellar performances by the film's stars created a movie not to be missed. Though it may miss out on the Oscar's biggest prize because of the Academy's trend to avoid financially successful films, ""Hustle"" should be by no means avoided anyone who considered themselves either a devoted or casual movie fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Review: American Hustle/Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,"The heist film genre is one of the most exciting film genres in recent memory, thanks to the likes of elaborate minds and stylistically driven directors. From Soderbergh's Ocean trilogy which began the trend of mainstream, modern-day cops-and-robbers films, to other very meticulously crafted caper films, the heist genre is one which is both exciting and compelling to crack before the climactic final act. American Hustle is a modern day, somewhat self-indulgent, patriotic heist film with outstanding performances, many good times and very few bad times. The beauty of Hustle lies in its amazing ability to fake it; whether it be faking an overly complicated narrative for no apparent reason or a meaningful story that never gets old, Hustle is a solid film that will con your heart, through and through.American Hustle is a testament to a very powerful, respected and hard-working director. David O. Russell is a director who focuses more on his characters than he does on his story, and it is easily noticed in Hustle. Each and every one of the performances in his newest writing/directing credit is every bit as evolved and appreciated as his last. O. Russell has proved, time and time again, that his ability to get the best performances out of his actors is one of his many featured signatures. From Melissa Leo, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jacki Weaver, Robert Di Nero, and Jennifer Lawrence, O. Russell brings a furious velocity to his characters in the form of his actors that have ended in Oscar glory, if not recognition, at the very least.American Hustle is a con film showing the real con-artists as small time players against the biggest con artists of the world; the American government and the American judicial system. Hustle is a loose re-telling of the events following the investigation of the operation named ""Abscam"".Like any good story being told, it begins, and will always begin with a girl. That girl, in this case, is Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), or Lady Edith Greensly, either way, it starts with a girl, as do most American narratives. When low-level con artist and small-time businessman Irving Rosenfeld meets stripper Sydney at a party in 1978, the two begin a love-affair that involves low-level stakes at fraud and scamming, unbeknownst to Irving's unstable wife at the time, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). As Irving and Sydney meet investors and embezzle their money, they attract the attention of undercover FBI agent Richie Di Maso (Bradley Cooper). Desperate to make a name for himself, Di Maso entraps the two con-artists in a scam that includes the mayor of Camden, New Jersey Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), various members of Congress, and the mafia.While Irving's life spins completely out of control between spiralling cons, a love triangle between him, Sydney, and Richie, as well as his manipulating and out of control wife, Irving must master the fine art of deception so that he and Sydney can still come out with their lives.Much like the marketing of the film, and true to the style of the director, the performances are at the forefront of Hustle. Turning in two of the best performances of his career (the other being the slow burning thriller Out of the Furnace) Bale solidifies his confidence as a serious method actor. Bale's dedication to the craft, whether it be his outrageous weight-gain or loss, heightens his performances.Other stand-out performances include Amy Adams, whose confused and beguiling depiction of a desperate woman in search of love, happiness, and the American dream, is met wholeheartedly when she delivers lines like ""you're nothing to me until you're everything"". Adams sheds her good-girl image as she did for O. Russell previously in The Fighter, by playing the sexy pillar to her love interests. Much like Julia Roberts did in Erin Brockovich, I'm not sure if Adams deserves the supporting Oscar nomination or if her constantly revealing side-boob does. Either way, Adams seduces her leading men in high fashion, and ironically enough, low fabric.Lawrence, who won the Oscar for Lead Actress with O. Russell's highly over-rated Silver Linings Playbook last year as another unstable, slutty persona, really gives a sense of her characters unwillingness to change. Lawrence's Rosalyn is a crazy, contorting character who shows that her character is way out of her league in her husband's world of deceit. Rosalyn is really a child in a grown man's world.Renner hits it out of the park as Polito, an honest man whose sketchy manoeuvres as a person in power, really sheds the action-hero substitute Renner has been playing recently in franchise revival action genre films.Cooper gives a great physical performance as he did also in Playbook, but unfortunately falls short and sidelined by Bale's unwavering performance. Plus, I'm not sure if the tight-curl perm really helped with the believability of his character or if it may have been a tad too distracting to Cooper's overall performance.At the end of the day, as Irving states early in the film, ""we con everyone, we even con ourselves"". American Hustle is a much needed con of a film of heavy hitting dramas in a hopeful Oscar season. Blending an exhilarating mix of serious comedy and satire, O. Russell preaches some of his many valiant directing efforts by trusting in his highly-skilled actors and allowing them to use improvisation to develop the shape of the films rustic narrative. O. Russell's characters literally sing their hearts out to ensure the audience understands the subtle points of their deep emotions, and with the help of a highly effective retro-soundtrack to hit some of the confusing plot points.Read the rest of this review at www.nightfilmreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Come for the plot, stay for the people","This movie is good for what it is. It has almost everything you'd want in a crime caper - its funny, its slick, the soundtrack is great, the cast have fantastic chemistry, but the plot.........well, meh.There should be no doubt that by now you will either be hearing great things or bad things about this movie. Some think its Oscar gold, whilst most think of it as the most overrated movie in a decade. Well make no mistake, the film is by no means Oscar material and I think that hype hurt the films reviews somewhat. If the film had not been hyped up so much, people might have liked it more. It's not really an award worthy movie (at least not the amount that the film has got), but is a good movie on it's own. The cast shine in their roles, but when you're up against films like 12 Years a Slave, a heist movie can only go so far at the academy. The banter between the characters is also very funny, almost reminiscent of Scorcese-esque dialogue. Even when the characters are angry, you can't help but laugh. The only real weak point of the movie is the plot and how it's executed. The plot concerns a group of con men who gradually get in deeper and deeper with the FBI and the mafia due to their scams. At times you will be wondering ""where is this movie going"" or ""wait, what just happened"". Sometimes the plot moves forward in importance very suddenly without emphasizing it to the viewer and the inner workings of the scam will go over your head unless you're in the same line of work, study it very extensively or are very familiar with the scam that the film is based on. It's the kind of plot that will have your brain scrambled by the end of it, and to be honest, I don't see that plot being understood better through multiple viewings.All in all, American Hustle is a good solid movie if you just want funny banter and characters, but I wouldn't go into this movie expecting a great plot if I were you.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the most over rated films of all time,"What's so great about this film? And why have most of the cast been nominated for awards?Is it because it has American in the title?The costumes are decent, the wigs are good and the set is OK, but nothing special. So there's a few twists. Big deal, quite literally.You feel nothing for any of the characters. Its slow, boring and NOT funny.Amy Adams, I'm not a fan of hers, ever since watching the appalling Leap Year it put me off for life. In AH she struggles with her accents and puts in one of the most average performance you'll ever likely to see. Yet she's up for an Oscar, can someone please explain why?We walked out of the cinema and had instantly forgot this film. That really speaks volumes in my book",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Interesting way to Spend the Afternoon,"American Hustle will be a big contender at most award ceremonies this year and it's easy to see why. It is a unique and captivating story with some standout acting performances. Set in the 1970s and focusing on two con artists, this film certainly won't be like anything else you see this season. Christian Bale and Amy Adams excel in their lead roles but the real surprise is Jeremy Renner, who despite not being nominated for a Golden Globe, delivers the best performance as Mayor Carmine Polito. The costumes and sets are very well done and quite fascinating at times. I did get tired of the low cut thing for Amy Adams though and thought the costuming was very one dimensional in this sense no matter how fab she looked in it. It is a long film and gets a little slow at times so bring some food in with you. Overall it's not a bad way to spend the afternoon..",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than most movies at representing the time,"I'm not quite understanding some of the downside reviews regarding this film play. It almost makes me ask if some of these people have seen more than two or three movies before, or have only now just noticed that movie script writing is far and away the lowest ""art form"" ever endured by any culture, before we start.Neither The Godfather nor Goodfellas broke new ground in any sense. Indeed, they both relied upon deeply instilled pre-existing notions and stereotypes, including just a sprinkling of reality when convenient to the story. Pandering, patronizing, catering to the basest of 'instincts,' all wrapped up in a neat package (excellent directing and cinematography on a completely banal story, the Hollywood way). And I'm not sure if any movies were more 'self indulgent' than those two.I'm not saying that this movie matches those two or other likewise ventures in grandeur, but it does have at least some semblance of an ""Indie"" treatment of the matter. Of course the movie is not ""perfect"" in telling the very non-simplified story at hand; there's no way that it -could- be. I don't see how one could tell a story as messy as this one with out the presentation itself being a bit 'messy' in some respects. (If you want grossly over simplified with fantastic production and classic actors, see reference in second paragraph above).I have no complaints as to the acting (at least not much). Christian Bale seems to always be put in an acting role about half a notch 'above his level,' but by the end of the movie we (or some of us, at least) think it turned out just about right. Same here. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were pretty darned good, indeed fantastic sometimes, so much as the script and story allowed. Both were a great strength to the movie, stole scenes as opportunity presented, etc., no question.I have some gripes about the script writing, as always, but given the subject matter and the era being presented, I (and I hope that others) cannot overlook the fact that the women in this movie were far better represented and given a lot more credit in having more than two brain cells than in the much more popular 'Mafia standard' movies. The instance of Rosenfeld's wife (J Lawrence) explaining to him that she had started reading Wayne Dyer's books, so now they had to get a divorce, made me keel over, actually. But what mattered is that she took a notion to improve herself, and had gained a notion of an independent self at all, not a popular notion in that milieu.It used to be so simple; ""you marry my money, I marry your body,"" and now (in this movie) both parties come to the late conclusion that there's more to it than that, by both meeting new acquaintances and (in the case of the wife) actually reading books. Yes, by a (at the time) ""new age Guru."" But if she started reading books at all, she would have eventually moved beyond that. The salient point is that she ventured out beyond her ""I'm so afraid of change"" world at all.Sorry for all the disappointment to others who started out with the intent of ""trying to be generous"" in inappropriately assigning the task of this film as being a follow up of any sort to the mafia classics, but there's a lot in this movie you missed out on in pursuit of that folly.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
8 Pairs of Legs (Out of 10),"If This Film Had Siblings: Boogie Nights, BlowPros: Strong Performances by Ensemble Cast, Great Score, 70s Time Capsule, Strong EndingCons: At times Draggy, Play Dress-upAmerican Hustle brings to the screen an untold scandal of the 70s. It stars The Legs of Amy Adams with Cameo appearances by Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams. I'm not one to complain, but I""m still trying to figure out who The Legs paid off for such a prominent role.Now let's get down to the brass tax. A very entertaining dramatic ride with outstanding performances and many laughs. David O. Russell has a gift to get the best out of his actors. Jennifer Lawrence is considered to be the 'showstopper' according to most pundits, but for my money, the performance by Bale was tops. You feel like you can see the cogs churning through Bale's eyes as he tries to manage the situations. Bale's layers of stress are a burden upon the viewer. The other performances seemed to operate on one plane when compared to Bale.Now there are items that some of us will never be able to fully comprehend. Like for example, is the FBI really that dumb? The story moves fast and at times it feels like it could blow down with a gust of wind. The score is fantastic with its use of popular songs from the 70's. The musical interludes really add character to the film. And the opening musical montage gets you ready for the ride (I had goosebumps).Time to go heat up some dinner in my science oven.

That was Jennifer Lawrence!?!?!,This movie was pretty much what I expected. Bradley Cooper did okay and Chris Bale brought more depth to his role than anticipated. The pacing lagged a bit at times but there are times when it is difficult to keep a high pace throughout a movie. What was really a great performance was by Jennifer Lawrence. I couldn't believe it was her. I saw her in Hunger Games and that did little to allow her to spread her wings. What a wonderful future this young girl has. Hunger Games was OK for the kids I guess and it would be difficult for anyone to rise above the tripe that franchise espoused. I couldn't get by one hour of the first one! It was also entertaining watching Louis CK keep a straight face!!! He must have been exercising EXTREME restraint!!! Jeremy Renner was also awesome!!!

"The Louie ""American Hustle"" Movie Review","I tell you I don't even know where to begin in trying to explain this movie. We can start by saying it was extremely unusual and pretty much incomparable to any other film I have seen lately or ever. I couldn't figure out if I liked the movie and then when I figured out that I did like it and really started to enjoy it, I knew why. The actors did a phenomenal job. And normally that goes hand in hand with a really good story. But in this case it was.well unusual. The main story is goodthe stories within the main story arewell just not feel good situations. But even with that somewhat negative observation they were entertaining in their own right. Funky I know. Without giving anything away it revolves around a con man (Christian Bale) and his partner (Amy Adams) and a fed agent (Bradley cooper) in an unlikely partnership to catch other criminals. The stories within the story are various. And you feel multiple emotions throughout the movie. Some of the situations are a bit sleazy, and I don't mean sexually. I mean just plain doing the wrong things. But just when you get kind of turned off the scene turns into laughter. Again, because of the fantastic job of the actors and their portrayal of the characters. You feel excited one moment then intense the nextupsetthen laugh out laughingthen intense again. At the beginning of the movie you are like ""What is the hype all about this movie?"" but I tell you as the movie goes on you get more and more enthralled with the characters their side storiesthe absurdity of some of the situationsand again the intensity. Literally you don't know what to make of it when you get out of the moviebut one thing for sure you are glad that you saw it because after everything you really enjoyed it. I can't say it enough that the all of the actors, every one, did a fantastic job of portraying their characters and you go from laughing with themto laughing at them to having no respect for themto sympathizing with themand back to laughing with them and going through that circle of emotions several times throughout the movie. Christian Bale played a part that you have never seen him like this. Amy Adams was so sexy and smart and very intense at timesyou will love her. And again each and every actor bought their game to this movie. I will say one thing, if you go to this movie commit to seeing the whole thing because you may be tempted in the beginning to say ""What the heck?"", because I did. But even as I am writing this review I am thinking I will see it again when it is available to rent because I will enjoy the first quarter of the movie more the second time after I have learned to really love the characters. I give this movie the most unusual ""B+"".",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Geeky Randy's summary,"Not-too-dramatic/not-too-thrilling crime tale carried by an ensemble of lead actors from Russell's previous films THE FIGHTER and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK based on the ABSCAM operation from the late-'70s/early-'80s which includes sting operations on corrupt politicians, perms and comb-overs! Everything in this outing is a little too easy: the humor is simple, there are no extraordinary characters despite a cast of A-list-ers, and the plot is rather bland. Despite all the so-so, it all comes together to be a slightly-above-par flick that is worth having a look to judge for yourself.*** (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dreadfully Boring,"There are 2 films I have wanted to walk out of the cinema when watching: 1 is some cr*p with Will Ferrell and a basketball team (that I can't remember the name of), and the other was this. At least 4 people had the good sense to leave after 25 minutes, I wish I had followed them; or at least fallen asleep, like the guy behind me that was snoring his head off. However I feared that eventually something would actually happen, unfortunately these fears were unfounded.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED.I have been an IMDb reader for sometime but I am so passionate to raise my views about this movie I have had to register so I can place my review.Why this is being considered for 10 Oscars, I have no idea. The story was unengaging and I didn't care about any of the characters apart from maybe the Mayor, who looked weird.I was lulled into a false sense of excitement when Robert De Niro appeared, but alas this was an extremely brief cameo.The critics seem to love this film, I can only imagine because of the improvisation elements....well, some of the best ideas are old ones. A well plotted storyline and well scripted dialogue cannot be outdone by a bunch of ""up-their-own-ar*e"" movie-makers trying to be clever.In fact, as the saying goes....it's not big and it's not clever!!....well it's big I suppose but I am the one feeling stupid for spending cash on this codswallop.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Directionally and Dramatically Exceptional, But Seemingly Overrated","The original reason I decided to rent this movie out and watch it, was because of the extraordinary casting and the award nominations and winning streaks. The quirky style of David O. Russell reminded me of what could have happened if Hollywood had of mashed the Godfather with Lincoln Lawyer and Jersey Boys, and got it directed by Baz Luhrmann. The majority of characters were played with a huge amount of talent. Jennifer Lawrence, tho i thought the casting was weird, really did a great job at pulling of a psychotic woman. She frightened me. The casting did however make me feel like Russel had just mixed the castings of The Fighter with Silver Linings Playbook. Loved Jeremy Renner's performance as usual and found that Bradley Cooper came across as bi-polar. Christian Bale plays a character a lot more unique than what i'm used to seeing him in, but still has a lot of similarities to other characters played by him. Amy Adams played a predictable character that didn't shock me at all nor did her performance cause any sense of surprise.I think this movie is overrated.

American Hustle - Human Nature Exposed,"While 'American Hustle' begins with a disclaimer that 'some of this story is true' the viewer is more importantly left with a taste of how easily drawn into hustles all of us are, no matter the situation legal, above the law, or lost in deception.Each character in this movie has a desire for power, success, validation - no matter the concept they are each one lost in their own need to define themselves in whatever capacity they choose. Though the story line takes awhile to get rolling, once it does, the audience is drawn into each character's psyche, and right through to the finale wondering how this might turn out. When the outcome seemed predictable, something else came into play to draw you further.This movie contained a number of characters that you were clearly designed to dislike. In fact, I don't think I liked a single one, except perhaps the innocent bystander - figure of speech. The intrigue of this movie is the ability to have the audience wondering how they might react to a situation, and also, how easily they could relate to the drive of each character's actions. Where one wanted to succeed a scam, another wanted identity, while another simply wanted their life to be more purposeful than they ever believed it had been, and when things began to unravel it seemed clear that in the end everyone would probably die a brutal and cinematic death. That's not a spoiler, I assure you.The acting was solid to the purposeful drive of the premise. The display of the human condition in its most ill spoken and vulnerable state though, was the driving force of the movie. The outcome, while testing your own preconceived notions of how generally, a con turns out badly, in some respects, helps define how the very fallibility of our human nature is an albatross we all carry around with ourselves in our search for definitive identities in our respective societies.Thom Amundsen http://www.thinkingoutloudagain.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

In my opinion, the best part of the movie is its music, beautiful and blending well with the situations. However, writing is probably the worst part, and directing is not much better. The story is cliché, the story-telling is confusing. The acting is good as expected, but the characters are too single-faced and predictable.

"Well Acted, Stylish, but Also Self-Indulgent and Disjointed","Hype can be a major killer when it comes to movies, and American Hustle is a huge example of this. There was a lot to be excited about here. The cast was huge, with big named, really incredible actors brought on board. It has David O. Russell in the director's chair, coming off his back-to-back critically acclaimed movies ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook."" It has the feel of a Scorsese film, with the music that feels like a throwback to the 70s. And it holds a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes; that alone garners this movie a chance. So why did I walk out of this movie dissatisfied?Largely it has to do with the overall structure of the movie. It has everything that it needs to put together a fantastic movie, but feels very disjointed, like they didn't know how to put that puzzle together. It also feels like it has a touch of self-indulgence thrown into the mix, like O. Russell wanted to make his own version of Goodfellas, only without the flow and consistency of that film. And ultimately it ends up feeling very jumbled, very inconsistent, and very unsatisfying.Of course there is still a lot that this movie can be praised for. All the actors do a tremendous job, the two main standouts being Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper. Amy Adams does a good job as well in the main female lead role, and Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as well (even though I feel like she is completely miscast and not as incredible in this movie as everyone makes her out to be). There's also some great dialog, great editing as well. The overall tone is fun and it definitely keeps you interested in what's going on. I just felt if they had found a much better way to bring all of this together, it would have succeeded a lot more than I felt it did. Hopefully next time, O. Russell remembers that to back up his great actors, settings, costumes, soundtrack, and dialog with a solid and stable story.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Good Film Depending on How You Look At It,"In a sense the film is just like its characters. For example, Christian Bale's comb over hairstyle for the movie describes it perfectly: elaborate, misleading, entertaining, and attempting to be something it's not. First off, the film looks great and presents it's self well, like the characters do, but it's all there to just make up for what it lacks underneath, which is heart and substance. The film prances around too vicariously in an attempt to find it's footing between a good looking comedy to portray the theme of pretending to be something more while being empty inside, or being a drama with an awkward pacing and strange comedic timing in an act to seem sincere in proving it has something to say. Overall, 'American Hustle' is pretty solid with great performances, set designs, and a stellar wardrobe department but is definitely a hit or miss depending on how you look at it. Some of it works for me, some of it doesn't. Even though it's not David O. Russell's best work in comparison to his others, it's still pretty entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Had the makings of a good story.,"A group of people are in a fancy hotel room in the 70s discussing some deal with a sheik. A briefcase is pushed in the direction of one of them. He gets outraged and leaves the meeting. The others push one of the guys to go after him.Rewind to the beginning. Irv as child saw his father, the owner of the local window business, taken advantage off so he decided to even the score by breaking all windows he saw. As an adult he inherited the business, ended up owning some dry cleaning businesses and became a loan shark but the kind that don't give out any money, just charge a non-refundable fee to the desperate. At a party he meets Sydney who's way out of his league. But they were made for each other. All her life she dreamed of nothing but being someone else. She took on the persona of an English girl with financial connections in London.Together they become better con-people and their business booms. One day one guy shows up who is way too happy for a guy out of his luck. Irv has reservations. Sure enough, he's an FBI agent. He makes a deal with the two after watching Sydney sweat for a couple of days in jail. If they con four other con-men they're free. But agent DiMaso has bigger plans. The name of a popular New Jersey politician comes up--Carmine Polito. He finds an equally ambitious district attorney. DiMaso's boss on the other hand wants nothing to do with his plans. Irv and DiMaso concoct some ludicrous plan to ensnare Polito. And Irv and Sydney plan to con DiMaso and use him. The idea is that a sheik will invest millions on Polito's plan to revitalize Atlantic City.And now we're back were the movie starts. Irv runs after Polito and becomes his friend. He finds out that Polito is a genuine good guy. He cares only about his constituents and his large family that includes an adopted kid. We learn more about Irv. He has a wife and he treats her son as his own. We learn also about DiMaso. He's got a fiancée and a religious mother. Throughout this adventure, Irv and Sydney have a falling out, Sydney and DiMaso become close, Irv's wife will get them all in trouble and Irv has second thoughts about Polito taking the fall for no good reason. DiMaso sees a chance to catch not just local dirty politicians but Congressmen and Senators, who unlike Polito are all too happy to take a suitcase full of money. The mob gets involved too, since we're talking about casinos and gambling and the deal will have to be between the non-existent sheik and a Miami mobsters. Irv's wife has an affair with a mob captain. These two will provide the catalyst for the eventual unraveling of all this.American Hustle starts out fairly strong, for the first hour or so. Then it runs out of steam in a spectacular fashion, keeps going for no good reason and barely recovers near the end. It's a reverse Scorsese show--the rise and fall of an FBI guy. Performances are very strong over all. Some of the situations the characters are put in a quite absurd but the actors' bravura make it work. At least, there is plenty of cleavage to make the boring half watchable.When it comes to the relationship between the three main characters, the story is narrated from those three perspectives: Irv, Sydney and DiMaso. For some reason the director and editor lose sight of the main story at some point and focus on soap opera bits instead of advancing the story. When they manage to pick it up again, it's almost too late. And the way the resolution is told is surprisingly anti-climactic. There was a good story here but it's buried in non-sense. There are some good lines, too, but plenty of meaningless stuff that someone thought sounded real bright. 30-40 minutes could have easily been cut making this movie what it should have been- a smart, at time funny, and exciting drama about likable con-men, the mob, and the FBI.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An overly long, draggy dialogue-heavy film despite stellar performances from its casts","American Hustle is a loose retelling (as stated at the beginning of the film, ""some of this actually happened."") of the FBI ABSCAM operation of the late 1970s that led to a few bribery convictions which involved a U.S. senator, six members of the House of Representatives, a State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.The story is about two con-artists, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who was forced to cooperate with an FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) to arrest 4 high-flying con artists so they can be pardoned from their crimes. However, what initially seems to be an operation that targets stolen property trafficking eventually lead to a huge, elaborate public corruption investigation, which goes out of control and involved the mafia as well.Sounds interesting? It seems so, on paper. In film, to commit a con job normally requires heavy exposition, to explain the elaborate plan without failing to engage the audience along the way. The film failed at doing that.Despite its unexpected plot twist, the film suffers heavily due to its pacing and length. It's overly long and filled with constant, ceaseless dialogue-heavy scenes, with literally no action to provide the thrill factor, which most general audience will find it to be boring. It's all talking, talking, and talking. Acting, acting, and acting. It goes on and on...The film drags too long until when something unusual happens (the point where the operation starts to go beyond control), it's a little too late as many would have lose interest by then (fortunately not me, but quite close though).Most of the actors done their utmost best, delivering their award- worthy, charming performance to the film, which is mostly the reason why the film received such critical acclaim upon its release. But, don't believe the hype. This film was no better than any of the other Oscar award-nominated films of 2013. The film does provide a few occasional laughs here and there, there's some witty dialogue delivered perfectly by actors on-screen, but that's it.Overall, it's not a bad film, it's just not a solid entertainment and not nearly as much fun as you would expect it to be. It would certainly benefit the film if the director is willing to cut some of the unnecessary scenes in film.Rating: 7/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-american-hustle.html",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Only Louis C.K., DeNiro, and other members of the supporting cast come out of this looking like pros at work. This might have been acceptable had the film been a comedy, but at a pace of one laugh per 20-30 minutes, it's not. Instead, it's a long, slow, unpleasant grind that mostly goes nowhere. Yes, there moments of genuine intensity, and yes, the final 15 minutes or so go quite well, but for nearly two hours of running time the only thing keeping me in the theater was the fact that my wife didn't want to leave.

A love triangle examining the lies we tell others and ourselves,"American Hustle opens with the sight of Christian Bale as we've never seen him before: It's Batman with a beer belly and a bad comb-over, one which we see him meticulously craft – strand by strand -- in front of a mirror. It's a metaphor for -- and a foreshadowing of -- the elaborate deceptions we're about to witness.As the opening disclaimer exuberantly states: ""Some of this actually happened."" Director David O. Russell's seriocomedy is loosely based on the Abscam scandal/sting operation of the late 1970s. Bale and Amy Adams play a pair of con artists who are nabbed by an ambitious – and often unscrupulous -- FBI agent, played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper's character promises to let them walk in exchange for their help in taking down other corrupt characters. But as we soon see, nearly everyone in this movie is scamming someone else.All the major characters are pretending to be something that they are not in order to manipulate others and get what they want. The main theme is the struggle of these characters to maintain their facades while suppressing their true selves. They may be able to fool others, but can only fool themselves for so long.The film is, at its core, a love triangle involving the characters played by Bale, Cooper and Adams. It examines how true love can give someone the courage and desire to be truly honest with another person. The leading trio gives impressive and dynamic performances, disappearing into their roles. All three leading cast members have previously appeared in one of Russell's films, as have supporting players Jennifer Lawrence (who maximizes her limited screen time, stealing ever scene she's in) and Shea Whigham. Russell (Three Kings, Silver Linings Playbook) reuses so many actors; he seems to be in the process of starting his own repertory company. Comedian Louis C.K. also adds to his burgeoning film resume with his second terrific supporting role of 2013 (his part in Blue Jasmine being the other). The weak link is Jeremy Renner, who is badly miscast as a New Jersey Mayor.The movie captures the period perfectly, from the fashions and hairdos -- right down to the tin lids on jars of Skippy peanut butter. Russell propels the action with a superlative musical score of wall-to-wall (mostly)'70s hits. He even uses the old school Columbia Pictures logo from that era.With American Hustle's Me Decade time period, its criminal underworld setting, heavy use of voice-over narration, numerous wide-angle tracking shots, freeze-frames and aforementioned generous use of pop hits on the soundtrack, it would be understandable if someone mistakenly believed that The Wolf of Wall Street wasn't the only movie Martin Scorsese directed this past year. I'll simply assume that this movie is Russell homage to Scorsese. (He even includes one of Scorsese's frequent collaborators in a surprise cameo.) The movie's primary flaw is the fact it's a little lacking in the pathos department. Because nearly every character in the movie lies, deceives or manipulates in some way, it's hard to root for anyone. So, the resolution, when it arrives, is rather joyless.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great piece of film but maybe not strong enough,"Firstly, the combination of actors from David o Russel's previous two films was always playing it safe..he knew what he was going to get from his cast but with that talent to play with the script didn't have to be 100% and it wasn't. For his directing, well its clever..greatly detailed and stylish and manages it throughout the film. If anyone deserves the Oscar nod its bale. With his performance alone i was able to be interested for the over 2 hour running time. Bradley Cooper was strong support and again put in a fantastic performance. Overall, the movie deserves congratulations all round, but with movies like 'wolf on wall street' and 'her' approaching us with raving reviews, i cant see American hustle with a great deal this awards season, even though it is not your 'normal' film...",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why overrated?,"With excellent story and plot, American Hustle managed to gain good ratings, even better with seductive performances of Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence.Conning acts, plus good plot twist at the end, makes this more-than-two- hour-long movie very interesting to watch. It makes you thinking about what will happen next!Over-the-top casts here are made even more awesome with a cameo from legendary actor Robert De Niro who plays the Italian mafia.But even with those and 10 Oscar nominations, many still despise it and think it is overrated.Not me, not me.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pass the Popcorn review,"American Hustle is the fictionalized retelling of the real-life FBI operation called 'ABSCAM', which ran during the late 70s/early 80s, and which result was the conviction of one U.S. senator and six members of the U.S. House of Representatives – they were sentenced for accepting bribes from a FBI agent who was posing as a sheikh. During the investigation, the FBI were aided by a convicted con artist, named Melvin Weinberg. A film adaptation of this event was originally planned in the early 80s, but it failed to reach the big screen up until 2013, when David O. Russell sat in the director's chair and gave the world a very loose adaptation of the story – so loose that the opening title card in the movie says only that 'some of this actually happened'.Set in the late 70s, American Hustle follows a pair of con artists/lovers – Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) – who ran a small con operation. One day they get arrested by the FBI and are soon given a choice, by the young and idealistic agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Copper), who says he'll let them go, if they help him perform 4 white collar busts. Irving and Sydney reluctantly accept their offer, and make a plan which involves a made up Arab sheikh, and which will hopefully attract other con artists for DiMaso to arrest.American Hustle is like a postcard from the golden age of Hollywood, it reeks of old Scorsese movies (Goodfellas comes to mind first), and while others may consider American Hustle a rip off because of this, I found this movie to be a stylish, beautiful throwback to a time when mainstream movies were somewhat better than today. In this movie, the director David O. Russell collaborates with almost everyone he has collaborated before: Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starred in his critically acclaimed, but in my opinion somewhat flawed, Silver Linings Playbook, and Christian Bale and Amy Adams starred in The Fighter. These casting choices are amazing, since everyone fits their characters and roles perfectly. Christian Bale, who has (once again) undergone incredible body transformations in preparation for his role, is memorable and great as the con artist Irving Rosenfeld; Bradley Cooper is magnificent in portraying the FBI agent Richie DiMaso and his troubled personality; and Amy Adams is absolutely adorable in the ""double accent/double character"" role she plays. Even Jeremy Renner, who had not previously collaborated with Russell, is perfect in portraying the sleazy, but likable Mayor Carmine Polito. Only Jennifer Lawrence's role, that of Irving Rosenfeld's wife Rosalyn, didn't really stick with me, since her character seems rather formulaic.In one instance, during the shooting of the movie, David O. Russell said to Christian Bale ""Christian, I hate plots. I am all about characters, that's it"". Which is a rather strange thing to say since some people, from what I have read on the internet, had problems with the characters themselves, meaning they couldn't engage with them. And I must say – that is very true, sometimes it is hard to empathize with the characters (since all of them have some distinct unlikeable traits) and this may be a problem for some people because the movie is over two hours long. As for me, I haven't had such problems, but I still disagree with Mr. Russell, since I am all about the style and the old school way in which this movie is told, rather than the characters. Although, there is one thing in the movie that left me disappointed, and that was the ending, which felt dull and underwhelming. I must say, in the end, I felt somewhat hustled.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Slightly over-hyped, yet still one entertaining piece.","Knowing David O Russell's style, I knew going into this that I was going to have to deal with some over the top quirkiness in the characters and style, which I can usually tolerate in his films. On one hand, he handles his actors extremely well with top notch directing and handles his script very carefully as well. On the other hand, he lets his style slip out of his hands and spill out all over the screen in an over abundance of random bantering from characters, and depraved scenes of sexual frustration that get played off as comedic.Christian Bale and Amy Adams are two con artists who are forced by an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to set up an elaborate sting operation on corrupt politicians, including the mayor of Camden, New Jersey (Jeremy Renner). Meanwhile, he has to deal with his estranged wife (Jennifer Lawrence) who constantly gets in the way of his plans. I was invested because this is the first time David O Russell has tackled crime drama. He still manages to blend black comedic undertones with the colorful, sporadic writing on the surface.The casting and performances are probably the film's biggest strong suit. Christian Bale is hilarious and convincingly serious at the same time. Anytime he's on screen, he squeezes every last drop of investment into his character that the scene calls for, and it pays off. When he gets upset, angry, or scared, you really see it on his face. In a film like this that's really flashy, it's amazing how much emotion he displays while the audience is getting energized by the soundtrack. Amy Adams is sexy and deceitful, which we get out of every single scene she's in. Bradly Cooper is quickly becoming one of the most promising actors in this day in age. He is unpredictable in every scene he's in, but he manages to keep it straight and real at the same time. Jennifer Lawrence is unstoppable, portraying yet another emotionally distressed woman with husband problems, and no filter on her mouth. The only thing I wasn't sure about was the random Robert De Niro cameo.One main issue I do have with the film is that the style, while entertaining, distracts from the plot. I usually encourage this behavior from Russell in previous works, but this time it left me a tad overwhelmed. It hammered itself in scenes that were completely unnecessary. The film went on a tad too long, and definitely could have trimmed some scenes that were needlessly thrown in there for stylistic purposes. The writing is solid, but the quirky character trope just throws me off at times and makes it hard to focus.Overall, the film really energizes and excites you in each scene, making for one very entertaining film. I feel like a few people love the flashy style, which I can appreciate, even if it distracts a little. For that reason, I find it a tad over hyped, but not enough to take away any enjoyment. Russell is getting more mainstream, which is showcasing in his films. I just hope it doesn't get to his head, and I look forward to what he can do in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just Fantastic!!,"Just Fantastic, wonderfully over the top!Seventies vibe, and one cool actor after another. Bale is again into it, gaining weight. Just like losing it for The Machinist.

Not that good,"This movie is... OK but not so good. The plot itself is good and at times it is funny and entertaining but overall it lacks depth and seems to be lost in a limbo between comedy and drama without reaching the level of coherence and fluidity of other great movies and TV shows of its genre.The movie begins at medium pace and appears as though it's going to pick up, but never really does. It basically crawls throughout the movie and at the end it finally sprints toward the finish line. I usually enjoy Jennifer Lawrence's performances, but in this movie I IMO, she was a little outside of her comfort zone. Somehow I feel as though she overacts and underacts at the same time. She's trying too much in an inconsistent matter that end up looking half awkward and not very genuine. Kind of like an SNL impersonation skit where it is done purposely and ironically in the context of a comical skit.Other than that, the other Character performances were good, I almost forgot that Christian Bale is also the batman. Finally, Louis C.K in a ""serious"" role was interesting as a reminder that the movie (and life in general?) shouldn't be taken too seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Perhaps the most well-acted con movie of all time,"If you're an actor with any degree of prominence, you've probably asked your agent to get you into the next David O. Russell picture. Including ""American Hustle,"" the dude has helped his actors to 11 Oscar nominations in his last three films, with a nod in every major acting category each of the last two years. That's unheard of. Needless to say, ""American Hustle"" is a tremendously acted film, perhaps the most well-acted con movie ever.""Hustle"" is the kind of film you'd expect from Martin Scorsese, not Russell, who has shown a distinct preference for family drama in his previous films, ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook."" This is a story about deception, corruption, the American dream and love muddling up all of it.Set in the '70s, ""Hustle"" imagines the story behind the FBI's famous Abscam sting, in which the feds, with help from a convicted con-man, exposed several corrupt politicians by disguising an agent as a fake Arab sheik who offered them money for help with illegal activities. The con-man was Melvin Weinberg, the basis of the film's main character, Irving Rosenfeld.Christian Bale drastically transforms his appearance (yet again) to play Irving, this time putting on significant weight and giving himself a sophisticated comb-over. Watching him, you'll be in shock that this is the man who played Batman for three films. Irving is a businessman who owns a chain of dry cleaners as well as a con artist with a sharp mind and a big heart. So big, in fact, that after we learn how he fell in love with Sydney (Amy Adams), we discover he's a family man with a wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and a son.The script uses voiceovers for each of the main characters to provide some insight into who they are. Sydney, for example, has longed to be anyone but herself, so instead of ditching Irving when she finds out his main line of work, she takes on the persona of a British lady with banking connection in London. Together, they con desperate lowlifes who think they'll land $50,000 on a $5,000 investment.Everything changes when FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) catches them in the act. Knowing he has them by the throat, DiMaso leverages their haplessness into helping him set up sting operations. If they comply, he'll drop everything he has against them and let them walk. They start by setting New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) as their mark. As they develop and carry out Abscam, however, DiMaso's brazen behavior gets them all way over their heads.Every role in Russell and Eric Warren Singer's (""The International"") screenplay gets ample material to work with, which is part of what makes ""Hustle"" such an incredible ensemble film. Even Lawrence, who plays the wild card character who has little to do with the actual plot, gets a few meaty scene-stealing moments. It might be her best performance yet in terms of proving just how diverse an actress she can be.Adams also does some of the best work of her career. An Academy darling with four nominations in six years, Sydney is her most worthy performance of any of them. The role effectively showcases her one-two punch of toughness and beauty in a way previous roles haven't. Sydney is independent-minded but hopelessly in love, dangerously seductive but morally conscious. Given her outfits, you'd make assumptions about here character, but you'd be wrong.Cooper's character is hot-headed comic relief as the FBI agent driven by dreams of catching the big fish. Richie controls the pace of the film and Cooper uses that to his advantage. He's another character with a distinct moral ""direction,"" as sometimes he's a confident go-getter, sometimes he's a baby and sometimes he's everywhere in between. Renner's Mayor Polito is also complex; most con marks in a film are despicable scumbags, but he might be the most likable character in the film.Much of the dialogue was improvised, so that tells you how much of a character-driven film this really is — actors truly becoming their roles and bringing out instinctual emotion on screen. A version of this film could've been easily done in a way that focused entirely on the intricacies of the scam, setting up situational humor or melodrama as a result of strictly plot points. ""American Hustle"" takes on a life of its own with these actors/characters really playing off one another. Production pieces such as costumes and a killer '70s soundtrack set the stylistic tone more so than the direction or the screenplay.As much as the talent sets ""American Hustle"" apart from similar genre entries, it's a con film at heart, in which the satisfaction comes from a big twist and seeing who comes out on top when the smoke clears. Although this movie does push the message of people believing what they want to believe, Russell's previous films had more thematic and emotional weight to them. ""American Hustle"" is more entertaining, but less fulfilling — a fun con movie with phenomenal, praiseworthy acting.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Great performances, good characters, mediocre plot","The main cast consisting of Academy Awars / Golden Globe nominees and winners, characters and events based on real cases, thrill via FBI and crossing / double-crossing - all this should be the basis for a gripping movie where time flies and you won't notice the length. Unfortunately, as for American Hustle, it does not fully apply. True, performances are catchy - particularly Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, Bradley Cooper as FBI Agent Richard ""Richie"" DiMaso, Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser / Lady Edith Greensly, Jennifer Lawrence as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, Robert De Niro (uncredited) as Victor Tellegio - characters have comical behaviors and lines, but the plot is uneven at times, the thrill fades away, and several activity lines do not provide additional value to the whole story, contributing the length only. The solution is plain, the main twist is dissolved in real outcomes of exposing corruption.Well, if we take some other movies nominated for 10 Academy Awards: Cabaret, The Godfather, Network, Tootsie, Star Wars, Braveheart, Slumdog Millonaire... Can American Hustle be compared with them? I am afraid not. It is an okay movie, but not conceptional.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Intense Drama 8/10,"Review: I really enjoyed this intense movie which if full of drama and intensity. The acting from the all star cast was brilliant and the storyline was well put together. The director really kept the storyline interesting throughout the movie and you can't help but feel for the characters who try there best to get out of an impossible situation. After all of the hype from the Oscars and the reviews, this movie really does live up to its expectations and the clever writing do bring a little comedy to the movie. At the end of the day, this is definitely a movie not to miss. Great!Round-Up: Bradley Cooper seems like he can't do no wrong at the moment. Coming from Silver Linings Playbook, which he also starred in with Jennifer Lawrence & Robert DeNiro, he has made some great choices in his career. Christian Bale had shown that he really does have a wide range with his acting skills. Coming from the Batman franchise, this is definitely a complete different type of movie which he play quite well. Amy Adams brought some light to the movie and she has also shown that she is a terrific actress with with a wide range. Jennifer Lawrence was a big surprise to me because she is mostly known for her role in the Hunger Games franchise, but she was brilliant in the film.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $252million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there intense dramas about a couple who have to take down corrupted politicians. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle Review,"American Hustle is a very messy movie. It feels like the type of movie that a teenager and his friends would get together to make, to try and pay homage to the likes of Scorsese. The problem here is that American Hustle is a movie from David O'Russell, a director whose past movies I enjoyed a lot, with the likes of 'The Fighter', 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'Three Kings'. David O'Russell shouldn't have to look to Scorsese for inspiration, because he comes up with good original ideas of his own. American Hustle feels a lot like a rip of Goodfellas. Things such as structure, narration, character arcs; all very reminiscent of Goodfellas. And in my opinion, Goodfellas is the greatest movie of all time, so if you're gonna pay homage to it, you're gonna have to do it right. David O'Russell doesn't do it right, producing a complete mess that, although not a bad film, could have been so much more.The screenplay for American Hustle is garbage. It's really awful, and I sincerely hope that it doesn't receive a nomination at the Oscars because it's pretty bad. The story is very convoluted, has no satisfying conclusion and the characters are fairly messy and disbelievable. One thing the movie gets right is it's humour, but even so, a lot of that feels improvised and probably isn't even in the screenplay.Acting is okay, but none of these actors are really performing to the best of their ability. Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper feel like the only ones who really lose themselves in their roles, and whilst Christian Bale is good he's hardly at the quality he was at in the likes of 'American Psycho'. Jennifer Lawrence delivers what's probably her worst performance to date, she has a great screen presence but only because she overacts so much that it's laughable. Louis C.K is really great, his scenes with Bradley Cooper were my favorites in the movie, and Jeremy Renner does a good job as well.Things like costume design and and set design are great, but that's all aesthetic stuff. American Hustle has the style but not the substance, which is where it really fails. There's no other way around it; American Hustle is a huge disappointment. You could go and see this movie which, although is not bad, is basically a fake Scorsese movie, or you could go and see the real Scorsese with 'The Wolf Of Wall Street'. I think you know what the wiser option is.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle better than 12 Years A Slave,"I've watched these two films recently. What I believe is that American Hustle is better than 12 Years A Slave in many aspects.First, American Hustle's soundtrack is really amusing, making the whole atmosphere of the plot properly.Second, I have to mention about some really serious things like cinematography and the arrangement of shots.Both films contain some Cut Away shots. I love CA, sometimes to give people time to think about the subject, and to make the film more interesting. But 12 Years A Slave's CA shots really made me mad. I still cannot know why they made such things. While in American Hustle, those CA shots are very good.For cinematography, American Hustle's is very motivated, is a kind of inspiration. You can watch the film getting the most information from the visual impact. While for 12 Years A Slave, not so good for only WS, MS, CU, WS, MS, CU, sort of that. Boring when you always get the same view in different part of the story.Really think American Hustle is a good film. Not the best, but the better.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The World of the 70s Perfectly Done But Directors Chooses Characters Over Plot,"Director David O. Russell takes viewers through the velvet suits and wood panel interiors of the 70's like it was yesterday. Wardrobe, set-design, and hair and make-up were all surprisingly well-done and added believability to this period piece (based on actual events surrounding the ABSCAM scandal). Actors Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence bring big star power to the film. Plus, the dialogue rings true and the characters are somewhat multifaceted. So what's missing from American Hustle? Perhaps it's that all these elements - even done to perfection - still aren't enough to make a really good movie from beginning to end.American Hustle showcases the skills, intelligence and anxieties of life-long con man Irving Rosenfeld. Enter Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) his muse and prime love interest (aside from his wife played by Jennifer Lawrence). Director (and screenwriter) Russell cleverly keeps the audience (and characters) guessing as to what in their lives is real and what is fake (who's playing who). Predictably, Irving and Sydney find themselves in some trouble with the law - cue FBI agent Richie DiMaso (played by Bradley Cooper). Irving isn't without conscience and has some qualms about what Richie now wants them to do, but with his hands tied, he's forced to move forward with Richie's power-hungry ideas. Relationships amongst the characters develop and evolve until the film's conclusion. Taking pointers from Ocean's 11, both the movie's characters and audience learn the big reveals together.So, it's kind of fun to watch Adams dance around in revealing dresses and to see Bale painstakingly tamper with his ridiculous comb-over hairdo - but it's not enough. A great movie moves at an unnoticeable pace. It flows through scenes effortlessly - it flies by in a delightful flash and you didn't even notice how much time went by at all. I checked the clock at least three times during American Hustle. Dialogue and plot in some instances played out unnecessarily slow and dragged down the other elements of the film that are well done. Despite some surprises at the end, this movie didn't hold my interest. Russell is known for strong characters and less for storyline development but this selective emphasis hurt the picture as a whole.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Even though I wasn't around back then, the movie feels very 70s. The music, the clothes, the overall atmosphere is there. However, there are some negative aspects to this piece of entertainment. To start with, it is a bit too long and slow. I think they could have kept up the pace a kept the movie at one hour and forty five minutes or perhaps one hour and fifty minutes. Another critic I have is the amount of humour. There are some humorous moments but there could be more of them. Lastly, there could have been some more action and violence to give the audience some shock moments. But overall a good and entertaining movie definitely worth the money.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic performances & settings carry an above average narrative,"American Hustle is a movie based in the 1970s and is about a real life operation called ABSCAM which took place during the same time period. And just like most films based on real life events this movie does not do everything in accordance to what happened in real life. For instance in the real event Bradley Cooper's character did not play such a role in the operation they were many other feds involved.Now what this film does is that it tries to be a black comedy while also trying to be a serious movie, for me it actually works, it will make you laugh at several scenes and the serious scenes will make you understand the seriousness off the situation and grasp your attention. The movie started out excellently, with a pretty funny scene between Bale and Cooper arguing and then playing a great song from it's fantastic soundtrack, while rolling the opening credits. The beginning was done so well, that it had me hooked to the rest of film, I probably wouldn't have been interested in the slow back-story scenes that followed, if it wasn't for this great start. After this the film does some comedy scenes, some serious scenes and many songs as a routine while carrying the plot at a very very slow pace. What is a huge negative is that the film moves at an extremely slow pace and this story, which is not that interesting could have been told in a much shorter time. While I was happy with the conclusion, the overall plot/narrative was not that great, its setting, atmosphere and most importantly the performances are what carried this film.Christian Bale, man I don't know what to say, he is extremely dedicated to any film he is in and any role he plays, he gained over 40 pounds and got a huge tummy for this movie, and this is the same guy who lost over 60 pounds for the Machinist and also lost weight for the fighter. And he is always completely into his characters. His performances in the sequels of Batman films were good but from what i have seen he has done so much better, his fans should do themselves a favor and watch his non Batman films to see how great of an actor he really is. I must say I liked his performance the best out of the cast.Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic, I haven't seen her Hunger games film but she is extremely charismatic and keeps you interested and keeps you listening and pay attention every time she is on the screen. Amy Adams does a serviceable job, she looks good in this film and her dresses are hot, her acting and dialogs are OK, apart from some scenes where she actually is really good. Her English accent was kind of bad though but maybe that was on purpose. I never considered Bradley a good actor but he kind of impressed with his performance, some people call him a weak link, I think he did a good job, yes he acts all goofy and silly and he acts all naive sometimes, but he is playing a naive power hungry fed anyway. Plus he gives this film a good comic relief believe it or not, his facial expression at the end of the film was just hilarious. Jeremy Renner also did a good job. De Niro's was awesome in his short cameo wish he had a more expanded role. The minor characters did well.The film does a great job of recapturing the environment of the settings with it's awesome screenplay and setting, clothes, environments, everything is done so well. Apart from the performances I just love, love this film's soundtrack every song fits the scenes and they are all nice to listen, the soundtrack is one of the highlights of this movie, I absolutely loved the songs ""The Dirty Work"", ""Horse With No Name"" and ""Long Black Road"".Overall I enjoyed the American Hustle, it is a great film in my honest opinion. Does it deserve all the Oscars and praise it has gotten, debatable, but this was an enjoyable film and had the narrative been stronger, shorter and moved at a faster pace, it would have only made this film better than it already is.Overall Rating: 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great period film, but a slow and trudging story and pace","There are some good acting performances and an interesting story that unwinds in a 70's period that is masterfully recreated throughout. But the specifics of the confidence games or ""cons"" are glossed over when they are in fact vital to a film that is based on a true story. The relationships between con artists, con artists and marks, con artists and agents and politicians and gangsters receive the lion's share of the script. The pacing of dialog that frames the relationships for the audience is often slow, methodical, and offers a good opportunity for most movie-goers to make a quick trip to the restroom without missing much. This film over-develops some of the characters out of fear of under-developing them. The final product that has wowed so many pundits is in my humble estimation one that is comparable to watching a championship American football game---a collection of talented performers on a grand and entertaining stage----played on a wet surface on a rainy day and plagued by penalties, injury time-outs, replays and lengthy commercials.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Nearly drowns in style to start with, but does develop into something more solid","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIrving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a small time crook who grew up taking a few hard knocks, who finds a kindred spirit and partner in Sydney (Amy Adams) and together they mastermind powerful and elaborate swindles in high stakes situations. But they push their luck too far and undercover agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) busts them. To save their skin, they must help him spring a trap on seemingly wholesome Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) who DiMaso is convinced is dirty. But as Irving and the mayor come to form a more intimate friendship, loyalties and boundaries get pushed that little bit further.The 'American' dream always begs to be scrutinized by film makers, who start the titles of their films with the word 'American', implying their desire to scratch beneath the surface and show up the, potentially quite ugly, side to certain aspects of the culture and lifestyle. Here, director David O'Russell takes us back in time to the '70s, colourfully and stylistically bringing the fashion, music and setting back to life to have a stab at the love of the almighty dollar and the drive for material wealth. Yet it's a film that almost doesn't want to be taken quite so seriously, aiming to tell a straight forward, quirky heist tale, if only such strong writing, good acting and all round higher ambitions weren't getting in it's way.You come to make this assessment as to start with, the film almost seems to get carried away in style, drowning in all the modern flashy, slo-mo tricks any modern day cinema goer would be familiar with, matched by a brilliant '70s soundtrack. But the writing's nowhere near as lazy, and a bit of patience would make way for an intelligent and gripping story, a slow burning narrative that develops in to something fabulous. And if the story is multi-layered and pleasantly surprising, the performances are even better. In the lead role, Bale is a revelation as a dishonest lowlife with an unquenchable spark of humanity burning beneath the surface, but the supporting cast are among the most inspiring, notably Renner as the public spirited politician people just aren't willing to accept breaks the mold in decency, and Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's neurotic ex wife who throws a big spanner in the works as the plot gets under way.This is the sort of thing that can't be pulled off wrong, and O' Russell and his writers have ensured a tale that is solid, enthralling and revelatory. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Well Done,"American Hustle: the title talks on his own. This crime-comedy drama film shows us an incredibly transformed Christian Bale as the main character, followed Amy Adams (Man of Steel) as his ""not-so-secret"" lover, Jeremy Renner (The Avengers, The Bourne Legacy) as the Mayor of Camden, by the so much appreciated Bradley Cooper (The Hangover I,II and III) as an FBI agent, and the ""newborn"" beautiful star Jennifer Lawrence (The Hunger Games movies) as Christian's wife. Located in the United States of the 70's, this movie tells the story of Irving Rosenfeld, a con artist that meets a young and beautiful woman, Sydney Prosser, and falls in love with her. But wait: if you're now expecting the common and boring love story, hold on. You'll be surprised. Together, they start a new fraudulent business, flying in lower skies to maintain a certain safety. Nonetheless, one day they are caught by an undercover FBI agent, Richard DiMaso. This is where the real story starts, with a continuum of lies, frauds and deceptions between all the characters showing up in the plot, to end up... you will find it out. It was actually weird seeing Christian Bale as he was in this movie. After all, in our hearts he will always be our beloved Bruce Wayne, while in our heads the psycho-killer Patrick Bateman (pretty close to Batman as well, isn't funny?). But still, his performance was quite pleasant to the sight after a short while of adaptation. A fat, bald and emotional crook? He can be also that one person. But also the other characters are well-developed. Obviously, not being a psychological movie, there isn't so much room for a deep insight into everyone's personality, but it's still easy enough to grasp a general idea from their speeches, their acts, and of course the main narration. The plot was generally balanced and well-structured. The main sensation I had was that Russel didn't want to exaggerate with epic facts and events, as often nowadays happens with cinema. Appreciated choice. After all, this movie derives from a true story. Another good thing about it was that there is no redundancy of details, thus giving the viewer the chance to imagine again. So yes, in the end American Hustle counts as a ""Must-See"". Maybe not as those legendary pulps all of us know, but still its worth enough. With its sometimes grotesque humor, its thrilling plot, and well-placed casting, American Hustle gained its place into cinema's history.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great acting showcase but that's all,"The Colour Purple of the 21st century, this glamorous, super stylish albeit hollow crime drama got 10 Oscar nominations and went away with nothing. It's not hard to see why. Christian Bale and Amy Adams, 2 criminals, end up helping the FBI catch other hustlers. What follows is an endlessly complicated plot with more twists than a rubix cube, until finally we reach the end. Some of this actually happened, as the opening title card says. AH is primarily an acting showcase. Christian Bale's best actor nomination was something of a mystery, but he does more than put on weight and don a wig, and he's very entertaining. Bradley Cooper is excellent, Amy Adams is electric and is especially impressive as she has the hardest role in the film. Jennifer Lawrence steals the show from everyone and she absolutely crackles with energy. David O Russell, takes a story which doesn't need a lot of stunning visuals and fills it with vibrant camera-work while the production team do a good job recreating the 70s. Not bad for a film with some awful haircuts.Everyone loved AH at first, but it has since faced a backlash. The hype machine strikes again. The plot doesn't go anywhere, and since it constantly spits out twist after twist you never know what's going on. It is also totally style over substance and it lacks depth and purpose. The dialogue does have plenty of energy, but it does little more than prolong the scenes. It's certainly a visually stunning movie and quite a fun one at times, but did we really need to endure endless twists, aimless banter and all of that in your face style over substance for over 2 hours? Seriously? I'm glad it didn't win best picture, because if it had it would have become the new Crash. It's not a bad movie, but if you're looking for something which is actually Oscar worthy check out any of the other 8 best picture nominees of 2013. It's bizarre how people whine and moan about style over substance yet they shower films like this, Pulp Fiction, Avatar and How To Train Your Dragon with praise even though they are completely style over substance. Still, even if it's not Oscar worthy, I still enjoyed it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An American Tragedy,"American Hustle is a great movie. It's no surprise that it's nominated for Academy Awards in Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Supporting Actor and Actress. It's that good. I've fallen in love with the director, David O. Russell. Christian Bale ""is"" his character and though he's repulsive, forty-five minutes in you've come to care about him. By the end, you feel deeply. How he inhabits this character is the definition of an academy award performance. Amy Adams is subtle, brazen and luscious. Bradley Cooper, so manic and over- the-top, he is just nuts. Jennifer Lawrence nailed her part. I mean just jaw-dropping nailed it. Mesmerizing. All of it is mesmerizing, from the costumes to the dialogue, through plot and the ploy. Oh boy.American Hustle is a snapshot of a cultural phenomenon that occurred in the 70's in America. Sure, it's about some con artists and a sting operation paralleling Abscam. But it's much more.In America today, people become famous by taking videos of themselves having sex and posting them on the internet. The rest of America seems to want to watch those videos. Then those new ""stars"" have a reality TV show. We're in an age of the cult of me where someone is famous for being nobody and their main talent is they think are somebody.American Hustle reflects the time when the cult of me was beginning. Unless you lived in the 50's, it's impossible to imagine how conservative America was with women in girdles, shirtwaist dresses and pumps and Leave It To Beaver and Father Knows Best representing what Americans thought was ideal. Twin beds for married couples on TV and in movies. Many folks had left rural American and come to cities for jobs but things were still pastoral and provincial. The war was over and we were living in the American dream. But it was stultifying and stresses converged. The Vietnam War, the Birth Control Pill, lots more women in the workplace, a rise in divorce and latchkey children and much more. America started having a social fit, like a snake, it began to shake off the strictures of the 40's and 50's, up pops the 60's and real social upheaval. Sex, drugs and rock n' roll cogently says it.Our egos were filled with the right to self expression and that was the ultimate goal, to be an individual and to be free. Of course that didn't work out exactly as envisioned. This is what American Hustle reflects. This is the understory that we see, throbbing behind the plot.Start with personal vanity. Bale's pitifully hilarious, glued comb-over. Cooper's perm-rod acquired afro, Adam's plunging, breast-revealing necklines and Lawrence's nail obsession, capped by the fruity, rotten top coat, so Freudian. The four main characters are far away from ""down home, plain, no-nonsense"" America of the 40's, ""decent, aren't we all innocent, hard workers"" America of the 50's and even from the ""peace, love, turn-on and tune-out"" of the 60's. They have entered ""we are all movie stars or rock gods, whether wanna-be or full tilt."" This is Saturday Night Fever told about adults. This is glam rock gone wild, where even the men are obsessed with their hair.The characters are slick and smart, the dialogue ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" caustic and the movie incredibly styled, successfully, from set to costume to manner. I felt transported back in time in the disco scene, reminiscent at Amy's lovely breast-teasing outfits. This was what it was really like ""back in the day,"" though the ""plot"" of the con game and Abscam were not part of it for most, but certainly not so far removed either. Everything was loosened, for good or bad. It just fell where it might. That made it fascinating. That is what American Hustle so deftly depicts. Self-will run riot, damn the consequences.I have read many reviews of the movie. Most called it a comedy. I would hardly call it that. Certainly there are comedic moments, but primarily it is a tragedy, an American tragedy that still reverberates.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

American Hustle...Who's Hustling Who?,"Just watched AH last night and I really enjoyed it. I can see why it was up for so many Oscars because it doesn't allow you to breathe. If you miss something, forget it...it's gone and then you have to rewind your DVD to watch it. There's a lot going on, but I thought Mr. Russell gave us characters that we care about, and that's an important part of any movie. The soundtrack was awesome and mixed with the movie a la Boogie Nights. I laughed a lot at Louis CK's character, and the ending was satisfying. Overall a great watch, even if you really had to pay attention to what Mr.Bale was mumbling for the 2 hours. A great 2 hour ride!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Why? Well, because it just doesn't have what it takes to support repeated viewings.An impressive cast puts on an equally impressive performance for sure. And just if anyone is in doubt, yes, it is Christian Bale who outshines everyone in the movie with his particular performance. But it was also interesting to see Bradley Cooper in a role such as the one he had in ""American Hustle"".It is a rather long movie, but it does provide enough entertainment for the entire 132 minutes that it is running.""American Hustle"" is well-worth watching for the performances, characters and dialogue alone.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Possibly overrated, but a brilliant piece of cinema","With such a famous cast and with a screenplay that was #8 on the Blacklist, O'Russell certainly had his work cut out for him!Flared jeans, slinky dresses, elaborate fur coats and wacky glasses launches you back to the 70's, with a backdrop of old school New Jersey and Brooklyn setting the scene. The accents are also on point - Lawrence's American twang and Amy Adams' British tease are brilliant.With a cast including Batman, Katniss Everdeen and Hawkeye, the bar was certainly set high, but every single actor pulled their weight and transformed themselves into their characters. Literally for Christian Bale's overweight, crazy combovered Irving who packed on the pounds to get into character. All of the actors are as good as the rest, working with each other not to steal the scene or be better than the other. Bale and Adams are brilliantly compatible and Amy's sexiness is finally shown. Cooper is fantastic at getting right into the nitty, gritty part of his character and Lawrence is made for films. She moulds herself to any role, embracing and completely nailing everything she is attached to.American Hustle is captivating, intelligent and oh so stylish to watch.

American Hustle - Just who hustled who?,"Truth be told, American Hustle was the one movie I was most excited to see this year. As is most of America, I am in LOVE with Jennifer Lawrence. Once again, she did not disappoint me - it was unbelievable this scene stealing vixen in American Hustle is the same young girl in Hunger Games - Catching Fire. She couldn't be more versatile. Or Sexy. Or Crazy. Or Conniving. Or Brilliant.Director David O. Russell is at his finest - putting together a dream team - Christian Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner, Louis C.K., Shea Whigham and, in a brief but important appearance, Robert De Niro.mirror mirror: Lawrence, Adams In a film the New York Film Critics Circle is calling this years BEST, American Hustle has city leaders and ""low-lifes"" running in the same circle. So what's new? Movies have shown that for years. What does Russell do that makes this feel so different? Well, let's start with his opening credit: ""Some of this actually happened."" Right away we begin watching for the ""real moments"", right away we are on the edge of our seats. In one interview, Bale talks about Russell telling the cast to use the script as a ""guide"" - so often times they are totally off script. Many of the best scenes in the movie are actually improvised. I think this is what makes it so brilliant - it is just so real.The wardrobe and hairstyles are outstanding! The early scene in which Bale's character tends to his comb-over is as heartbreaking as it is disgusting. And don't worry, the soundtrack is just as sleazy.Christian Bale is AMAZING. I was so in love with his character, I just wanted to take him home with me and take care of him. Poor baby....Words can't even describe Rosalyn. Lawrence will walk away with the Oscar for this one. She is fantastic. And obsessed with smelling her nail polish - sweet n sour....Bradley Cooper once again plays a man on the brink of a full-on Mental Breakdown. He is one of the good guys - but is so obsessed with bringing down the goons, you are just waiting for him to totally lose it. And that perm...man we love the perm...And Amy Adams cleavage should have it's very own category.Bottom line, American Hustle did not disappoint. It was a very fun ride through the 70s, and a good reminder that you shouldn't always believe what you think you see. Snakes come in all shapes and sizes...and sexes..",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very good once it gets it's feet on the ground,"American Hustle 7.5/10- I will start this off by saying that I am a huge fan of David O'Russell, Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Jennifer Lawrence. It is an understatement to say that I hold David O'Russell's directing and his screen writing at the highest regard. American Hustle cons its way into making a near-masterpiece of film making.When I saw the previews for American Hustle, I read that American Hustle is loosely based on the 1978 ABSCAM scandal. I would explain what that is, but I do not want to ruin the movie for you. What I will say is, American Hustle gives a completely new view point on the FBI and how they do things. As said in the movie, the world is not black and white, it is gray. Now, none of the depiction of the ABSCAM scandal would be believable it was not for the great costume design. Bradley Cooper's curly hair looked hilariously superb, but Christian Bales comb over looked fantastic. The costume design department obviously knew what they were doing when they made these risky moves that more than paid off.It is impossible for me to describe how great the screenplay was. The movie has a lot of ground to cover in a short two hours and five minutes. American Hustle moves at an electrifying pace that informs everyone on the background of all the people involved. The movie is a shoe-in to be at the very least nominated for an Oscar in the screen writing department. Now, a great movie is nothing without great acting. The acting ensemble that American Hustle gathered from all of his previous movies and a few new members was perfect. A lot of credit goes to both David O'Russell and the casting department.When it comes to the acting, I do think everyone in the audience would agree that it was top-notch. Amy Adams, who plays Sydney Prosser, continues to deliver these amazing performances where she is sure to get a best actress in leading role nomination. Amy Adams plays the con-artist partner duo alongside Christian Bale. Christian Bale, who plays Irving Rosenfeld, amazes the audiences by his ability to commit to a role. Not many actors in Hollywood would be willing to give up a six-pack and gain forty pounds and have a comb-over for one movie role. This is what makes Christian Bale stand out. He can play any kind of character. He obviously did his homework for the role because he demonstrated his knowledge of the con game as the character that Bale plays is revered as one of the best con-artists of the 20th century. The Christian Bale-Amy Adams duo worked out well together and they showed good chemistry together. The characters they play, Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser go into the con-game together and are eventually forced to work with the hot-headed wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso. Bradley Cooper, who plays Richie DiMaso, gave a career best performance. He does not play very many characters that are arrogant and selfish, but no one in the audience would even guess that. Bradley Cooper also must have done his homework as he is being taught the con game by Irving Rosenfeld in American Hustle. Jennifer Lawrence will no doubt be nominated for best supporting Actress and I think she has a good shot at winning. Jennifer Lawrence plays Irving Rosenfeld's wife Rosalyn Rosenfeld. She has played this type of character before unlike the rest of the cast as she plays the loose cannon that can blow up the whole con whenever she becomes upset. Just like in Silver Linings Playbook, Lawrence plays someone who clearly has mental problems and her performance is so believable that some people guess if she actually has any mental issues. That is of course NOT true, she is just a normal nice cool young adult who deserves to be biggest in demand actress in Hollywood. But, that is neither here nor there.Last year, Silver Linings Playbook was the first movie to be nominated for an Oscar in all four acting categories. I think American Hustle has a legitimate chance at doing what Silver Linings Playbook did. It is just one of those movies that makes you love every single character despite all of their flaws and you kind of end up rooting for all of themAll in all, American Hustle deserves all of the great reviews it has gotten. You do not even need to like any of the actors to love American and I would recommend this movie to anyone thats wants to see one of the best films of the year.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excelsior Indeed !!,"American Hustle directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook) is a comedy-drama inspired by the real life events referred to as Abscam Scandal which happened in the late 1970s in USA when an FBI sting operation resulted in the conviction of several corrupt politicians including six Congressmen, a Senator and a Mayor.Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfield, pot bellied, pill-popping middle aged businessman who runs a of dry cleaning chain. However, he is actually conman and mints his money through fake art deals and hoodwinking people desperate for money with false promises of loans. He is trapped in a loveless marriage to the unstable Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and whose son, Danny, he had adopted. He meets his match in the smart Sydney Posser (Amy Adams), an ex-stripper and present day clerk at the Cosmopolitan magazine with soaring ambitions to reinvent herself. Mutual attraction gradually leads to a rollicking partnership when she suggests that she could assume the identity of Lady Edith Greensly, with a fake English accent and ""connections"" to London banks. The two thrive in mutual company and live the high life till they are trapped by the zealous FBI agent Richard Di Masso (Bradley Cooper). When Di Masso throws them an offer of immunity if they aid in arrest of four big league criminals, Irving and Edith/Sydney hesitantly agree to it. They try to entrap the popular Mayor Carmen Polito (Jeremy Renner) who is desperate for funds to rekindle the economy of Atlantic City. The stakes are raised higher with the involvement of the mob, the resultant involvement of some Congressmen whom Di Masso want to entrap, the growing unease between Irving and Edith/Sydney, Di Masso's growing feelings for Edith/Sydney and the edgy, unpredictable Rosalyn who is hovering around the scene like a gathering storm.Will Irving and Edith/Sydney succeed in fulfilling their end of the deal ? Would Di Masso emerge the hero for netting the big fish ? Does he forge an emotional connect to Edith/Sydney ? And, what role would Rosalyn play in all this ? The rest of the movie navigates us through this murky waters as these characters try to con each other (& themselves) in a roller coaster ride with loads of fun, witty dialogue, authentic 70s setting and some really well chosen songs that accompany the tense proceedings.While Silver Linings Playbook was evidence enough that David O. Russell is a master of creating complex characters that connect to the viewers, in American Hustle, he weaves sheer magic with an ensemble of such quirky characters played by a stellar cast. He has carefully chiseled out each character with a clear set of chinks and eccentricities which make them very human and enables the viewer to emotionally invest in them.Given such well written characters, it is but natural that the A-list stars that inhabit them revel in their respective roles. While his mastery in physical transformations is legendary, Christian Bale is simply superb as the tense conman who is apprehensive of the dangers involved in a high-stakes con and desperate to save his family and his love. Matching him every bit is a smouldering Amy Adams revelling in a complex character as she oozes sex appeal in her plunging necklines, fakes an English accent and alternates effortlessly between emotions whether when being hopelessly in love or her desperation for reinventing herself or her frustration on being cornered. Bradley Cooper plays the hot-headed over-ambitious FBI agent out to make a name for himself with elan and Jeremy Renner is good as the well-meaning Mayor. Robert De Niro leaves a lasting impression in a small role as a mob enforcer.Yet, it is Jennifer Lawrence who steals the show in a cameo as the feisty, unstable Rosalyn who feels frustrated with a marriage in shambles and craves for love and attention. As a loose cannon who could derail the carefully mounted con at any moment, she brings an intensity to a role which could have easily been a caricature. All of 23 years old, this talented lady is already a winner of Academy Award winner and stands a good chance to win another one this year for Best Supporting Actress. She has loads of talent and I may not be exaggerating if I say that she could well be the emerging as the Sachin Tendulkar of her art.David O. Russell, in mounting this delectable entertainer on a large pitch-perfect period canvas, appears to have finessed his mastery in presenting memorable features populated by volatile characters. He has presented us a winner here that is already a front runner at the Academy Awards with a clutch of nominations after having won several at the other award shows.EXCELSIOR, indeed !! An exhilarating experience that is sure to leave the viewers look forward impatiently for his next !!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""American Hustle"" has a lot of fun with a true story and makes us want to sing along.","According to Wikipedia, "".ABSCAM was a United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the FBI's Hauppauge, Long Island office in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation."" That investigation and its results form the basis for 2013's ""American Hustle"" (R, 2:18). But the film is only loosely based on the real-life story. The first thing on screen are the words: ""Some of this actually happened."" ""American Hustle"" stars Christian Bale as con man Irving Rosenfeld and Amy Adams as his girlfriend and partner-in-crime Sydney Prosser. Irving is running a small-time loan scam on New Jersey locals and doing pretty well, but business really takes off when Sydney gets involved, puts on a high-class British accent, starts calling herself Edith and portrays herself as well-connected with the banks in London. Personally and professionally, things go swimmingly for the pair, until they run into Bradley Cooper's FBI agent, Richie DiMaso, who entraps Irving and Sydney/Edith, and then forces them to work for him. As in real life, the undercover activities shift from targeting criminals to targeting politicians (trying to get them to take bribes).That's about all of the similarities between ""American Hustle"" and ABSCAM. Director David O. Russell (who also directed Oscar-winners ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""The Fighter"" and brings together the best actors from each of those movies to this one) focuses his film on the fictional characters that he created along with co-writer Eric Singer. This allows the movie to have some fun with both the characters and the story. As Sydney/Edith says in a bit of narration referring to something she did early in the film, ""There was a boldness about it. I didn't know where that boldness would take me, but I was gonna find out."" That quote also sums up my feelings as I watched this movie.Russell populates his story with a variety of colorful characters. Irving has a pot belly and an epic comb-over, but as Sydney says in a bit of narration, ""There was a confidence that drew me to him."" Irving's attitude is summed up with his quote: ""We're all conning ourselves, in one way or another, just to get through life."" Edith (who distracts her marks – and the audience members – with her revealing outfits) shows quite the aptitude for the con games they're playing, and she's a lot more comfortable than Irving with the higher-stakes stings that they're helping the FBI run. Meanwhile, Camden, New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) seems well-meaning and gets things done, but isn't completely ethical in achieving those results.Given the time period and the tone and style of this film, pretty early on it reminded me of a combination of two great 90s movies which also told stories set in the late 70s and early 80s - ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Goodfellas"". Then, when a song from the former showed up in this soundtrack and a major cast member from the latter showed up on the screen, the parallels felt even stronger. And, as ""American Hustle"" progressed, I also saw elements of ""The Grifters"" and ""The Firm"", two more excellent 90s films.As with those movies, in ""American Hustle"", it's both fun and interesting to guess who's playing whom and how all the characters are going to fare when the story has run its course. It's also interesting to see whether the use of a phony Arab sheik (Michael Pena, playing a Mexican-American FBI agent playing a sheik) helps or hurts the cause, and how Irving's crazy wife (Jennifer Lawrence) plays into the equation. (Yes, he's married, even though he's @#$%ing Sydney). Throughout the film, and especially when they finally meet each other, Adams' and Lawrence's characters seem to be competing for the title of ""Craziest Bitch in This Here Movie"".""American Hustle"" features a smart and funny script, along with several award-worthy performances from basically every actor mentioned in this review. The soundtrack and use of music in this film are also pretty great! I loved the old, familiar songs, but I also heard a non-English version of ""White Rabbit"", and thoroughly enjoyed the short scene in which Jennifer Lawrence cleans her house while rocking out to the James Bond anthem ""Live and Let Die""! If you appreciate great acting and like an entertaining story, you really should, regardless of whether you're an American, hustle on over to your computer and find this movie.

She's sly, confident, and just... sharp. But let's be real, sometimes the whole ""look how clever we are"" vibe of the movie drags a bit. It's like, alright mate, we get it, you're going for style over substance.Now that hotel scene with Irving (Christian Bale) and his wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence)? Bruv, that's pure chaos.

Bradley Cooper is the greatest movie actor in the world today.,"This movie starts out as an unmitigated clunker. For the first half hour or so the story is a meandering nothing, featuring characters who are utterly devoid of interest. This movie is so flat that it gives cause to leave it alone, and chalk it as another waste of time and money. Then, all of a sudden, the movie takes on new life. It immediately becomes interesting, exciting, and above all, fun to watch, and the reason for that: Bradley Cooper. He saves the movie; in fact, he IS the movie. He so thoroughly dominates this movie, meaning, every scene, that the producers could have sent the rest of the cast home. Christian Bale is not funny; Amy Adams is not funny; Jennifer Lawrence is outright shrill; Robert De Niro isn't even credited; but Bradley Cooper IS funny, and engaging, and, most importantly, entertaining. He carries this movie.

6-8/10 depending on your mood/intoxication levels,"This is an exceptionally difficult film to score - there's lots to like here and lots to loathe.Arguably, the same could be said for Wolf of Wall Street except the editing here, though not great, isn't up to the tragedy level of WoWS (did they cut *anything* from that film???) so there's still stuff in here that coulda/shoulda been cut or improved.The script, like the acting and the direction is both good and bad at times and how much you are affected by the good/bad on offer here will be totally down to personal sensitivities and will make this either a completely ordinary or a reasonably entertaining experience for you.For me, both Cooper and Bale were outshone by their female counterparts - Cooper I found intensely irritating throughout - Bale's role is by necessity less showy but it's a mixed performance for me with elements of his Patrick Bateman performance showing through all the extra hair, makeup and glasses etc.Amy Adams is extremely sexy to be sure but the director spends so much time luxuriating over her body (and for some reason her legs and feet - perhaps he shares my fetish ...) that anything that may be notable about her performance was lost to me.The real acting kudos here goes to Jennifer Lawrence who I think stood out in almost every scene she was in and I'll be looking out for her future work ...All in all, this is worth a view but you probably want to leave your brain at the entrance and pick it back up on the way out ...Like many ""big"" films recently, the general standard of how well the film was *crafted* seems to have slumped to levels I've not seen since the late 1970s.This is something I've witnessed in films like Gatsby(what the hell?? Awful!!), Wolf of Wall Street (45 minutes of worthy stuff stretched out for three hours) and 12 Years a Slave (decent but massively over-hyped with a weak script) - is it all getting just a bit too easy for folks up in Hollywood these days cos someone, somewhere, sitting atop this stuff is falling short in their duty imo ...",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Originality, Style and Wit written all over it","David Russell is on a roll. He is reinventing himself with every movie. Thanks to his splendid filmography till date, we know that he has his own and enviable style of humor. In Silver Linings Playbook he created a new genre called serious dromcom. In American Hustle he steps up and infuses humor in a rainbow of other emotions with typical Russelesque style, a style which is shockingly original and entertaining.A lot of credit should go to the fact that he has used his tried and tested cast in ever versatile Bale, coming of age -Cooper and one of the most promising female actors of these times in Jennifer Lawrence ( Oh! She is so lovable). She is so bloody convincing at everything she does that its almost impossible to not travel with her whenever she is on screen. Jeremy Renner as usual gets into the skin of the character without fuss and Amy Adams can take your breath away while she is trying to play seductive games with Bale and Cooper.​The USP of American Hustle does not lie in its story (it is like so many other con movies that we have seen in past), it lies in the depth and range of human emotions and behaviors that have been covered and presented with amazing ease, butter smooth camera work, epic one liners and utmost attention of detail.

Performances outshine film.,"The acting performances are really the only bright spot in the entire movie but it's SO long that even the great performances become tedious after a while. It's never entirely clear if Bale's character or Adams' character have a specific goal in the story. They just sort of... do what they do. And I can't remember ever seeing Bale's eyes even once, which is odd and creates a significant barrier into his character for the audience.The camera work was painfully awkward and distracting and one could sense the editor's struggle to find optimal edit points in the strangely choreographed camera moves.The oddly written script was poorly paced and had a disjointed quality to it that I can't put my finger on.It was nice to see Elisabeth Röhm finally in a big studio film.I think DOR should have let this script percolate a while longer before execution of the film. It just seems poorly developed and the half-baked narrative isn't quite as amazing as Three Kings, Boogie Nights, or Silver Linings Playbook.I give it a 1/10 here only to offset the number of 10/10 votes but to me, it's a 6/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thrilling ensemble piece of corruption and conmen. Fantastic to the last!,"American Hustle opens with the text: Some of this actually happened. Oh, that it were truly the case.Well, actually it is. Sort of.David O. Russell reunites the stars (Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence) of his starkly different but equally superb Silver Linings Playbook in a fantastic yarn, about a brazen conman, that bubbles along from the off and jostles the viewer along with its boundless energy and audacity. American Hustle lifts elements of a certain reality and weaves it into a fiction that is an absolute romp.Conman Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) is a smalltime wide boy who falls completely for the seductive, sharp-thinking Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) and forms a partnership for more not-so-petty scamming. Entrapped by FBI agent Richie Di Maso (Cooper), who has promotion in mind and far bigger fish he wishes to fry, Irving and Sydney are forced into organizing the mother of all cons that Richie hopes will bring down Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), the big cheeses in the Mafia and a host of politicians. It is a convoluted and dangerous plan fighting corruption with corruption and with money, power and lives at risk. And hiding in the wings is Rosalyn (Lawrence), Irving's highly-strung, volatile wife.There is so much energy coursing through American Hustle with writers, director and cast on terrific form. This is such a cleverly crafted and beautifully written film with an accomplished director, who can evidently juggle multitudinous strands and ideas, in the chair, and a starry cast that would struggle not to make the best of it. They do, and it keeps the audience riveted until the fat lady sings.Bale, with a comb over that is so awful you have to love it, struts his portly stuff with arrogant panache. Frequently he displays signs of Robert De Niro (in his heyday, not the De Niro of The Family) but Bale is in a class of his own when it comes to method, intensity and versatility and though his Irving is no Adonis, like Sydney, we can't help but fall for him completely.There are many films were the star power works on paper (Larry Crowne, any one?) but on film it is very obvious that someone forgot to invite the chemistry along to the party. Not so here. There is a fantastic crackle of electricity between the principal quintet and, though Bale is clearly in command of our attention here, it is in the company of his peers that he plays hardest. The relationship that develops between Irving and Carmine adds a gentleness to the boisterous mayhem that bubbles away behind the scheming.Apart, both Lawrence and Adams are exciting in their performances as the ladies in Irving's life but, though this is the seventies, neither woman is a doormat and both hold the men around them by the short and curlies, one with guile, the other with desperation. And when they finally share a room, oh boy, hell freezing over could never be that glacial! Cooper, though not in the same league as Bale, adds another superb blend of bumbler and Jack the lad to his CV. Always watchable, inevitably entertaining, he is the equal of his co-stars in this wonderful ensemble piece that will remain vivid in the memory even when we are preparing to bid this year farewell.American Hustle thoroughly delights, entertains and will surely end the year laden with gold honestly gained. Throughout, it is thrilling, funny, dramatic and intense. As the narrative unravels so do the plans of the protagonists, while their lives become ever more complicated by predicaments that could only exist in the mind of the most creative of writers.Couldn't they?For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining but highly over-rated,"After finally watching American Hustle I just had to look up the meaning of the word ""overrate"" and this is what I found -1. have a higher opinion of (someone or something) than is deserved. ""an overrated player"" synonyms: assess too highly, overestimate, overvalue, rate/prize too highly, think too much of, exaggerate the worth of, attach too much importance to; praise too highly, exaggerate the merits of, over-praise, oversell, glorify, magnify; informalblow up; rareover-prize ""it is easy to overrate what Frederick achieved"" antonyms: underrate, underestimateMuch of what you see above you is a perfect summation of what American Hustle is, a film overrated to the point of complete saturation. Upon release critics and audiences alike were swept away in a frenzy of hype for a movie that, while highly enjoyable in many respects, is also completely and utterly unmemorable and way tpo self assured to ever become anything more than a slight Hollywood romp.David O. Russell is a director who in recent years has found favour where once he had mere art-house aficionados. Hustle, much like his previous and even more offensively overrated Silver Linings Playbook saw the director strike awards gold and box office gold with a story and script that wafts in it's own importance. Much was said about just how witty and biting the dialogue in Hustle is but personally I felt it's nothing more than a sneaky smile inducing type of event. Russell seems to have said to the cast ""speak loud, fast and at times mumble"" as much of what is said on screen is done in such an over the top, unbelievable way that its hard to see these characters as real people or in fact care for them and their various plights, and that's where the film falters above all else.The lead characters in the piece, Irving and Sydney, are well played by Bale and Adams, with Adams in particular the most worthy of the critical lauding the ensemble received. Bradley Cooper, who is once again cast in a role that feels like a different take on the same character, is nothing more than annoying while Lawrence has moments of both averageness and softly spoken greatness. The story these characters inhabit is such a complicated and murky one that we the audience really needed more to hold onto to carry us through, but you'd be hard pressed to care whether they succeed or fail with such an unlovable bunch; in the end it's likely you'll wish you spent more time with Jeremy Renner's mayor than any of these ""cons.""It's hard to fathom that Hustle received 10 Oscar nominations this year, but justice was served with it walking away empty handed. Sometimes a film comes along and strikes a cord with a moment in time and that's what Hustle is, a quick con that succeeded at the time yet in time will be quickly forgotten about. It's an enjoyable 2 hours thanks to a intriguing real life scenario and some interesting acting but overall American Hustle is not as cool as it so clearly thinks it is.3 intense comb-overs out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role American Hustle (2013),"In 2012, the review website IndieWire stated Lawrence had a ""down-to-earth, self-deprecating, unaffected"" personality. An IGN writer considers her to be a ""sharp"", ""funny"" and ""quirky"" actress who likes to ""stay grounded"" despite considerable success. Lawrence says that she finds acting ""stupid"" in comparison to life-saving professions like doctors, and therefore does not believe in being ""cocky"" about her success
A close-up of Jennifer Lawrence
Lawrence at the premiere of A Beautiful Planet in 2016In 2012, Rolling Stone called her ""the most talented young actress in America."" Her Hunger Games co-star Donald Sutherland has favorably compared her craft to that of Laurence Olivier and considers her an ""exquisite and brilliant actor"". David O. Russell (who directed her in Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and Joy) has praised her effortless acting that makes her performances look easy. During her career, Lawrence has played roles in both high-profile, mainstream productions and low-budget independent films, and has appeared in a range of film genres. She did not study acting and has not been involved in professional theater. She instead bases her acting approach on her observations of people around her. The actress told The Globe and Mail in June 2010 that she does not ""invest any of my real emotions"" or take home any pains of her characters. Lawrence went on to say that ""I don't even take it to craft services"" and has never shared their experiences, relying instead on her imagination, noting ""I can't go around looking for roles that are exactly like my life."" She stated that ""If it ever came down to the point where, to make a part better, I had to lose a little bit of my sanity, I wouldn't do it. I would just do comedies.""",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointing,"Let me say at the outset that I am at odds with the majority of critics and IMDb reviewers to date in that I thought that American Hustle was an ordinary movie. It's not that I didn't want to enjoy it. I really like Christian Bale and Amy Adams, I think that Jennifer Lawrence is destined to become the best actress of her generation and I like Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner and Robert de Niro. From a cast level, I wanted it to succeed.Perhaps my mistake was in viewing it as a drama. True, there were some humorous lines but I thought that essentially the movie aimed at the dramatic, with some violent scenes adding weight to that view. Now I find out from the Golden Globe nominations that it was a musical or comedy. (The soundtrack was good, so maybe the nominators have viewed it as a musical??)Seriously, though, I was expecting more action. I thought that the movie was too long and some scenes were far too tedious, and as a result I became bored. In addition, I didn't much care what happened to any of the seedy characters, which added to my level of apathy.I am out of step with the majority, as I have admitted, but I felt that the alternative view deserved to be aired.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

"I didn't enjoy watching the film, but can't stop thinking about it.","I found the story depressing, no characters you really wanted to root for, and the evocation of the 1970s unsettlingly accurate. I remember it as a grim decade filled with sketchy people making bad choices.That's why I had to grudgingly give American Hustle 8 Stars. They totally nailed it. It's not a feel good movie. It's has no central character to identify with and root for. Everyone is flawed, but compelling. Just like life. The performances were top notch, IMO. Especially Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence. They totally committed to their characters and made these deeply flawed, often unlikable people unforgettable. The film was like a multi-car pileup. You don't want to see it, but you just can't turn away, and it just keeps building.I did not enjoy watching this film. Yet after it ended, I couldn't stop thinking about it. This movie deserves every award it garners. Great cast. Great story. Deftly told. I think all the uncredited cameos speaks to the quality of the material. So many people wanted to be a part of this. I can understand why. It may never be a blockbuster, but it's a great piece of storytelling and a memorable ensemble piece. 20 years from now this will still be a film worth watching. Everyone involved should be proud of what they made together. The more time passes since seeing it, the more impressed I am with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
From the Feet Up,"""American Hustle"" begins with one of the best opening scenes in recent memory. Before we see anything else, we see Christian Bale -- the guy who played millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne not that long ago -- meticulously arranging, pasting, and spraying into place a terribly elaborate and truly hideous comb over. It's funny, and it tells us volumes about this character. He's a con man, a master at the art of deception, and a very careful one. Every detail has to be exactly right, ""from the feet up"" -- all the way up to the fake hair.But he's gotten himself into a situation where nothing's right, everything is slapdash, and he's out of control. It's only a matter of time before he ends up in prison, or worse. That's all thanks to Bradley Cooper, an FBI agent who caught on to one of his small time schemes, and is using it as leverage against him and his partner, Amy Adams into larger and ever more dangerous schemes, until they're looking at taking down powerful politicians, and ending up on the wrong side of the mob. Bale isn't happy about any of this; he's a small fish happy in his big pond; he'd rather be scamming gambling addicts than having a sitdown with Robert De Niro.Some of this actually happened. The film is based on the ""Abscam"" scandal from the late '70s, loosely. The historical situation is pretty crazy in and of itself, and indicative of the dysfunction in American government and culture in the '70s. (""Argo"" this ain't.) In a nutshell, the FBI grew tired of being reprimanded by Congress, so the feds launched an operation against Congress itself. It involved a fake ""Arab"" seeking to invest millions into New Jersey's slumping economy, and willing to grease whatever palms necessary to get the casino licenses, citizenship and anything else needed to get the job done. Abscam brought down several Representatives and one Senator on bribery charges, but it also resulted in something called the ""Civiletti Undercover Guidelines,"" which basically was the Attorney General telling the FBI to never do anything like it ever again.It's a situation a little too messy for a straightforward film adaptation, but David O. Russell likes to make messy movies. Russell's signature talent is his ability to both create and control chaos on screen. He loves to set crazy characters on colliding paths, and knows there are infinite ways to play crazy. It's hard to imagine any other director managing the scenes Russell manages, scenes in which three or four or five crazy people bounce off of each other at odd angles in fantastically entertaining ways. He's also skilled at swinging from zany to serious (and back) at the drop of a hat. It's kind of like watching Real Housewives: these people are nuts, but we care about them anyway. Actually, it's infinitely more entertaining than Real Housewives.Russell has developed a consistent stable of actors he likes to work with -- or who like to work with him. Rumor has it he's an extremely demanding director, known for feeding improvised lines to actors from alongside the camera during shooting. Also, there's a video on YouTube of him ranting and raving at Lily Tomlin during the shooting of ""I Heart Huckabees,"" though Tomlin afterward said that everything was fine between them and she'd be happy to work with him again. Some can't take the heat, and some thrive in it.Amy Adams is better in Russell's movies than in anything else she's done, and so is Bradley Cooper. Cooper has earned Oscar nominations for his two performances in Russell's films, despite playing basically the same character in both of them (manic and naive, goal-driven, desperate, prone to violent outbursts but somehow forgivable and even innocent.) I'm not convinced yet that Cooper is a great actor--I'd like to see more range in his performances -- but he has without a doubt created a very watchable character performance that can span multiple films. In that way he's kind of like Al Pacino or Woody Allen.Christian Bale, on the other hand, is a man of a thousand faces (and mannerisms, accents, etc.) If the Oscar always goes to the actor who uglies up best, Christian Bale got robbed. He gained 50 lbs and looks terrible. I guess that's not as impressive at Matthew McConaughey losing 50 lbs., but McConaughey is still rodeo-sexy through most of Dallas Buyers Club. Bale just looks bad here, and that's good. It's amazing to me that the same guy can play Batman, Patrick Bateman and a crackhead boxing has- been who once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard (or maybe he just tripped.)But Jennifer Lawrence, who can seemingly do anything, might be the best part of the movie. She plays Bale's wife, whom he can't seem to get away from (he calls her ""the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate."") She routinely steals scenes by playing absolutely, but uniquely and distinctly, batshit crazy. She's the opposite of her nail finish--she's mostly rotten and a little bit sweet, and you can't get enough of her. You just keep coming back.""American Hustle"" is a zany, screwball ride, but it's also a movie about survival and reinvention. It's about people who are conning themselves, who are desperate to get out of their situations and maybe their skins. Ironically, the only characters who have a firm grasp on their real identities are the cons . In the world these characters live in, ambition is the greatest sin -- ambition and lying to your friends.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
So bad it hurts,"Here we have one of the most over hyped and overrated films from the past decade. You probably saw a trailer and thought how good this would be. You are off by a mile.The Direction by David O. Russell, AKA Scorsese wannabe. First things first, I read in the trivia that most of the movie was improvised, how good is that! Not good at all, obviously during this process the actual basic plot and characters got lost and ended up being spat out right at the end. Good direction and writing? Oscar WORTHY?! The polar opposite, Mr O. Hustle was the con master, not Christian Bale, he managed to get people to go and see this.The writing. Now this is the biggest joke about this ""film"" (Im sorry i cant type film without thinking SNL Skit with ridiculous wigs). What exactly happens? Who in the hell knows, i sure as hell don't. I watched this thinking .....? my little sister could have wrote a better script. Does O. Hustle think he is the new Scorsese? Probably. Is he? So far from it its funny.The Performances. Good god, to be honest i like everyone of these actors, A LOT! Except Jennifer Lawerence, but i wont get into anything personal. Im going to skim through this by saying they are utterly insufferable. Even Christian Bale is horrible? What he can do no wrong, well thats what i thought until i saw this. Now Jennifer... what are you doing woman! How old are you exactly? 16?

"Hustle over to the cinemas right now and see ""American Hustle"", a highly amusing and charming gem of a film.","There's something to be said for films that provide endless charm and plenty of smiles to audiences. Especially in an age of dark, gritty, moody reboots and over-bight, assembly-line cookie-cutter Hollywood schlock... it's like a breath of fresh air after holding your breath underwater to find a film such as ""American Hustle."" A release that will immediately make you feel better, and remind you of the magic of cinema.Beginning with an amusing tease that ""Some of this actually happened"", we follow the story of veteran con-artist couple Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), who are apprehended by FBI agent Richard ""Richie"" DiMaso (Bradly Cooper) after a sting to catch them on a loan scam. The duo are promised to be released as part of a bargain, if they can help provide DiMaso with more arrests. However, a number of complications arise, including Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who threatens to complicate matters and has an ongoing rivalry with his lover Sydney, DiMaso's sometimes reckless eagerness and growing feelings towards Sydney, Irving growing friendship with Mayor (and target for the operation) Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), and constant complications to the ever-growing and changing scheme. Amongst many other often-comical foils to the plot.This is a film that is most certainly all about the cast, and how they portray the characters. And it is one of the finest ensemble films I've seen in some time. While the entire cast is absolutely wonderful, I first have to give credit to the two strongest performers here- Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams, both of whom I am a massive fan of. Here, they really both become the heart of the film in different ways, conveying outstanding performances that left me in awe. I was particularly amused by Adams' dual roles, not only as Sydney, but also as the British aristocrat ""Lady Edith Greensley"", a false identity she created for her schemes, and an identity she is forced to slip in and out of often during the film. And Lawrence, who I first noticed in the very well-done ""X-Men: First Class"", before becoming an enormous fan with ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"", completely steals the show in her scenes, giving Rosalyn a lot of complexity, and conveying a number of different mindsets- everything from wild drunk to manically depressed and enraged. Lawrence has quickly become arguably the best actress of her generation. And I was more than thrilled that both her and Adams won their respective Golden Globs. (And I hope they do win their Oscars)The rest of the cast is marvelous as well. Bale proves himself once again to be completely fearless, making Irving a complex, confident-yet- insecure-at-times individual, who is... well, physically very off- putting due to a large gut and a balding head. Bale is so much fun in this film. Cooper is also a blast, starting off somewhat noble before becoming a greedy, over-eager and cocky man who still has a lot of charm. Renner is also great as Carmine, a decent man who unfortunately gets sucked into some shady dealings. And I do have to give a shout-out to someone I think is very over-looked in the cast, which is Louis CK. CK portrays one of Renner's superiors at the FBI, and while his scenes are often brief, they are hysterically funny, very memorable, and very well-acted. I wish CK could have been nominated for at least a few awards, because frankly, he deserves them.The production is absolutely great. Director/Co-Writer David O. Russell weaves a surprisingly complex-yet-accessible caper with his script (co-written by Eric Warren Singer), and it's full of much great humor. Even during scenes where it wasn't laugh-out-loud, the film's charm and jokes left a constant smile on my face and gave me numerous chuckles and giggles. Russell's direction is also top-notch and quite classy, providing us with the best possible visual storytelling. (Although I will nitpick that I didn't like a few shots where the camera would rapidly move into closeup, as I found it somewhat distracting, but that's a very small nitpick in an otherwise flawless film.)I also really have to give a shout-out to the set and costume design. Set in the 70's, this film does a wondrous job conveying its timeframe, and the sets/locations were particularly beautiful. I also highly admired the costume design, which not only felt authentic, but lended a sort-of classic ""Hollywood beauty"" to the aesthetic. (Although certain wardrobe choices for certain actresses did lead to much distraction for myself as a male viewer. If you've seen the film you will know what I'm talking about.) And the musical choices were phenomenal. I almost found myself singing along in the theater during one sequence when Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" came on.I really don't know what else to say. This is just a fun, fun, fun film. It's one of the most charming movies I've seen in years, and one of the most joyously humorous. I haven't enjoyed a trip to the cinemas this much in months, and I do think this film deserves every nomination and award it receives. (And I didn't even have the time to address certain other strengths, including a surprising cameo from a film legend that I won't surprise.)""American Hustle"" is a perfect 10 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A full-throttled tribute to the American con man,"For all that we revere the farmer, the soldier, the statesman, the law enforcer, the clergyman and the hero, we Americans have always reserved a special place in our hearts for the outlaw, the gangster, the card shark, the con man, the hustler. It's a trait that goes to the very core of our identity as a people, a crucial element in our national mythology. From our most humble beginnings, hustling has stood as a time-honored tradition, a value ""as American as apple pie."" Indeed, whole genres of literature and popular entertainment have sprung up around this idea. And for all the lip service we pay to what we righteously call the Protestant work ethic, we can't help but subversively admire those who are able to achieve the American Dream through less noble and less arduous means. Indeed, our history is populated with scoundrels and scalawags we've somehow managed to turn into folk heroes, and, while today our grifters operate on Wall Street or in corporate boardrooms rather than on the western frontier, the characteristics are the same: they're all just slick-talking manipulators operating outside the system and making a fortune while doing so. And, oh, how we love it! Unless it's being done to us, of course; then, we're not so crazy about it, which is why when it involves political corruption, the fleecing of us the taxpayer, we may no longer be quite so forthcoming in our admiration.""American Hustle"" is David O. Russell's smart and savvy tribute to the con artist in all of us. He and his co-writer, Eric Warren Singer, have chosen to set their work in the 1970s, an age of polyester suits, ultra-wide lapels, porkchop sideburns and bad comb-overs. It was also host to one of the biggest financial scandals of the modern era, Abscam, an FBI sting operation that resulted in the convictions of a mayor (played by Jeremy Renner), a United States Senator, six United States congressmen and an assortment of state officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania on bribery and corruption charges. ""American Hustle"" starts off by declaring that ""SOME of this actually happened,"" and, indeed, the movie's often absurdly comic, larger-than-life quality makes us question the veracity of a good deal of what we're seeing. But no matter because the movie is clearly more a study in character and theme than it is a factual recounting of the events of history (which explains why all the names have been changed to protect the guilty).And what a cast of characters Russell has gathered for our amusement and delectation! A paunchy, balding Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld, a natural-born shyster who's found a way to earn money (to the tune of $5,000 a crack) through offering loans to people desperate for cash, money these down-on-their-luck individuals will never see. Irving is married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), a scatterbrained chatterbox who is so high maintenance that Irving is forced to live on his own even though he supports her and her son, whom he's adopted as his own. Irving's problem is that for all his willingness to rip off people, he may be just a tad too softhearted to be very lucrative at his profession. Enter Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), an attractive woman with some secrets of her own who becomes Irving's business partner and lover. They're not in the business very long before undercover FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) blows the lid off their operation, offering them immunity from prosecution if they'll help take down some bigger fish. Richie is, in many ways, the focal point of the screenplay, a preening, overreaching lawman whose main concern is netting as many big fish in his net as he can in order to make a name for himself. It's not long before tensions are developing among the three principal players, and much of the movie's fun derives from watching these two outsized figures, who find their value in being able to manipulate others to their own advantage, engaging in what amounts to a giant pi**ing contest over strategies, ethics and even Sydney herself.As with any good tale of con artists and grifters, ""American Hustle"" beguiles us with the spectacle of hustlers hustling the hustlers, since, as we're told, hustlers are ultimately just people ""doing what they need to do to survive."" It gets to the point that not only do the characters not know who's telling the truth and who's playing whom, the audience can't tell either. And even though Richie thinks he's shrewd enough to play in the big leagues, he soon learns the bitter lesson that, when it comes to hustling, amateurs should never mess around with professionals.Russell employs a dizzying whirlwind technique - consisting of fast-paced storytelling, energetic camera-work and editing, snappy dialogue, crisp narration - that puts one in mind of ""Goodfellas."" Even when the action is set in an enclosed room, which is often the case, the movie never stops moving. It's alive and we're alive to it. Moreover, the spot-on period details, especially the uber-tacky 70s fashions, only serve to heighten the absurd humor of the tale we're watching.""American Hustle"" boasts one of the finest acing ensembles we've come across in quite some time, which, in addition to the main cast, includes Louie CK, Michael Pena and Robert De Niro, among others.There's a manic energy in both the performances and the filmmaking in ""American Hustle"" that perfectly reflects the soul of a nation founded on youthful vigor and anti-establishment rule-breaking. And indeed it's that uniquely American spirit of anarchic iconoclasm that Russell captures to such memorable effect in ""American Hustle.""",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Hustle Review,"""Some of this actually happened"" reads an early title card, rather than the traditional ""inspired by a true story"", these words provide a sense of relief. Director David O. Russell acknowledges the historical ABSCAM investigations that influenced this film but he isn't willing to let the details compromise the story he wants to tell. Like his previous work he is able to focus on the characters story than the plot.""American Hustle"" is his second film of the past 12 months after ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and for this project he gathered an ensemble cast by combining Christian Bale and Amy Adams of 2010's ""The fighter"" with Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro from ""Silver Linings Playbook""The interaction between these cast members offers a unique chemistry that could never be replicated with any other actor each character has their own story and each story is told to perfection, but its when these stories intersect that the emotions emerge and the quirky sense of humour follows.The hair-styling, costumes and set design is fascinating to examine and O. Russell emphasises the 70s look by using camera angles iconic to 70s movies, like John Travolta's strut in Saturday Night Fever.American Hustle opens on Christian Bale's 'beer belly', as the camera tilts up, we see him piecing together a rather elaborate comb over. Gone is his physique from ""The Dark Knight"" Trilogy as Bale again puts his body through an intense transformation for his role in as Irving Rosenfeld.Irving is an experienced con-man who along with his cunning partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for FBI agent Ritchie Di Masso (Bradley Cooper). DiMasso pushes them into a world of Jersey power brokers and mafia that's as dangerous and alluring.Amy Adams has never been better, she is sleek, sexy and seductive as Sydney Prosser The chemistry between her and Irving seems genuine, but the ease and comfort that she plays her British alias Lady Edith Greensly keeps us on our toes, whose side is she really on? Amy Adams is dazzling and guaranteed to feature in the upcoming awards season even her cleavage gets enough screen time to warrant an Oscar statue.It's the hot-headed Ritchie DiMaso who transforms the most throughout the film. Played by Bradley Cooper, Richie is the young, ambitious FBI agent still living with his mother and with a point to prove. His ambition sometimes gets the better of him as he tries to bag some of the biggest crooks in the state.Caught in the middle of this diverse threesome is Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito, the passionate New Jersey politician who wants to recover the local economy and Jennifer Lawrence as Irving's wife Rosalyn – A real loose cannon and the most manipulative of the lot.When Rosalyn almost sets the kitchen alight by putting metal in the new ""Science Oven"" (Microwave). She manages to manipulate her husband to show a bit of gratitude for extinguishing the flames. In a role written specifically for Jennifer Lawrence she continues to prove that she is the most versatile and talented actress in Hollywood. No matter what she's doing she is enchanting, even an unexpected rendition of ""Live and let die"" is captivating.The biggest setback for American Hustle is its pacing, although never boring, the film does meander and the 138 minute runtime begins to be felt midway through, however this is somewhat redeemed with an energizing use of 70's music, featuring tracks from Elton John, David Bowie and the Beegees.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Oy.,"Not sure where to start. I love period dramas. I love this cast. But this movie was a mess. I think everyone did as well of a job for what they had to work with. It felt like the director's main goal was to go big, and along the way forgot sustenance. The opening scene of Christian Bale, while odd, I thought was one of the better scenes for the 2+ hour movie. It was thorough, uninterrupted, and gave the audience a perfect example to his character without telling the viewer so specifically it becomes annoying.Will not be watching again. With all the far better movies out there, I would not recommend this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Niche Movie about Character Development and Relationships,"If you plan on seeing this film, do not expect to see one that is heavy on the plot. The plot for this film is used almost exclusively as a setting for the characters to interact.With that being said, all of the characters become part of an intricate plot that is bigger than themselves, and David O. Russel does an incredible job of humanizing each of the players in this game. I found myself not looking forward to some ""big bang"" ending or intricate underlying twist like that of an Oceans flick, but awaiting the next interaction between conflicting characters and just how pathetic, comedic, humanizing, or intimate they can reveal themselves to be. It's a movie about strongly connected characters and how they will blindly step all over each other in order to achieve their goals. The entire cast is incredible at their roles and it's wonderful seeing such beautiful people playing such flawed, vulnerable, and believable characters.If you go to this movie expecting an action-packed plot with a Hollywood ending, you will leave disappointed. If you go into the movie with an interest in the characters and their evolution throughout the film, you'll be delighted at every turn.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Surprisingly Great Movie,"I'll get this out of the way right now: I'm not the biggest fan of David O. Russell. Nothing against him personally, but, after having seen The Fighter and The Silver Linings Playbook, he just doesn't do it for me in general. The former was okay, while the latter crapped out with some dumb script contrivances in the third-act. He's like Quentin Tarantino: talented, but not my cup of tea. The only difference? Tarantino is too chatty and over-the-top, while O. Russell is overly blunt and melodramatic.I say this because American Hustle genuinely surprised me. It's not the deepest movie by any means, nor is it the most profound, but it IS a well put-together film about how insignificant we really are in the grand scheme of things. Everyone is just trying to scrape by, even the incredibly ambitious, and denying that reality only makes your inevitable wake up call that much more disturbing. And this is what really makes the movie shine, even amidst the hilarity and shallowness that frequently goes on on-screen.It's most likely that I'll end up being alone on this one, or perhaps in the minority, but this is one of my favourite movies of 2013. I found it more compelling than The Wolf of Wall Street, much funnier than Nebraska and even more of a well-written character piece than Saving Mr. Banks. I mean no disrespect to any of those movies, I liked all of them, but it was just no contest. I've been told that American Hustle will be forgotten in a year, but I say that it'll be more remembered than people give it credit for; after all, it has one of the greatest end- twists I've seen in the past decade! That has to account for something, right?4.5/5...",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Much more than a con-caper,"Excellent movie. Ostensibly a con-caper, it is so much more than that. Clever, and, most of all, wickedly funny. In fact, it is the humour that tips this movie from being good to being great.Writer-director David O Russell brings together the main cast from his last two movies, and they don't put a foot wrong.Christian Bale, as always, throws his entire life into his role, putting on several kilograms and going out of his way to look sleazy. Amy Adams is superb, as always. Bradley Cooper is solid in his role as the FBI agent.Stand-out performance, however, goes to Jennifer Lawrence. She gets the funniest lines and scenes and they seem to suit her perfectly. Her over-the-top, manic performance steals the show.(Bale and Adams were both in Russell's ""The Fighter"", and Lawrence and Cooper were in his ""Silver Linings Playbook).Good support from Jeremy Renner, Louis CK, Jack Huston and Shea Whigham. Robert De Niro only appears for a few minutes but leaves lasting impression. Still as good as ever.Add in a superb, rockin' soundtrack, by now a given for a David O Russell movie, and this movie is a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good Movie,"This movie was surprisingly good. By watching the trailers, I didn't really know what was going to go on so I went into it somewhat clueless. It reminded me a lot of Pulp Fiction, just in the style that it was done (although not in many different stories that all make one eventually) but by it starting off in the middle and then went back and continued from the beginning. It did seem to drag on though. Some parts could have been shortened but overall, it was a good film. The costumes were good and the ladies were for sure beautiful! I loved their hair throughout the entire film. Especially Jennifer Lawrences updo. I will definitely see this film again, although probably not in theaters.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
the film of the year is a misunderstood work of genius!,"I am on the road but outraged at the negativity toward a brilliant film. Not only does this movie nail the 70's in so many ways, but mirrors current events (New Jersey) in such perfect concordance, that it seems completely predictive of a thousand news stories circling the planet. How current does a movie have to be when it looks deep in the heart of darkness in American politics and then it all plays out right in front of us? As someone who lived in the middle of this kind of political world, I could not stop laughing at the perfect characterizations by a director who has assembled the best cast since Altman. Christian Bale and Amy Adams create a pair of con people that forever change the way you look the whole world of corruption. This is a classic work. And as I left the sold out theater, the audience seemed as astounded as they should have been. As far as the negative views on this site, you missed a film I will never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Genius cinematography and brilliant performance by Christian Bale and Amy Adams,"American Hustle's filming-style is artistic, and the angles captured are attention-grabbing, somewhat resembling the Tarantino-style cinematography in certain scenes. Very thought-out cinematography.The film's screenplay was entertaining, the dialogue authentic, weaving both drama and comedy together in a harmonious fashion. Christian Bale was phenomenal in this film, demonstrating exceptional versatility, and incredibly amusing to watch. And, Amy Adams intense expression of feelings and facial expressions are remarkable. Wacky hairstyles and marvelous clothing design collaborate in creating the eccentric setting. Some level of predictability arguable, yet a very amusing and well-made film throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a let down,"I like the TV show Hustle and I don't remember why I expected great things from this film. After just a few minutes I was thinking, 'What a slow start', and that feeling stayed for the whole film. Maybe the last 5 minutes were the most enjoyable.Con? What con? Sexy women? Where? Tension? Hardly. I felt that in the right hands the story and characters and locations and tension could have been a 10.

Jennifer Lawrence steals the show in this very entertaining flick,"""American Hustle"" is a pretty darn good, entertaining, and fun film. While I don't think it's director David O' Russell's best film, I still think it is his best directed. It is directed with a flashy style that really fits with the era of the movie. There are many over the top moments and exaggerated camera sweeps that really brings a lot of excitement on screen. The script is layered with hilarious dialogue and deeper meaning of living the ""American Dream"" than what is actually being presented on screen. However, I wish it did have more focus and a tighter story as it did feel like it was all over the place. The journey is also more satisfying than the actual conclusion.The cast is great and the director really gets some amazing performances from the cast. Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Bradley Cooper are great in their roles and play very dimensional characters. They make them come alive and their on-screen chemistry is great. However, the real stand-out in this star studded cast is Jennifer Lawrence, who doesn't have as much depth or screen time, but commands total attention on-screen. She embodies everything that the movie is going for by being over the top, zany, and full on entertaining. Every time she was off-screen, I kept on begging for more.Overall, ""American Hustle"" is a really good movie that is equal parts entertaining and thought provoking. It never reaches any emotional highs and needs some focus, but David O' Russell's stylish direction, use of high energy music, and committed cast makes this movie something special. I give it 4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
No Hustle. The Real Deal,"Just got out of the theater for this one.American Hustle is a brilliant blend of great acting, a perfect script, and copious amounts of dark humor to keep everyone thoroughly entertained during the film's two hour and twenty minute run time.Bale absolutely nails it as a sleazy con man that we can somehow relate to and shake our heads at the whole time, and Adams has once again grown as a competent actress to match him. This duo could not have been more perfect for this story. Bradly Cooper also extends his acting range and slowly let's the audience in on the pathetic nature of his character. Cooper had several scenes that had the whole crowd rolling with laughter....and the there's Jennifer Lawrence. Wow. Will she ever stop topping her self in these dramatic roles? I was worried about a younger actor standing up to the other heavy weights on screen, but she steals the show in every scene she has. The ""Live and Let Die"" scene is bound to wind up a classic.To speak of Hustle's convoluted (but ultimately tried and true) plot would be cheating (hustling) the audience out of the fun residing in this masterpiece. While certain scenes definitely required more developed empathy for the characters to achieve the desired effect, Hustle invests the time to keep us on edge at least, and is a film that gets better with each and every scene.Go see it with attentive eyes and you shall not be disappointed.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great entertainment but also has something to say,"The con artist mentality – everyone is a sucker and the more you say NO to ""marks"", the more they want what you are selling; conversely everyone likes to play the film-flam game – that is the basic premise of David O. Russell's goofy, madcap new film American HUSTLE. And the Federal Government turns out to be the ultimate hustler in the ""idealistic"" pursuit of justice or ""entrapment""– a thin line that bends and sways depending on the ambitions of prosecutors. The word ""real"" is used in the dialogue over and over and over againdisguise is the norm – being ""real"" involves a rare moment of trust and exposure of your inner self which always reeks of a putrid scent, barely camouflaged by the fragrance of nectar that we employ as a shield of body armor.This convoluted, crazily complex movie originated ""somewhat"" with a true story-the ABSCAM scandal of the 1970's. Understanding the source will help make sense of American HUSTLE, giving you the opportunity to relax and be entertained, without being distracted trying to puzzle out what is going on. ABSCAM was an FBI sting operation in the late 1970s and early1980s, initially trafficking in stolen property but later converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI hired Melvin Weinberg, a convicted con man, to help plan and conduct the operation. ""Abscam"" was the FBI codename for the undertaking, because it involved Abdul Enterprises, Ltd., as its front company, using an FBI employee posing as Karim Abdul Rahman, a fictional Middle Eastern sheikh bribing targeted government officials in videotaped meetings. Suffice it to say Atlantic City and its burgeoning casino industry were in the mix, ultimately leading to the conviction of a United States senator, six members of the House of Representatives, one member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, and an inspector for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.Christian Bale (terrific) still handsome after gaining over 40 lbs playing the beer bellied mastermind and proud-of-it charlatan, Irving Rosenfeld (based on Abscam's Melvin Weinberg) who owns many dry-cleaning and window glass stores in the Bronx and Manhattan – all small time establishments fronting illegal loan activities. The movie opens with Irving fashioning his daily make-over on an elaborately funny and very serious comb-over – a source of pride and concealment before attending a cocktail party where he glances over and BAMMM sees a gorgeous Amy Adams who portrays the seductive, alabaster toned Sydney Prosser, and Irving Rosenfeld is hooked on the spot – meeting his match in brains and larceny. But this dame is a classy one, who has already ""masked"" her persona, and intuiting a fellow traveler responds to Christian Bale in kind. A love story is in the making, despite the fact that Irving is married to a surprisingly, (for me) wonderfully, eccentric, often inept, and unsuitable (to his chosen profession) wife, Rosalyn played by Jennifer Lawrence, who might be the most authentic person in American HUSTLER.Adams and Bale join forces and become partners in crime, and business is soon flourishing until a wildly enterprising, tightly curled poodle cut, FBI undercover agent, Bradley Cooper (Richie DiMaso) shows up and snares them in his net. From then on our heroes are working for the impulsive, righteously manic, Cooper in order to stay out of jail.And then the fun begins! Larger and more intricate schemes including Abscam (Arab scam) loom ahead. Passionate avidity blossoms as a Mafioso - a critical bit part by a barely recognizable Robert De Niro - gets enmeshed into the conspiracy. Despite harebrained shenanigans and lots of heedless bungling, and plot twists, the underlying romance perseveres, complicated by Christian Bale's hesitant equivocation concerning the age-old choice between wife and girlfriend. Another memorable character, a linchpin of the FBI shakedown operation - Jeremy Renner is startling as the oblivious, charismatic Mayor Carmine Polito of Camden NJ, complete with an Elvis-style mop of hair, and the only politician who actually cares and works for his constituents. He is the one genuinely tragic figure in this tale.American HUSTLER is a complicated mosaic of cynicism, questions of credibility, legitimacy and the art of illusion tempting desire. The energetic soundtrack weaves through each scene punctuating the activity; passages are episodic - some hilarious and others predictable. Absurdity nesting in farce can be sublimethose resplendent moments appear and vanish like the hypothesis of the film itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awards mean nothing,"How could this movie be up for awards? Are you kidding me? Truly a lousy movie not worth anyone's time. It's like there was no script and only the vaguest idea of what the plot was going to be. So much fill you won't believe it: people listening to music, people lip syncing, people dancing, people making out, lots and lots of boring make out scenes, people picking out and trying on clothes, personal grooming, pretty much anything to kill time without advancing the plot. The movie just drags to the point where you're screaming at the screen. It honestly is like anyone could just randomly come up with an idea for a scene and they went with it because they needed to fill time. The actors' behavior seems random and unmotivated at times. The characters are all pretty unlikable. And it honestly would not be possible to find an actress anywhere who would be more miscast in her role than Amy Adams. I'm going to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fun and Invigorating,"Twists and turns. That pitches American Hustle better than its own plot. David O. Russell's latest is one that can benefit from going in blind, even if the trailers revealed next to nothing on what it's actually about (hallelujah). Featuring damn-near everyone from O. Russell's last two films, American Hustle definitely treads the too-much-for-its-own-good line, yet it still manages to come out on top.For those who crave pre-viewing details, American Hustle deals with conning. A couple characters make a living out of conning people, who then get caught and forced to con others who are, themselves, cons. You could probably make a drinking game out of describing this movie's plot.Even if the premise doesn't peak your interest, O. Russell has more than a few ways to fixate you. The movie opens with a small, humorous jab at the oft-used ""this actually happened"" title card in movies. Follow that up with a priceless hair scene and we have the start to a movie that builds and builds, all while immersing you.Though there are many characters, Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper are the real tri-force here. Bale gets completely invested in his character (once again) and is often tough to see beyond the hair, glasses, belly fat and other make-up. Adams dominates nearly every scene she's in, bringing a presence that's both vigorous and electrifying. As for Cooper, much like his Silver Linings Playbook performance, there's a constant sense of a man with too many nerves in certain areas, but they rarely snap apart. There's so much praise and discussion to go around for the entire cast, that you could write a review simply on that. Even comedian Louis C.K. gets some classic moments in a role perfect for his dry style of humor.Just as important (if not more so) is the directing style, which has a Scorsese-like feel in that it's flamboyant, but not overbearing (save The Departed). The entire time there's a constant question of what's real and what's fake. Aside from a couple deliberate points, each scene keeps you wondering what's thin as skin and what's thick as bone for each character. Even those who aren't actual cons might just be putting up a little facade of their own.Consistent second-guessing, first-rate performances and a lively directing style all lend very necessary contributions. American Hustle is one of those movies that keeps on giving. It hits you like a whirlwind with every scene on your initial viewing. Come back again and it's guaranteed to make you notice and appreciate a little bit more. With a bravado like this, David O. Russell is certainly doing well to solidify his place amongst other greats, such as Scorsese and the Coen Brothers.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Splendor,"""Everyone hustles to survive,"" and that's the picture American Hustle's '70's quintessentially paints for the culture and mentality of America. Our very economic system encourages for loops to be taken as long as you secure those wads of cash, and, in the end, the easiest targets will receive the boot into a jail cell rather than the powerful and resourceful (the crooked and corrupt bankers and politicians who deserve to share a moniker with other criminals). Anyways, the whole concept is devoid of any sense of morality, and that essentially grooms Irving Rosenfeld (played by Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (played by Amy Adams) for the big leagues of scamming and reaping the riches. However, once they're finally caught by an FBI agent- Richie DiMaso (played by Bradley Cooper)- their sole responsibility is to catch a bunch of dirty politicians red-handed in bribery, and they're in charge of constructing the whole procedure.There's no doubt that American Hustle gives off that ""Goodfellas"" vibe and is generally influenced by Scorsese's masterful work, but it also decides to incorporate even further playfulness. David O. Russell's signature style of directing in which he implements humor into the tensest or most dramatic of scenes returns. All throughout, I found myself confused if certain scenes were meant to be slightly funny or fully serious. Though I chuckled during some mainly parlous scenes that played out in a more outlandish manner (which instituted that element of humor), the majority of the theater room sat in silence. What I'm trying to say is that it's an incredibly fun ride.First of all- and, in my opinion, most importantly- we witness some of the most brilliant, captivating, and intricate performances of this year from the likes of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner- an all-star cast! Christian Bale, most evidently, remarkably strays from a recognizable appearance and instead sports an atrocious, but equally comical, haircut, an actual beer belly, and a Jersey accent. In sum, the guy transforms like no other. Moreover, all of these characters are granted their time to shine, and they all truly stand out with their own distinctive personalities. Russell means to emphasize this: it's all about the characters who glow with exuberance and complicacy. An abundance of fun is had by placing some of the most vibrant individuals into a complex predicament and then simply watching how they attempt to dig themselves out of such an extensive hole. Not only are we joyful at the sight of an obviously talented cast- not one stealing another's thunder- but we're also surprised by some brilliant- brilliant- cameos. The flamboyancy of these characters greatly stem from a terrific script that provides us with clever and hilarious dialogue. See, this cinematic wonder is so damn quotable as every other line carries amusement and farcicality with it. In addition, the intriguing narrative is serviced by an outstanding soundtrack, recalling the greatest '70's tunes (those violins are just daunting in 10538 overture- amazing track, by the way).With that being said, the plot becomes a little confusing at times, especially at the beginning. The whole plan is so elaborate that the structure and details within moderately threw me off. One has to possess a somewhat clear idea of how the entire financial scamming business works in order to completely understand the more prominent events. A considerable amount of the confusion is thankfully removed as the story progresses and we hear Bale's explanative narration over the wild occurrences. Furthermore, the picture commences with noticeably slow pacing as we take the time to familiarize ourselves with the characters and their backgrounds. It definitely reminded me of Casino's fairly sluggish opening in which De Niro explains the multiple processes and conveys the nature of the crime-riddled environment we're about to be cast down into. Finally, when the scheme is set into motion, that's when the storyline picks up as we see the countless characteristics of these peculiar individuals make their mark.Overall, American Hustle is an exceptional piece of cinema that delivers on what it promises. Normally, a predominantly nonviolent crime tale would feel strange and unfulfilling, but Russell knows exactly what he's doing here. With the help of superb and rich performances from A-list actors, this crime drama feels fun, suspenseful, risible, and impeccably crafted (considering the sublime costumes and the impressively effective presentation of the 70's).",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
