Dialogue laughable...Dancing beyond incredible,"As with the last user who commented, the reason for this score was purely the dancing. Now, to be fair, the acting abilities of the two main characters was average...even above average at times...though not stellar. However, their dancing was freaking SICK. I've seen a lot, and some of this freestyle was off the charts incredible. The only reason that I went to see this movie, in fact.Briana Evigan (Andie) is an amazingly talented dancer. Her acting was actually not that bad, I was pleased. Robert Hoffman (Chase) was the typical charming, blond-haired and privileged pretty-boy...with an edge. His dancing was phenomenal, they were both exciting to watch. Their chemistry together was enough to make it hard to tear my eyes from the screen. If the trailers entertain you, and you're a fan of dance see this movie. Though the plot is weak, and the dialogue laughable, the dancing is enough to make spending your $8 on the ticket more than worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
See it for the dancing!!,"The story lacks substance, but I did not see the movie for story... I saw it for the dancing and the dancing was great. I love all dance movies though. This was definitely the movie with the best dancing, but not necessarily the best storyline. Take the Lead was a better story, but the dancing could not compare. The new characters were cool too. They had pretty good chemistry. The movie kept me totally entertained the whole time even though it was totally predictable. Like I said the dancing was what I wanted to see and I was not at all disappointed. The last 15 minutes of the movie made it definitely worth an hour and a half of my time. If you like dancing you'll love it... if you don't then you won't!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Dancing Makes The Movie,"I actually thought that the movie was pretty good. It's not as bad as the reviews that it's getting, just don't go in expecting to get an Oscar performance. The storyline was a little all over the place. Typical teen dance movie. BUT the dancing is amazing couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Robert Hoffman did a decent job, he really lays the charm in throughout the whole movie. The dance scenes make the entire movie. Ethnically, it is such a diverse cast of people, there is someone for everyone to identify with. The soundtrack is insanely good also. By the end of it you will be quoting lines and wanting to dance for sure.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Usual Story But Oh the Choreography, Oh the Dancing and Oh the Energy!","'Step Up 2: The Streets' follows a typical storyline of an 'underdog' striving to make it and in the end overcomes all obstacles and succeeds. The dialogues are passable, mostly the typical lines. But, what makes it so entertaining is the incredible dance sequences, amazingly choreographed and superbly performed by the actors/dancers. The film is full of energy and excitement. Break dancing (well, dancing in general) is something that has always intrigued me so the film kept me engaged throughout. The acting is adequate. Briana Evigan is a talented dancer and not a bad actress either. Her other cast members dance well too. The soundtrack boosts of adrenaline guiding and giving voice to the dance moves. In spite of the done to death storyline, I enjoyed this one. Anyone interested in dance should watch this.",,Anonymous,Music
It's not where you're from. It's where you're at.,"A rebellious street dancer named Andie, part of Baltimore's most intimidating dance crew, the 410, who is given a chance to attend the prestigious Maryland School of the Arts. She finds it difficult to fit into her new school life while keeping her friends from the 410. Determined to prove her skills, she assembles an eclectic crew of classmates that includes Chase, the schools best dancer, to compete against the 410 in the premier underground dance battle in Baltimore, The Streets.I quite enjoyed Step Up, although the plot was clich√©d and predictable, but the dance moves were good. Now picture that, times TEN! Anyone crazy enough to see this movie for the plot should not see this film. Why would anyone see this movie? The dance moves.There are double the dancing sequences and double the greatness! I was won over by it. The charming two leads and the lovable characters add as the cherry on top. The plot? There's nothing there. Been there. Done that. However, if you set your expectations right, you'll be surprised to turn out that you like this movie.Obviously, if you're an older person, you may not like this movie as much as if you're a teen. Of course, the demographics for this movie is to attract teens. All in all, this is about a notch or two better than the original, but plotwise, it's the same. Watch this movie for the dances. Not the plot. Otherwise, the piece is entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Best dancing ever seen but horrible acting and script,"A movie like step up 2 or almost any dance movie for that matter typically has poor writing/script and nothing beyond decent acting. the whole point of these movies is to take your breath away with dance moves and step up 2 does just that. trust me when i say this, the last scene of the movie is one for our generation, one of the best dance scenes in any movie, creative and different it will shock you. i thought stomp the yard had good dance moves and it did but this movie actually outdid that movie. i normally do not like dance movies, i did not like you got served, one of the worst movies ever made possibly, i did not like step up 1, etc. it starts slow to be honest and in the beginning it's nothing that you or i haven't seen before but everything comes together in the end and its great, the last scene and the dancing is what makes the movie and worth the price of admission.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Moderately fun film,"""Step Up 2 the streets"" is a movie that is for a fun, ""no-thinking"" outing. The sequel to the popular ""Step Up"" was obviously not as good as the first (sequels and prequels never really are) but it was a fun film to watch.There was a few good comedic scenes, and the street dancing really was incredible, especially at the end of the movie. This kind of movie is obviously going to be a little bit predictable and cheesy, but still- it's fun to see with some friends on a Saturday night.Also, the soundtrack really helped improve the movie; there were many excellent, cool songs playing throughout the film, such as ""The Way I are"" by Timbaland and ""Low"" by Flo-rida ft. T-Pain.If you give it a chance, you may enjoy it. It depends on whether or not you enjoy feel-good, funny dance movies. If not, then don't go see it! The final verdict: Step Up 2 is a moderately fun film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
not bad at all!,"I didn't expected this movie to be much fun, but it was! The story obviously wasn't that great and the ending was predictable. But this movie didn't pretend to be ""intelligent"", it never tries it! The story is told clearly and there aren't to much unnecessary scenes. The dancing is good and there are various funny scenes! Everything a entertaining mainstream movie has to have. The acting is mostly OK, no major problems found, although there are a lot of stereotypes used in the movie (the handsome white guy, the envious ex-girlfriend, the ""Looser"", the ""bad"" black guy,...). But which movie doesn't have them? I also like the soundtrack, a lot of good tracks can be hear with great dancing performances. This movie deserves 5 out of ten points!",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Best of the series,"Some time ago I was a huge fan of this franchise. It all started with this sequel because I thought the first was a little lackluster aside from a mega hot Channing Tatum. Well he's topped here in my opinion by a gorgeous and very talented Robert Hoffman and a sexy and fierce Brianna Evigan (Sorority Row). This time around we are introduced to a competition called the street in which a group of MSA students gather to become a crew and compete. The politics are expected but effective and the dance sequences are electrifying. I'd be lying if I said this wasn't a guilty pleasure filled with melodrama but it's the best of the series, overly entertaining and filled with some diverse, colorful characters. Funny, romantic and thrilling.Budget: $17.5M
Box Office: $150.8M7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Fitting,"That poster and that title: Fitting is actually fitting in this case. Step up 2 the Streets works, especially if you liked the first one and are not a cynic about what this all meant cinema wise (including a very lame spoof called Dance Flick). But what this is most notable for is the introduction of Moose (character). Someone you'd think was there from the beginning and is a big part of the Step up franchise, just got into part 2, but since then is an integral part of it all.The story is as predictable as the others are, but with new leads in the male and female department and other song and dance routines you do get something fresh out of it. It really does work on a couple of levels throughout.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A daily comment from Midget Emma: Step Up 2: The Streets (2008),"Not bad. This time it didn't feel rushed and the dances felt like they were done to perfection. This time the rich kids are pushed into the streets.This had better dances then the first one, better music and didn't feel rushed. It still had the bad acting but it did have some chemistry. This felt like there was little story going on.The final dance was great. Very dramatic in the rain.The first one had a mix of different dance styles but this had just hip hop dance basically.I recommend it if you saw the first one, like hip hop dance or just like these movies.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Way better than I expected!,"I certainly didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I figured the dancing would be fun. My expectations were exceeded, WAY exceeded. Sure it has a predictable plot and it's nothing more than a right-side-of-the-tracks/wrong-side-of-the-tracks love story (Pretty in Pink, West Side Story, Romeo & Juliet, etc.), but the dancing was really incredible. I'm way older than the target audience and yet I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.If you're looking for groundbreaking plot, acting, or directing, you won't find it here. But the acting/directing was just fine, and the dancing was stellar. If you're concerned with the acting, I guess that would be like going to an action movie and judging it based on the acting rather than the action.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It accomplish exactly what it was supposed to...,"I would write about the plot here, but seeing how there isn't really one, I find that pointless. This movie is basically about one thing: Awesome dancing. If you walked into this movie expecting anything else, then you walked out severely disappointed. I, thankfully, expected this movie to be a strenuous two-hour music video, and, it having gone above and beyond my expectations, walked out completely satisfied (in fact, I saw it twice).Step Up 2 presented some of the most amazing street dancing sequences that have ever appeared on film. The final dance literally had me leaning forward in my seat, as if I were watching a high-intensity fight or chase scene.And come on. I've heard a lot of complaints about the acting. I thought the acting was not too bad, especially since they initially had to find really good dancers...that happened to act. Comparably speaking, I wouldn't say it was any worse than, say,the acting in Jumper, which was fairly horrendous at times *cough*Jamie Bell and Hayden Christenson.Basic summary:Highlights: The video that the new crew makes for the streets.The characters Moose and that hilarious Asian chick.Latino dance sceneAnd, of course, the final dance scene.I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because this is a film quality grade, and, as a film, it wasn't spectacular. However, Step Up 2 accomplished just what it intended to do: create an awesome excuse to show off amazing dance moves for almost two hours. In fact, it passed with flying colors.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Yes, horrible acting but stunning dance moves","This movie gets a 7 in my book, and sure some of you may find this overtly and outrageously generous but I'm commending solely the power of the climactic dance scenes. This movie, just like Step Up (towards which I have similar feelings) has some of the most atrocious acting I've ever seen, and the ill-placed jokes were slightly less than totally idiotic. The tried-and-true method of uncanny coincidental run-ins is getting a little worn, also. So if you manage to ignore this crucial mistake, I promise you may actually enjoy the vibrant twists and turns of some of the best choreography I've ever seen in a dance film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
What I Expected.,"When I paid my 10 dollars to get into this movie, I would have been stupid to expect Oscar winning performances by the cast and an award winning script, which is why I wasn't too disappointed when the acting wasn't all that great and the script wasn't too great either.But what was I there for? The dancing. And did the dancing live up to expectations? As a whole, it definitely did! You see, I thing Evigan was very disappointing, being the main character and she was not even close to the best dancer. Her performances looked VERY choreographed, even when she was supposed to be free styling. I guess she was just the only one that really looked like she didn't know what she was doing. Sure, she could shake her booty with the best of them, but her dancing wasn't as convincing as the rest of the cast's.Other than that, the dancing lived up to all my expectations! Robert Hoffman really impressed me with his moves, seeing as he hadn't known how to break dance before hand. He was really good.And when it came to comedic timing, acting, and true to the core dancing, Adam G. Sevani (Moose) was this movie's saving grace. You'll have to watch it to understand what I mean.So, basically, in a nut shell, if your expectations aren't set too high when it comes to the acting and the script, you'll be pleasantly surprised by this movie. The dance moves will rock your world, and I think that anyone who loves a bit of exciting dancing will enjoy this movie as much as I did!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Subpar Acting, but Better than Expected","I went into this movie with very low expectations. It was a way for me to get out with some friends, and most likely something I would have never seen otherwise. However, I came out surprised an in awe. The acting was bland, but the dancing more than made up for it. The choreography was amazing, and my jaw dropped during the final dance scene. --Aside from the dancing, the characters could have been slightly more interesting. Tucker (Black Thomas) was slightly frustrating with his predictability of racial stereotypes, along with most of the 410 Crew. Outside of the 410, Moose (Adam Sevani) had the whole theater cracking up. The remainder of the characters were all pretty predictable. Chase (Robert Hoffman) and Andie (Briana Evigan) shared some chemistry, enough to make it believable. Step Up 2 highly surpassed my expectations, but not enough to make me see it again. I would recommend a rental rather than pay for the ticket.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Atrocious acting mixed with thin plot and countless clich√©s...,"I can not begin to describe how awful this movie was. Even worse than its predecessor, Step Up 2 manages to be even more predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen from the first ten minutes. The script was ridiculous. The story could not have been more clich√©. The movie tries to have many subplots but it fails to achieve an enjoyable storyline. The movie paints a very unrealistic college and street dancing life, and that is fine, but the problem is that this movie tries too hard to make it seem real.They attempted to throw some humor in this god awful hideous picture when they portray an Asian foreign student and ridicule her for her accent and lack of correct English language. There was some cool dancing but honestly, it wasn't nearly enough to save this movie. The low rating says it all.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

The dancing is BAD!!! :D,"I just watched Save the last dance 2 a couple of nights back and was loving it. But then Step up 2 came my way and I am absolutely blown away!! The dancing is fantastic!!! You can not fail to be awed. Everything else is just OK. Some of the supporting acts are terrible and at times dialogue delivery left much to be desired. The story is not deep as such compared to the first Step up but then all that fades away when the dancing begins.Chemistry between Andie and chase is not as strong has it was between Tyler and Nora in Step up but then the romance between Chase and Andie is far in the background.Moose is my most memorable character and can't wait to see more of the actor, Adam Sevani. I plan to watch this film over and over just for the dance-off at the end. Awesome!!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"wow,,,","You guys over analyze...sit back and enjoy a great movie. I guess you have to have a passion for dancing to enjoy it but if you don't then just don't ruin it for anyone else. We don't sit here and make fun of your little horsey movies or little car movies, everyone has their own likes and dislikes and if you enjoy dancing you will enjoy the movie. The actors/actresses are portrayed as very skilled dancers in this movie and you eyes will be glued to the screen. Both Step Up movies have GREAT choice in characters because the lead roles in both films are gorgeous. Both girls and guys. I am a big fan of dancing movies in general, and these two both top my list. Ignore the bogus comments. Definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It's Worth Your Time,"""It's Not Where You're From. It's Where You're At.""Considering the fact that I haven't see the first one (nor do I want to) I really have nothing else to compare this movie too, and because of this it stands alone. Step Up 2 the Streets brings not only the best dancing I have ever seen on screen (aside from White Nights I guess), but what it does is it proves that even with a moderate script you can still present something remarkable with the right kind of characters and good pacing.The whole concept about following you're heart is a load of bull and has been done many times before, but it was, however, never mentioned in the film, which I was very pleased about. To a reasonable extent, I enjoyed most of the characters and the talented actors that really developed their characters. I can imagine it being extremely difficult to finds actors that can not only act but have incredible dancing abilities. It's because of their talent that I can over look the fact that a lot of them look older than their character's age.What I mean about good pacing is that because I watched this movie at three o'clock in the morning I never once felt that something felt out of place or that this was more dancing than story, or vice versa. I was kind of tired and if any film can keep me up long enough to watch the whole thing, then it will have my praise.WARNING SPOILERS ( FROM ANOTHER MOVIE)I remember the first time I watched Jeepers Creepers, which I watched around the same time as this film. I was about half way through when the monster was finally in the open, and it turned out to be some indestructible monster with wings. It was after that that I decided to stop the movie at wait until morning to finish the movie. I didn't have that problem with Step Up 2 the Streets.I give it too the critics that the ending was it's weakest point and had the potential to conclude with a better punch, but that wasn't a big problem because I found that I didn't want the end too come because I was so in to the story of these characters and the fantastic variety of dancing.I would just recommend to watch this movie with an open mind. Try not to right away hate or love anything about it until the movie ends, and then ask yourself, ""was this movie worth watching?""***/**** StarsStep Up 2 the Streets (2008) Rated PG-13 for suggestive material and brief violence",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great dancing... AWFUL script,"The only reason I could offer a rating of 5 was for the dancing. The storyline was awful, clich√©, and a pathetic example of a movie sequel. Every encounter/experience on the part of the girl were just circumstances that served to validate her point of view. Anything that offered a growth opportunity was either not included in the script or edited out. Where the first film was a yet another film hybridizing formal and street dance, this film paid no respect to formal dance and seemed to even discredit it.This movie failed for me just like almost every porn flick that tried to employ acting and a plot along with the action. LOL",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Not Too Bad,"I admit I was a little skeptical of this movie, seeing as I was such a big fan of the first movie. I was however pleasantly surprised:The story line wasn't quite as tacky as I had thought it would be and it did have its own unique style.Although the music and acting wasn't nearly as good. At times it seemed a little overdone! It seemed as though the script and the actors were trying to way over dramatise everything and it kind of spoiled the intensity that made Step Up such a brilliant movie. I think over dramatising it made it a little monotonous and confusing because it left the audience wondering ""Ok so what exactly is the issue here"" or ""Wow is everything just wrong in this world"".Overall though, I would say it is worth watching but I would recommend you thinking of it as a movie of its own and not a sequel as I believe it will make it all the more enjoyable to the viewer. It is definitely a bit of a feel good film, in a slightly corny way. But NOT at all comparable to the original if you ask me.",,Anonymous,Music
"Personally think it's better than the first ""Step Up""","Personally I liked this movie a bit better than the first ""Step Up"" movie. Mainly cause it focuses more on dancing than romance, although it has romance in it. The story in this one is super ridiculous and weak compared to the first film, not saying the first ""Step Up"" was good or anything. None of the characters was even really memorable in this, except maybe the character Moose. It would have been a better film with the new crew that gets made has more dancing in it, in competitions. The dancing at the end of this film is actually pretty cool and is done pretty well and is entertaining to watch. Just would have been better if it had more of that stuff. The dancing outside the competition, was pretty entertaining to watch as well, it was just slick, fast and cool. Although the story is pretty weak and ridiculous for these types of flick, you can't really expect much in that department. Plus it wasn't irritating to watch or anything, it also has more dancing in it as well than the first.6.2/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Enjoyable, Makes You Think and Pretty Good Point","I am not at all Hip-Hop fan or anyway they call Ghetto style stuff or anything which has poverty attached to it and I am not sure why I picked this movie at all, may be had nothing else to do. This is great movie, makes me wonder someone is thinking.These type of ideas make me salute Adam Smith for making world aware of capitalism and value of Chaos as solution for difficult issues. No one can imagine what type of dancing will be liked by crowd and once it has been around for 200+ years then it gets in classic form and I think this was the point director was making. Movie could have been much better except dancing which was awesome in the back drop. Girl and the guy were perfect and I will not 2nd guess if Bollywood copies this concept though this is not at all a phenomena today in India but capitalism has brought chaos, hence many new forms will sprung up.

Painful,"Okay, I really wanted to like this movie. I loved Step Up, and I was hoping that this movie would at least come close to the same level. But...it really didn't. Chemistry between the leads was missing...in fact, chemistry between any of the characters was lacking. I am still not sure why they cared about each other at all. Also, I felt like there was no point to the movie except to string a bunch of dance scenes together. There was no real growth on the part of Andi, or the other characters. Maybe originally this movie was intended to show how someone from the streets could fit in...but I never saw Andi struggle. The dialogue was clich√© and boring, and the minor characters, while perhaps intended to add humor and depth, did nothing for me.And then...the dancing.A lot of people have been raving about the dancing in this movie, and saying that it is the only good thing about it. However...it was ALL THE SAME. There was hardly any variation when it came to style, except for maybe five seconds of a mediocre ballet student. I felt like I was looking at the same dance over and over and over again, with the moves slightly reshuffled. The one exception was the final dance, which I did enjoy watching. At least the original Step Up combined different types of dancing to some extent; that was completely lacking here.In short...stay at home and save your 12 bucks, and if you're looking for a dance movie, go back and watch the original movie again.

The best of the franchise,"The second Step Up is no doubt the best of all movies from the franchise. The story is touching in the right measure, without becoming too melodramatic, because of course it's not the intention of a movie about street dance. Anyway, it still achieve the viewer's emotion with the protagonist drama, since she was born in a poor neighbourhood and had some issues with her family. Besides this great story, the movie delivers us some nice dance scenes and the soundtrack is incredible for those that, like myself, loves hip hop music. They put on the OST some huge hits from pop and hip hop scenario at the time and made also the best soundtrack from all Step Up movies. If anyone asks me which one is my personal favorite, I don't think much. Step Up 2 is the best!

Entertaining and enjoyable; even to non-hiphop fans,"Entertaining and enjoyable; even to non-hiphop fans (like me), if you're eager to see something fun and new. Step Up 2: The Streets does not pretend to have a major plot and achieves its goal of delivering a good number of well choreographed dance teasers to keep you patient for the grand finale, even with the incredibly blah dialogue.This version will obviously be compared to its predecessor Step Up, which was unexpectedly delightful. The plot is still trite but while the former focused on second chances and the chemistry of its likable leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum), the story in Step Up 2, focused on an issue (encapsulated in the movie's tagline: It's not where you're from. It's where you're at), however, the cast, albeit obviously talented, lacked the charisma of the former movie's stars.Andie (Briana Evigan) is the usual rebel without a cause, with a way-fierce underground dance crew 410. To connect the first movie into this one, Tyler (Tatum) returns as her pseudo-big brother who sets her straight by beating her at a dance-off. Andie has to stay in an uptight school for the arts and runs into resident boy-band looker Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman), who also happens to be the director Blake Collins (Will Kemp)' brother and ex-boyfriend to the school's triple threat (sings, dances and acts) Sophie (played by singer Cassie Ventura). Teen drama ensues culminating in the street dance contest.Evigan is charming enough and talented because she doesn't dance self-consciously. Hoffman is great but his face just isn't as handsome as Kemp, who was brilliant but seemed too young for the role. Cassie doesn't get to showcase the wunderkind she was supposed to be and just has a few snivelly moments of longing. Of all the comic relief characters painfully included, the season of the cool nerd has truly arrived as Moose (Adam Sevani), a David Spade-ish character, gets to be the hip geek.

it's hot moves all the way!!,"yes it's cool and hot dance moves in this film.. some dance routines that could actually leave with u goosebumps.well the female lead Briana evigan, hot as ever, has a passion for dancing.. she has one really hot bod..and those dance moves of hers keep u glued to the screen..personally she lost her mom but finds solace with her dancing.she is a member of the group 410.. a group who are known for their dare devil dance routines on the streets..Old friend channing tatum (who plays a cameo) wins a dance battle with her one day in a street club and as a forefeit for losing she joins the school of arts..she has a buddy in school Adam sevani who takes her through the tour in school.. and puts a smile on her face every once in a while.they she bumps into Robert Hoffman who starts getting attracted to her..moving into the school of arts does not go well with 410..she is kicked out of the group..a dejected Briana then starts a group of her own with Robert joining in.. and some odd guys from the school who are at their best in certain dance moves.. Adam too has some cool dance moves that go unnoticed initially..the new group start practicing for the main street event..all groups are geared up for it and ensure they are at their best..well the final battle between 410 and the group is the best to watch out for.. the last 15 minutes of the film were the best.. dance moves that sizzling hot!!!well if u are fan of music and dance.. then this a movie u will definitely like.. story wise it was not that great..and the cast is not box office stars.. but overall they did a decent job..i liked Briana..she really kept me glued to my seat..",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Best dance movie I have ever seen!,"Oh my gosh... This is the best dance movie I have ever seen in my entire life by far! This movie definitely beats the likes of Honey (obviously), Center Stage, Save the Last Dance, Save the Last Dance 2, Take the Lead, and Step Up 1. My friends and I, who were all dancers, went crazy at the movie theater. The acting wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, and the dancing is sick. Freaking sick. You'll want to just bust out into dance as soon as it starts happening in the movie. The end dance sequence is absolutely phenomenal. I'm not kidding, if you want to experience some serious dancing, go see this movie. In a nutshell, despite what the others say, this movie is definitely worth your money to go see it in the theater! You'll be mad if you have to wait!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"The story is predictable and clich√©, but still watch it..","The plot of this movie is unoriginal, and I knew what was going to happen before the movie even finished. The dialogue is pathetic, and when I watch it, it seems to me that the writer said..""Ok, lets make a sequel to Step up, but it'll be in the streets this time, yeah. Now go learn some dances, I'll just come up with something about something, I'll throw in some dialogue, and put it all together""...a bad movie, with good dancing.Now that's what bugs me - this movie is INCREDIBLE in the dancing, but for the rest I wasn't even watching properly, I was waiting for the dance scenes. Why couldn't they at least put in an effort to come up with a better story and better dialogue, it would have been a really good movie! I say, if you haven't seen this, watch it for the dancing, but don't expect much from the non-dancing parts of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointed & Disturbed,"I think it's in ""fluff pieces"" where stereotypes are particularly dangerous. The movie claimed that it wanted to showcase how dance and hip-hop transcend cultural and class barriers, but the plot only served to highlight and exploit these divisions. I hold the writers more responsible for this missed opportunity than the director, though. A few simple plot changes would have given the storyline the level of emotional intelligence that even a cartoon deserves. It's easy to believe that observations like this will only fall on deaf ears, but I hope more people (in audiences and in the movie industry) will be less naive whenever another studio decides to mass-market such ignorance.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Where did Nora go?,"Actually, the only reason that makes me want to watch this movie is about Tyler and Nora....i want to know what's going on after the happy endingBut then, this Tyler guy pop up in Step up 2 for less than 5 mins, and then left me a message that "" Nora went to a tour"" when i saw this i was like... ARE U KIDDING ME?the dances are good, absolutely worth 8 dollars to see a clear vision but like all the dance movie ,there are no ""story"" at all The two main character both are talented dancers, they for some reason see each other and dance together, typically break up before a big competition, and then at the very last moment they will be together and dance very well.Isn't it the exact same thing as Step Up? just the characters change?I highly doubt that the filmmaker will find another two characters and make a Step up 3 easy money huh?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A sequel to Step Up. Great dancing but the storyline needed expansion.,"Like Tyler Gage, the protagonist of its predecessor, there was someone who wanted to follow her dreams but felt like she was crushed when someone close to her died. Thanks to Tyler, she had another chance to fulfill that dream. The same school where he was given a second chance. She joins hands with someone to form a crew to compete in an underground dance battle while creating a bridge between school and the streets.There were moments and characters that were enjoyable. Andie West, played by Briana Evigan, Chase Collins, played by Robert Hoffman, Robert ""Moose"" Alexander the Third, played by Adam Sevani. Andie, Chase and Moose were my favorites. The dance scenes (especially between Tyler and Andie and the final dance battle) were best. The chemistry between Briana Evigan and Robert Hoffman was the best. The film soundtrack was the best, especially the songs by the likes of Timbaland, Flo Rida, T-Pain, etc.However, giving points to the characters, dance sequences, and chemistry between Briana Evigan and Robert Hoffman, the story was short and needed expansion. Plus, there was an unfit musical score in the movie, especially in the ending scene. It was cheesy and definitely not fit.Despite its ups and downs, the movie was entertaining but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than the Step Up?,"I don't know about that...but it had its own edge and the dancing was, as they say, SICK.Premise: Tyler's (Channing Tatum from Step Up in a cameo)foster sister has grown up and her mother has died leaving her with her mother's friend to raise. Andie runs the streets with the 410 (dance) crew and constantly gets into trouble and could be shipped off to Texas...oh, no!! Tyler gets her an audition at his alma mater the Maryland School for the Arts and fish-out-of-water-clashes ensue.As I like to say, the movie has heart and that counts for a lot. Plus, the dancing is sick. They definitely know how to take a basic girl-meets-guy-but-can't-be-together plot and make it work even if it's pretty standard stuff.The best was seeing Jabbawokeez, winners of he first ""season"" of America's Best Dance Crew.An epic dance crew competition started from this movie on YouTube between Miley Cyrus and her friend and Adam Sevani who played Moose. Just for that, it's a pop culture phenomenon.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't compare it with decent movies... It's OK for its genre...,"To start with most of the comments on this movie -and most of the other dance movies- are harsh just because -i think- they are compared with really good movies. We can't compare this kind of movies with ""decent"" movies (when i say decent, i mean movies which are made as a form of art and has any concern of winning a couple of awards, or at least trying to highlight something). Most of these dance movies are made to entertain, and i think we all should consider this while we're criticizing. After that's said, Step Up 2: The Streets didn't give me what I've expected (but that's probably because I overrated it in my head). I wanted to see a better film and much better dancing than Step Up. However as a movie it was much below Step Up and dancing didn't really passed it either. Plot was predictable and everything. I must say this doesn't mean the movie wasn't good (remember I'm not thinking of it as a classic or anything).. It was good alright, it was fun and jumpy as it should be.. It made me and everybody leaving the theater want to dance.. And I think that is the point of the movie anyway.. So it has done it's purpose.. I totally recommend it to people who are interested in dancing (particularly street dancing)you would LOVE it (i know i did). But it would be foolish to expect the best movie of the year (it can be the funnest.. maybe). As a last word: if you want to see a fun movie this is for you.. but if you want a great movie with great acting, light, script, direction, etc. go search for something else leave this for the dance lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Rude & Racist and a Disgrace to Black Culture..,"Being a black street dancer from Harlem New York since the 1980's, I found this film offensive. The film was a poor effort by middle class kids who are desperately trying to fit into the urban dance street culture of black youth. The black actors had a very out-back roll to that of a film extra and were portrayed as the spoilers in this movie. It was the worst effort I've ever seen by any film make who dares to call themselves a film director. The film was poorly written, degrading and very discriminating towards black people and it would appear that the director did the best he or she could to push the black actors to the back. It is a dream for the middle class kids to be a part of or be involved in such a culture and for the film maker to somewhat attempt to even try to merge a black mother into being a mother to a young white girl was a poor shot at trying to blend the girl into such a culture. This movie does not deserve the right to be called a movie. It's more like a cheap series on the scfi channel and a weak attempt of a culture take-over by the some kids who idolize black music and urban dance culture. A big minus -10 for this poor so called film.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"this was a DANCE movie! - February 15, 2008","I saw the movie yesterday, and am going to see it again! Why? It was excellent!! From the start to the amazing finish, it was awesome. The dancing in the movie was beyond SICK. I mean, the choreographers should be given a cut of the profits. THAT'S HOW SICK THE DANCING WAS! Some people want dialogue/substance to a movie. But Step Up 2 was a D-A-N-C-E movie. Who cares if they can act their way to an Oscar nomination? Who pays hard-earned money to go see a D-A-N-C-E movie, thinking they're going to get great dialogue? This was definitely WAY better than the first.The only other dance routine on par with anything this movie offered, was the ""Double or Nothing"" scene in ""Stomp the Yard"" (but I'm still thinking there's gotta be something from ""You Got Served""). And the other recent dance movie ""How She Move"" was very good, but NOT ENOUGH dancing (Step Up 2 DID NOT have this problem).So, why only 9 out of 10? Only because of a specific scene in the movie.So, there ya have it. A more-than-satisfied customer.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An OK film with street dancing,"So once upon a time my little sister tells me to see Step Up, as I myself am a pro dancer and she assumed I would like it. It was showing in-flight so I stayed up and watched it. Afterwards I was angry because I would've rather slept for the 2 hours.So I get invited to see Step Up 2 at an advance screening and expected the worst. As soon as I recognized BBoy Crumbs in the first scene I knew the dancing would be good. And it was. The producers did their homework with casting proper dancers, there are some world famous BBoys (breakdancers) in this movie (Crumbs, K-Mel, Machine). Not to mention some great Poppers & HipHop dancers. (including a cameo by the Jabbawockeez crew) The acting is a bit cheesy as you would expect, but we do end up feeling for the characters. The plot is quite silly and very predictable.If you like street dancing, see the movie for the choreographed scenes.I gave it a 7/10 If you don't like dancing 4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Dirty Dancing Wantabe,"Let me go into this review, saying halfway through, I almost decided to just up and leave without wasting time on even getting a refund. They can keep my money i just want my time i wasted on this back.Lets start off by emphasizing on the plot and script....Horrible acting by both parts. If this was a musical on ice they would have better luck looking like they know what they're doing. There's almost no acting to be seen, its almost as if they purely practiced their dancing and nothing else. The main actress seems to rely more on anatomy than ability, however the leading man seems to somewhat have a grasp on pretending to act at least.As for story, same ^&*^ different day. I really wish people would stop remaking and ripping off the classics, and this one is a prime example. I would only watch this movie again if they paid me.So in a nutshell, the acting abilities of the peoples (main characters) is near nilche. THe dancing, is descent but really, who watches a movie just to see dancing, at least dirty dancing had the swayze. I really feel the worst over the leading actress as you would hope she has a spark of talent, more than she demonstrates, so sadly her career will be based purely on what people find her attractive.I would rank this 0/10 however it doesn't have that option. Wait till it hits TV and then record it for one of those lonely nights, when you think the world cant get any worse. I will have to add this to one of my top 10 WORSE films of all time.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Seeing cassie in it was interesting too. I like the fact that Channing had a cameo and I liked the use of the school and the mention of Nora from the first film. I thought it was interesting to see Channing and Robert on the same side this go round as they didn't like each other in She's The Man.The soundtrack is also worth checking out.

Chu, this sequel to the original ""Step Up"" film delivers a pulsating blend of dance, music, and urban culture.At its core, the film follows the journey of Andie, a rebellious street dancer portrayed by Briana Evigan. Andie finds herself caught between her love for dance and the challenges of her inner-city environment. When she joins forces with a group of talented dancers known as the 410, Andie discovers a sense of belonging and purpose within the tight-knit crew.The movie thrives on its electrifying dance sequences, choreographed with precision and flair by industry professionals such as Jamal Sims and Hi-Hat. From jaw-dropping breakdance battles to mesmerizing hip-hop routines, each performance is a testament to the skill and dedication of the cast.While the plot may follow a familiar formula of underdog triumph, the film's infectious energy and vibrant cinematography keep audiences engaged from start to finish. The soundtrack, featuring tracks from Flo Rida, T-Pain, and Missy Elliott, further enhances the film's immersive experience, infusing every scene with rhythm and groove.Despite its predictable storyline, ""Step Up 2: The Streets"" succeeds in delivering an entertaining and visually stunning dance spectacle. It celebrates the power of self-expression through movement and serves as a testament to the diversity and creativity of urban dance culture.In conclusion, ""Step Up 2: The Streets"" is a must-watch for fans of dance films, offering a captivating blend of talent, passion, and rhythm that will leave viewers inspired and entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

The dancing is great and full of energy and the final dance is brilliant, probably the best I have seen and the hairs stood on the back of my neck.

Yes, it's cheesed up to the eyeballs in parts, and at times I wished they'd just cut to more dancing, but this was not enough to spoil the overall enjoyment.

"Very formulaic, but I still found a decent amount of entertainment value in it.","After Channing Tatum broke out, they decided to make this into a franchise. The sequels would grow increasingly tiresome, I just felt with every sequel they would rehash the storyline from the original, but in different ways, but this one is actually decent for what it is. The gorgeous Brianna Evigan takes over the lead in this one, and does a solid job. Her bubbly, yet defiant personality was a treat to watch. I'm surprised her career hasn't taken off like I expected. Robert Hoffman lacks Channing Tatum's charisma, but he made for an OK, if underwhelming lead. He & Brianna lack the spark that Channing & Jenna Dewan have. The dance scenes are fairly good.

My friends and I were bored and needed a movie to watch and since a couple of my girlfriends are just die hard fans of the first Step Up, they were dying to see the sequel. I think this was just a horribly written movie and so badly acted, it's the same plot recycled from the first Step Up, only this time it's with the girl who's the trouble maker and the guy is the preppy rich kid. They just couldn't do anything original or even classy... as much as I enjoyed the dancing, there were some incredible moves, this was meant to be a movie, not just a tutorial on how to dance, good dance moves do not make a good movie.Andie is apart of a dance crew who not only dance great, but they also cause disruption in society and are wanted by all the police. Andie's guardian gives her one more chance to straighten up and sends her to a preppy dance school where she meets the kids who dance ""properly"". But when her crew finds out where she's been going, they kick her out, but a preppy dancer encourages her to start her own crew and invites others, but the teacher gets angry when the streets are threatened and damage school property, the teacher threatens expulsion to anyone who is apart of the street dance.Step Up 2 the Streets is definitely for those who enjoy these dance movies, but for me, nothing stood out any different from any other dance movie. This is a rental or just a skip, I feel bad because I didn't want to see this movie, but I will give it it's chops for a great ending dance sequence, these kids were absolutely amazing and their timing was on, I can't believe how well it was performed.

Good dancing in otherwise flat and atrocious attempt at entertainment,"Andie (Evigan) joins a highly sophisticated school and once entered in an extremely difficult dance class, her friends and dance group the 410 turn their back on her.Though labelled as Step Up 2, this 2007 music drama is not a direct sequel to the previous fan winning picture. Having never seen the original, comparisons will be short here but in full honesty, I flicked this film on for a light hearted viewing knowing full well it was classed as a casual flick and starring some attractive young stars with some modern day hit singles, it was sure to be popcorn entertainment, but no.If you have seen the trailer for this Jon Chu picture you will have noticed some eccentric dance moves, some visible drama and heard Flo Rida's previous smash Low. All fine elements combining for a good trailer and promising picture but don't let this take you for granted.Step Up 2 is a film made purely for profit. There is no point, there is no deep meaning, and sadly there is hardly entertainment to speak of. Encoded with chart singles and upcoming stars, it is a vehicle forward for the cast and crew.Starting off with a bizarre dance battle and we see sullen central character Briana Evigan lose a dance battle and is forced to go to school and she is instantly an outcast who brings her own flair and instantly likes the hottest most talented guy and blah, blah, blah. It's your typical story with modern music and stereotype gloss over, a film for ""the hood"" or ""the chavs"" was an accurate review given by the critics, which is reasonable enough.There is too much slang to make out what was proper English, the clothes are all hoodies and awful tracksuits aimed to represent the difficult culture when all it does is make the characters look baggy and scruffy rather than emotionally strained as the shabby script seems to depict them.The acting is terrible, complete stone faced twitter that expresses little emotion. Adam G Sevani brings the odd spark as appropriately named Moose but the leads are a very basic form of Romeo and Juliet, who obviously don't know it.If there is one reason to watch this, it is the dancing. When looking at classic music dramas such as Saturday Night Fever we see an era of classic and surprise. Here the dancing justifies the modern culture, break dancing away from the normality and past into a brand new phase of life. The choreography is superb and the rain dance sequence, though ruined by the most ridiculous inspirational speech ever to grace cinema, is otherwise a shocking surprise to this otherwise faulty and flat picture.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointed,I went to see Step Up 2 cos there was no movies I wanted to see and I thought it was really interesting! wrong! the acting was terrible and so were the actors apart from Channing Tatum who is a great actor.I didn't really like the soundtrack too.I didn't even know that it was a movie with urban music.It is definitely one of the worst movies of 2008 and one of the top 5 worst movies I have seen in my life.I personally thought that the movie was bland and was actually better than the first Step Up movie which I saw the other day and was very bland.I would give Step Up = Plot 2/10 acting 1/10 music 1/10 overall 1/10.,1.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly entertaining teen dance flick,"First of all, I did not go in expecting a great movie... maybe something like Save the Last Dance. But I was BLOWN AWAY by the all-out amazing dancing and equally amazing talents of the cast. Most of all I liked that the story was very focused on Andie's independence and special-ness. I was very impressed with the artistic merits of the film- super job, Jon Chu. Great chemistry between Briana Evignan and Robert Hoffman had my eyes glued on the screen when they weren't dancing, and I have to admit the acting was very good, even if one-dimensional for most of the supporting cast. I loved that the direction of the movie focused on the story without distracting with ""artistic directional use of lens""... Even though the ending was predictable, it was SO unpredictably good!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Step Up 2 Crashes Down,"Being a dancer, I'm drawn to dancing movies. ""Step Up"" came to theaters almost three years ago now, and although it didn't bring the finesse that my favorite dance movie ""CenterStage"" had, it held an enjoyable character of its own. Although I know Step Up 2 has been out for some time now, Ifinally decided to give it a go. That was my first mistake. The second?Leaving it on after the first ten minutes. Not only is it generally just a poor movie, the dancing was lacking too. Stomp the Yard completely Stomps this movie in the dancing department, although the acting is about the same. The only thing that I enjoyed in this film was the special appearance by Channing Tatum, and that's only because his chiseled features and gorgeous eyes entrance me every time.Where to begin? Let's start with the terrible acting. Briana Evigan plays the part of Andie, a rebellious teenager, who's mother died at age 16 and is on her last chance living with her late mother's best friend (seem familiar?). Her last chance to stay in Maryland, as from the previous Step Up, is attending the Maryland School of the Arts. Robert Hoffman plays Chase, the preppy boy-band, blonde-haired dancer. Supposed sparks are supposed to fly between Chase and Andie, but obviously I missed the cue, because I couldn't even see a sliver of heat between them on-screen. A romantic scene between the two during an evening party had the words cheesy and clich√© written all over it, which left me cringing. After Andie is kicked out of her own crew, her and Chase randomly decide to start one. Soon, a group of wanna-be dancers meet to work on a routine for the big competition ""The Streets."" After they realize they suck, they start re-working their routine. In the meantime, Andie's ex-crew gets word of the new crew, and trash MSA's studio, which gets Andie expelled. It was a good decision by me, although it was far from the right reason. The crew falls apart, and the usual ""I'm sad and miss you"" montage of Andie, Chase, and the rest of the crew ensues. The next thing you know, the crew's back together at Andie's door the same night as The Streets competition. After arriving at the infamous underground competition, they're told they don't belong there, it's a competition for locals only, and that they should go home. And, as predicted, Andie gets up and starts in on the heartfelt speech, which was almost heartbreaking to have to put up with. Pretending to act ghetto, she pleads to the crowd to let her crew dance. And, as predicted, they suddenly change their minds and cheer her on as they all rush outside in the rain to watch the final crew dance. The final dance had some interesting choreography, and the rain added a cool twist, but again, I was left lacking excitement. It was clear that some of their moves were stolen from past seasons of the hit Fox reality show, ""So You Think You Can Dance,"" which I'm sure was input given by producer Adamm Shankman.Step Up 2 lacks creativity, a good plot-line, original choreography, talented actors, and just about everything in between. To quote my favorite show, FRIENDS, ""Well, the lighting was all right."" If only that were enough to make a movie worth seeing.If producers are going to continue with this ""sequel"" fad, they better be darn sure it's going to blow the original out of the water. Then maybe it'll stand a chance for it to actually be just as good as the first. Hopefully producer Adamm Shankman will keep that in mind while they're working on the newest sequel, ""Step Up: 3-D."" I sure don't want to torture myself watching another disastrous dancing movie again.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie was FANTASTIC!!!,"I could re-watch Channing Tatum's dance routine and the film's finale over and over and never get tired of it. Before Chan filmed his part of the movie last September, he mentioned to me that he was a little nervous, because he had not danced in while. Well, if that's how he dances nervous, then we should all be so lucky. I loved it from start to finish.Then the movie's finale scene was some of the best dancing I have ever seen in or out of a film in my life. I have been told that it was choreographed by Dave Scott, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. All I have to say is, Briana Evigan, Robert Hoffman, and their crew of dancers are forces to be reckoned with.You will find it impossible not to laugh at characters like Moose and Jenny Kido. They are absolutely HILARIOUS and amazing dancers!!! Many cheered when Channing came on screen and when he finished his dance. Cheering was actually a common thread throughout the movie and the incredible soundtrack and dances make you want to get up and dance during the movie.My theater was a little tamer than others, but I've heard numerous stories of movie goers dancing in the isles and practically having a party in the theater. You can blame that uncommon phenomena on the hot soundtrack and incredible choreography throughout the film. I take my hat off to choreographers Jamal Sims, Hi Hat, and Dave Scott for the routines and to director Jon Chu for capturing all of the action so well.Q",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Eh! *shrug*,"I probably would never have ended up seeing this film if my friend and I hadn't ended up missing a screening of Juno that we wanted to go to, and she hadn't been asking me about going to see it earlier. For a teenager, I like to think of myself as having pretty good taste in movies most of the time. This, not having been my choice, took me out of my comfort zone a lot, since it had virtually little or no substance (and more than a few potentially offensive stereotypes, as with the Asian girl, and especially the black and Hispanic characters). There is nothing to spoil, because you will probably be able to predict every single thing that happens, whether or not you have seen many films of this nature. Of course, that's hopefully not why you bought the ticket. You came to see amazing hip-hop routines matched with all the hottest new dance tracks. This certainly delivers on that, though you have to wait awhile for a completely uninterrupted step sequence. In short, a good easy way to spend an afternoon with a friend or significant other, but it's just as easy to spend $7.15 to rent the DVD or go to see something else.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining but very unrealistic.,"First of all, why does Channing Tatum (who plays lead role as Tyler in part one) appear at the beginning of the movie and then he disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the movie? I thought he was going to be the main guy again; Wrong. Robert Hoffman appears as Chase Collins, the lead role, and to be honest, his dance moves were not all that (to put it nicely). Secondly, I thought it kind of disturbing that the writers portrayed the 410 Dance Crew, which had an African American leader and more people of color, as violent and ""Bad"" - I've never met a dancer, whether street or not, to have the kind of anger and violent tendencies that the leader of the 410 Crew exhibited. Third, everyone knows, (or do they?), that African Americans invented hip hop, rock, jazz, etc. yet, you have two Caucasians as the lead roles, and to be honest, when it comes to dancing, they just can't cut it like African Americans - period. The African Americans that were in this movie were in the background and weren't allowed to display the kind of dance moves that REALLY make people take notice. So, to be fair, I give it a 5 out of 10 because it had some decent dance moves and I can tell they worked hard on their ""dance moves"". The acting was okay.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

A Nutshell Review: Step Up 2 the Streets,"The opening just might inspire the return of the flashmobbers, a fad which picked up for a short time in Singapore (of which I did participate in one), and then faded into oblivion. From the get go, it seemed like a unique idea, until you realize it's all staged to gain street cred in this Youtube age, performed by ""crew"" members of reigning street dance champions 410.But Step Up 2 retains much of the superficial facade of the original movie, with the setting in the same elite school, only with a different cohort. From what we've seen in the first, those snobby arty farty dance kids no longer hog the spotlight, as it is firmly on a group of misfits who are here to replace the loss of the previous two leads Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum, although the latter did land a guest appearance to cement the excuse for a sequel, as well as to pass on the troubled teen mantle to Andie (Briana Evigan).Whatever troubles these teens have, it's all secondary to the purpose of making the movie. Sure, you have the outcast who don't look right and get prejudiced against, a typical younger brother trying to step out of the shadows of his more illustrious brother who's now school principal, and some might even deem it condescending to have an Asian character who speaks in a funny accent. Too many characters here and all of them turn out to be one- dimensional and cardboard. But all that camaraderie building aside, which is what is formulaic glue, the main draw is undoubtedly the street dancing moves.I'd bet everyone in the audience, who are mostly teenagers into free form dance, will lap up all the moves that the cast put on display. And there are plenty of set pieces for one to gawk at. However, in my own personal un-dance-like opinion, the dancing here pales in comparison to the first. What made the first interesting to watch, is the fusion of two different schools of thought, and having them come together for an explosive finale which was worth the wait. Here, it's more improvisation, and even then, you can't help but notice the very individualistic styles that stand out on its own, never for a minute trying to blend in with the rest of the crew.Coming together for the expected finale was also very staged and forced, and in no way given the story development, can they pull off something like that. Even so, instead of one coherent act, you get many disjointed short sequences being force fit together. Not very effective, or interesting to sit through unfortunately. So I am going to state that Step Up 2 the Streets is strictly meant for street dance fans, otherwise this makes the first movie look like a class act of its own.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Step DOWN!,"The more flips or spins or twirls, or shakes, Step up 2 does, the more time the audience has to reflect on the fact that this amateurish enterprise is missing everything elseStep Up 2 makes every story-telling mistake possible: Dialogue driven, over-exposition, Flat characters, contrived plot devices, silly lines, and an insulting misuse of montage. Step Up wasn't so well written itself, but at least it look like the product of a filmmaker. This looks like the product of a hack. It is striped to the bone of story, and over stuffed with dance numbers that look choppy and uneven, like a cobbled together mix of every dance style ever.

"""Fame"" redux generally falls flat","Saddled with a screenplay that wouldn't earn a passing grade in a Cinema 101 course, ""Step Up 2 the Streets"" is an urban fairy tale about an orphaned crew dancer (Briana Evigan) from the 'hood who is accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts. But can she find a home with the assortment of geeks, preppies and classically-trained arty types who attend the school? And can she succeed as a student without turning her back on her ""homies"" from the old neighborhood? Or will she be forced to form her own crew from dancers at the school to compete with the Big Boys out on the streets?You can write the script yourself, but the key selling-point of this sequel to ""Step Up"" - sort of a mash-up of ""Fame,"" ""Footloose"" and ""School of Rock"" - is clearly not the storytelling but the dancing. And in that respect it delivers the goods. So ignore the predictable plotting, the tinny dialogue, the corny inspirational speeches, the wafer-thin characters, the obligatory montage sequences and the amateurish acting, and simply revel in the moves, street-dance or otherwise, that permeate the film. It's not much in the way of compensation, I know, but at least it's better than nothing.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"Predictable, unrealistic, main female character counts steps, but JabbaWockeez, Moose, and Mari Koda save the film!","I love hip hop--the music, the breaking (along with other forms of dancing), and the culture, but I have yet to see a hip hop movie that I really loved. The reason why these movies always fail (""Honey,"" ""Save the Last Dance,"" ""You Got Served,"" ""Step Up,"") are because the movies either fail in acting skills or level of dance. I enjoyed ""Step Up"" solely because of Channing Tatum's excellent dance skills, but the girl in that movie looked like she was counting every single hip hop step. In ""How She Move,"" the issue was that the music directors kept playing music during the stepping scenes and stepping is supposed to be so powerful that you just listen to the body music, also an issue in parts of ""Stomp the Yard"" (although I loved the latter film). I was not at all surprised when I wasn't moved by this film. The lead female character, like so many others, looked like she learned hip hop dancing yesterday right after her model shoot. I'm not saying this to be facetious, but the problem with Hollywood movies is they pick what they think people will find attractive rather than skill level. I watched Briana Evigan dance, and almost every move was followed by some video girl pose or hard concentration on her face. Miss Prissy (of ""Rize"") is a good example of how a female whose background is in hip hop usually looks when she dances. The grit in the female dancers is ALWAYS missing in these movies, but it's replaced by pop star poses. I hate that! If we get past her character, which could have been left out altogether and focused moreso on Chase Collins (played by Robert Hoffman), this movie might've worked. I have seen him on ""Wild n' Out,"" and I think he has phenomenal skill. His acting skills are cool too, but I also wasn't buying Evigan's acting. The first half of the movie, especially with the 410 Crew, sounded like they were reading straight from the script. No emotion; just words. That made me think of ""You Got Served"" again, which had to be the worst acting I've ever seen. ""Breakin' and ""Breakin' 2"" also had bad acting, but the dancing was so tight that I didn't even care.This movie also had more clich√©s than a little bit: 1) a guy and a girl sitting in a tree kissing (Are you serious? And who climbs trees with a dress on?); 2) a guy and a girl kissing in the rain; 3) the entire crowd in the final scene going out through what looked like a storm and not one person put up an umbrella (Sistas are NOT trying to get their hair wet; ask one sista you know right now to go stand outside in the rain and see how she looks at you); 4) no reason whatsoever that Moose should've been a nerd nor was that character developed enough; 5) Andie's crew went to the club to show off their new moves but they acted like they were new to the neighborhood, which doesn't make any sense considering Andie used to be in 410 Crew and Chase frequented this area and danced in the very beginning of the movie (How do you make someone look inexperienced who has experience from years of practicing?) Pros: The el train scene at the beginning of the movie kicked this movie into high gear, and I was immediately entertained. I loved the dude (Alfred ""Black"" Thomas) who plays Tuck, although I wish he'd take that scowl off his face every once in awhile. I checked him out in ""Stomp the Yard,"" but I got to really admire his dancing in this film. I always enjoy watching Channing Tatum because he dances so tight and puts a little stank in his moves, almost like he's also influenced by traditional African dancing with the popping. Robert Hoffman was ridiculous as usual, and I'd like to see a dance off between him and Channing. I wish Mari Koda played the female lead because she killed her role in this movie. It's about time that movies started incorporating the Asian influence in hip hop; I know Japanese people who live and breathe it harder than the average person in the club. Everything about her dancing was polished. However, the person who really caught my attention was Moose (Adam G. Sevani). That cat was SICK! If I saw him walking down the street, I wouldn't peg him as a hip hop head, but everything about his moves told me he's been dancing for a long time, and if he hasn't, he sure fooled me. To put it plain, there were a couple of girls that I took notice of, but overall, the guys outshined them in this movie. And I was so amped to see the JabbaWockeez. They are one of the best crews I've ever seen in my entire life.Would I want to see this movie again? No. Will I buy it? Nope, renting it was fine. But I still have faith that someday there will be a hip hop movie that I can go ""That's it! That has all of the elements--great acting, excellent dancing, and an unpredictable plot."" At least I hope so because this movie plot was about as recycled as the blue bag program.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Doesn't Even Compare to the First Movie,"First off let me just say that this movie was not horrible, but in my opinion it didn't even compare to the first Step Up movie (which BTW I would absolutely say is one of my top 10 movies).At first I couldn't believe that they were making a Step Up 2 without the two lead roles in the first Step Up ( HOTT Channing Tatum and the GORGEOUS Jenna Dewan)that made the first Step Up movie such a success. I saw the movie Step Up 2 with a bunch of my friends when it first came out, HOPING that it would be as good as the first one.BOY WAS I WRONG. I gave this movie 2 stars truly based on dancing. And even that wasn't all so great! All the dances looked the same and they all looked like they were trying to hard, or showing off- unlike Channing which unlike him it looked like it just came natural! Watching Hiphop after hip-hop after hip-hop just got boring and The storyline was absolutely horrible and the two lead characters had no chemistry whatsoever. Now that I'm thinking about it I probably would have never seen this movie if I hadn't been for Channing Tatum in it. AND I BET THAT NONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAW THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR CHANNING TATUM IN THAT ONE SCENE! In my opinion no one can touch Channing Tatum's dance moves and at least in the first Step Up movie they had variety of ballet and hip hop dancing. I can honestly say that after seeing the first Step Up I immediately said ""I HAVE TO OWN THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT"" and with Step Up 2 I was very disappointed and also a bit annoyed that they would even think about making a sequel to a movie that didn't need one.And if they were to make a sequel it should have definitely had Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan in it. So If you want to see this movie do not go into it hoping for it to beat out the original Step Up, but go into it to get a good listening of music. As most of you can probably tell by reading this I am ADDICTED to Step Up (the original) and the Hottest actor on earth: Channing Tatum. Sorry, he just is amazingly gorgeous.

Step  Up 2 The Streets,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had more of a hip hop feel to it, compared to the first one. And a lot more hip-hop dancing. It had a pretty decent story line but, it was also pretty predictable. Good acting performances by the main characters Brianna Evigan and Robert Hoffman. Robert has been in other dance moves like You Got Served. But, this was the first time he was really able to shine with his dance ability and acting skills. I actually thing Cassie's character could have had a little more substance but, i figured she hasn't had much acting experience. But, what really made the movie great to me, was the final dance scene. It was sexy, edgy and new. Something I've had yet to see, in any other dance movies! Honestly, this was one of the best dance moves I've seen in a while. Good story line. good dancing, good actors. If you like dancing you should check this one out.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Takin' it to the streets,"Andie (Evigan) is adopted by her mum's friend following her death and facing a life of petty crime and delinquency, decides to try-out for enrolment at the local school of Arts.

Rejected by her old crew for becoming part of the establishment, she teaches her new peers to compete for the street dance wars, but risks expulsion, ridicule and the support of her adopted mother in the process.Actor-crooner Greg Evigan's career lives on vicariously through his husky-voiced daughter Briana playing her first lead role with confidence and skill, while English ballet dancer and actor Will Kemp has an essentially non-dance role as the stiff headmaster, learning a thing or two from the next generation. The cast are fashionable and age appropriate for their roles; nothing special, the emphasis is on the moves and the last act is the best in that regard.There's a bit of romance, drama, a Kleenex moment or two, plenty of gyrating mid-riffs, plunging necklines, jealousy, vandalism and fisticuffs topped off by a rain-drenched, headlight lit dance off.

A ridiculous film with two boring leads. Robert Hoffman is near zombie like most of the time only with a perpetual smile on his bland dead like face. There are two small things of interest.

If it's dancing you want to see!!,"This movie is all about the dance, it has much more dance sequences than Step Up, Save the last Dance; and they are stunning!The story is a bit predictable, the typical ""girl from the neighborhood that comes to a fancy school..."". The acting is OK, the main actress (Briana Evigan) did a good job and I really liked Adam G. Sevani, as Moose. The male lead (Robert Hoffman) for me was the weakest on the main cast.But... The dancing is AMAZING! The coreographies are great and really complex. The dancers are awesome (for example Robert Hoffman who was the weakest in acting, his dancing was amazing)! Great Break Dance every five minutes of the movie!!!So, if you want to see a movie with great dancing, this is it!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
great movie,"i loved this movie. it has to be one of the best dance movies i've ever seen. i don't agree with some comments made about it. I thought all parts of the movie were excellent including the acting. the end dance scene was probably the BEST dance scene i've ever seen in a movie. If you want to see a movie that has excellent dancing, a great cast, MORE than decent acting and gives you a great feeling at the end of it, see this. The dancing in this movie just makes you want to become a professional dancer, all the dance scenes are really enthusiastic and gives a great energy and vibe from it. Even though its a movie, it projects all this through the screen. To anyone that thinks this is a bad movie, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, however if you have not seen this, i would like you to take not from this comment. Great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great dance movie,"Step Up 2 The streets was such an amazing movie. The dancing was so cool the way they did it. The dance scenes that they did were in all different types of areas. There was also a love story to it a little bit. The love story was very good though and fit right in with the story of the movie. I thought that it was better than the first step up because it was very different and wasn't the same at all. The acting in it was pretty good as well. I didn't think that their would be much of a story to it but their was. It made you want to get up and clap and cheer for the dancers in it. The dancers in it did a great job dancing as well, and learning how to dance. The end of this movie had very long dance scenes as well and seemed like it was never going to end which was a good thing. I thought that this was a great dance movie and was perfect for Valentines Day.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"It's as charming, has the original.","I thought this was not gonna be has good as the first Step Up(2006), cause some sequels try to a carbon copy of the original. But Step Up 2 was not quite copy. This sequel makes a little note to the first one, reprising his role in a guest shot by Channing Tatum as Tyler Kage from the first one, but other then that this movie stands on it's own. It starts with Andie(Briana Evigan) is a member of a dance group called the 411, and can't seem to stay out of trouble, but is giving one more chance when she gets an audition, and ends up passing a school for the performing arts, during that time she meets up with Chase Collins(Robert Hoffman) an another aspiring dancer, in which they start out rocky, but gets better has it goes on. But school takes up too much of Andies time, and her crew dumps her. But Andie and Chase try to put there own crew together. But taking the schools most talented outcasts, and making them into a team. But will they make it? You'll half to see the movie to find out. This movie had great dancing, and great performances by Briana Evigan and Robert Hoffman, and not to mention great dancing. If you loved Step Up(2006), then you'll love Step up 2:The Streets.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"hate it , or move it","real deal, this is the shi*,It has it all:story, dance, music etc.If u don't like the movie your flag is too high.Watch it twice and you will see what I'm talking about.The moves, there's nothing like'em:it moves you in your chair just seeing them.My opinion about this movie is that is great.Even the story line is good.All the music in this movie will make you feel alive if u want to feel the beeb i suggest you get the ost of this thing coz its absolutely crazy.You might get emotional at it, and it's not a bad thingjust don't keep the flag so high like others",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly good,"Despite quite dire reviews, i decided to watch step up 2 and surprising found it really enjoyable.The acting wasn't impeccable, but it was sufficient for this genre. And yes the storyline is rather predictable but to be honest, so are most films in this genre.The dancing was different to the first Step up hence the title ""the streets"" and it was refreshing to see more diverse choreography, particularly the final dance scene.Not to be missed were the surprising comic factor and of course the amazing soundtrack.Definitely one to watch if you like dance films.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Loved it!,"If you want a film with AMAZING dancing, some fun characters and a bit of a romantic storyline, give this a go! I had low expectations but found myself smiling through most of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A very inspirational film.,"This was a great movie. The acting could have been slightly better (although wasn't THAT bad), but the dancing made up for the lack of acting skills. The dancing was sick from the beginning of the movie (subway scene) to the end. It wasn't just a break dancing flick, it was also a movie to teach everyone 2 lessons, to never let someone tell you that you cannot do something, the second is to always be yourself, chase your dreams not the dream others want you to chase. It was a touching and inspirational film, in a hip hop way (if that makes sense lol). Great movie, I recommend to all those who are into any type of arts ex dancing, acting, musical, painting, drawing, because it's one that would speak to the artsy people the strongest.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Love the most,"I love step up movie. step up 1, step up 2 the street, step up 3 D, step up 4 revaluation, wait for 5. <3 And i like Adam&Alyson. ^^ I want have to create for next part every year. But, i wants involvement Dancing in the next. 555 I love dancing. I have inspiration from step up 2. At least I had a staring dancers after. I never refused to follow the dream. If I had the chance. I asked you to come to Thailand for supporting me. I'm waiting for you. I want to dance, stand beside Adam.

I learned from YouTube. That's I do now. Wish you have good movie a lot. I'll follower you.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I give this a 10 because it does not deserve the low score it has,"You people just need to calm down. Predictable? Yes. Really now, find me a movie that isn't? I'm sorry, next time Hollywood will just have everyone get shot in a drive by, nope, wait, you will STILL COMPLAIN! You work in Hollywood than, people are so much more eager to whine than compliment. Stereotypes are annoying too but yet again, I'm sure you would still complain if it were white guys (calling them idiots or something) or if the black guys were all rosy (calling them idiots or something). If you haven't caught on, Hollywood has those options to choose from and they choose what they believe is the lesser of grievances. To the movie, I thought it was great and inspirational. Sure, clich√©'d (once again, what isn't these days, w/ almost 7 billion people its hard to avoid) but awesome. The dance scenes were beyond beautiful. Gotta love Mr. Hoffmann too, he is a very talented dancer, go him! I say see it, even if you don't like the story or what not, the dancing is worth every penny, I saw it twice in one night and the second time was as good as the first time.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
You guys are too harsh,"I went to see the movie expecting it to hate it. I guess I'm one of those people on which the IMDb ratings have started having effect. But just like QoS, Raise Your Voice, and Thirteen, I was disappointed not by the movie, but by the IMDb user's rating.The movie isn't bad at all, in fact, with all the dancing and the music, it's fun. I think we're getting too harsh on movies, instead of just having fun we're becoming critical about every little aspect/fault a movie has.Come on guys, the dancing is the best I've ever seen, the songs are catchy, and even the story isn't that bad. It's not even half as bad as I thought it must be. Its NOT a movie that's going to change your entire life, but one that will make your hours worth it.Watch it, ignoring the comments here. Give the movie an honest shot and it won't disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Fairly good movie,"Step up 2 is a fairly good movie to watch, except the fact that it's clich√©. The movie has an amazing dance choreography which will leave you dumb founded. I should say that all the dancers & performers who have been involved in this movie has done a great job, but acting wise not so good maybe because that's the way the story is made. Like i said before, the story is clich√©. Surprisingly, it's actually quite inspiring seeing how great & talented these dancers are. I'd rate this movie into 3 categories story,acting,dancing. Story : Not so good. Acting: I'd say good because the story is meaningless and what more can you act?. Dancing: Great. Highlight of the movie since the movie is all about dancing,It's mandatory that the dancing is at least good. Summing up, It's a good movie to watch if you're a person who is into watching chick flicks but not saying this is a chick flick or if you like watching dance/musical movie then this is a perfect movie for you to uplift & warm up your mind",,Anonymous,Music
amazing dancing,"This movie completely outdid the first Step Up movie. As previous users have said, the acting isn't all that great but the leading characters had great chemistry. It had great dancing. Its a really good movie for teens. The plot won't matter as much as the dancing to them so if you're younger or have teen kids its a good one to watch. They will get up and dance during the credits. If you enjoyed Step Up and won't watch it because you think it's just like every sequel where they mess it up like I did, go see it. You will be surprised because I sure was. I was highly impressed. Even if you aren't a big fan of all the dancing or aren't into the kind of dancing, watch it, you may find yourself changing your mind. Although the plot is very amateur, it does send out a message to some so the plot isn't as bad as they say.",,Anonymous,Music
