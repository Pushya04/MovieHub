"Alice slays, as usual","Alice was her usual badass in this installment in the resident evil franchise. The objective should never be to go in with high expectations, it's all about over the top action with a sprinkling of plot. This fits the bill. The storyline was a bit disappointing because it doesn't have much of a beginning or end, it all just kind of happens. Overall decent acting, good cinematography and zombie action. I thought Alice and Claire had good chemistry, and the newcomers held up as good cannon fodder.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"no story, but enjoyable","I liked this compilation of scenes. I liked the soundtrack; I liked the acting; I liked the settings; I liked the effects. As a game, it works greatly. The movie is a sum of chunks of stories. Most of them are action stories. A few are horror stories. Another few are mystery stories. And none of them are connected to each other. They just share common characters.Honestly, the plot is just an excuse for great action scenes. And I liked the action scenes. I rate it zero for the story, ten for the technical quality. And I have to admit it: in the end, I liked it as a whole.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alice's Afterlife Aggregation...,"A prison breakout's always fun, especially if you're on the run, from multi-tongued mutant defiance, or a hooded giant axe wielding giant. Arcadia's moored just off the shore, if you make it there your safe for sure, just try to avoid the shaded fella, who pulls the strings of Umbrella. If your losing faith with all the confusion, you need to prepare for retribution, where everything you've seen before, is repeated, recycled, churned, turned once more.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Patchwork filmmaking,"Alice (the eternal Mila Jovovich) is back and in multiple copies. Her prime target is the Umbrella Corporation and the now T-virus enhanced Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts). After a full frontal attack the Umbrella base is left destroyed, but the whole batch of Alice clones get blown sky-high, when Wesker manages to fly away unscathed and detonate the plant. Conveniently for the movie the original Alice survives unscathed as a castaway on-board the plane. During a skirmish with Wesker Alice gets injected with a antidote, that turns her back to being human (but somehow she still manages to survive a terrible plane crash unharmed and keeps her over-the-top fighting abilities largely intact). With Wesker dead and Umbrella disposed of Alice returns to the States to search of her friends, who left for sanctuary in Alaska, only to disappear in mysterious circumstances.In general a much improved instalment of the series and if anything the whole series remains enjoyable, if uninventive. In this part Anderson actually outdoes himself and instead of thinking up something original he starts borrowing scenes from other movies. Wesker looks and fights like Neo's twin brother, the new zombies bring to mind ""Blade 2"", whilst The Executioner has a disturbing familiarity to Pyramid Head of the Silent Hill franchise. Nonetheless some of the scenes are very memorable with the combat with The Executioner a real highlight for the movie (especially given the abrupt ending of the final fight).There may be a bit too many generic elements with this movie, but that has never stopped the franchise from being mindless slash-em-up fun. Even if a somewhat weakly scripted one. Also Alice remains a very likable heroine, so no matter how bad the script if she gets proper screen time and a couple of intriguing fights, than the movie just never seems to feel like a waste of time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alice unites a group of survivors who want to relocate to a strange place called Arcadia,"Fourth spectacular , action-packed and stirring installment of the ¨Resident Evil series¨ , adapted from the video games characters produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi .

This exciting picture contains thrills, chills , action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts. The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized. This sequel takes more , more approach , more fights , more blood and gore . The film turns out to be a crossover between 'the nuclear apocalypse of Mad Max 2', the 'George A Romero's Zombies', 'Zack Snyder's Dawn of the dead' and genetic experiments from 'Sigourney Wever-Ripley in Alien saga' and the monsters from ¨Blade¨ and ¨Lord of Rings¨. Of course, the film takes ideas from former parts as 'Resident evil'(2002, Paul W. Anderson, here also producer , director and screenwriter) and 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' (2004,Alexander Witt) . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames. It's predictable but we have seen the previous chapters but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women, Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods, plenty of screams, shocks and tension . The make-up assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals . Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with deserted and destroyed cities, such as the fantastic scenarios in Los Angeles totally inhabited by flesh-munchies creatures .

Mindless fun.,"This fourth Resident Evil instalment was only ever going to be worth seeing if it featured lots of amusing gore and entertaining action scenes that utilised the third dimension successfully. Evidently, director Anderson must've known this too, because nary a second is wasted on anything else. From the get go we're embroiled in a mass raid on Umbrella's high-tech underground headquarters by dozens of Alice replicates. It's Matrix-y slick, features a massive body count and is a great way to kick off proceedings, even if the CGI is occasionally substandard.The remainder of the film becomes grubbier once it relocates to an abandoned maximum security prison surrounded by thousands of the ""infected"". Alice, and the ragtag bunch of Los Angeleno's she meets in the jail, encounter blood-thirsty zombies left, right and centre with murderous glee. The finest sequence on offer comes thanks to the inexplicably nonsensical inclusion of an unnamed 10ft creature with a mammoth axe-like weapon, who was apparently only introduced so we could witness its gruesome demise. With rain-drenched slow motion and heart pounding music, watching Alice and Claire despatch of this demented beast is a thrill.To mention other dispensable elements of this movie – you know, acting, character development, dialogue, plot plausibility, etc – would be redundant for two reasons, (a) because your enjoyment of Afterlife can be measured wholly on your reaction to the above couple of paragraphs and (b) we all know that the aforementioned filmic elements will be close to non-existent anyhow.Mindless fun.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What happened?,"One of the things I like about the Resident Evil films is that they take the time to fill in the details while holding the audience in suspense.This forth film completely falls flat on both accounts. Thanks to 2 dimensional characters, an overdone plot, and poor use of foreshadowing, the entire film is predictable. At the same time it doesn't bother to show or explain how certain important plot devices came to be. The movie reeks from it's overuse of Deus ex machina.The special effects were the only engaging thing about this movie. A lot of it felt like The Matrix in 3D.One other thing this film did well was continuity from the 3rd film. I like that they didn't spend much time on flashbacks while being faithful to the events of the 3rd film.All in all my feeling after seeing the movie was that I was expecting more. They could have made it longer, filled in some missing details, developed the plot/characters more, and had a much more enjoyable film.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil: Full of Life,"I am a huge fan of the video game series; I've played & completed every Resident Evil game there is and I have 100% trophies of Resident Evil 5.I loved the previous Resident Evil movie trilogy although many fans were disappointed by them because it wasn't to close to the games and Alice is the main character who isn't in any game. The filmmakers can't please everyone when it comes to movies based on video games because if the movie is very similar to the game then people will say that ""What is the point of the movie when it is just as same as the game?"" but if it is very different then people will complain that it is not related to the game in any way, shape or form. What Paul W.S Anderson has done is created an original story and had the setting of the game in the first film & in this one as well. Which is the best thing to do and he has proved that he is a terrific writer & director, he may not be the best filmmaker ever but he does know how to make good movies based on games and he is one of my favourite directors. His two movies Mortal Kombat & Resident Evil are both the best video game adaptations to date.The plot of Resident Evil: Afterlife is that it takes place after Extinction and Alice is continuing to look for survivors in world that has been infected by T-Virus that has turned into flesh eating zombies plus she wants to take revenge on Albert Wesker and this time she if fully prepared with her clones, telekinetic powers and awesome weapons. Fighting Wesker isn't an easy task because he is superhuman himself just like in Resident Evil 5. This instalment is very close to the games and particularly Resident Evil Code Veronica & Resident Evil 5. Those who have played the 2 games will get flashbacks while watching the movie.This was the most anticipated film for me this year and it absolutely did not disappoint me at all. I loved every minute of it right from start to end. Resident Evil: Afterlife was relentlessly entertaining, exiting and a perfect popcorn movie at the cinema kind. The movie had a great blend of action, horror, sci-fi and thriller. This one had a much more post-apocalyptic look than in extinction and has amazing special & visual effects in just in a $60 million budget. The monsters were just like in Resident Evil 5, e.g. the zombies look like the majini's with their predator like mouth, the executioner and the dogs that split their heads open with teeth inside it. So it was fascinating to see that.The cast was great, Milla needs no introduction & is fantastic just like always and she is improving in acting, stunts and she doesn't struggle to get the job done because she can do it. Shawn Roberts was a much better Albert Wesker than Jason O'Mara in Extinction.Overall it's not an Oscar winning kind movie & it doesn't need to be. It's a movie for the fans not for critics so ignore their negative reviews but I had a really good time watching it since I am a fan and check it out if you're looking for an entertaining movie and it's a must see if you are a Resident Evil fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Eh, it's got its moments.","Plot: As Alice (Milla Jovovich) continues her fight against the nefarious Umbrella Corporation, she meets up with a group of survivors in Los Angeles, who are trying to reach the safe haven known as Arcadia.So far, here's how the series has done, in my opinion: the first was great, the second was horrible, and the third, though somewhat laughable, was still entertaining. After seeing this one though, I think the series is starting to go downhill again. The movie delivers basically what you could expect: tons of zombie-killing action, some cardboard cutout characters, and a useless story. Afterlife succeeds in all of this.Aside from the lead performance by Jovovich, I could hardly care less for any of the other actors. One of the unfortunately bad performances actually goes to Wentworth Miller, who played an agonizingly hollow Chris Redfield. And the story needed a complete re-do, because it was almost pointless. One example is the use of the Executioner from the game series. Though I thought his fight with Alice and Claire was cool, I was completely puzzled as to what his purpose in the movie was.It does do well in the action sequences, including an awesome, though short, standoff on a rooftop. But some of the action is overdrawn thanks to the ridiculously large amount of slow-motion. If they ran the movie without slow-mo, I bet the movie would lose half of its running time. XD I also liked the soundtrack by media boys tomandandy and the film's use of 3D really helped during some of the more intense moments.Overall it does have its perks and the 3D's good, but this is nothing more than a one-trick pony. Believe me; I'm a big fan of the games, and even I was disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Security, Safety, Shelter and Food","After destroying the Umbrella Corporation's Headquarter in Tokyo, Alice (Milla Jovovich) heads to Arcadia, in Alaska, seeking for survivors and following the broadcast message that offers security, safety, shelter, food and no epidemics. However, the place has no one but Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) that wears a strange device on her chest and has no recollections. Alice withdraws the electronic device and flies with Claire to Los Angeles, where she sees a group of survivors on the roof of a prison asking for help and under siege of the undead. They land on the roof and they learn with their leader Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) that Arcadia is actually a ship anchored nearby the harbor that has stopped broadcasting the message a couple of days before. Alice and Claire team up with the survivors and they decide to move to the vessel since the crowd of zombies is menacing their fortress. But first they release Claire's brother Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller) that is imprisoned in a cell. But in their journey to Arcadia, they have to fight against the legion of undead and also against a treacherous survivor.""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is a pleasant full of action adventure, with two lovely heroines performed by Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter and a cool good guy, Wentworth Miller, in his first feature after ""Prison Break"". Despite the gross continuity mistake when Alice is ready to take a bath and depending on the angle, the shower is spraying water or not, the film is highly entertaining and supported by a good story and great special effects.

"A disappointed fan, a mediocre movie and the 3D was a fuzzy mess","I'm a huge fan of Milla Jovovich and the Resident Evil movies. The last one - ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" - I thought was a great movie and the best in the series so far.So I had to see this latest installment, what a disappointing and mediocre movie it turned out to be. The 3D was so fuzzy and distracting throughout the film but even if it hadn't been in fuzzy 3D it still was badly directed and poorly written, with hardly any of the signature action scenes, and all the actors were very pitiable and amateurish, with an exceptionally lame lead villain. Most of the action was blah and boring, in routine slow mo cuts. Don't go to see this movie if you want good or creative action scenes or an interesting story.Most of the actors made no impression whatsoever, with the exception of Milla and Wentworth Miller of ""Prison Break"" fame. And even Wentworth Miller was given little to do, he didn't have but a handful of lines in the movie and it was a waste of his considerable talent. I really hope that he does better movies and roles in the future. I think he could become a major movie star, but not with appearing in crappy movies like this.I am giving it a generous 5 rating, and that is from a fans perspective. If I wasn't a fan I would give this movie a 3.Please let the next Resident Evil have a different director than this sub par effort had, and please let it not be in horrifying 3D.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Afterlife"" is great-Milla's return to the role, that fits her the most!","I saw Resident Evil when it got out back in 2002, and was impressed by the tension and action and, by Milla Jovovich, of course.Although flawed, the second installment of the franchise found more room to expand to than i could've ever imagined.And though it was logical, the third one provided the goods as well with more action and a bigger picture, as well.Now, visiting a pre-screening of ""a movie"", everything would've been perfect, if the movie was one of Zack Snyder's upcoming efforts, or Milla/Anderson's new Resident Evil.And boy, was i happy to know it was one of my most anticipated movies this year.Now, Alice is back, once again.I wasn't sure what to expect, because the series were strong and solid so far, but it isn't easy to keep up the good pace.So, at first, i thought it wasn't going to be easy to match the prequels, especially the scale of the last installment.But then, the news about the 3D came around, and followed by the fusion system technology announcement, the infamous Cameron creation, that will be used almost ruthlessly often in the future, it was all clear.I saw it getting better and better, the development of the movie was incredible lately and, though the trailer wasn't saying much, i was kind of hoping to cover the best parts, and i luckily hoped right and this was the best part-i wasn't expecting even half of the action and battle sequences i saw.And i must say, that the cast is the best, that could've been assembled.Ali Larter is great, she's grown so much to the series, that fits her perfectly well.Wenthwort Miller is cool, a little bit Scofield-like, but that's normal.After all, he was great as a con.The only thing i missed was Oded Fehr, who has portrayed a very likable and convincing character in the 2-nd and 3-rd installments.And, surprisingly, the script had more incommon with the videogames than the prequels had.I mean, that's a fresh take, and the 3D makes it better.This is probably the best 3D since How to Train Your Dragon was around, and as a horror/action movie-the best of it's kind.Just to compare, the technology was way better than the 3D, used in the last ""Destination"" installment and, as well, better then ""Valentine's Day"" remake.And those movies made a lot of profits at the Box Office.And to add something up-i red a review, claiming that the movie is a ""Matrix"" rip-off.So my advice is this-don't listen to those claims-first of all, there were some stunts, looking very similar to a couple, featured in ""The Matrix"", but the script led very logically to them, and this isn't a trademark for ""The Matrix"".People dodging bullets or walking on walls-wow i've seen this somewhere else-oh yes, in, at least 2 or 3 movies.Second of all, those scenes are very sane and surely not even looking close to those, in the Wachovski movie, instead being shot in an entirely different style.It's like claiming that a car, plane or train explosion is a trademark for some movie.And those people should admit, that The Matrix is also copying a couple of movies.And those movies are Alex Proyas's ""Dark City"" and Germany's ""Welt am Draht"".So don't give the audience false infos.Another interesting thing was the way Anderson shot the movie-in entirely different style from the previous ones.This new moves are definitely a change in direction for Anderson as a director, a fresh and surely an epic one.So expect ""Afterlife"" to surpass the domestic achievements of its predecessors, because, aside from the fusion tech and the hype surrounding it's release, the movie has something the above-mentioned movies don't-a convincing lead.Because Milla Jovovich sets the mark for lead female characters in all movies to come, and she's fantastic-Alice's return and the role that fits Milla Jovovich the most.Fantastic movie for fans, a real peak in it's genre.And one of the best movies of its kind this year.My rate:A deserved 10/10 for Milla & co.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average survival horror in a prison and on a tanker,"Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth entry in the live action franchise based upon the Japanese video game series that started in the mid-nineties. The story revolves around the urban legend of a safe haven called Arcadia that seems to be located in Alaska. Former private security operative Alice attacks the headquarters of her former employer in Tokyo before heading for Alaska where she expects to join the group of survivors she had met eighteen months earlier. However, there is no safe haven to be found and Alice even gets attacked by a former companion who seems to have lost her memory and acts erratically. Alice manages to calm her former friend down and they travel south to Los Angeles to find out what happened to the group of survivors and unveil the secret behind the urban legend. The duo meets a group of survivors hiding in a maximum security prison that is surrounded by undead victims of the infamous T-Virus. Alice learns that Arcadia isn't a fixed place but a cargo tanker that is now situated in the port of Los Angeles. She tries to get on board to find out what happened to the survivors but realizes too late that the ship is a trap.On the positive side, the new characters Alice encounters in Los Angeles are overall quite diversified, quirky and unique which leads to a few emotional scenes. The locations in and around the abandoned prison are quite haunting. The action scenes are particularly intense and are truly impressive in the film's middle section and ending. The special effects are fluidly crafted and blend in very well. The showdown on the ship is truly gripping but also ends on a cliffhanger leading to the fifth installment.On the negative side, the transition between the third film and the fourth movie isn't exactly fluid as there is a gap of twelve months between the third film's last scene and the fourth movie's first scene. Furthermore, there is another gap of six months after the opening sequence. The scenes in Alaska are rather disappointing and basically only consist of a fight between Alice and the lone survivor who attacks her. The story is simplistic and unrealistic, even by the franchise's low standards. Some side characters such as the one played by Norman Yeung are rather exchangeable while former intriguing characters such as the one played by Spencer Locke only have cameo appearances here.In the end, Resident Evil: Afterlife is pretty much on the same level as its predecessor. It's a slightly above average science-fiction movie with impressive effects and stunts, a healthy dose of creepy atmosphere and intriguing lead characters while it's suffering from a lack of fluidity, a ridiculous plot and boring side characters. Fans of the live action franchise can watch this film without any regrets but this is neither a good movie to discover the franchise nor a film that will change your mind if you have never managed to get into this particular franchise in the first place. At the end of the day, this movie is solid and entertaining but fails to innovate or leave a lasting impression.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Afterlife,"Resident Evil: Afterlife attempts to take the series back to basics and delivers a campy action film that has fun with the material. In this chapter Alice searches for Claire and her group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse, which were headed for Alaska looking for the infection free zone Arcadia. Wentworth Miller joins the series and gives a strong performance. Additionally, the over-the-top action scenes are quite impressive, and bring a lot of energy to the film.

More of the same... so I'm happy.,"Having sat it out for parts two and three, Paul W.S. Anderson returns to the director's chair for Afterlife, the fourth film in the Resident Evil series; rather unsurprisingly, his film is another slick, effects packed horror/sci-fi hybrid with the emphasis on glossy 3D action set-pieces rather than character development or plot progression. As such, the film is unlikely to alter the opinions of those who haven't enjoyed the series thus far, but the rest should have a blast...Anderson occasionally goes a bit over the top with his Matrix-style visuals, particularly in the film's opening scene, which utilises an excess of bullet-time effects and gravity defying acrobatics, but for the most part his handling of the action is pretty impressive. There are loads of effective scares, the slow motion gives Jovovich and Larter fans plenty of time to appreciate the stars' physical form, and what the film lacks in originality, it sure makes up for in energy.The film might owe a lot to other genre classics for inspiration, but once the action kicks in, Afterlife proves to be a very entertaining time-waster indeed. Not all of it makes sense, but with survivors of the zombie apocalypse seemingly comprising of at least 50% hot women capable of kicking major butt (check out that shower room scene with the massive monster vs Alice and Claire for sheer awesomeness) this proves to be another satisfying entry in a consistently fun franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil fans won't be disappointed,"¨Five years ago... A virus escaped, and everybody died. ¨ It has been three years since the last Resident Evil movie came out. Afterlife is the fourth of the franchise and lives up to the expectations most fans of the series had although it isn't as good as the first movie. This is my favorite franchise based on a video game and in my opinion the series has worked because of Milla Jovovich. She is great in her role as Alice and has become a huge action star. Paul W.S. Anderson directed the first film of the series and now he came back to direct the fourth one, although he has written the screenplay for all four films so he has been involved with the entire process. The effects are great and if you are a fan of the franchise I recommend you see this in 3D, but if you didn't like the other films or aren't familiar with them I wouldn't recommend them since you might find yourself lost in the midst of the plot. I have to admit I never played the video games or know anything about them so I can't say how true to the game the story is, but considering all the video games that have been turned into movies this is by far the best series. The thing I liked least about this movie was the opening 15 minutes in Tokyo, but I understand they served to connect the end of Resident Evil Extinction with Afterlife. After Tokyo the movie really picks up and I found myself engaged in the story. This is not a movie you will enjoy for the acting, dialogue, or intelligent script, but it is an action packed movie with cool visuals, good fight scenes, and a very hot Milla Jovovich doing what she does best: killing zombies.The movie begins right where Resident Evil Extinction left us. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is trying to destroy the Umbrella Corporation using her newly discovered clones and goes deep inside Umbrella Head Quarters in Tokyo to kill Wesker (Shawn Roberts). After a face-off with several soldiers, Wesker escapes in an aircraft and the base is destroyed. Alice's clones have all been exterminated in the explosion, but she managed to get to the aircraft in time and just when she is about to kill Wesker he injects her with a serum that neutralizes the T-virus in her blood. She losses her superpowers and becomes human and thanks him for that right before they crash in the mountains. Alice survives and decides to go search for any survivors left in the apocalyptic world. She travels to Alaska in search of Arcadia where her friends had parted in the third film. Once in Alaska she finds the helicopter her friends where in, but there is no sign of survivors, the place is deserted. Right when she is about to lose hope she is attacked by Claire (Ali Larter) who has no memory of who she is because her memory has been erased by an Umbrella device. Alice frees her from the device and tries to help her get her memory back, while in the meantime they travel together on a two-man plane to Hollywood in search of more survivors. Here they find the city infected with zombies, but there are a few survivors in the rooftop of a prison cell. They make a forceful landing and meet some of the survivors who think she is here to rescue them. Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Crystal (Kasey Barnfield), Kim (Norman Yeung), and Wendell (Fulvio Cecere) are some of the survivors who tell Alice what Arcadia actually is and together they have to try to get there before the zombies find a way in the prison walls.Wentworth Miller was a good addition in this film as he plays Chris Redfield, Claire's brother, but due to her memory loss she can't recognize him. Alice and Claire are back from the third film and they have a lot of screen time as usual. Miller and Kodjoe give good supporting male roles, but we all know that the Resident Evil franchise is about girls who can kick zombie butts. In the first film it was Jovovich with Michelle Rodriguez, then she teamed up with Sienna Guillory in the second one, and now in the third and fourth films Jovovich and Larter are the true stars of the film. There are some very memorable scenes with great Matrix like effects. The 3D visuals are cool, and I especially liked the scene where Alice and Claire battled the Axeman in the bathroom. This is a popcorn action movie and probably not for everyone. If you didn't like the other Resident Evil movies then there is no reason why you should go see this, but if you liked those films then you will probably enjoy this one as well.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
OMG!

The 3D is the best I've seen (along with Avatar) and nothing like the crappy conversions done to Clash of the titans and Alice in wonderland.I'm sure there are whinny little haters on the franchise, but they need to take a seat because this movie is solid.The cinematography is beautiful and the visuals are stunning, you can definitely tell they invested a whole lot more money and time on it.If you are looking for a fun kick ass action/adventure with horror in it this is your movie!

res 4......more like the matrix 4,"where did it all go wrong? This was not the best game adaption to begin with, for me silent hill is still the closest game to movie effort. But I really love the first 3 resident evil movies, the third being my personal favourite so when I seen a trailer a few months ago for afterlife I could not wait to see this. Maybe that was the problem, expectation.I have read some other reviews on this site and I am puzzled, maybe I missed the point or I'm being to hard on the film? But for me the games and the previous 3 films had all being about atmosphere: this has none at all. It just rambled along until the next ""slow-motion just for the sake of it"" scene, of which there are a lot (id guess 20mins of the film is slow motion).I just don't know what happened to the series, as I said I am a huge fan of both the games and the films, barred this one of course, and can't understand how people can be so happy with this poor rip off of a film. There are so many direct rip off bits from the matrix, the obvious ones being the trinity style jump out the window from the trailer and even Wesker looks and moves like an agent.But this said, the easiest job in the world is being a critic. I am just so disappointed that it turned out like this, but I will just cross my fingers and hope against hope the nest one is a lot lot better.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A worthy addition to the franchise,"It's hard to review a 3-D film when your screener is in two dimensions. I am not talking about the Clash of the Titans or The Last Airbender type 3-D where they tried to convert the film after production. I am referring to a movie that was meant to be in 3-D and was filmed with the proper cameras and style to appreciate the genre. I am referring to Resident Evil: Afterlife.This, the fourth entry in the franchise, picks up immediately after Resident Evil: Extinction with Alice (Milla Jovovich) continuing to travel the world in search of human survivors after the virus unleashed by the Umbrella Corporation has turned most of the world's population into ultra-violent zombies.The film opens in a blaze of gunfire as Alice(s) invade the underground lair of the Asian Umbrella Corporation. It is here, she confronts her arch nemesis Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) for the first time in the series. This confrontation leaves Alice human (do your homework) and almost dead after their getaway transport crashes in the mountains.Alice then begins her search for other humans. A search that will eventually reunite Alice with fellow kick-asser Claire Redfield (Ari Larter) who was last seen looking for human life herself in Resident Evil: Extinction. The two will travel to Los Angeles where they will band together with a small group of human survivors that include Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Bennet (Kim Coates) and Claire's incarcerated brother, Chris (Wentworth Miller).With the gang all working together to fight the encroaching undeads, the normal shoot-outs and fisticuffs will ensue – mostly in exaggerated physical sequences that are accompanied by a musical score that almost had my sub-woofer beating through the basement floor.Resident Evil: Afterlife is written and directed by W.S. Anderson, the director of the original Resident Evil, Aliens vs. Predator and Death Race. Anderson is up to his usual tricks in Afterlife. He is good (sometimes real good) at action sequences, but character development and dialogue are trailing behind in all the action. A terrible voice over to introduce the film sets the tone and you get the feeling that Anderson doesn't push his actors (particularly the pivotal character of Albert) into multiple takes until the final product is delivered in the appropriate tone.When it does come down to the action, Anderson does the franchise proud. There was a great scene involving a wide angle show of a single engine plane leaving a blood streak as it chopped through hundreds of zombie onlookers and another scene of Alice jumping off a building and the zombie faithful following her to their second deaths. Other gun fights and muscle flexings seem to continue far longer than is necessary, however, we do realize that this is what the fan base clamors for.There are plenty of scenes that look like they would project well in the 3-D format. From sunglasses being flung to a plane crash. Unfortunately in the 2-D format, we can only imagine the difference.The concluding chapters to Resident Evil: Afterlife were a bit of a letdown. After Alice seems to find a large contingent of human life, she again must confront Wesker who has become pretty much invincible. Their final battle scene might have looked good in three dimensions, but it lacked the great climax we were hoping.The final scene in Resident Evil: Afterlife strongly suggests a sequel, and why not? The film garnished $59 million of its $60 million budget domestically. But internationally, Resident Evil: Afterlife brought in $200 million more. And with those kind of returns, you can guarantee that the franchise is dead and kicking.www.killerreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil..... 4.,"I am not a very big fan of RE but my younger brother.... OMG he is so mad after this movie and some times he even looks weird. I have seen Resident Evil 1, that was fine and interesting, Part two was pretty uninteresting and story was poor... Extinction was better (I didn't see it completely) and I liked it better than RE2.But part 4 is pretty good, 3D works here, visuals and cinematography are best part of the movie and editing is good but its very better than Part 2 & 3....Story in kind of different and better, Actually very better... Part 2 was worst in the series but 4 seems close to the part 1.In short its a good movie and Its not what you are expecting its really better. You won't regret ....",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only enjoyable if you're mentally handicapped or lobotomized,"..or just six years old. This movie is so full of *beep* i don't even know where to begin with. The opening scene, starring a bunch of cloned ninja-sword wielding bitches. The helicopter crash.. seriously.. WTF? The permanent Matrix-style slow-mo scenes. The ultimately lame ""story"" or the god awful and annoying music. The 3D effects were the only good thing in this movie, but still couldn't save it from being utter trash.The only reason to watch this movie would have been a naked Milla Jovowitch. Unfortunately, there is no naked Milla in it.This movie get's a solid one from me. You're better off playing the video game, or watching your neighbors dog licking it's ass.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could've been better,"I was watching Resident Evil: Afterlife for the 2nd time on DVD. I'd seen it a long time ago and needed to refresh my memory. I decided to read the reviews on IMDb and I noticed that most of the one-star reviews came first. They're so misleading for such a high-budget movie and probably come from rival movie directors.I agree that the fourth RE is too pretentious, hollow and a Matrix copy-cat, but none of this justifies giving it only one star, because it does have its moments; cool fight scenes, a fantastic protagonist, lots of cool mindless action, and a cliffhanger type ending. Clair wasn't bad either; especially her battle with the Monster was really awesome. I'd say it's one of the most memorable fight scenes in the franchise.The change of style in the movie is a tad hard to get used to. I'd like them to go back to the original style; no slow-motion, lots of scares and gory scenes, some suspense, which is lacking because the movie jumps from one location to another before you begin to develop a feel into the atmosphere of the location; from a futuristic base to sky, from there it cuts to snowy mountains, then quickly to some sort of desert, the beach, the sky, the plane, the prison, the ship. Maybe if they had slowed things down a little and made the duration a bit longer and had spent some time on character development, we would've got a far more enjoyable movie.What I didn't like about this movie was that there was no blood. Alice dips knives into the enemies' heads and they don't even seem to feel any pain. There's no emotional element in the movie. The survivors are as good as dead. Most of the characters are useless. You can't even connect with the villain. Nothing makes any sense. I hope they'll fix these problems in RE5, which I cannot wait to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What happened to good movies??????,"Firstly, I created an account on IMDb just so I could review this movie. I wish I could have put 0/10 but I could only choose 1/10. I don't usually waste my time to review movies which I didn't like but seriously I have to get this out of me.Nothing is good in this movie from start till end. I would rather go and clean toilets for an hour and a half.There is so much to explain on how bad this movie is I honestly do not know where to begin, you have probably read it on other reviews so I wont ramble on. I found myself laughing at the slow motion scenes which happen every 2 minutes for no reason. I feel like an idiot wasting my time watching this hoping it would get better, it just got on my nerves.People actually pay money to watch these films, no wonder more and more people are watching them online because the quality of films recently is just so bad its not worth spending money to go and see them. Everything is fake, there is no creativity in films at all, surely there are smart people working on these films, cant they tell how stupid and ridiculous the films are.Crap film, don't waste your money, don't be curious to watch it, end of.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
How much more ridiculous can these movies get?,"Let me be clear, despite my slightly positive rating, Resident Evil: Afterlife is in no way a ""good"" movie. But it is entertaining, in a ridiculous, inexplicable way.I'm a fan of this series, even though that admission would probably cause some people to doubt any and all of my credibility when it comes to movies. The last three RE flicks were just dumb, fun action movies with zombies, and I could appreciate them for what they were. No, they don't follow the games very closely, and no they weren't scary in the slightest, but I still liked them (to varying degrees). Milla Jovovich is a credible and likable action star and seeing her jumping through the air, kicking and shooting things in the face never really got old, for me. Plus, this series has a habit of including some pretty hot actresses in each installment (including this one), which I heartily approve of.Afterlife, to be quite honest, is a train-wreck. But, it's like a train-wreck where no one gets injured, and the train cars do some crazy flips in slow motion and there are tons of explosions and everyone who happened to see it had a pretty good time watching it. Writer and director Paul W.S. Anderson has completely (and wisely) given up on trying to make these movies make sense in the slightest way, and let all logic fall right off the B- movie cliff. There's just so many cheesy, absurd things going on at any given moment that it's almost an overload. The almost constant slow motion, the AWFUL acting, the absurd dialogue, the concrete-tunneling zombies, the guarantee that exactly every 3 minutes, a zombie or monster was going to magically appear behind a character and kill/almost kill them, the random elements from the games strewn about haphazardly...it's all just so ridiculous.This truly awful movie appealed to me in a perverse way. It certainly didn't bore me, that's for sure. But, you should be very wary if your tolerance (and maybe even fondness?) for a disaster isn't equal to mine. Resident Evil: Afterlife destroys the limits of absurdity like one of Alice's shotguns to the face. And yet, after the extra scene during the credits, I actually felt eager to see the next Resident Evil movie. Maybe I'm the one who's absurd.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why did I give this a 10?!,"I gave Resident Evil: Afterlife a 10/10 because I got exactly what I wanted out of it: GGG! Short for GIRLS, GUNS, and GORE! If you haven't figured these movies out by now, then you're most likely some loyal fan who expects too much. Yes, I am a fan of the games. But that doesn't mean I want to see an exact replica of the games. There's no suspense, you know who's going to live and die. I mean if I wanted an exact shot-for-shot Resident Evil adaptation, I would play the game! Is this film dumb? Yes. It's a guilty pleasure. And I'm fine with that. I love seeing gorgeous women kick ass, I love seeing ridiculous gore, I love being smart enough to see that this movie is NOT supposed to be Oscar-worthy. If anything this film was more fun than the previous installments, there was humor, great action, and hot chicks. Seriously folks, you should have figured this whole film series out after the second one. Don't come in with high expectations. Go with a group of friends and have a good time. If there's one thing that's absolutely incredible, it's the 3D. Probably the best since Avatar. Overall Resident Evil: Afterlife is a bloody good time. Definitely a great way to end the summer.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zombies are getting savvier!,"This is a big improvement on my last two horror nights at the multiplex: PIRANHA and THE LAST EXORCISM. That said, it's pretty formulaic. A handful of survivors of the killer virus are holed up in a Los Angeles fortress prison surrounded by thousands of hungry zombies.Zombies are getting savvier with each successive movie appearance. They manage to tunnel and smash their way in - predictably. Also fairly predictable is who's going to make it to the final reel and who's destined to be zombie snacks. The plot leapfrogs from scene to scene with huge how-did-they-get-here gaps, but series super-heroine Milla Jovovich is in great shape and there's a splendidly hiss-able uber-baddie head of the Umbrella Corp. The 3-D is good and not too 'intrusive'. The zombie attacks are visceral without being too gross. There are some great sets and eye-boggling stunts.As video-game adaptations go, this pushes all the right buttons.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where were the Zombies???,"For me personally this movie was a major disappointment. I consider myself a fan of all things Zombie. Being such I believe Zombie movies should include ""Zombies"" as a main part of the film. Unfortunately in this movie the Zombies were used basically as a morbid backdrop at best.Resident Evil Afterlife was more about Annie's ongoing battle with the Umbrella Corporation and its waves and waves of armed guards. It began looking like a cheap rip-off of the Matrix trilogy from years gone by. Even their new Umbrella Corp. ""bad guy"" seems to be invincible like the Agents in the Matrix.The Zombies themselves (although true to the game) have taken on a new squid faced appearance turning their looks into something more like a bastard child of Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean) apposed to a traditional Zombie.If you are looking for a true representation of the video game you'll probably be pleased with this movie, but if you are looking for a great Zombie flick you just might end up being as disappointed as I was.I guess I'll have to wait for World War Z for my next Zombie fix... I just hope it turns out better than Afterlife did.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie was like watching a train wreck,"Before I begin I'd like to preface this review with some background on my taste in movies. It isn't sophisticated, it isn't special, it's actually pretty average. I enjoy action films just as much as the next guy. Sit me down in front of a mediocre action film like Wanted, Ninja Assassin, Death Race, or Crank 2 and I'll enjoy killing a couple of hours without a single complaint. Do they have flaws? Sure. Do they have occasional stereotypes? Of course. Are the stories that great? Of course not. But that's all beside the point, the movies are all meant to be enjoyed for the carnage that people enjoy in any action film.Having said that, I'd like to talk about Resident Evil: Afterlife. This movie absorbs every bad stereotype from every bad action movie ever and mashes it all together into one. Scenes that make no sense (a totally normal human being walking away from a plane crashing into a mountain at hundreds of miles an hour), fighting that blatantly rips off other movies (the opening fight scene looked like a recreation of the lobby fight in The Matrix), and insanely stupid transitions between scenes (Claire magically has showered, put on makeup, and found clothing before they get in the plane?).There is so much wrong with this movie I cant even fully explain it words. Please don't go see this movie. And if you enjoyed it, I truly truly pity you.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid Movie Worth Seeing,"Guys if your looking to see a carbon copy of the classic video game I think you should have realized by now that this isn't it. But it is one of the few series of movies that have been able to change the story around and still remain good. It is a great action film. Maybe because it was my first ever experience in an IMAX theater I am giving it an 8 but I highly recommend this film to anyone looking to be highly entertained. I think Milla Jovovich has proved herself to be a bona fide action star on top of that she is gorgeous. I actually think she is a better action star then most men right now. Can't think of any I'd rank in front of her. Action junkies, fans of the first 3 installments and people who love seeing hot chicks will love this movie. The movie may make you jump a couple of times but nothing too scary or disgusting quite simply put it's Action all the way. The movie has it's draw backs there is 0 character development and you are expected to know who Alice is going in. The other characters are really just there for Alice to have someone to interact with and for the zombies to have someone to kill. Unless you've played the game you won't realize that Shawn Roberts is supposed to be Albert Wesker, who by the way, looks EXACTLY like Albert Weker from the game. This will leave you wondering as to who this man and your left assuming that Alice simply has a personal issue with Umbrella which he is part of. I'd see the 1st 3 installments before seeing this movie. But even if you don't you'll have fun it's not that intricate of a plot where you'll even really care. By the way you'll see a part where Ali Later is all dirty then suddenly she appears on the plane gorgeous with make up and lipstick. Honestly while her character development is very weak she does compliment Mila Jovovich. The characters of Clair Redfield, Alice K-Mart and Luther West all compliment each other well could have done without Mr. Prison Breaks character, Chris Redfield, who always seems to play the same character nonetheless it's a really good movie worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Completely Lives upto it's Expectations!!,"If you are a fan of trilogy, you shall not be disappointed. This movie completely lives up to it's expectations. Honestly I don't think 3D was necessary but still it was a great add on. They introduce a new star cast who were familiar from TV shows etc. and they also did a great job. Also don't storm out of theaters right after the credits, stay for few minutes and see a MAJOR clue. Milla Jovovich yet again surprises us with her charismatic hardcore action. I cannot imagine anyone else for the role of Alice besides her. Ali Larter didn't had a major role but she also kicked butt! And offcourse if you like Zombies, this one has more than the previous parts. The soundtracks of the movie were breath-taking. They literally gave me goosebumps! I'm just not happy that it wasn't long enough. I was hoping for it to be at least 120mins but it was instead 90mins but I guess they are saving it for the next chapter.

"Worst screen-play, but finally Albert Wesker is the big boss:)","The visual effect was pretty good, I really enjoyed! There were a lot of idea from Resident Evil 5 (video game) like the characters, the huge zombie with the blade-hammer, and Albert Wesker was the same as we saw him in the game (abilities, clothes, skin). But the screen-play was awful, the plots just putted together without any concept. It's a pity because this film could be a very good one, but not this way. I have no idea why don't use the game storyline in this movie... And Mr. Scofield as Chris Redfield, well it was funny to me:)So the visual effect was good, but the 3D was nothing extraordinary...

Paul Anderson shows again he can turn Pure Gold into Feces!,"The so called Resident Evil movies are mislabeled, they're not Resident Evil, they're just generic zombie movies with Resident Evil slapped across the title, I still don't understand how Capcom allowed the movies to carry the popular Resident Evil name, they never stick to the story, it has an amazing number of errors which include 98% of the movie being not true to the actual story found in the games.In a Nutshell, disappointing. The movie was made into a damn action film all over, there's no suspense just incredibly cheesy action scenes and weak tension, this is where I say Paul Anderson is an absolute idiot.The people who like the movie series have obviously never played the game or they have played the game but never got around knowing the story well, if you did you wouldn't be asking yourself throughout the movie ""what the hell am I watching?!"" I give it a 1/10 mainly because it doesn't stick to the real story AT ALL, there's ZERO suspense, too many cheesy action and effects **I can't emphasize more how cheesy this movie is** and last but not least it's not a survival horror movie, it's just a stupid action movie with zombies in it... quite frankly Night of the Living Dead deserves more to be called Resident Evil.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Milla Jovovich continues her battle with zombies,"Easily it will be ridiculous to expect 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' to be anything more than the other films in terms of quality. Here the zombies have mutated into nameless monsters and our heroine, Alice (Milla Jovovich) once again finds herself as a sole warrior battling them until she finds Claire (Ali Larter) in circumstances different from when she last saw her. Together the two find a few other survivors but the zombie population has expanded exponentially and there is only one escape. I enjoyed Resident Evil: Afterlife' more than the third one. The fight sequences are fun to watch (even though they're nothing new) and the mutated monsters are a refreshing addition. Jovovich is obviously very comfortable playing Alice and she is supported well by Ali Larter. I'm not saying they gave phenomenal performance but rather they do the best one could do with such roles in such films. The special effects are good and this one has more energy than its prequels. It's popcorn fun and I can imagine it's more entertaining in 3D.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not Bad,"Resident Evil: Afterlife is not going to be considered one of the greatest movies of our time, nor would it be considered very good. RE is an average film that has been made more palatable by the 3D camera. While the acting, the story and the direction are all equivalent to a straight to DVD movie, the 3D effects make is surprisingly entertaining to watch in the theater. The story is so full of holes and bad dialog that you have to be able to ignore all of that and allow yourself to be engrossed into the 3D effects upon the screen. The 3D looks marvelous and the camera makes the film come to life. One thing that is highly irritating about the entire Resident Evil series is the consistent effort by one corporation to destroy all of mankind. Let us be real folks--people want power to have women (or men), money, to enjoy and have things others do not have, to have the finer things in life and to have control over others. If the world is gone--if everyone is dead---if there is no money--then every single survivor in essence is in power--but power that is not desired. That consistent drive to kill everyone by Umbrella is just stupid and annoying.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The worst movie I've seen in 2010 so far...,"I'm not sure where to start when it comes to ""Resident Evil : Afterlife"", I went into this film totally unaware what it was about beyond it was the next Resident Evil film, I had avoided trailers and spoilers and sneak peeks successfully hoping that it would be a solid addition to the franchise, but at the same time was worried it would be more of what the third one served up, to my surprise the situation was much more dire as this is hands down the worse movie of the franchise thus far.""Resident Evil : Afterlife"" moves at such a slow and uninteresting pace that by the time you even see a ""zombie"" you are half asleep and wondering if you have been duped into a zombie less world. Don't fret this is not the case there are in fact billions and billions of flesh eating horde roaming the streets of the world, but you won't get to see many of them because the only time their interjected into the main story arch is when they need to dispose of a unneeded character, always in a sudden and unimaginative fashion and to the shock of myself with very little gore, but I will go into that later on in this review.The story felt thrown together and just void of any effort, with so many cases of ""six months later"","" 2 years later"" etc it's hard to figure out the time-line during the first watch. And the ending felt so tacked on I started to have flashbacks from the ""House of The Dead"" film as quality comparison.Where the f*#k was the gore? Honestly the only real gore you see is when it comes to dispatching various umbrella baddies, most of the time when anything interesting occurs the camera cuts away and you are thrown away from the action into a new scene, very disappointing for any zombie fans out there hoping to see some people get eaten and such. The movie has a few nice special FX moments but not nearly enough to warrant seeing it, and to be fair some pretty awesome 3D scenes.The over use of slow-mo, freeze frame, and bullet time made the movie feel like it would of been a better 45 minute short to be released as fan service, I honestly felt like I had been tossed into a time machine and transported to when ""The Matrix"" was first released and everyone and their mom was using the bullet time and slow-mo gimmick in their action flicks.Over all I really disliked this film, from the bad use of outdated gimmicks, to the uninteresting disposable characters that felt like they were added in just so they could justify killing someone, to the sporadic time line the film attempts to create , it was all in all just a bad movie. My score on behalf of The Liberal Dead is a very weak and below average 3 out of 10 and award for most occurrences of ""jumping the shark"" I have witnessed in a single film to date.Ted Brown ""liberaldead.com""",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Neat, yet subtle","Though this series of Resident Evil did not hit the theaters, it's still watchable by all means. Umbrella is at it again with their schemes. The place called Arcadia was supposed to be a safe haven turned out to be a trap by Umbrella. Alice (Milla Jovovich) first takes on Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who would later rob her of her powers, and later crash land and find an amnesiac Claire (Ali Larter). The duo would later go to Los Angeles, ravaged. And would land in prison. With no guards, or inmates they and other survivors try their best to survive against the undead. One of them is a director would betray the bunch and head out to Arcadia: A large cargo ship which happens to be a front for Umbrella. In that ship, they would find survivors who ended up to be guinea pigs. Despite being neutralized by Wesker, Alice can still pack a punch. No one can really bring her down. This movie still can be hit, and not all sequels should be shown in the theaters. The action was not lost one single bit. Very subtle though, which kind of makes it home viewing wise.

"Action, Milla and Camp","It's the Fourth Wednesday with Resident Evil and at this point I have once again accepted my fate and am almost excited for some mindless blockbuster action. Also because I remember this one as one of my favorites,and not because of the story, as there barely is one, but because of some considerably cool action sequences, and, well, basically same old qualities and reasons. It's Milla helping another group of survivors. Full disclosure, almost the entirety of action is completely unrealistic and for maximum show, but that's okay, one must accept the terms. We come here to munch on popcorn. And see slow-mos. Proper miniboss fight too, the big ol' guy with an axe. Probably one of the most memorable sequences of ""Afterlife"", although that's not saying much. Cgi's Iffy at times, some scenes lesser perhaps in favor of other scenes having more budget, who knows, a lot of this looks awesome enough. Some of the sets are proper entertaining. Take everything with a grain of s..cheese.Milla Jovovich still goes at it with the same content energy, something that endures the whole franchise, Wentworth Miller portrays a prisoner, obviously, and Shawn Roberts's Albert Wesker (pretty much the biggest of characters from the games in the movie franchise) is borderline comical, but that does vibe with the general atmosphere. Paul W. S. Anderson seems (mostly) aware of what the franchise has turned out to be, though having said that, it doesn't get any better moving forward. If it was even more devoted to action and replaced the shallow plot melodrama with much more leaning on horror, or comedy and wit. Make it more fun and less typical.Personally, I'd say ""Afterlife"" is the third best movie in the series, after the first installment and ""Extinction"", for I, sadly, know what's coming in the next two weeks. Bottom point is, generally nothing changes in this franchise, same elements on varying quality. A campy line of blockbusters. My rating: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I feel compelled to warn others!,"I have never written a movie review before but this movie is sooo bad I felt compelled to take 10 minutes from my weekend to warn others I'm not expecting an Oscar wining movie when I go in to see a zombie flick.

With its MANY gaping plot holes and ridiculous decisions that the character make the movie seems more like a dimwit mixed guns, slow motion effects and then added ""3D"" to the title. And this is coming from a guy that likes machete and predator.I'm a fan of zombie movies but being a movie that is based on a zombie game this movie has the characters fighting zombies for a few minutes and the rest of the movie is the main character fighting soldiers dressed in swat uniforms.The movie does not advance the plot in any way. When the last movie ended her new target is the leader of umbrella, when the movie ends she has not managed to kill him and the only difference is that she does not have super human powers but the head of umbrella does.AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.

An Action-packed Thrill-Ride From Start to Finish,"I loved the first Resident Evil film & consider that one the best of the franchise, & i didn't really enjoy the other sequels that much but recently re-watching them I've decided each entry is good in their own way, well i don't like ""Retribution"" because it drops two of the best characters (Chris & Claire Redfield) as after the Awesome ""Afterlife"" those two are never heard of again? WHY? Where did they go? They were right there at the end of Afterlife!!! Plus Ali Larter & Wentworth Miller were excellent in their roles & was the best part of Afterlife. The two sequels after Afterlife are pointless to me & silly.I gotta say i Don't like the ""MATRIX"" style slow-mo action & bullet time, it's been done to death!!! But Director Paul Anderson seems to be in love with The Matrix.I really wish he didnt slow-mo all the action scenes, because it would've been better more frantic & gritty & there for more dangerous. The special FX are excellent & the scale of the film does feel Apocalyptic & epic. Having a small group of survivors band together in a closed-in section does have that old school Carpenter feel & i love that. Afterlife has the feel of a B-movie but with a big budget & crams itself with action sequences after action sequences but its all totally enjoyable zombie shooting entertainment. Visually the movie is excellent with it's grim Apocalyptic scenes & the slick sci-fi look & creature FX, all excellent.There's no denying that Milla Jovovich isn't a fantastic action star & is excellent as Alice in all the movies & is great here in Afterlife.This time Alice is searching for a safe haven called Arcadia, she follows it's signal to the Apocalyptic city once known as Los Angeles. We get an awesome look at a well designed, destroyed Hollywood & downtown LA, it looks fantastic. Alice lands her two person plane on top of a huge building which happens to be a prison.We get a decent group of survivors including the beautiful Ali Larter (House on Haunted Hill, Final Destination 2) back as Claire Redfield (also starred in Resident Evil: Extinction) & we have the intense looking Wentworth Miller (Prison Break, The Loft) as Chris Redfield, brother of Claire, & is a combat soldier type & yes he's pretty much completely different from the game version but that's fine. This Chris is Wentworth's version & he's damn good. Miller plays a much more believable & realistic Chris Redfield, as this one doesn't look like a wrestler in a tight uniform lol!!! Miller isn't a ripped-to-shreds meathead but instead a more grounded human soldier instead of a comic book looking super hero. Basically, Miller is the best version of the character.I just wish he got to do more action stuff & a bigger part but hey, just having Wentworth Miller in the ensemble cast is good enough, he's a fine actor with an intensity to him & this brooding serious hero role suits him & he was my favourite in the movie. The rest are throwaway characters or zombie meat.Apart from the silly slow-mo Matrix stuff, Afterlife is a pretty good action-packed Sci-fi Horror B-movie.I loved the big mutant zombie thing with that huge terrifying axe & it's fight scene...but again too much slow-mo again.The look of the destroyed city is very impressive & all the thousands of grungy looking zombies that's surrounding the prison base look awesome. I liked the trapped setting of the prison base whilst they are there but that's not long. There's some great ideas, settings & scenes but just not enough & way too much CGI everything & of course that Matrix crap. But there's no denying that Afterlife isn't an all out action-packed thrill-ride from to start to finish!!! Bullets keep flying & the action set pieces keep coming like the undead. I would say Afterlife is more an action sci-fi flick more than anything else, yes the zombie carnage is obviously still there but there's nothing realistic to be scary in that department, it's all kick-ass everything but it's so entertaining. Afterlife is a fun late-night flick that's never boring.Afterlife is a big budget B-movie that's full of style & non-stop action scenes & it's a fun thrill-ride, even if it's not perfect it's still one hell of a great late-night sci-fi Thriller.But overall, Afterlife is a fun Action-packed B-movie with sci-fi & Horror elements mixed in & a decent trio of stars with Jovovich, Larter & Miller.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I came away disappointed,"Decent movie, but in my opinion the worst of the series. It didn't really serve a purpose. It didn't really do anything for the series and nothing is explained. It starts off great but as the movie progresses it becomes clear that this movie has no story whatsoever. Nothing important happens. I loved the action sequence...s, special effects, and the acting by Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. But Wentworth Miller and Shawn Roberts who plays Albert Wesker are just awful. Spencer Locke(Couger Town, Resident Evil 3) just doesn't have enough screen time to show her potential. It's nice to finally see Boris Kodjoe on the big screen instead of a straight to DVD movie like StarShip Troopers 3. He was the best actor in ST3. Out of all Paul W.S. Anderson's movies this is his worst. This movie had potential to be good but I know there are a lot of people out there who hate is movies, but I personally enjoyed Event Horizon and Aliens Vs Predator. All in all I was excited to see this and had high hopes for it but it left me disappointed. I don't want to spoil anything but there will be a sequel which I HOPE will be better and actually have a story.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favorite since the original.,"Four films into the franchise and the series keeps getting better. Paul WS Anderson is back in the director's chair. 'Afterlife' boasts stunning photography, incredible slow motion capture, stunning visuals, good acting, and a stunningly powerful score by Tomandandy. The opening sequence is impressive, although maybe too much killing of humans.In 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' Alice continues her journey to Alaska - responding to messages heard in 'Resident Evil: Extinction'. However, once she arrives there, she soon realizes everything is not as promising as the messages had indicated, and soon finds herself surrounded by zombies. The film mainly revolves around Alice and a handful of survivors trapped inside a huge, towering building, with hordes of zombies dying to get in! (Ha-ha, notice the irony?).We're introduced to new characters. We have new heroes Luther (Boris Kodjoe) and Chris (Wentworth Miller), and two new antagonists Bennett (Kim Coates) and Wesker (Shawn Roberts). Boris Kodjoe is oh-so-sexy (!!) while Shawn Roberts makes a ruthless and determined villain.The dead have mutated into hideous creatures and are no longer just plain old zombies. The Axeman attack scene is sensational, with some of the most impressive slow motion photography ever seen, complemented by Tomandandy's score. This scene is INCREDIBLE! The visuals in these films keeps getting better and better. 'Afterlife' offers loads of action, adventure and gore.'Resident Evil: Afterlife' is my favorite in the series since the original. This was also the highest grossing film in the series until it was overtaken by 'Resident Evil 6: The Final Chapter'.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An unconfirmed joke,"Resident Evil Afterlife is a 3D holiday ride, but it suffers from some serious problems especially like Apocalypse. Firstly, the battle between zombies and Alice's team is not the center of the story (we see them in two three scenes maximum) Secondly, I had not expected Shakespearan dialogs, character studies, a Kubrick-like direction or Tarantino-like camera work, but like the other sequels, cinematically, all we have are showy shots and showy slow motions. Really doesn't entertainment cinema need masterful story telling? artistic styles? developed characters and powerful scripts? If you expect more than entertainment (for example a well written script or well direction), keep your expectations very low. Paul W.S. Anderson has potential, he can do much more! (despite he disappointed some of his fans by Alien vs. Predator) In the fourth sequel, he takes the helm, he is back as the director, but this time, he is not different from the directors of the previous sequels. Thirdly, haven't the trend of The Matrix passed already? The opening sequence is like an imitation of The Matrix trilogy and there is even a Agent Smith like guy with sun glasses who is able to dodge the bullets which leave trace in the air! Can there be a bigger joke than this? By the way, more than one Alice was not a good idea, if you ask me, but the movie leaves that at the beginning luckily. This is not a R rated zombie movie (7+), so it is mildly bloody and mildly violent. May be that's why the movie's focus is not zombie human combat, instead, we watch some Matrix-like action! It is weird that the first movie is not liked even by some fans, but The first Resident Evil was subtle, simple and solid (direction and script both) Some scenes were unforgettable, remarkable, the atmosphere and make up were effective, but Anderson does not do it again. The main villain is like another ridiculous joke, in fact, it was like one of the things (difficulties) that confronts Alice rather than a real villain. Were the mutant dogs again necessary?, what was the point of those experimental people? In all the sequels, there is a guy who turns into a disgusting monster etc. The best scene of the movie personally was the scene with the giant hatchet, but also it was the most meaningless scene of the movie, who is that executioner-like thing? he works for who? what is the aim of him? Except the opening sequence, almost till the second half, I can say that there is no action, but this does not mean boring. It is a great pleasure to see Milla Jovovich as Alice on the screen again, one of my favorite actresses, I am not a 3D expert, but 3D was completely satisfying (despite I closed my eyes at the attacking dog moments) but no more than that, but it seems that children, some teens and the incorrigible fans will love this movie too.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Afterlife Begins With a Bang,"I recently got a chance to watch Resident Evil: Afterlife with a couple of friends at a local theatre. The first three movies didn't give me that much to expect for the fourth installment, either way, I was very excited. I came out completely blown away. It was high octane thrilling action at its best.Some movies (e.g. Airbender) used the magic of 3D to great waste. But to tell you, Resident Evil 4 was absolutely amazing in 3D and surround sound. Never before had I got to witness Milla Jovovich blowing zombies away in 3D. It was a whole new experience and the first of its genre to be in 3D. I thought it was used amazingly.There were many jump scares which I didn't mind, the 4 mouthed zombie's looked awesome and the normal zombie's look also very freaky in 3D as well as the Axeman whose feet shaked the very floor of the theater. But the best scene for me was definitely the final battle with Wesker, complete with suspenseful rock music accompanied in which accompanied the epic battle. We've been waiting for almost 3 movies to see his head blown out into bits by Jovovich. I'll leave you to see yourself if he makes it out alive.Overall it was a great movie, not for kids, so do yourself a wonderful favour, run to your local theater and buy yourself a ticket for Resident Evil: Afterlife in 3D.P.S. Stay a few minutes into the credits. Video game fans wont be disappointed",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than expected!,"Surprisingly, Resident Evil: Afterlife appears to be thus far the best action movie of 2010. Possibly because I wasn't expecting much after the blatant Matrix rip-off-fest that was the trailer.There is an actual storyline (I won't spoil it for anyone) which isn't half bad... and that's saying a lot for an action movie!!! Typically, I don't expect anything when going to watch an action movie, so take this into consideration when raising an eyebrow at my ""not half bad"" comment.Cast-wise; no complaints whatsoever. Then again, not many guys would complain when the cast includes Milla Jovovich and throws in Ali Larter. Wentworth Miller showing up in the context of the movie made me /facepalm while I heard whispers of ""Prison Break"" and sniggering from various other movie-goers around me.Action; this is where the Resident Evil franchise has always been top-notch and it doesn't disappoint this time either.Overall, I'd give it a 6/10. Minus 1 point for stretching the Resident Evil movies just a little too much...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why 3D?,"I have seen all the Resident Evil movies and I must say, I love them. I am, however very disappointed that they made this movie in 3D. I have had may friends explain movies to me because I cannot see them. I have epilepsy and cannot see 3D movies for fear that I may cause panic for other moviegoers. Would you like to be in a theater and see someone have a fit and ruin the movie for you? I didn't think so. This 3D craze has ruined the theater experience for me, and my husband and I go to the theater often. I have seen 3D movies in 2D and the quality is terrible. I know I am in the 1% of people effected by this, but I see a ton of movies, and that list, I fear, is shrinking. I hate to think that all movies will soon be in 3D and I'll be left out in the cold.",,Anonymous,Horror
Should only watch if you are a fan of the series,"I am a fan of the video games series, and I really enjoy watching this movie. Most of the enjoyment, however, comes from the anticipation and seeing how elements in the games are incorporated into the scenes, and I am very satisfied in this aspect, except for Wesker. I also like the dark, mansion-like, claustrophobic feel that was the first twenty minutes or so of the film, which brought back some good memory of playing the playstation classics.But if you are not a fan of the series, game or movie, then this movie is not worth the $15 ticket. First of all, this is an action movie, not a horror movie. There are zombies/monsters, but other than some suspenseful moments at the beginning, there aren't no scares at all, and the actions are quite dull.The fighting scenes are mediocre, and while there is lots of shootings, there is not enough variety of guns/firepower, which should be expected from a Resident Evil title, especially that which has a lots of elements from the game RE5. I'm also quite disappointed to see supposedly powerful bio-engineered monsters taken down with only a few shots from conventional weapons.Plotwise, this movie has no plot, and no character development. Chris Redfield seems to appear out of nowhere, with no apparent role in the plot, probably just to please the fans. I also find this movie racist toward the Asians.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Is What I Call a REAL 3D FILM!,"""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is the only film which has 3D version worth to be experienced since 2009's ""Avatar"". After ""Avatar"", the other 3D films didn't have satisfying 3D effects on them such as ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""The Last Airbender"". The 3D effects were just not visible at all like it's the same as 2D only with higher price. The animated films however did have better 3D effects but were still average. But, ""Afterlife"" is different and the 3D is really real. I have to tell you, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" has to be experienced in 3D.Don't expect award-winning acting performances and a great storyline. Just expect some fighting actions with great 3D effects. If you set your expectations in an average level, you'll be surprised, but don't put expectations too high like what you'll put for ""Inception"" or something. If it hadn't been released in 3D, I wouldn't be bothering to watch it so 3D is the main reason why I went to see this movie.The story is very simple for this movie. It's just Alice trying to find uninfected humans who have survived in the whole world. So, the story is just plain. Nothing to be proud of.So, if the story sucked, why did it receive a score of 7 stars?The 3D rocked. Bullets shot really went out of the screen and made the movie looked spectacular. With many action scenes, the movie becomes enjoyable and truly, a memorable 3D film. I know the previous films were awful but this one is just damn great. Just cool.Tips if you want to enjoy this film: 1. Don't think about the story, the script or the acting. 2. Don't take your 3D glasses off. 3. Experience the Action Scenes in Amazing 3D!Do yourself a favor in watching the first real 3D experience in theaters since ""Avatar"". Even though it looks horrible, trust me, it's not as bad as it looks. 7 stars for the combination of breathtaking action scenes and great 3D effects. Just follow the 3 simple tips above and you'll have a fun time watching this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Big, Stupid, Action Packed Zombie Movie","Now, don't take my review title the wrong way. Big and stupid aren't necessarily bad things if you find that entertaining. I happen to find some big, stupid movies entertaining. This was one of em. Once again directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, this film is the second best in the series right behind the first film (possibly even the best), if only because the action was so kick ass.The film once again picks up where we left off. Alice is still hunting down Umbrella, while Claire has gone off to find the source of the signal heard in Resident Evil: Extinction. However, not everything is as it seems, and it seems Umbrella still has a plan of action.At this point in the series, if you're expecting anything more than an action packed, dumb zombie film devoid of scares, you've either stopped watching the film or are fairly low in the intelligence department yourself. This film is full plot holes, questions, and coincidences. Overall, the film is pretty ho-hum. The story is straight forward and of little consequence, and the disappointing ending once again leaves the series open, doing away with the promise for the film series' finale. But, with all that said, I regret nothing. The action was highly entertaining, the acting was actually pretty good (as far as this series goes anyway), and the RE fan service will bring a smile to RE fans faces.The 3D is actually pretty good here, with some notably impressive effects, including a bunch of water effects. The shower room scene is simply fantastic in 3D. Anderson brings his Mortal Kombat A-game here with the action scenes being very well shot and a blast to watch. I won't lie and tell you that this film really goes any farther beyond that. For those that have seen ever RE movie in theaters, this is the film that we had hoped the sequel to the original would have been. Suffice to say, Anderson really is the only one who can handle it the way it should have been done after the first one. The music here is also fairly decent, with a nice soundtrack I will definitely have to track down. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it is pretty cool.Obviously, this film isn't a great one. It's the fourth film in a series that has degraded in quality over its course. Heck, it never really won anyone over to begin with. However, my expectations were pretty low to begin with. The prospect of Anderson returning, this being the final film in the series, and the impressive trailers all encouraged me to see this one final RE film. I can certainly say I wasn't disappointed, as I got just a little more than what I expected. I probably won't be seeing the film again (except maybe on TV), but, for what I saw, I can say that I don't regret seeing it in theater. And if you're going to watch the movie to begin with, you really do have to see it in 3D. It's surprisingly some of the best 3D I have seen yet (and no wonder, with them using Jim Cameron's 3D camera technology. No post conversion doo- doo here).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Paul Anderson dumps another steamer on your face.,"First and foremost, how does this guy keep getting to direct movies? I would first suggest taking a browse through what he had directed previously. Go on, this review will still be here....Finished looking? Impressed with his movies that flopped harder than someone having a seizure?Now after you're done looking at his classic hits such as ""Deathrace"" ""AvP"" and the classic ""Mortal Kombat"" and thought ""hey those were good... alright at least decent movies"" please skip over this review because your intellect may not be capable of comprehending this review, and by all means go see this movie since you're most likely catatonic.So finally we get to the movie, undeniably I am a gamer, and Resident Evil fan, but also an avid horror and action movie buff. This movie fails on all those categories, and leads me to believe Mr. Anderson also rode the short bus to school, although not in full blown retard gear. Now if you are remotely expecting any of those, what-so-ever make note, any sense of ""horror"" is completely non-existent, the action scenes you can count on 3 fingers, and lastly the way he completely makes a farce of game tie-ins will make every single RE fan explode with nerd rage.If you haven't seen the trailer already, I would highly suggest watching it, just for Milla Jovovich, and her horribly acted and edited in ""clones"". It's like the director told her before filming ""No Milla, you only get paid once, your clones don't get paid as well"" since her disappointment and willingness to act certainly shows.In closing, I can only highly suggest skipping this, saving your money, and hoping Paul Anderson stops making horrible game to movie tie-ins.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It's not very original, but it's still so much fun","Resident Evil: Afterlife is the 4th instalment of the Resident Evil series. Milla Jovovich goes back to do what she does best: kick ass.With a new villain, new location and a big man with a big axe, RE4 sees Alice trying to find Arcadia, the so called last safe haven for survivors of the T-virus. She finds her old ally Claire from the 3rd film, who has lost her memory, and together they meet up with a new group of survivors trying to get to Arcadia. Easier said than done when they're all surrounded by the undead.Jovovich and Ali Larter do well as the leading ladies of action, but Shawn Roberts is basically just channeling The Matrix's Agent Smith as the villain Wesker, from the voice right down to the sunglasses. He comes off looking like a video game character all right. Prison Break's Wentworth Miller does alright as Claire's brother Chris, but still sounds like Michael Scofield, as always.Roberts isn't the only thing here that reminds me of The Matrix, all the slow mo action sequences just screams of it too. But you know, it just works very well. To his credit, Paul W.S. Anderson doesn't pretend to make a cerebral action horror flick, he just gives what his audiences want: a bloody good time. You want blood, gore, monsters and Alice looking awesome? They're all here.The familiarity of it all might annoy you at first, but after a while you'll feel comfy and end up getting a real kick out of this.Bring on RE5!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
gives you what you'd expect,"The undead won't be denied in this now fourth installment of the Resident Evil series. The world as mankind once knew it no longer exists, and with the exception of a few resilient survivors all humans have mutated into deadly, flesh-eating zombies. Alice is a resourceful survivor and hardened warrior who battles against the reprehensible Umbrella Corporation, but before she can lead a definitive strike she has to locate the remaining survivors and Earth's last bit of infection-free haven. The series formula is strained, to say the least, but the film makes effective use of its violent, in-your-face 3-D action scenes, anchored by the scrappy, always reliable Jovovich in the lead. Offers some fun when you don't think about it too much, there just isn't much of a story to tell. A good way to pass the time for RE completists, others needn't bother. **",,Anonymous,Horror
A total waste of money,"A terrible movie... There was no storyline, and not enough Zombie fighting to cover for it. Usually when making Zombie Movies, its either a good plot or lots of zombie killing, the plot was boring and there was only one good zombie fight.

Afterlife is Hell,"Paul WS Anderson returns to his franchise baby with a new toy. Amazing stereoscopic 3D the likes of which was used in AVATAR. And like any kid with a new toy, he goes overboard sacrificing all substance for all style. The silly excuse for a story begins immediately after Resident Evil Extinction left off. If the movie was truly a video game, Alice would be that idiotic hacker who got her hands on every single cheat code. She got ""GODMODE"", ""AIMBOT"", ""/KILLALL"" and even a cheat for ""Ally NPC Spawn"". For the benefit of non=gamers, this just means that Alice gots superpowers and gots a super-powered clone army too. Within the opening minutes, Alice and clones stage a daring incursion into the Tokyo facility of Umbrella corporation, causing chaos and ultimately facing down the T-virus powered chairman, Wesker. The writer, also Paul WS Anderson, must have known by now how quickly the movie would be over since Alice could just pop the guy's head like she did in Resident evil Apocalypse. So through some stupidly convenient plot device, Alice is superhuman no more and all her clones are gone. Now on the run, she proceeds to Alaska in the hopes of reaching the last safe haven where her friends fled to, a place named ""Arcadia"".The mystery thickens when all she discovers is an empty landing field and a deranged Claire Redfield (Ali Karter) under the control of some weird biomechanical device. After saving Claire, the duo proceed to Los Angeles where they encounter another group of survivors holed up in a prison. With zombies all around and a new dangerous giant axe/hammer wielding threat heading their way, Alice, Claire and the survivors must find a way out ASAP. Their last hope may rest with a prisoner named Chris.It all sounds a lot better than it turned out. Story-wise, it is a very standard action movie narrative with maybe only one good twist. Though the resident evil films have always been light on story, this one is possible the lightest. The characters are the main problem. Anyone who is not Alice is relegated to being a one-dimensional stock character common in zombie apocalypse movies. You have a conniving a55-hole in a business suit, the damsel, the rough-n-tough soldier, the big strong African American guy and a token Asian dude with no attempt made to make the audience care whether they live or die. Claire Redfield takes over the role of amnesiac from Alice's initial appearance in the first movie, who slowly regains her memory and conveniently reveals the plot. None of them are given any development at all. Even the main character of Alice manages to be both uninteresting and underdeveloped; getting no emotional closure after four movies.Paul WS Anderson, the baby with the 3D, must have spent so much time making his wife look good on screen that he forgot not only to write a good story but to direct good action. He blatantly rips off The Matrix trilogy, Dawn of the Dead, and possibly Ninja Assassin. And by ""blatantly"" it means lifting whole scenes to the point where it should usually be considered a copyright violation. Almost 90% of the combat scenes are in slow motion, easily reminding one of Uwe Boll's ""House of the Dead"", complete with painful over usage of 360 degree panning and other matrix bullet time effects. As a resident evil movie, Afterlife commits the worse crime possible by having little Zombie killing action. The very sci/fi-ish set up, the CGI cityscapes, lack of Zombies and Milla Jovovich doing Gun Kata makes this feel more like ""Ultraviolet 2"" than a Resident Evil film.Perhaps the one redeeming factors is how the franchise is trying its damnedest to move back on track with the games. There are numerous references especially to Resident Evil 5 and Code Veronica; the Executioner, Wesker's appearance, even that P30 bug thing just to name a few. Alice no longer dominates the screen as Game characters like Chris and Claire get their fair amount of time to shine. No doubt the fan-boys might be more pleased than usual about this. Oh yes, and there is Avatar-style 3D which just shows how weak the movie would be without this gimmick.Like a shambling zombie in the movie, Resident evil Afterlife now plods through the underworld. A sad Frankenstein's-monster pastiche of past action films with an erratic pace and a lack of good action. It has become Paul WS Anderson's vehicle to showcase his pretty little wife and his latest gimmick 3D toy to the world. Among the Resident evil movies, this one is has the least substance but the most style. No doubt the slick 3D action would please the millions of simple-minded adrenaline junkies. It would find warm reception too perhaps from fans who desire something closer to that of the games (compared to past movies), and maybe existing fans of the Resident evil movie franchise who know what to expect.With the promise of a sequel, one wonders how much lower can the franchise go now that its already all gone to hell. Well, At least it is a nice looking and entertaining Hell.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A subject that moves forward but steps back in mind, body and soul.","The problem I find with this fourth instalment of the Resident Evil franchise is that it seems to have by-passed any form of depth, while not expecting too much in the way of a story at least, this Afterlife addition has solely concentrated on its 3D gimmick to sell its point.There seems to be a trend of the visual over any hardcore narrative. What we have here is 3D overdrive enhancing the form and actions of Ms. Milla Jovovich, and it's as basic as that.The characters are the average one-dimensional throwaways that are placed on screen as walking clichés, adding too, that when it comes to any threat from this franchise's walking dead themselves they are no longer required to project tension or threat. These poor souls, too, no longer require top billing and it is they who are reliant on this latest technology rather than the 3-D needing the horror of the undead to keep the gravy train rolling.This, again, is not about the old days of walking dead horror but Alice's new image as 3D dolly bird and her quest to do slow-mo action and the old chestnut of bullet-time once again raises its ugly head. With this latest fad comes old ideas to exploit and it's all so tiring.All this and the nondescript script, too, that makes the fourth instalment a seemingly pointless exercise in the life of Alice and her wonderland. Her part in the franchise of the new technology of three-dimensional theatre is ever evident when the visual dimension supersedes the dimension of the three fundamental traits that make a good film: script, plot and narrative.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Review from a die-hard Resident Evil fan...,"Of the video games! I played every Resident Evil game, and more than once. I can honestly say that the reason I score this film so high is because I saw it in 3D. I was totally blown away by the technological aspects of this film! But; 3D aside, it was still a large production, and larger than all three films preceding it.Milla Jovovich is one of the best female action hero's ever. She is born for these roles, and also can act! Ali Larter was not as gripping and emotional in this film, but they still make a good team. I really think they are friends off=camera.Lets face it, the Resident Evil films were nothing like the video games. RE2 was probably the closest, because it was more of a horror film than Sci-fi. The games were like that, closer to horror with a touch of Sci-fi. Instead, the movies are the opposite, not excluding this 4th installment. I wonder...what does Resident evil have to do with the Matrix? or Equilibrium? Nothing if you ask me, but still, a rather impressive film nonetheless. Afterlife makes the effects in the Matrix feel like yesteryear. I actually had to take off my 3D glasses at times! Still, I would trade it all away for the nostalgia of the games, the Gothic and creepy sets; the Mystery; Umbrealla Corp and their motives; The scarcity of ammo; the psychological aspects of the Zombies, reading about what they were going through during transforming; and finally the soundtrack. I loved the Electronica soundtrack in this film but would gladly trade it away for the excellent creepy soundtracks of the video games.Fans of the games won't be too disappointed. I was a little, since it had no plot at all. It was just eye candy to me, but some pretty sweet candy at that! So if you like roller-coasters, then you will like Resident Evil : Afterlife.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Short Quick Review,"Good for the Friday night, a lot of time and effort went into this as you will be able to see from the very 1st scene.Pros: The usual amazing metal techno soundtrack, kick ass moves, no long boring scenes which take forever.Cons: Seemed to end abruptly when it seemed it should have had an extra 20 mins, slow motion scenes seem to appear too frequently and somehow spoil certain fight scenes.All in all, definitely go to see it if you are a fan of the series. If you have not seen previous instalments, it may be a little confusing, but will still enjoy it as the start explains the story very shortly.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyed it more that RE2 and RE3,"First off, to those who claim 3D was blurry or whatnot: Choose a good theater and have your glasses replaced as soon as you see that something is off, because I watched it on digital screen and the 3D was absolutely perfect and really crisp in our theater, I could make out tiniest details in every scene, so I really do not understand those complaints (maybe it's from cast of a rivaling 3D movie or something? :D).And now, to the point:I liked this movie a lot more than RE2 and even RE3 in some ways.I had to forgive it a few cheesy moments (bullets flying slower than they should in few scenes) and some a bit over-emotional acting on Jovovich part (especially the cam bits). That said, I am yet to see an actor make a good ""Imma gonna record myself on the cam now and be all emotional about my long lost friends and stuff"" footage. Any cam recording in any movie just seems unrealistic to me.Great over-all atmosphere, a few nice jump-scares, nice 3D and action (maybe a bit clichéd sometimes, but I personally had never seen those scenes in 3D, and it was fun to see the dust flying off the walls and empty shells and rubble fly towards you etc.) Sometimes it reminded me of the first movie. They even used a song from the second, which made me feel a bit nostalgic, since I really like the RE2 soundtrack (not the movie itself as much). Part 3 was just too ""wastelandy"" to me and it was good to see RE in it's natural habitat once again: a big city, lot's of zombies. Plus ""the stuff"": mutants, dogs, and a nice surprise (I cannot recall if it was shown in the trailers so I won't spoil him, but very nice fight scene).Tl,dr: 3D was ""Let me pull that knife out of my forehead and wipe that blood off my glasses... wow, look at those raindrops fall on her feet!"" perfect. Acting and story could be better, but I liked it in many ways more than parts 2 and even 3.Conclusion: For a RE fan - must see, especially if you liked the first one and did not like where parts 2 and 3 were going.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Huge Disappointment,"Absolutely hated it. I've played every game, followed the stories and I HATED the first three movies. I thought I might actually like this one but I was wrong . . . This movie is regurgitated Resident Evil 5. There are some parts that are literally taken from that game word for word and several sequences identical to the game. I spent almost the entire movie waiting for something exciting to happen and it never came. I suppose someone must've given them an infinite ammo code too. How many times did Alice fire her S&W 500 revolvers (a five shot revolver) without reloading? Maybe I'm being overly critical because I know a thing or two about guns and the people who made this film obviously knew NOTHING . . . I could go on and on about why I say that but I'll spare you. Probably what upset me the most was that they FINALLY put Chris Redfield in a movie and gave him a small sidekick role! Stop making these garbage movies and calling them Resident Evil!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
much better than its predecessors!!!!!,"Well i have always loved the resident evil game series. The first three movies were good but this was awesome. But sadly i didn't get to see it in 3D. The action sequences, zombies , the axeman ,the sets were all up to the mark.The story also attracted me coz it differed from the game . Then why i didn't give it a 10 ??? My only disappointment was that my favourite villain ALBERT WESKER had very little time to show off his superhuman abilities. The director could have added more of his fight sequences with ALICE. Also the ending rung the bells in my mind as if asking ""WHAT??? MORE IS YET TO COME"". ALL IN ALL a good entertainer a must watch in 3D.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a bad sequel to watch,"After watching some tragic sequel movies over the past years, this was one movie that I really liked. The movie isn't great, It starts of slow and ends slow. Nothing special happens but It's worth watching it. As a fan, I've watched all four of the movies and liked them. Maybe because I didn't allow myself to dislike it, but it's far better then some lame movies like Twilight receiving such high praise and achieving more money then a worth while movie like this. The action scenes aren't that bad either. The fight scenes start with a bang and ends with another bang. Milla's facial expression and her tone is the same through out the movies, she acts like a dead soul, but in the place she lives, I think that's just about right. I liked the movie, It was not bad at all. Thumb ups from me. Will hope for yet another sequel..",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An empty special effects flick,"I normally enjoy Paul W. Anderson movies, such as Event Horizon, Death Race and the earlier Resident Evil movies, even though I never played the game. There always was a certain touch to it, something that sticked with you. Like in Event Horizon where you really felt the fear in many occasions and then after the movie is done you can't stop thinking about you being in such a situation.Now this movie right here. It didn't have any effect on me at all. Why are all the people top models? Why is everyone wearing make-up when they've struggled to survive for years? Why is everyone tightly shaved, all the time? Why do gun's never go empty? The dialog is amazingly bad, full of cliché's like: ""Aahh a family reunion, how very touching"". Come on, you can't do that anymore. This is not the movie to whine about stuff being unrealistic, but it wasn't even tried. At some points I even felt the special effects were bad and completely fake-looking.The only reason I remember the movie after watching it, was because I felt disappointed in Paul W. Anderson creating such a bad action flick.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alice Is Still Alice. Enough Said.,"If you have not played the games and seen the previous films, go see something else.This is an episode in a series. A very stylish, visually appealing episode in a series. A series where favorite characters never die, they just get cloned again and again. A episode which takes off from last episode's cliff hanger and leaves off with a cliff hanger that will be continued in the next episode. An episode in which only one thing of great import happens, but it was something we knew would happen, something we wanted to happen. And no, I'm not going to say what it is, because if you are reading this, then you have seen all the previous episodes and you already know what the One Thing is.The only times this film----sorry, this episode dragged was when Alice was not on the screen.For those who compare it to a cut scene in a video game, cut scenes are awesome. When they work, they get you psyched up for game play by establishing a character and a conflict and then you get to take over.

Resident Evil in Matrix style: best action I've seen in years,"Milla Jovovich is back for the fourth installment of the series and this chapter is a whole lot better than the previous ones.I'm a huge fan of both games and movies so it was great to see that this movie was closer to the games.3D does its job and delivers the greatest action and fight sequences I've seen in years. The creators used slow motion and made RE:A look like Matrix in some scenes.All the actors tried their best to make characters believable.Milla Jovovich proves one more time that the role of Alice fits her the most and establishes herself as one of the biggest female action stars.Ali Larter plays Claire Redfield again and Wentworth Miller is her big brother Chris Redfield. I wish there had been more of them in the movie but the game fans will be pleased anyway to see them in action.However, the brightest star of this movie is Shawn Roberts. Every time he shows up on the screen as the main antagonist Albert Wesker he steals the scene. Wesker is sexy as hell and totally bad-ass, I can't think of anyone who could have played this character better.The only reason I gave this movie 9 is a bit disappointing ending - it leaves guessing what's going to happen next. On the other hand, it suggests that there will be fifth part and we can hope it's going to be even better than the fourth.All in all, this movie is a candy for both RE and action fans. The fight scenes will leave you amused. If you're going to see this film, do yourself a favor and see it in theater in 3D - that's the way it's meant to be seen. You won't regret it - the movie is worth the ticket price. And don't rush out of the cinema afterwords - if you stay a couple more minutes as the credits roll, you'll see the big twist.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Afterlife only half resurrected...,"OK I didn't see this in 3D so maybe seeing it in 3D would have given the film a bit of an edge. But I judge films based on their plot and entertainment and I can enjoy a film even if it isn't in 3D - I think that it is mainly just an incentive for you to like it even more. In my opinion, if a movie is horrible and its in 3D - it is simply that. A movie that is bad and in 3D.Now afterlife isn't a horrible movie. I enjoyed the first three, in particular the third, which I think the is the best of the three. Afterlife is simply more the same excuse to have big special effects and continue a plot that simply seems will never end with Umbrella continuing on forever in the next 'afterlife'.The monsters in this movie were good, but I think the zombies don't really play much of a part in the horror and are simply there just to add to the atmosphere. Also, I felt that near the end, it borrows too much from the Matrix and is really nothing original.I was also expecting more from the characters who appeared in the third film and they really aren't given much to do. Milla Jovovich is fine in her role but she simply is given the same mission over and over in all the films - save people and get them to safety. Honestly, how many times do you have to see this done in each Resident Evil movie? I'm not saying this isn't entertaining nor is it visually nice, but I think if they keep doing this over and over, it's gonna wear thin pretty soon. I'd wait for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Annoying ""Style"" Is Back","Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010)* 1/2 (out of 4)Alice (Milla Jovovich) leaves Alaska in a plane and ends up at Arcadia, a supposed safe haven but soon the remaining survivors there are wanting out when they realize something isn't quite right. The fourth film in the series had the original film's director Paul W.S. Anderson returning to the chair and bringing with him that incredibly annoying style that rips off THE MATRIX. It's clear that this style just isn't for me because I just don't feel a movie should be looking like a video game. The slow motion shots of seeing bullets fly through the air or 360 shots of a round kick to a zombie's head is nothing more than distracting to me. I understand Anderson has a good following but to me it just doesn't work and the opening sequence here just had me shaking my head and growing frustrated. The story to this entry isn't all that bad, although like the previous films it starts to run out of ideas and the finale really drags as we get into standard ""B"" movie action stuff. I thought the zombie designs were much better in this episode and we got some inventive kill scenes but this certainly didn't make up for the weak parts. As in the previous films, Jovovich is in fine form as she's very believable in the lead role. The supporting cast is also quite good but it's a shame no one involved got much to work with. RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE will probably entertain fans of the series but those such as myself will see it as another bad entry in a pretty weak series.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Dumb fun, with equal emphasis on both words","Alice takes her army of clones to make Wesker pay. If you don't already know what that means, don't expect this film to tell you. Anyway, after that, she finds herself in the same situation as the last three times: Trapped in the middle of somewhere, wanting to save everyone there with her. No, really, that is it. As far as the plot(which is swiss cheese, what else is new?) goes, I mean(and don't expect it to hold up, make sense, or explain much of anything). This is rather entertaining and is, occasionally, effective in getting us excited and the like, in fact, in those aspects, it's the best of the four. Heck, in nearly all regards it is, really. Action is cool(as are a few of the sets) and surprisingly fitting in amount; there is the occasional awkward pose or sequence, and slow-motion, whilst not always bad, is severely overused. Anderson can come up with nifty ideas, but not all of them are as good as he seems to think they are. Again, par for the course. He is getting better(I keep watching his flicks hoping that that will happen, and trying to figure out why he is allowed to write or direct), using his own horrid(like faking us out by establishing something only to abandon it, having chaos erupt out of calm, false tension, etc.) clichés less(with that said, this has a couple of Hollywood ones) and balancing things a little. The music is more appropriate and less noisy than the others. Costumes are well-done(the Cronenbergs are a talented family), with the Umbrella troops being faceless stormtroopers and the unbelievably hot Jovovich's(who doesn't get naked in this one, breaking the trend) outfit being the least silly since the original(in spite of the cut-off sleeves, similar to the pants-legs of the last one). The ninja-thing is enjoyable, and in general, if you liked the trailer(as I did), and you know that these are stupid, you may very well get into this(as I did). While this is still centered on her, Larter gets actual screen-time here. Michael Scofield joins, adding nothing other than a face-palming ""joke""(care to take one guess where we first see him?) and scowling(worse than in that show). Guillory as Jill only has a cameo. So, Exctintion was one big set-up to this. Does it live up to that? Not story-wise. Our lead loses her powers(she just barely used them!) almost immediately, albeit without her becoming particularly vulnerable. As sad as that is, honestly, at this point, it's probably too late to do otherwise. Maybe this should be the last one. I understand this is the one most based on the games(I've barely played any of them); it doesn't get the mood of them right(why start now? The original was eerie, the second was clearly inspired by RE2 and 3(without getting stuff right), that's the closest they ever got). There is zero character development. We don't care about any of the new ones(not that the old ones put us on any emotional rollercoasters). About half of the one-liners are average(the rest are below). Dialog is poor. Wesker speaks and moves just like Agent Smith, and that's not the only clear Matrix reference. This is shot with the tech of Avatar, and the 3D does indeed look nice, and it's used well and not excessively(...well, a little is), and this is something that it is made for. FX are well-done, if not stunning. The humor is OK; this got unintended laughs, as well. There are jump scares, and they work. This got and kept my adrenaline pumping, without my ever forgetting that it was simplistic. As horror should have, there is a moderate amount of blood, gore, disturbing content and strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone fan of the movie series, forgiving lovers of the video-games, and anyone who wants something to turn their brain off to and just kick back with. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing Too Amazing But You Get Your Money in 3D,"Okay, you all probably know the scenario now as Alice battles the undead and the Umbrella Corporation on a wasted post apocalypse earth. It starts out with a massive amount of CGI as Alice and clones storm the Tokyo HQ of U.C. The gals cut down swarms of Japanese guards with throwing stars, samurai swords, machine guns, bombs etc, all in state of the art CGI and 3 D with lot's of Matrix ripoff thrown in.Then the head honcho of U.C., Albert Wexler, all T-virused out with red eyes, shoots Alice up with the cure with a hypo in her neck, so Alice becomes human again in his VTOL escape plane. She thanks him for that, just before the plane crashes into the side of a mountain, you'd think they would have a better autopilot than that. That crash was frozen in space as everything inside the fuselage continued forward ala Newton's Law, but since Alice is now human, one would think she would have been crushed and burned, along with super Wexler.But in the next scene she is piloting a single engine plane over Alaska, no mean feat crossing the Pacific non stop, looking for Arcadia, the promised land from the last movie. No dice, instead of the promised land, she finds a runway full of empty planes and some doped up crazed Claire Redfield, almost a zombie due to some creepy mechanical spider full of some drug attached to her chest. So after Claire is subdued, they are back in that little plane, which seems to have unlimited range. and flying south to good old LA, which anyone would guess is the nexus of disaster as in every end of the world movie ever made. They land on top of an urban high rise prison full of various survivors in a daring rooftop, gravity & reality defying landing where they meet some fellow survivors.Okay, Arcadia is not a town, it is a ship, some huge cargo one, which happens to be in L.A. harbor but there is a horde of zombies separating the ""prisoners"" from ""safety"" I won't go on too much more except to say there is the usual stunts and laws of Physics defying tricks by Alice & Claire. Even though supposedly Alice lost all her super abilities, you'd never guess by her endless super stunts. Or her matched sawed off double barrel shotguns that she loads coins, bigger than the bore, to make them super guns.You get pretty much a bunch of cool special effects, the usual twists and characters you'd expect as well as an ending left open for the sequel.

REAL 3D Falls Short,"Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D Wait For DVD My Critical Perspective: D Personal Perspective: C- 20/100Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth installment in the film series Resident Evil based on the popular Video Game series with the same name. Similar to many sequels that have been released recently, Resident Evil director Paul W.S. Anderson decides to film it in 3D. For those who have not followed the film series or the video game, the following is a brief history of Resident Evil. The main character in the film series is a woman named Alice, played by Milla Jovovich. Alice used to be a security operative for a corrupt company called the Umbrella Corporation (a corporation developed both the T Virus and G Virus and perform various lab experiments) based in Raccoon City. Basically the company releases a deadly virus (T Virus) that spreads rapidly around the world and turns infected people into zombies. Therefore, Alice's overall goal is to destroy the Umbrella Corporation and prevent further infection to the world population. In Resident Evil: After Life Alice teams up with Claire Redfield (Played by Ali Larter) who at the end of the third film (Resident Evil Extinction) Travels to a ""so called"" safe zone known as Arcadia, but has lost her memory. Together they lead a small group in a quest to discover the secrets behind Arcadia and continue to hunt the Umbrella Corporation.The Good: First off, the film had the highest grossing opening weekend box office out of the four films in the series making 27,700,000 dollars. Second, Milla Jovovich is back with her portrayal of Alice and stays true to her character as she has throughout the series. Alice along with Claire and their fellow survivors provide the audience with some very entertaining mindless zombie killing action that has been seen throughout the series. The best part of the film is the opening credits. They are able to utilize 3D technology the best in the film with a sequence where the camera pans around various characters as the credits are revealed on the screen. This opening scene gives an overview of the atmosphere of the film without any dialogue and in a very simple way.The Bad: The time between each action sequence is very boring and lacks substance, good acting, a thoughtful dialogue and well thought out plot. The screenplay comes off as being forced together and put together in a rush. (Example: If the group of survivors needs a swimmer of course they have a high school swimming all-star.) The story is all over the place and is very confusing even if this isn't the first film you have seen in the series. Also, besides the 3D in the opening scene/credits the 3D is unnecessary and does not add to the movie at all. One example of this is a scene shown in the previews where the leader of the Umbrella Corporation takes his sunglasses off and throws them at the audience via 3D for no apparent reason at allFinal Thought: The subpar acting of Milla Jovovich along with various entertaining action sequences does not outweigh the poor scriptwriting, or the horrible acting of the supporting cast of this film. This film is just another sequel that was made for the sole reason of making money and is not worth the 3D ticket prices to see it in the theatres. Even Resident Evil fans should Wait For DVD to see this film.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

If you are above 15 years old and think you can critic movies a little bit DON'T watch this movie.,"I liked previous Resident Evil movies especially the first one. With great enthusiasm I went to theater, hoping to have a fun Friday night. But instead of that I ended up here and writing my first review for this unbelievably bad movie.Resident Evil: Afterlife doesn't have a bad opening scene, but after that this movie show everyone how a movie doesn't has to be. First this movie doesn't have a prologue nor a conclusion. All fight scenes are unrealistic, not looks good, and don't have spirit. Musics are terrible, they are all alike and only head bang you and ruin atmosphere. Acting is bad, really bad, I don't want to be so negative but they don't give me anything good to write here, sorry. Sense of humor can make you vomit. All scary scenes are cliché zombie boo scenes. Almost every visual effect makes you say ""that so much looks like computer made, this too, this too also,..."", come on modern games have better visual effects at these days... and if you look carefully you can see too many illogical things, but I don't want to write here and give spoilers. I kept directing to last, I can clearly say this, that was the worst directing I have ever seen in my life, I don't know whether the director did this on purpose or producers forced him but he ruined movie to take benefits of 3D experience. I think main idea must be ""lets make a good movie, then lets make it 3D"", not ""lets make something in 3D, OK lets make something like movie"", you understand my point I think.I'm really sad and disappointed for this movie, it is even worse than Alien vs. Predator 2 for me. I'm sure you can find something better to spend your money and time. If you are not really obsessed with 3D, I recommend you to stay away from this movie.

15 Bucks I Don't Want Back.  I Love America.,"More K-Mart. More K-Mart. MORE K-MART!I know: one model-slash-actress should be enough. Three female slashies plus four slashie guys verges on overkill. Watching skinny women (even adults) flip, flop and fly in leggings of their own design is great fun. But you throw in a teenager toward the end, and I get nostalgic for the days when Milla Jovovich wasn't quite so grown up. It's awful of me to say since, in her mid-thirties, she looks fabulous. Except she doesn't look twenty.Should I hate myself for admitting my opinion? Hey, it cuts both ways. I don't look as good as I used to either. And I never looked as good as Milla. But I digress.For what it is, a 4th-installment video-game spin-off 3D spectacle with less story, plot, or character than the slimmest of its forebears, it's a fine effort. Lots of shooting, stabbing, cutting, biting, crashing, yeah, yeah, yeah. ""Afterlife"" destroys Tokyo better than most Godzilla movies do. And while I think it's a mistake to top-load a Milla movie with multiple Millas and then spiral down to one, there are compensations. Watching people get blown apart with coin-loaded shotguns is better than, say, not watching that.To be fair, these movies do have one character, and (usually; definitely in this case) one actor who deserves the title. Milla's better than any other single factor in these things, though this time she has fewer opportunities to act than in the previous three; but that's okay, because the combined presence of Ali Larter and Wentworth Miller is nearly enough to stop me from paying to see any slashie act again, ever.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Poorly Done,"This installment has probably ended the Resident Evil series for good. There is absolutely nothing original or suspenseful here. The cast has no substance, and the most interesting part about Alice's character is removed in the beginning of the movie. Every turn in the movie is expected, and any intended excitement is directed at the wrong audience. Anderson basically took The Matrix, The Island and Resident Evil and combined them into one movie. I did however, love the use of A Perfect Circle's The Outsider remix for this movie. Oh man, it could have been so much better. Shawn Roberts and Milla Jovovich were very cool on the screen, but everyone else and the poor writing killed every scene. Oh, and if you are planning to see this movie in 3D, don't! The 3D glasses make it difficult to see, as most of the scenes are without much light, and the 3D effects are less than amazing. When the movie ended, I felt like I just watched a 10 minute commercial for the actual movie, and the only ones who seemed happy with it were fans of Boris Kodjoe. Save your money and wait for this one to come out on TV.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Also in this movie franchise.. a lot of times we are shown stuff that is explained a lot later.. maybe even two movies later. Like the Majinis and the Executioner, who show up in L.A. for no reason.. Maybe we'll find out in the fifth installment.Let me just say that i am a BIG fan of the RE games, especially 4 and 5, which have taken another direction with the storyline (for the better), but i also like the movies.

So I thing the whole Gang will be coming back . Yahhhh . Mila Jovovich is the best female Action actress after Angelina Jolie though Angie has proved her Action Heroin Status in different Action movies where as Milla is stuck to Resident Evil franchise only, but that's okay we still love her. Ali Larter is the second most important essence to the Resident Evil franchise and I loved her in T.V show Heroes though I still think her role was never shaped up the way it should have.

Played the video game from when it first came out. great video games, no question about that. watched the previous series and that's why I call myself well informed.

But I do expect the 3D would worth it since that's the point, right? a 3D version using the name of this series, is gonna attract fans no matter what crap they make.But, still, totally does not worth it. The storyline is moronic, the action is sort of cool for the first 5 mins? Too many useless trash taking most of the time and at 1 hour I realized the story has not spread out yet!!!! There could be some scaring moment, cheap ones, nothing you really can not expect. totally pointless movie and if there is anything I acquired from watching this one? 3D won't make a crap any better. and sadly, that's the 3 point I vote refers to.Don't watch it unless you really wanna see Alice in 3D.",,Anonymous,Horror
Braaains! We waaant braaains!,"Alice is trying to track a broadcast from some place called ""Arcadia"" which promises shelter and sanctuary from the T-virus and the zombified.

This is some guy so hopped up on T-virus that he's gone Matrix on everybody's ass. I swear, he acts like a refugee from the movie.My Impression: The movie was entertaining with impressive sets and visuals. I was never bored.Before I sign off I can't resist pointing out a curiosity about the shoes our heroine was wearing when she first makes her appearance (which was grand indeed). They kept alternating between heels and flats (I noticed 'cause I was giving her a good ogling). All I know is that pumps are a hindrance if you have some athletic ass-kicking to do since you need speed, balance, and coordination. It's as if the director couldn't decide whether or not our heroine should be sexy or practical. Practical means you have a brain in your head, so it's sexy. ---Or would you rather have a zombie?

Matrix-Wannabe!,"I can mention at least 10 similarities between thiz film and ""Matrix"" (1999)! Gun fighting Vs. a group of tactical team in a hallway, smashing into building window and firing back while it falls (with slow motion too!), bullet time technique when the villain Albert Wesker is avoiding the bullet, and even the villain character (Wesker himself) is Agent Smith look-alike! (Including the way he talks and body language) and many more. Terrible rip-off! Thiz game adaptation is a sequel of three previous movies, chronologically are ""Resident Evil"" (2002), ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" (2004) and ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" (2007). Paul W. S. Anderson takes back his command as Director. In my observation, Anderson is another ""Michael Bay"" type of mindless popcorn Director, who always delivers mind-blowing action with extra excessive situation and seems fully unrealistic, just like what he had shown before in ""Mortal Kombat"" (1995), ""AVP: Alien Vs. Predator"" (2004) and ""Death Race"" (2008).The brainless storyline follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) who continues to fight against Umbrella Corporation, which is now turning the world into zombieland. Like the tagline on the poster says, ""She's back and she's bringing a few of her friends"", the movie is featuring all of the original characters of game version such as Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) although she only appears as a Cameo in the ending scene. There is no such a thing called character development in thiz movie, everything is flat. It is 97 minutes with a series of slow motion sequences! One thing is for sure, on the movie like thiz you even do not have to worry during the film, because the main character will never die in any circumstances.

I lived in Toronto for 20 years or so and if I can't recognize a single building or location, then there is far too much green screen and CGI.When there is too many effects, little story and no logic, why make another one?Even if you change the lead cast...the story is still the same...as long as you have zombies and people that don't die...you can only go so far.This story won't end...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The 3D is very very neat. (Probably because they didn't converted it from 2D to 3D in post production). 2. For the 2nd & 3rd movies of the series, you may say the story was poor. But here you can't even say the story was pathetic because how can we use an adjective to describe something which is non-existent. If you ever wondered how can anyone make a movie without a story, watch this. 3. The fights and gore are less compared to the previous movies. 4. It feels more like watching someone play Resident Evil game rather than watching a movie. 5. The fans of the game would enjoy this immensely because the movie has some of the game's creatures. But if you didn't play the games & only like the movies, then this will be a definite disappointment. 6. There are a few good scares. A 30-something guy who sat beside me jumped at 2 or 3 occasions. 7. Milla is looking hot & younger as each movie progresses. 8. Overall acting & writing are not very stupid but the lack of story really hurts.On a final note, 1. If you like the Resident Evil game series, you may like the movie. 2. If you never played the games, but like the Resident Evil movie series, this movie will slightly disappoint you. 3. If you don't fall in the above 2 categories & if you don't like Milla Jovovich, please don't watch the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is that any way to treat a girl?,"A super-heroine's assault on an evil corporation is foiled, so she teams up with a desperate group of survivors to battle through a zombie horde and finish the job.Alice continues her quest for Arcadia in a decent addition to the series. The director delivers his usual excellent pace and action set pieces, and the lead actress is always perfect in her icy, fists-on-hips compassion. But the story is a bit diffuse, with too many locations and characters, plus enough gaps in the logic to take you out of the story. Did it need the second strong female? The giant axe-wielding zombie? Nope. And what's with the silver dollars - an appeal to survivalists?Overall, it rolls along with lots of flames and fury, and a few touches of humour, ending in a swirl of optimism and pessimism.

Probably the best in the franchise..... with eye-popping 3d.,"Resident Evil has been a successful franchise. But the movies themselves, were average at best. So I wasn't expecting anything new.Well, the movie is great. The plot was more like the game itself, unlike the past movies. The 3D is very good, shot with the Fusion Camera system. Many things fly at you, and it also has excellent depth.But unfortunately, the film is too focused on the action scenes and the 3d. This causes a flawed plot and new characters which we don't really care about.But I don't care. This movie looks stunning, is very fun, and it's a fun mindless action movie. Easily the best in the franchise.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the rest but not bad,"Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth film in the video game based franchise. This one is just as action-packed as the rest but my only gripe is the plot. While the Resident Evil film series is generally not seen as the most plot heavy series, this one makes the plots of the other entries in the series look complex. Besides that, its a great flick. To me this one reminds me the most of the video games and at certain points, I'm reminded of when I played Resident Evil 4 on the Gamecube. If you loved the other ones, you'll like this one. It's got hot babes in black, zombies, swords, guns, and action. What more could you ask for? (Jill Valentine)",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Worst Resident Evil,"Hey it's TVGuy3, and sadly this is the only movie I'll be reviewing this week, since my cousin said the Virginity Hit is a big steaming pile of trash. Anyway, I was a big fan of the Resident Evil franchise ever since it came out on PlayStation. The first movie was a great shocker, the second almost rivaling the first, and the third was showing signs of decline. Now with Afterlife, the fourth installment, I was just looking for a popcorn movie. And it is. But the first three all also functioned as real horror movies. This one is just slashing and shooting. Don't get me wrong, it's a really capable slashing and shooting and Milla Jovovich gives a great performance, but this movie honestly needed more plot. Or a new director. Paul W.S. Anderson is not a good director. Let's just get that out of the way. The thing the first three movies were lacking was good direction. Luckily, the script and the acting were good enough to scare us. But like I said before, the script and acting is just slashing and shooting, which makes the bad direction even more visible. If you're not a fan of the franchise, this is a good horror flick. But if you're a fan of the first three, don't waste your money and be disappointed. If you want slashing and shooting with a real plot, go see Machete. Not this.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil Franchise Rolls On...,"Resident Evil Afterlife continues directly after the events of the previous film with survivors looking for the supposed safe haven of Arcadia. Milla Jovovoich returns as Alice and is joined by Ali Larter and Wentworth Miller of Prison Break fame. Paul Anderson who directed the original Resident Evil returns and he ensures the film is well shot with great visuals in places. In truth Afterlife adds nothing new to the franchise but it does move at a relentless pace, albeit at the detriment of character development. Action scenes are well handled however the CGI in places looks a bit ropey and the film does generally feel like a bit of a B movie. Jovovich, Larter and Miller all give solid performances but elsewhere supporting cast members provide weak, hammy performances. Resident Evil Afterlife does what you expect of it and is a fun 90 minutes in a brainless sort of way, however ultimately this franchise is beginning to feel a little tired now.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Execrable nonsense,"RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE is the fourth RESIDENT EVIL movie I've watched and by far the worst of the lot. It's an execrable piece of nonsense, possibly the nadir of Paul W. S. Anderson's career, and that's saying something given the amount of dross this guy has turned out. It's clear that the only idea behind this sequel was to make more money from a semi-successful brand, because there's an entire dearth of ideas and imagination.Once again, the wooden and unlikeable Milla Jovovich plays Alice, a dull cartoon character who goes around shooting zombies in the head and performing various wirework-assisted stunts. The story is very slight, involving her teaming up with a group of survivors trying to get to safety, but when they find themselves trapped inside a building under siege it's predictable zombie film time. Things get sillier and sillier until the ridiculous climax, which has to be seen to be believed.Everything's poor about this film: the writing, the acting, the lunk-headed characters, that dialogue. The CGI effects are noticeably cheap-looking, and I'm glad I didn't see this in 3D as the effects looked poor too. Half the film seems to be ripped off from other stuff: those PREDATOR-mouthed monsters from BLADE 2, that giant axe-swinging guy from SILENT HILL. Needless to say this is a waste of time, even worse than the previous instalments.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Love Conquers,"Of course the story is vapid. That's what kids demand. But this has two things that appeal to me.One is the dimensionality of the thing. I saw it in three D and was very impressed. There is nothing new in terms of the effects. We have your zooming and your stuff coming out of the screen. We have slomo, bullet time and an impressive freeze and pan in the midst of a plane crash. Nothing new but extremely competent. The best equipment must have been used.Some sense was given to depth in the back. For instance, Milla lands a plane in Alaska and we see the foreground crisply and the plane out of focus in the distance. There are many scenes like this where even the CG is appropriately blurred or unfocused. It was thrill and competent. (A water scene must have been largely cut, because it seems unnecessary.)All the situations are ridiculous until you imagine that they must have been that way in order to have the sets and effects.The second thing that just makes me melt is when you have a filmmaker who is filming his lover. There is a tenderness and familiarity to this. Milla knows how to appear appealing, but Anderson does some particularly affecting cinematic caresses. Consider just the opening action scene where multiple Alices, all with superpowers, are attacking the evil group. (They call it a corporation, but there is no indication of corporate qualities.)Her gymnastics are more than what we need for kickass woman action; they are created out of imaginary Millas and imposed on her to make her seem more alluringly graceful than she really is. Some subtle changes in her shape are visible in the CG Alice, especially that superAlice we meet initially. Interestingly, Anderson teases us with his very first sequence where we see a woman's legs. We think they must be those of the starlet. They are — we later know — a quite different shape than Milla's legs, but identical to the ones we see on the simulacrum that follows. Those legs dance, made so by how her lover imagines they would.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Not too bad, not too awesome","I think these movies are getting more and more 'filler' with each installment. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy watching them, though, and I can definitely see myself re-watching them in future. But I wouldn't say that they're right up there with my top favourite films or anything.I look at this movie and compare it to the first, and see a marked difference. This one is more action, CGI, while the original is almost art-house in some ways.I enjoy the combo of Ali Larter and Milla Jovovic...and may I just say that Wentworth Miller is definitely worth viewing anytime! But all in all I would say this movie was just a bit 'eh', overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Aside from plot holes and IMPROBABILITIES AS BIG AS THE EARTH, It Was Fun","The Bad: When I say improbabilities, I mean improbabilities. There's a part about fifteen minutes in when Alice and Wesker crash a plane headfirst into a mountain and minutes later she walks out of the wreckage mildly burned with a limp. Now, Wesker has powers now so I can accept him surviving. She's human. If you can buy that, the sky's the limit. Other problems include Wentworth Miller, who was doing his best Christian Bale impression the whole time and the guy who played Wesker was pretty bad, too. I could see that guy being a memorable villain, but it was kind of ruined by the performance and an anticlimactic, but cool looking, end fight.The Good: This series is very much one of those that, while it is very different to the game, they are still fun movies. For that, I put this series up with some of the better video game movies that we have, not that that's saying much. I mean, look what it's going up against. And for those of you who want these things to be more faithful to the games, this is the most faithful one so far. The action scenes, while indeed stealing heavily in some parts, are really fun and the rest of the acting isn't as bad as it could have been. I've read some reviews where the critic was bothered by the sudden and unexplained appearance of the Executioner/Axe Man. This is different from the video games and previous movies how? It's the Resident Evil movie. You kill these bosses and you just move on from there. I don't want a whole back story on a guy who only appears for about fifteen-twenty minutes.Now, if you like the other three films, go ahead and see this one. If you didn't, I don't even know why you're reading this review because this most certainly is not going to redeem it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The start of a much more episodic trend in the series, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" lacks identity, but isn't without its charm and some very fun moments and set-pieces.","There's something about the ""Resident Evil"" film franchise that keeps me watching. Despite its ups and downs (and those down points really are atrocious... just watch the second film if you want to see my point), the series has always maintained a degree of watchability, mainly pertaining to its high entertainment value as a glorified theme-part stunt-show on screen. It's clear that Paul W.S. Anderson, who launched the film series, wrote every entry and directed several (including this installment) isn't concerned with make a particularly deep or complex franchise. Nor is he very concerned with remaining true to the original game franchise that spawned the films. (Which still irks me to an extent, though by this point, I've decided to forgive this fact and try to enjoy the films for what they are.)No, Anderson is more concerned with giving his audiences a hellish thrill-ride, full of over-the-top action set pieces, some admittedly fun horror beats and plenty of ridiculous and ludicrous eye-candy. And in that respect, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" excels, being one of the better entries in the series.Following a wildly fun opening 10-minute action set piece that is the highlight of the film, Alice (Milla Jovovich) is left in tatters. Her army of clones destroyed, and her powers taken from her, she is left all but dead. After discovering and re-teaming with former ally Claire (Ali Larter), whom suffers amnesia following the influence of a parasitic device from Umbrella, Alice resumes her travels, gains new allies (including Chris, Claire's brother, played by Wentworth Miller) and continues the search for the safety of ""Arcadia"" (revealed soon to not be a town as initially thought, but rather a constantly traveling sea barge).The film has some decent acting, to be perfectly honest. As usual, Jovovich is fun as the butt-kicking lead, and this film does correct the mistake of the first three by humanizing her as a character more. She seems to cover much more emotion. Larter is also pretty good as Claire, although they didn't do much with her amnesia. Miller isn't very good as Chris, sadly. He's a bit too brooding and ""dark"", making him feel one dimensional. However, supporting actors like Boris Kodjoe, Spencer Locke and Kim Coates are all pretty good in their short but well-played roles.The direction is actually quite nice for the most part. Anderson steps back in the director's chair after a 2-film absence and brings us what he does best- an over-the-top sound-and-light show. His direction is slick and capable. (Which goes without saying. No matter how bad some of his scripts are, he's a talented visual storyteller) My only slight complaint is the over-use of slow-motion in some sequences, and his over-use of characters throwing things towards the camera, which becomes distracting. (And was obviously put in for the benefit of the 3D effect. Unfortunately I cannot comment on the 3D, as I have only seen the 2D version, but for what it's worth, I wish I could have seen the 3D version, as it was clearly shot with 3D in mind.)The script is not so good, though. I will give credit in saying that it's better written than the first two films, but it just doesn't quite live up to the promise that the prior film (""Extinction"", which I found the easily the most well-written entry).The rest of the production is very good. The effects are stepped-up and look quite nice. The production design is top-class. (With the exception of some over-the-top Umbrella designs) The costumes are able to maintain a balance between realistic and stylized. And the music is serviceable.The ""Resident Evil"" series has truly evolved into something of a mind- bender for me. As basic, under-written and clichéd as the films are, I can't help but admire Anderson's push to give us pure, escapist fun with each new entry. And I've gotta applaud that. I like dumb, under- written escapist popcorn flicks from time to time. And the ""Resident Evil"" movies fulfill that desire.I give this a slightly above-average 6 out of 10. It won't win new fans, but it's a welcome entry full of carnage and fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
RESIDENT EVIL AFTERLIFE Criticism,"I have not to see the movie yet, but from what I've heard the critics say they aren't really good critics or thinkers.. I mean can we all see the movie first dang. With the simple mind that people have now a days before seeing the movie the critics would steal the shine when they are simply viewers like everyone else and not a clue to what they are criticizing on. Yeah they've said the movie looks like 3 different plot scenes meshed into 1, but even I know of the reason why and Im not even a critic. A smart person would know because they are all n 3 different locations. The clones are in Japan while Alice is in Los Angeles duh. There was also mention of the Axe man thrown in the mix without a reason. On duh resident Evil 5 (the game) it was the same way the guy just showed up without explanation. So why criticize the movie wen the games just the same. We'll I can't speak for everyone else, but this movie is a sure must see on my list simply because its entertaining and a awesome movie. I say go see the movie for yourself the viewers always disappointment and always bashing a good movie. They've got to see it now its our turn And thats all he wrote.",,Anonymous,Horror
Packs about the same amount of punches as the other installments,"Paul W.S. Anderson is pretty much sticking to the formula here. It's the same zombie game, only on a different location. The two main locations this time being a towering building and a massive ship. And we get the usual adrenaline rushing zombie action. Somehow it feels a little less epic than the dusty, apocalyptic third installment, ""Extinction"" (2007), which is still my favorite in the series, closely followed by the first movie. So it's simple: If you you're a fan of the ""Resident Evil"" series, you'll have the same amount of fun with ""Afterlife"" as you did with the previous outings. Amongst the highlights this time are Mila Jovovich crash-landing a plane on top of a building and a cool & wet big zombie-mutant boss fight in the industrial showers. The whole series is up there with the more entertaining & better executed zombie movies we've had coming out in recent years. And we've had many of those. For a 4th installment, it ain't bad at all. So keep 'em coming as long as Mila Jovovich is game; I'll be watching 'em.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Potentially good,"This is a movie about zombies so don't't expect to watch heart breaking performance or life changing sorties. That being said this movie is based on the video games saga of the same name and many fans including myself expect to see that and being this the fourth installment we already know that's not what is going to happen. In the games AL was about terror, fear of what may be around the corner and be ruining out of bullets, in the movies (exept the first may be) this is completely lacking, they shoot like they own a bullets factory and is completely more action oriented than fear driving. Elements of the game are thrown in without even bothering to explain why or how. What makes this movie a disaster is also what makes it great, I mean is pure action from beginning to end and despite the fact that the character of Alice never existed in the games she is just adorable played by Milla Jovovich. I think there are a lot of potential in this saga if would change of director's hands but still makes it for a nice way to spent an hour and a half eating popcorn.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The story starts multiple times but never ends.,"I got a chance to see this movie at a midnight show on opening day in IMAX. The movie look and sounded amazing in Imax. The enormous theater was sold out and many people had to go watch in a non Imax 3d screening playing next door. When the movie started there was a huge applaud and the excitement was felt everywhere. However, during the movie it felt like the audience had just fallen asleep. There were no sounds except at the end when people where whispering stuff like ""what just happened"", ""They ruined it"". Even my girlfriend said she fell asleep for a short amount of time.Here is the problem. The movie starts and doesn't change the pace. There is no climax, no wow affects, no twists in the story,...just the starting and no ending. They also made it more confusing by trying too many different things instead of keeping the story much simpler like part 1,2and3. This is not a spoiler at all but it seemed to me that they also tried to copy Matrix a little bit. Yes i know, its impossible because they are very different films but apparently someone screwed up. You'll know what i am talking about when/if you see it.Its hard to write a review without giving away anything so i hope you understand why i am being so vague. All in all this is a 'DVD' movie. I gave it 2 stars for the good implementation of the IMAX and i strongly feel that most reviewers who have given high marks to this film is also for the same reason but the movie 'sucked'.

***Best Movie of 2010 So Far***,"WOW...where do I begin? I was extremely lucky to attend the premiere of Resident Evil: Afterlife in Tokyo, Japan, and let me just say, it was nothing short of amazing. Before the premiere, Avatar (NOT that Airbender crap)has been my all-time favorite movie. But now that has changed, mainly for the fact that there is literally NON-STOP ACTION in Resident Evil: Afterlife. This was the most entertaining movie I've ever experienced. It grabs onto you and doesn't let you go, which is very rare for movies to do these days. I wasn't a big fan of any of the previous Resident Evil installments, but I feel Afterlife is almost Oscar-worthy simply for the fact that the director knows how to make great action sequences with fantastic special effects. Not to mention that the 3D was phenomenal, and really made you feel like you were in the movie's world. I don't want to give anything away, but I must warn that there are some VERY scary,gory, and disturbing scenes in Afterlife. I can't believe that it's only given an R rating. In my honest opinion, this film is slightly a higher level of maturity than R. Nevertheless, this is the best movie you're going to see in a long, long time. If you're in the mood to get sucked into the most intense and violent movie yet in cinema to date, Resident Evil: Afterlife is for you. A flawless 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Was OK,"First thing first I'm a huge fan of the first movie Resident Evil; I like the style and everything. Sadly for me that change over the course of the follow-up which they decide to make it less suspense and more of the action base. Which make me happy to know that Paul W.S. Anderson came back in the director chair to make this movie – unfortunately for me that don't really help, I felt as if I was watching Dawn of the Dead with guns (though After Life is a Whole lot better than the 2nd and 3rd) .Synopsis: Alice along with the few survivors trap themselves in an abandon High State Prison surrounded zillion zombies as they seek the way out to what they believe to be the last safe place known as Arcadia.The story felt like a comic now that there are already four parts into it as we slowly follow each journey of Alice and it very much felt episodic, luckily we finally get the chance to see the guy behind Umbrella Corp. There isn't much to say about the story really but bewared don't get too much hope on it; just watch it for action sequences.As for the casting, I thought it was so-so, with Milla look a hell lot better than in Extinction, lol. The castings of Welworth (Prison Break) do add a little status to this movie, though I hardly see his present really help this movie much. Shawn as Wesker has a lot of resemblance to the original but the bad part was doesn't really work out that great when in the movie Overall I don't really have nothing much to say about this movie, but I do enjoy it a whole lot better than Apocalypse and Extinction. The action part is pretty awesome especially the fight sequences between Axe Man (aka Executioner) though very very short. The heavy metal music work well in some parts. (Since I didn't watch it in 3D I can't say it has awesome effect). I say, hell just go and watch it when there is nothing on TV, you might enjoy it if you doesn't go too much on pin point the flaw ad loophole in the story.Recommendation: Worth A Rental from your local DVD store.Reason to Watch: You have been watching it the past three movies, just cont. watching it.Reason not to: It never seems to end, is it?Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
story is weak but one of the better 3D flicks,"Clocking in at the success of 3D afterlife was shot in real 3D and it shows but it is also it's weakness.The story picks in exactly at the end of part 3 so for that reason no problem. But it takes us to Los Angeles , fully infected with the Undead. They do have new abilities but we do move a bit too far away from the original concept, Umbrella. It's only when they reach 'Arcadia' that Umbrella really comes in the story.The only way I can explain this flick is for the 3D reason. They do look stunning but are the main part why you would watch Afterlife. Not only that, they also use super slo-mo for fight scene's and bullet flying around. I watched it in full 3D and you are lost in the effects used and forget what's it all about.As i said earlier, some personages from earlier entries do return but it's the weakness of the story that made me think, seen it all before. Only the last 20 minutes once at the 'Arcadia' are worth watching and is really what Resident Evil is about, not about killing Undead in all possible ways.

Horrid and critically evil,"Paul W.S. Anderson, we know him, we love him, we worship him. He is the eye behind Death Race,Alien Vs. Predator and Pandorum. He is the human entity responsible for the Resident Evil franchise. Part one was great, and part 3 was the supremely painted masterpiece. And dudes, let's just admit it, we love, love love Milla Jovovich. And if we are honest with ourselves, this is why we compulsively pay 12.50 at the theater whenever another crappy Resident Evil chop-shop sequel comes out. We love her buns, her rack, her model-like features, her deep sexy confidence and her barely restrained libido. I speak the truth, and this truth was well known by the producers and even Milla herself. Moving forward with this truth we are now in a position to criticize the most recent addition, which is truly an atrocious aberration of movie making.

It's a brain numbing mess.,"I wasn't a big fan of the first film, and the second film was pretty entertaining with Nemesis, and the third film is my favourite. But man oh man is this film a slap in the face. This film can only be described as dribble for the brain-dead viewer, or painful for fans of Resident evil in general. The new characters were just plain bad, but I did like the inclusion of the Redfields. But they end up vanishing in Retribution, so thats a slap in the face for me. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was the executioner, he was cool as s**t. You know what would be cool, him versus Pyramid head, I'd pay to see that. Well time to get into the flaws. The biggest being the slow-motion. There was so much of it I was laughing in frustration. It completely ruined the action scenes. The Wesker fight scene was disappointing, he is clearly more powerful than Alice. But he loses because he very slowly walks toward her with his mouth open, which allows her to shoot him, it was just stupid. And where did the Los plagues come from, like seriously. And in RE-extinction didn't they say the world dried up, along with the water, but here there is plenty of water. Don't quote me on that I'm still not 100 percent sure on it. This film ended up making nearly 300 million at the box office, which in the directors mind means let's put as little time and effort into making Retribution.

I just lol'd my pants watching this nonsense...,"Where to begin? I just laughed at the ratings for this movie. I think this movie, is the most non-resident evil movie from all. When I went to see this movie I thought I'll see what the trailer first offered me. Great visuals, amazing 3D but nonetheless non-stop action (that means a lot of killings) and a logical story to continue the series but what I witnessed was terrible.The story is that ridiculous I won't even comment on it. It has no logic, and it's simply written just to add stupid escapes and stupid action scenes that most part of the usual audience will find ""awesome"". Well it's not because it's dumb. The first resident evil movie was good so was the second but then they started to get more annoying than anything. Now they came up with this movie which doesn't even deliver what most of the resident evil fans want. You don't get enough killings but you get a lot of pointless monologues and pointless remarks. The twists are so obvious they might give you a headache. As far as being concerned about the acting... well... guess what... that was terrible too.The visual style the movie was so and so. And here's why. Technically the 3D was pretty good because it had some scenes that requested the 3D technology but besides that there's nothing else. I mean, the visual effects are above average. You see that behind the actors is a green screen most of the time and that airplane scene where Milla landed on that building is the proof of that not to mention it's another proof for how stupid this movie is. The cinematography was very good but the special effects just ruined the whole thing to me. The editing was so bad as far as the sound goes. I just felt this movie was rushed because you can't have that bad of an editing unless you need to send the movie and it's not ready yet so you rush things up. The soundtrack or the score or whatever you wanna call it started to be catchy but ended up being dull and boring.Another thing I hated in this movie was those slow-motion scenes and the action-scenes that rip-off The Matrix or Blade. You get one slow motion scenes each 10 minutes for every bullet that gets shot. That was hilarious and so irritating. This movie is just pathetic and not original at all and judging by the ending there will be a Resident Evil 6 which looks even more stupid than this one. I just can't stand when you take a good idea and you ruin everything. You don't have enough action and the action scenes you have are dumb, you don't have any logic, you don't deliver any interest in the characters in the movie, you don't deliver any atmosphere and when you have that music which is a good choice but the effect is zero then things are pretty sad.This movie deserves ""a big f**king fail"" and I just lost 5 minutes of my life to type this short-review.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The first great video game movie,"Resident Evil Afterlife manages the rare feat of seamlessly tying together a wide breath of movie styles; the zombie horror genre mixed with the monster movie genre to the slickness of the Matrix style environments and shootouts all encased in a disaster movie shell and characters. And, it's in 3d and if you've played resident evil 4 video game, there are a lot of derivations from the game that's sure to bring a few giddy moments. Best of all, every second is a total surprise and you'll have no idea where the movie is going and what is going to happen next. It never falls flat or meanders at any time. It is solid and punchy at every second. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's tearing the speakers right off the wall.This is a triumphant action horror movie that oozes with style that resident evil movies have made their own. The 3d aspect is also quite impressive but used mostly subtly rather than having things constantly hurled at your face. The zombies never leap at you or spring their tendrils at you but every scene with 3d has a subtle vibrancy to it and 3D effects are applied in the set piece fights very well. The plot probably has a few holes but the movie moves so fast that you barely have time to think about it or register it. Characters aren't that well flushed out but I suppose every second of character development is one less zombie killed.This is a great action horror movie and really recommended for people who found something to like in the older resident evil movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still weak on story but better on the action.,"After the first two films which I consider the best, this
franchise quickly went down hill in Extinction but after
I seen this film I felt well at least it's a little better than
the third film.I first seen this back in 2011 on DVD 
when another buddy of mine brought over a 
bootleg copy on DVD and I found it to be better than the third film.
He did as well and felt the third was probably the worst in the series,
at the time I agreed with him but the third has grown on me and I'm
more OK with it now.Unlike the third film, this one gets right to it with a strong action packed
opening and it delivers. Alice storms an Umbrella Corporation with her
multiple copies in Tokyo, but soon she is turn back to her normal human
state( still having her over- the-top fighting abilities) by Wesker and her copies get KIA after Wesker detonates the facility
on his getaway chopper. Also this franchise begins to become inconsistant
in this film but it really started with Extinction.Alice meets a new group of survivors and they band together to
fight the undead that has breached their strong hold.I give it a 6/10. better than the third with fun over the top
action scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"All the B-movie ridiculousness of the games, none of the fun.","Resident Evil: Afterlife makes a valiant attempt to blend elements of the previous films and the video games upon which the series is based, but the end result is a lurching, utterly brainless product that is unlikely to satisfy much of anyone.The plot, such as it is, follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her continuing attempts to reach other survivors of the zombie apocalypse while fighting off the evil Umbrella Corporation, which has not given up on experimenting with the T-Virus despite its proved zombifying, world-destroying properties. Along the way she runs into old friend Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), a multiethnic – and therefore mostly doomed – group of survivors (including Chris Redfield, played by Wentworth Miller), and superpowered Umbrella Corp chairman Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts, who at least appears to be having fun in his supremely hammy role).At this point, I'm fairly sure that the minds behind the Resident Evil films have just given up. The film jumps erratically from slo-mo fight scene to slow-mo fight scene, seldom deigning to exposit or flesh out its characters; several seemingly important plot points are introduced and then never mentioned again. The film attempts to throw game fans a bone with the inclusion of Wesker and the Redfield siblings, but none of these characters are given any significant development or purpose other than to facilitate even more slo-mo fight scenes; viewers unfamiliar with the game series are likely to be confused about why these characters are in the film at all. The only real praise I can give this film is that it's occasionally entertainingly terrible (keep an eye out for digging, swimming zombies!) instead of just boring-terrible like Apocalypse and Extinction.Still: If you're a fan of action-horror films, check out Predators when it comes out on DVD. If you're a fan of the games, wait for Resident Evil 6. If you're a fan of kick-ass women in movies, rent Salt. Afterlife is a soulless, headache-inducing product without enough brains to satisfy the most desperate zombie.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
So Bad!,"This film is like a poor man's MATRIX at times. Some of the scenes were such a rip-off I had to stop myself laughing out loud, it was EMBARRASSING! Unfortunately, the film is NOT a comedy, it's not a horror either. In fact, neither is it a thriller. It's basically pi$$ poor.The storyline was poor, when not incomprehensible & I'm not quite sure why I stayed until the end.However, thankfully, I have now forgotten how it ended anyway.... So now, on with the rest of my life, to try & forget the rest of this film.Wish me Luck!",,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good.,As exciting as this movie may be it became super unrealistic and I blame the 3D gomoc they used.Everything looked a little off. The CGI didn't seem as good and the whole thing felt a bit like a cash grab rather than a decent story.Still worth watching but not as good as previous installments.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A big let down,"Firstly, the 3D was absolutely terrible. I walked out of the cinema thinking something was wrong with my eyes, but according to the rest of the reviewers on this website it IS fuzzy! Very bad job, I found myself watching half of it without the glasses.The acting, plot and script were all abysmal. The plot holes in this film are ridiculous, you'll find yourself attempting to piece together parts of the story whilst the movie races from scene to scene.The characters are lifeless and boring. I was only interested in Milla, for all the obvious reasons. Even so, I found Jovovich to be less than impressive. I enjoyed the first three movies but Resident Evil: Afterlife is no match for its predecessors.To sum it up: It's a slow-mo pumped, plot less bore fest.

Good Fun,"Okay, the franchise is what it is. You must already be a fan of the games or previous films to understand the characters and the thin plot. However this film is visually beautiful and not short on genuine action.I have been a fan of the games but not so much of the films. For me the first movie is only worth mentioning but since then this is easily the best. Okay there is not much character development and the family reunion of Chris and Claire Redfield is some what puzzling as there appears to be no case of 'Hi claire what have you been up to all these years'? Instead, this film is just action, action and more action and to be honest I did actually enjoy it. It was just 90 minutes of pure zombie and bad guy slaying. I imagine there was quite a bit of a budget spent on this film as there was some fantastic real scenery from airview of Canada, Northern America etc. And the special effects to help produce a scary and frightening post apocalyptic world are impressive.don't expect too much of this film, it is cheesy, thin on the ground in terms of a real plot and character development but is enjoyable for its pure adrenlin fuelled rush!!

Story rambles on and on and on,"I think they're just stuffing too much into the movie.

It needs to slow down and stop going all over the place. While Ali Larter is back, I don't understand why Spencer Locke couldn't be included. She's in the movie anyways. Why not keep her with Ali Larter for the whole movie? The action looks great as always. I love the giant axe wielding monster. He looks beautiful.

There may be a bit too many generic elements with this movie,"In general a much improved instalment of the series and if anything the whole series remains enjoyable, if uninventive. In this part Anderson actually outdoes himself and instead of thinking up something original he starts borrowing scenes from other movies. Wesker looks and fights like Neo's twin brother, the new zombies bring to mind ""Blade 2"", whilst The Executioner has a disturbing familiarity to Pyramid Head of the Silent Hill franchise. Nonetheless some of the scenes are very memorable with the combat with The Executioner a real highlight for the movie (especially given the abrupt ending of the final fight).There may be a bit too many generic elements with this movie, but that has never stopped the franchise from being mindless slash-em-up fun. Even if a somewhat weakly scripted one. Also Alice remains a very likable heroine, so no matter how bad the script if she gets proper screen time and a couple of intriguing fights, than the movie just never seems to feel like a waste of time.",,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining Movie if you Enjoy Sci-fi  (i saw it twice),"This movie may have a crappy story plot which is simple but it's still entertaining if your into this sort of genre , basically Alice's main objective in this movie is to get to Arcadia which continues from the 3rd Resident evil, The 3D FX in this movie is kinda blurry but still good, the music does a great job by making this movie more entertaining it perfectly describes the the whole mood of the movie.The action scenes are fun to watch which is basically the only thing that this movie has going for it, the thing i hated though was how horrible the story plot was it wasn't really that interesting and it could have been Soooooooooooo much better there's so much potential for this movie to really be good and they could of made it longer too and if your un- familiar with the game you might not understand it as much since the plot does a bad job of explaining core story elements of the real games story line i know the movie is not meant to follow the game exactly but it left out some key things that are needed to explain the story properly.Two really great things about this movies Milla and Ali look banging hot and yet have this dominating aura around them which doesn't make them too over sexualised which is awesome.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Same Thing Over and Over Again,"I'm not sure the director (Paul S. Anderson) knows exactly where he wants to go artistically or how to handle this movie. The film begins with a great opening sequence in Tokyo but rather than delving deep into what could have been something very intriguing, he decides to shift to action, stunts, and CGI and continues until a certain scene involving a plane crash. Now, as if all of the action and unrealistic stunts weren't enough, it seems that both passengers also manage to survive. Apparently, plausibility or any sense of realism doesn't matter as long as there is plenty of action. And that's been part of the problem since ""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" two films earlier. Rather than taking what he has and utilizing it in a sober manner he constantly chooses to go overboard in the mistaken assumption that ""more is better"" regardless of how absurd it eventually gets to be. As a result, we get dozens of clones of ""Alice"" (Milla Jovovich) along with the original Alice possessing telekinetic superpowers. It's simply all too much. Fortunately, he realized this and took care of both of those problems at the very beginning of the movie. But then he turns around and does what could be the exact same thing again at the very end. I don't know, maybe it's just me but it seems like the same thing over and over again. Lots of action and CGI with a couple of pretty faces thrown in for good measure. Anything to distract the viewer from realizing that this film has no real thought or creativity behind it. Now don't get me wrong, I like the inclusion of ""Claire Redfield"" (Ali Larter) and ""K-Mart"" (Spencer Locke). But rather than have them just thrashing around looking pretty I would have preferred that they be given meatier roles with more character development. After all, it seemed to work in the last film (""Resident Evil-Extermination"") pretty well and to great effect. But failing any great effort on the director's part, I guess we will have to settle for lots of action in its place. And that's a shame because this movie should have been much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best of a bad bunch,The Resident Evil movies are all pretty terrible movies but Afterlife is the most fun to watch with cheesey over acting cringe worthy dialogue and bizarre fight scenes that while not impressive in any way will make you laugh and entertain you for an hour and a half.The movie follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) not long after the events of the previous movie as she first takes out a secret underground Umbrella facility where Wesker (Shawn Roberts) is hiding and he injects her with a new cell altering virus that makes her human again now human and free of umbrellas tracking she travels to Arcadia in Alaska where her friends were headed for safety in the last movie but she only finds Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) alive and brainwashed by drugs after helping her the two head down the cost in the hopes of finding more survivors and discover what happened to the rest of their friends but what they soon discover is Arcadia isn't what it appeared to be.The movie looks ok and is directed well for what it is but is filled with CGI backgrounds uninteresting characters and a story that just gets further away from the source material with every film released.I would recommend watching this movie at least once as there are some fun fight scenes and cheesy Wesker moments that are worth a laugh or two just dont get invested in it as you will be disappointed.,5.0,Anonymous,Horror
What's next?,"Just when you think it's all over, a new Resident Evil pops up. And this time it's 3-D too. It does continue the story where the 3rd left off, but it does leave a few question marks, that might not be revealed in this movie. Will Millas character finally set an end to it all though? You have to watch this to know for sure.The action is shot well and you even get a character from the Resident Evil 5 video game. A very big one that is, but wait til you see it (if you haven't been spoiled by the trailer that is). It is more the action than anything, that elevates this above the 5/10 mark for me. Of course you might feel it deserves more or less. It's not about the rating. It's about how entertained you are going to be.

Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) POOR Storyline,"The 3D was good but not great. Very little zombie killing which was a disappointment. All the good stuff was pretty much what I watched in the trailers. This movie basically played on the idea that the first 3 movies were hits to fans so they add 3D and a poor storyline. I went with all 4 of my boys and we all agreed that the villain acted more like a poor impersonation of Agent Smith (Matrix) less the Carl Sagan voice.Yes, this is based on a video game but the storyline missed the mark for a 4th movie following 3 epic movies for Resident Evil fans.It is very hard to review this movie without spoilers, so I will leave it alone and just say I would not see number 5 if it comes out. Yes, this movie will leave you guessing at the end.This movie does not qualify as a followup to the plots of the first 3 and if you never saw the movie series you will still be disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Style over substance,"Alice is stripped of her T-virus enhancing powers continues on her journey to find survivors and lead them to Arcadia, however, with more zombies, T-virus mutants and Umbrella Corporation personnel it's not going to be easy.Boasting being the first live-action movie based on a video game to be in 3-D The intriguing set up of Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) for a clone orientated sequel is dolefully all wrapped up in the opening minutes of Afterlife. The originals director/writer Paul W.S. Anderson thankfully returns the reigns and puts the series on track, especially by making our heroine more human and like the character of Resident Evil (2002).Milla is made for the role of Alice and looks particularly in shape and focused in this action orientated continuation of the Capcom game adaptation, as too is Ali Larter as Claire Redfield, although she is underutilised.Gamer fans will be pleased with appearance of game baddies and Chris Redfield played by Wentworth Miller. Boris Kodjoe is has a lot of screen presence, however, his and many of the other characters are not fleshed out or have enough dialogue nor time to make an impact. Afterlife lacks the depth and foreboding atmosphere of the first film but is more fun than Apocalypse and Extinction despite the hammy acting and overuse of slow-mo.The Redfield bother sister relationship is left unexplored and there appears to be a lot of missed opportunities. That said, these threads may turn up in future squeals, however, you can't help feel a little short changed as the plot feels to just scratch the surface.There's still a lot to like, zombies, guns, sword-play and explosions. Fantastic stunts, great sets, costumes, special effects and a pumping score. Sienna Gilroy's cameo sets it up for another tantalising sequel, however, every instalment in the series has done the same, let's just hope RE5 delivers in all departments.Overall, Resident Evil: Afterlife is immense sci-fi fun, but alas chooses style over substance.",,Anonymous,Horror
"too much slow-mo, bad CGI, flawless makeup, and 3D gimmicks; otherwise mindless fun - to an extent","Despite having not only Claire but also Chris Redfield, finally, and Wesker, in the same RE movie, it's a struggle to get through - if you can't tolerate its major flaws. If you can get past how persistently flawless and unscathed Milla and Ali's makeup is throughout the entire movie, no matter their condition, through swimming and rain and mud, then you're halfway there. Next you have to just accept that you'll be sitting (or FF) through gratuitous scenes of slow motion and 3D gimmicks (things flying at the screen, blinding contrast of colors, in-your-face CGI, etc), which occasionally reveal bad editing and other goofs in the cinematography. The CGI is mostly cringe-worthy, especially whenever tentacles come out of a zombie or Wesker's mouth. My favorite scene was the beginning, which - as downtrodden with slow-mo and 3D gimmicks as it was - actually looked cool. But it gets old fast, and given the perfect cosmetics throughout, it feels like you're just watching 2 models stern-face it through video game cinematic level action scenes. The music is borderline unbearable, too, but in a laughable way. The same goes for Alice's absurd level of strength, endurance, and speed, despite having her powers taken from her in the beginning. All of this equates to a 5, but I was able to shut my mind off halfway through and just go with the flow. But boy oh boy the final scene (and the cringingly acted mid-credits clip) was agonizing to experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is a multi-rip-off, but it is pretty well done","I liked the original Resident Evil, but unfortunately the successors did not impress me much. I would have to say though that RE:Afterlife is quite okay. It fails by not being scary, but it is on the other hand interesting and high-tech, with top notch CGI effects. The film is a rip-off in the sense that it is heavily inspired by both the original RE (notably the underground umbrella research facility), The Matrix (the lobby scene) and also has a built in ""Prison Break"", with Wentworth Miller as the star actor. The APC (that for some reason never is used) also strongly resembles the one used in Aliens.One area where it really fails is story continuity, with sudden jumps into the future without any explanation. On the other hand, this helped keep the film short and presumably retain only the very best scenes.Parts of the film are not well crafted and somewhat implausible. Whole cities are still on fire despite supposedly being destroyed months ago by zombie invasion.So overall, there are some serious flaws. Grab a beer and you will probably enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It's trash, but you should know better by now.","This movie was not worse than I expected. However, it wasn't really much better, either. I'm not going to nitpick apart all the places where it failed to do justice to the games it (falsely) claims to draw inspiration from, and frankly there's plenty of other stuff wrong with this movie to warrant a bad review. Pretty mucht 90% of the movie is shot in slow motion, and Milla Jovovich is still just as obnoxious of a female protagonist as she's ever been. Not only is she doing the female equivalent of Christian Bale's Batman voice for the whole thing, but now she makes video blogs throughout the film to convey exposition, which adds an extra layer of tedium to the film's already tedious first half. Secondary characters for the most part only occupy space (BTW, is it just me, or does Ali Larter's face constantly look like it needs to be slapped?), Shawn Roberts eats the scenery like he's in a fan film playing Agent Smith from The Matrix, and there's YET ANOTHER ridiculous amnesia plot device thrown in to conveniently prevent Paul W.S. Anderson from having to write convincing relationships between his characters.This game does borrow a few elements from the games, but for the most part it borrows from Resident Evil 5 which is unfortunate since that's one of my least favorite in the series-- especially the scarabs, which IMO were a lazy plot device and they're used just as lazily in this film as they were in the game. Again, I don't want to overemphasize what was changed from the games, because even though these things are frustrating to me as a fan they are not ultimately what makes this movie bad. It's Anderson's ridiculously overwrought sense of ""style,"" the brain-dead script, the acting which ranges from lethargic to mustachio-twirling levels of ham, and the overall goofiness of the whole thing. I can't say I was disappointed though. It was not any worse than what I expected, and honestly anyone ought to be able to tell what kind of movies these are just by looking at the posters. They're essentially Paul Anderson's multi-million dollar birthday presents for his wife, who happens to play the main character.Also, I must mention the 3D, which is of mixed quality despite it's claims of ""using the technology behind James Cameron's Avatar."" The 3D is just as spotty and obnoxious as the rest of the film, and when things aren't flying in your face, they're either too blurry and distorted to make out or just plain 2D looking. However, the extra $3-5 that it adds to the ticket prices has helped ensure that this will be the most profitable movie in the series and that Paul WS Anderson won't stop making them any time soon. My patience for the medium is fast dwindling, and I think next time I see a movie I'll save a few dollars and ask for 2D.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter?,"It works for me.""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" (2010) is the 4th installment in the series, which started with 2004's ""Resident Evil"". These are the only two films I've seen in the series so I obviously don't consider them ""must see"" movies and, yet, I have to admit to being thoroughly entertained when I do. They're basically superhero vs. zombies flicks with loads of style and pizazz. You can't take 'em too seriously and, yet, the stories & characters are ironically dead-serious.I call these ""superhero"" flicks because that's what Milla Jovovich is as Alice in a ""last people on earth"" scenario. She's dressed in a skintight black outfit with a weapons harness and looks stunning throughout. In this segment she meets up with Claire (Ali Larter) and they fly to a Los Angeles prison where a small group are holed-up against the legions of zombies. They seek to get to an offshore ship, a thought-to-be safehaven from the hordes.Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson is an expert at making great-lookin' movies with a cool sense of style. In addition, the score and soundtrack are excellent.Being based on a video game, which I've never played, there's loads of action, which gets cartoony at times (e.g. the giant with the axe).The best part is the women. It's hard to choose who's better: Milla or Ali. They're both great, but Ali might have the edge. As magnificent as these two are, they throw in more, like the gorgeous Kacey Barnfield.Taking it for what it is, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is a dang entertaining movie.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

For me at least left the impression of a movie made extremely fast and without a minimum attention to details- just for commercial reasons, unlike it's predecessors which I really enjoyed.

Almost a teenage gamer's dream come true,"Series star Milla Jovovich returns as Alice for this 4th installment in the Resident Evil film franchise, based on the video game series that won't stay dead. Also returning is her hubby Paul W.S. Anderson, director of Resident Evil (2002). Alice is accompanied by game protagonist Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). The two search the Earth for survivors from a worldwide zombie infestation and find some people atop a Hollywood prison. The plan is to get them to a rumored sanctuary known as Arcadia. But trying to stop them is the evil Umbrella Corporation boss Wesker (Shawn Roberts doing a really good Hugo Weaving impression) who started the plague, and of course a variety of walking, er running dead.The Resident Evil film series is supposed to be taking place in the ""universe"" created by the games. Newsflash, this isn't Star Trek. Focusing on anyone outside of the central conflict isn't very interesting. That explains why Alice is at the head of everything, which conflicts with the story told in the games and confuses the heck out of fans of the game series.From start to finish Resident Evil: Afterlife is a mess of unexplainable scenes. I'd say it was confusing, but that word implies a lack of understanding on my part. No, I'm certain that had I seen the first and second sequels that there would still be no way to make sense of this movie. Plot holes, contrivances, and silliness come at you in full force. Since I can't remember all the offenders, I hope to be forgiven for the ones I miss. There's Alice's HD camcorder that is set to record in only white, black, and red. There's the ""Executioner"" who appears in the middle of the city without provocation. Another strike for his ridiculous weapon, an axe chained to an anvil—a sign that what makes a fun game opponent doesn't necessarily make for a believable film character. This same game logic translates to the stupefying nature of the ""zombies"" featured this time around who are able to burrow and open their faces as though they are mandibles. This goes unexplained in the film, but it's a nod to the direction the game franchise went as it moved away from the confinements of the zombie definition and toward new outlandish territory. Lastly, my favorite gaff involves the look of shock in the faces of survivors when Alice attempts to land her plane on their building just after they were disappointed that she may fly off without them, raising questions over what they wanted in the first place.Knowledge of the game series is vital since carryover characters did all their developing in the games. Characters created for the film are either soon to be dead or stoic. A girl by the name of K-Mart (Spencer Locke) is mentioned on occasion, and when the team finds her she manages to go the entire film without a line. The central antagonist is known in games as Wesker though I don't recall his name being said even once in the film and a cameo at the credits requires, you guessed it, knowledge of the games and previous films.Not all is lost. Resident Evil: Afterlife is surprisingly attractive. Since Avatar launched 3D as a high-profit concept to escalate ticket prices, many films have tried to capture the same magic. Some resorted to adding the 3D effects in post-production. This film, like Avatar, does it in the camera. The difference in noticeable even if you rarely catch a 3D film at the cinema. Anderson shows this off by taking every opportunity to throw and point a variety of objects at the audience. Alice may have as many guns as her frame can carry, but that doesn't stop fellow survivors from tossing her a pistol or submachine gun. Even baddie Wesker gets into the act, needlessly tossing his sunglasses at Chris (Wentworth Miller). All of this is done in slow motion and all too often stealing the ""bullet time"" effect from The Matrix. Many Anderson vets have seen his movies because he got his hands on a franchise they care about, and they are often times disappointed at the numerous opportunities he takes to slow down the speed of the action, almost as though the goal is to bore the audience or stretch the runtime to meet a quota. Oddly, his pioneering efforts may have finally achieved notoriety thanks to the nature of 3D, because the slowed action provides audience members the time needed to admire the view. The crowning moment is the entirely slowmo fight with the Executioner in the prison shower. Water is flying in all directions, blood splatters on the lens of the camera, a giant axe is hurled at the crowd (making you consider ducking), every element plays on the 3D gimmick and to this date I have not seen a better sequence to showcase the technology.Aside from the poetic nature used to hand justice to the bad guy, little if anything good can be said about the writing. Too often I was begging a character to make a quip and realize just how over-the-top the situation has become. There are worse zombie movies, and there are better. What saves Afterlife is an apparent dedication to production values, even over producing the film with some lavish sets, effects, and makeup (good to see that the girls found concealer in the midst of the chaos). It never comes across as second-rate and its knee-jerk pacing keeps you on edge. Almost a teenage gamer's dream come true. **",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's better than #2 and #3 in the series, which is saying a lot when a sequel, especially a multi-sequel, tops its predecessors.

It was OK,"This is a OK Film, When I started, I really liked it but after a while I got very very bored until I finally turned it off, I would say that this Film is good, But if something else catches your attention, you may quickly start to lose Interest in the Film.So overall, It is a very good action film, But if you start of do something else other than the Film, You may lost Interest and get Bored after a while of it or If something else catches your attention, But If you are focused on the Film, You will probably enjoy it the whole way through more, I give it a 4 out of 10.That was my review, I hope that you found this Review helpful.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Probably one of the weaker ones in the franchise, but still fun","I've said it before about these films, despite their flaws they always manage to be fun and entertaining. I think Afterlife is definitely one of the weaker instalments, mostly due to the story, but it has a few redeeming features.Firstly, the action is probably on par with the best in the franchise (so far). The opening was pretty solid, paying a nice homage to the Matrix. I did think by the end though that this homage strayed into the territory of a rip off. Its a fine line to tread and I think Afterlife definitely crossed it in areas, from the leather outfits to the slow motion ""bullet time"".I enjoyed the characters in this one, although they were pretty limited in their development and screen time. Wentworth Miller was a good addition to the cast.I think another weakness was the villain. He seemed like a caricature and just wasn't interesting or fun at all. As a result the final set piece fell a little flat for me.Overall a decent first act, fun second, and weak third. A solid film, but not the best entry in the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"There is no fanservice like before, I wish there was.","I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the movies if I wasn't binge-watching them like a popcorn series.I like that they do not break the rules and consistency of the series' world and adapt to an inconvenient situation. The inconvenient situation in this movie is that Alice has become overpowered like a game character. That's why the character is nerfed very quickly.In this movie, they also added a mini boss. The boss looks pretty decent, and the fight sequence is relatively successful. In general, I thought stage designs and vehicle designs were decent according to age's standards. I think the last boss fails compared to the mini boss. I can't believe they still haven't achieved this after 8 years and 4 movies. The monster at the end of the movie has to have some weight. Even if it is a popcorn movie. The final fights in this series are always very cheesy and anticlimatic.Still, if you're watching this movie, you're watching it for one reason only, to see the models taking on monsters as if they were walking down a runway. The movie delivers this in one way or another.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"'Resident Evil: Afterlife 3-D' has good 3-D, less everything else","Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the latest, and fourth of the Resident Evil series, now called Afterlife, Alice (Milla Jovovich) continues on her journey, now with her sidekick Claire (Ali Larter), in a world ravaged by a virus infection to find survivors in L.A. and lead them to safety. Meanwhile the evil Umbrella Corporation responsible for the virus is after her.This 3rd sequel has now went on to the Avatar-esque RealD 3-D format, and in all honesty, it looked amazing. The images were crisp, the whites looked white, and the raindrops Oh my, the raindrops. If you had a choice between watching it in 3-D or 2-D, I'd suggest the 3-D version, because, well, the movie itself doesn't fair as well on its own, meaning, in terms of characterization, plot, or even action.The film starts off strong, particularly the beginning credits, which presents a rainy Tokyo street scene where a girl is standing alone without an umbrella amongst a crowd. The scene is filled with colors, tension, and mystery. Had the film carried that same sense of horror throughout the film, I think this film could've been something quite special. The pacing slows down considerably as well. As it is, it is a fairly standard action film with Milla Jovovich doing her usual badass, too-tough-to-bother action heroine thing. She looks cool, no doubt—but it's nothing new and she's mostly going through the motions by now.The visuals are what sells this film. The sets, both virtual and not, are of high quality (and budget, too, I suppose). The storming of the Umbrella corporation in the beginning is quite out there, but kind of neat, too. A fight between two women vs. one baddie with a giant ax is a nice scene where you see 3-D blood splatter onto the screen. Personally, I don't see how the film could be better in 2-D, particularly these action scenes. These scenes are highly unrealistic, are often in slow motion, and not terribly exciting aside from the 3-D. They're great visuals, but there's hardly any tension, drama, or fear. Milla Jovovich's Alice has become a James Bond-ian superwoman where no bullets or sharp edges can touch her. She twirls and jumps in mid-air, easily dodging bullets as if they were tennis balls on American Gladiators. Advertisement And, this is all in slo-mo. Now, this is where 3-D gets useful. You can appreciate the details, the textures, and the spatial awareness. I've read in an article recently that one of the tough aspects about filming fight scenes in a 3-D film is that you have to actually connect, or hit the other person because you can't use fake distance with camera tricks like you can with the regular film. I suppose that could be the reason for the use of slo-mo. Then again, one can always do the other way as in some Hong Kong Films, where they ""undercrank,"" so people can fight slower with slower frame rate so it looks faster in normal speed. Either way, it works aesthetically well in 3-D. Motion blurs could look odd in 3-D, after all.The plot involves a group of survivors stranded on a prison facility surrounded by flesh-eating zombies. It is up to Alice and Claire to help them get to safety to a ship offshore. The characters are fairly generic, with couple of fighter-type guys, a wimpy guy, a sleazy guy, and a pretty chick. Their backstory doesn't figure much into the plot, so it doesn't really matter what they do.Milla Jovovich has played this type of role for so long that it's nothing surprising. She plays Alice with great physicality and delivers her lines as it is written. The dialogue is generic, lacking humor. Ali Larter plays Claire, who looks more like a feminine version of Alice. Shawn Roberts plays the evil head of the Umbrella Corporation, Albert Wesker. (Who pays for the Umbrella Corporation, by the way? And, do they still pay money?) Wesker resembles Ice Man from Top Gun, donning sunglasses, looking robotic--I suppose he symbolizes the cold, robotic nature of big corporations.Overall, despite the simple plot and characters, Milla plays Alice as I suppose she is meant to played, with lots of action. I was still happy how good the 3-D looked and it could be a good reason to at least check it out in theaters. There's good potential and effective use of this medium, if coupled with a good script and characters we can care about.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
And now for something completely different,"First off I am a fan of the franchise and I loved playing the games. The Good, Bad.First the BadThe previous movies had really left the writers in a strange place so the first twenty minutes of this film was them trying to recapture the storyline and the audience (which probably didn't bother to rent other films) really suffers for lack of a unified story. This makes my first beef with this film. Second, the movie didn't have zombies! It was about 90% action movie and 10% zombie movie, the other films did a much better job of balancing that out. Third, the previous two films did a good job of setting up the villain with an unction / drive, this one really drops the bomb on that. The head villain, (if you're familiar with RE3) is not new but he has no back story and his murderous, cold blooded, i-wear-my-sun-glasses-at-night persona is just kinda random and stressed. The other villain, that freaky lookin' ax dude from the preview just shows up out of nowhere also!Now the Good: The film is entertaining, not worth the premium for 3d and not worth the IMAX price, but certainly worth a rent and a bowl of popcorn. Second: the writers feel free to experiment and manipulate the zombie genre; too often Zflilms are the same recycled plot dipped in a bucket of red corn syrup. Even if I would have liked a few more zombie scenes, I can respect the importance of branching out and expanding the genre.Bottom Line: If you enjoyed the other films, don't miss it. Don't go dropping $15 bucks for a ticket but it's a good show with some nice action. All in all pretty fun.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ultra stylish and fun but hollow,"Paul Anderson (Event Horizon) returns to the franchise he created for the first time since the original. The results are aesthetically astounding but slightly hollow. For the first time in the series it seems as though characters are simply added for a higher body count than having a real purpose. That being said it's a hell of a lot of fun especially if you turn off your brain. There are some truly dynamic scenes, the slow mo shower battle is gorgeous and enthralling. This time around the clones descend upon umbrella and are quickly disposed of and Alice looses her power and becomes human. She searches for Claire and the gang but stumbles upon a new gang at a prison that includes sexy Wentworth Miller (Prison Break) and gorgeous Boris Kodjoe (Addicted). The zombie army rages outside with some new mutations afoot while they try and escape to a supposed safe facility called Arcadia. The movie is fast and fun and ultra stylish. It's a step down story wise from Extinction but it's much prettier.Budget: $60m

Laaaaaaaame,"We can expect more from the guy who directed Event Horizon. When I watch movies, I take them in for what they are, so I'm not going to compare Resident Evil to American Beauty or Mystic River. However, I can compare it to The Dark Knight, Doomsday, and Kickass, which are decent action movies with really well done action sequences and imagination. The Action in Resident Evil is really exaggerated; as in they try to make a whole lot of nothing into something. Like when Wesker is dodging bullets, hes just kind of standing there making retarded faces. My friend expected this to be a bad Resident Evil movie which most fans(those who loved the first three games, and Code Veronica) will expect, but this was just a bad movie. Nothing was explained, just shown to look bad ass. The characters are bullshit and cliché, and Chris's situation when you are introduced to him doesn't make any sense. Finally the most disappointing aspect of the movie was the action, they don't even really shoot them in the head anymore to kill the zombies, it's just shooting, and looking bad ass. Also the hand to hand fighting wasn't impressive, The Matrix, which was created over a decade ago, Kickass, Doomsday, Batman, Spiderman, Watchmen, V for Vendetta, THE EXPENDABLES, and every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie(Including Jingle all the way) have more enticing action scenes. However, the helicopters do look really bad ass, which is why I give this a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1 out of 10.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you don't care for the previous RE movies, don't bother with this one.","The use of 3D makes this movie watchable. I am sure fans of the previous RE films won't be disappointed. The zombies look good, there are big guns, great sound effects, and lots of scenes with people flying through the air in slow motion. I would recommend watching this movie if you love a good old fashioned frag fest on screen, but please do not expect anything more. This is a typical CGI blessed action flick and in my opinion its better than the 2nd and 3rd RE movies (which isn't saying a lot really).In conclusion - If you never see this movie, you aren't missing anything. I would strongly recommend it for die hard RE fans but for others, this one is nothing special.P.S. If you managed to sit through the entire movie, maybe you should stick around a little longer till the end of the credits. Its worth it.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The special effects are worse then ever.2. The acting is surely not as good as in the previous movies.3. The storyline is becoming crap.4.

Another 3 year wait  why?  but in a good way,"This film is the best instalment to the trilogy, i went in with major high expectations for this films, it was that bad i was running away from people who have already seen the film before they could even breath a single word to me, also staying away from the reviews on here so i don't find anything out which was really frustrating.But in all fair play this film definitely delivered my taste to this amazing storyline, the writer/director is doing a fantastic job on keeping this films as close to the game as possible. Mean like resident evil 1 is based on 1 with Alice being involved which doesn't happen in the game but o well scratch that shall we, number two has a mix with number 2 and 3, extinction i felt went in its own path showing a different aspect to these sorta films being based all in daylight shooting which you rarely see in zombie films.Now this instalment to the films has its own way on playing but has sticked to the new resident evil 5 (my favourite in the series)besides being shot in south Africa. But keeping u with the new infected zombies and also adding the person behind everything with umbrella.I felt they chucked in a lot of off different aspects to this part, with it being shot in a costophobic way and also being shot in day and night. The action involved here as well was crystal nothing too over the top besides a bit too much slow-mo but hey we can all deal with that. More scarier and more jump scenes as well which i can come to terms no other resident evil has every chucked so many into.all in all i loved this chapter to this series.the only downside to me was the ending for one being as i was waiting through out the whole film see the return off Jill valentine and when i did i was like why why why. knowing i love the films i think it could off ended on this one because the director better do the 5 instalment and he has to really pull all the stops out to over do this one. Also the last thing is i felt it was a bit too long (longert then the last three i felt) but thats my only complaint.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I'm sorry, but exploiting 3D does not make entertainment.","We live in a time where entertainment can be mindless fun. So as long as they do not try to be what they can't. Then it's good fun. ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is not good fun. Why? Some say repetitive, others say it's boring, flat, dull and dark. Only when the action comes do we get some real ""cool"" entertainment but that's it.Heavily inspired by ""The Matrix"" the action sequences show no mercy in assaulting the senses. It's all there: slo-mo, bullet time, black sunglasses, lots and lots of bullets and slo-mo explosions, everything. Just add a few zombies to make sure they (the filmmakers) look like they're not ripping fans of the original games and film trilogy, and make it part of the franchise. Apparently they DO rip off the audience, there's very few zombie butt-kicking than in the previous three; save for that big brutal monster with the giant axe in the middle of the film which gives the film one of its pluses.There's virtually no story to speak of, just brief introductions to the next action sequence (and at the ending, an inevitable sequel to keep this dead horse running). Milla Jovovich looks good but she starting to look bored. Ali Larter, Boris Kodjoe and Wentworth Miller don't even bother about characterization apart from the fact that they look fit and hot. The cinematography, production design and visual effects are solid but the complementing music by Tomandandy is just too electronic and distracting. It's as if they're trying too hard to be hip.Speaking of trying too hard to be hip, the Matrix-inspired action has 3D to make it look even better. I'll admit, director Paul W.S. Anderson really jumped on the 3D bandwagon and put it to good use. The 3D is solid, with the bullets and blood and that giant axe all flying toward the screen and towards the audiences' faces.Which brings me to the question: why bother? 3D is meant for fantasy/sci-fi films with out-of-this-world situations. It does not fit in any action/horror film, and it is NOT supposed to be used as a gimmick. People don't go to the movies to see the 3D as advertised; rather they go to the movies to watch a story and get into a fantastical world. 3D can be used as a tool to get them immersed into that world (e.g. ""Avatar"", ""How To Train Your Dragon""), not as a tool to show off and be proud of itself. And that is exactly what happened to ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"". The film's action sequences in 3D is merely exploiting the format and is equivalent to an outdated old man wearing hip-hop clothes and screaming ""Hey, look at me! I'm hip! I'm fresh!"". This kills the film and makes it look desperate and lame.I apologize to those who reject my review. There will always be lovers as well as haters. These are just merely my thoughts, and who's to stop you from going to see the movie. But this 3D film is absolutely pointless to watch in my humble opinion, with no standing out qualities (apart from the pointless but well-made 3D). I'd rather not watch this one again.Overall value: 34/100",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"May be for you, but not for me.","I am truly not a fan of these movies. I have always loved the Resident Evil franchise, and that is why I still see these movies. None of that have been good by movie standards, none of them have been good by fanboy standards. Resident Evil is one of the only things I have ever really been a fanboy of. And, of course, fanboys are never pleased. That's just what it is. The games have even been steadily declining. The movies are just plain awful. I won't lie, the first movie wasn't too bad. It was alright because it was general. They made a new story line and were going with it. Cool. But then, they started to try to intertwine the game stories and the movie's story, and it just makes no damn sense. There are two kinds of people who like the RE franchise. Those who like the games and movies because it's about zombies, and that's enough for you. Cool, it's general, there's zombies, and there's blood. Awesome. But, I am a fan of the franchise because of it's in-depth storyline, and its character development. And the movies have none of that. And, putting aside the fact that this is a remake of a video game, it was just a bad movie in general. It was short, I couldn't find a real storyline, and there was way to much slow motion. And hell, the antagonist was in only two scenes of the movie. That's just unacceptable.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The worst action movie I've seen since Wanted,"I can hardly begin to explain how annoyed and disappointed I was when I watched this movie, but I will try my best so that people use the 10 dollars on coffee or something more rewarding. I have seen the past three films and I'm not going to say they're great but I'll say I expected more, not only out of the franchise but out of action movies in general. When you sit down to watch this movie just expect to see more slow mo than real time, just the tossing of a gun with no true time urgency in the ""plot"" or getting up off the ground is granted a 30 second slow mo scene. Every scare and action move, or set up I have seen a thousand times before and filmed in much better ways, this might as well have been shot like sin city with as much CGI is hurled into the viewers eyes, and it doesn't look good anyway. I've watched almost all the 3D movies that have come out but this one hurt my eyes. Every time a ""plot twist"" or a ""cool"" line was said I was thinking ""Really? I mean Really?"" this is only the second movie I've ever seen that I almost walked out of. I am disappointed to no end if this is what is thought of as a great action movie.

Resident Evil 5: 3/10,"After 4 years of the so called evil corporation ""Umbrella"", we still haven't gotten tired of this particular franchise. As entertaining as it may seems, we might be getting a little tired of Mila Jovovich being undefeatable (even though she doesn't have any powers in this film) by the undead zombies. The plot is simple and straight forward. Alice (Jovovich) continues her journey on trying to destroy the whole Umbrella Corporation. Joining her this time is Ali Larter (Heroes), Wentworth Miller (Prison Break), and Boris Kodjoe (Undercovers). Not that this cast is any better than its previous instalment. Though it may be in 3D, but few scenes actually worked in 3D. Paul W.S. Anderson's (directed the first Resident Evil) directing is as bad as it can be. The camera angles weren't right and he just doesn't know what to do with the material on his hands.

Alice is back in glorious 3D,This Resident Evil did for me what the previous versions didn't. Yes it did not truly stick to the video game story but it did offer some sort of fan service. Resident Evil 5 players will understand. We from the get go this movie jumps right into action with pacing I felt was up and down. I couldn't help but notice certain zombie movie cliché's here but they were laughable and I doubt anyone will hold the director for that. Alice is looking kick-ass and she does a lot of dead-ass kicking. With respect to the 3D i think they did a good job. This movie I will recommend to anyone who has been following the movie version of Biohazard/Resident evil. It is a great movie that will entertain you till the very end.

Resident Evil: Afterlife + Trilogy before it......,"Many people can agree that the Resident Evil Movies don't follow the games exactly, but they do have elements of the game in the story. What people need to understand is that the movies are taking the franchise to a new level, it would be pointless to make a live action movie that follows the game in every way. The movie versions are an adaptation of the games and twists things to fit into a theatrical format. Resident Evil: Afterlife does that well, by turning Alice back into the character in the first movie, she kicks ass and keeps it human, rather than super-human. The 3D was a new take on the series and I think it was nice, but it would have been fine without it too. It seems that the craze right now in movies is 3D, but some movies should go without it and let the story bring in the audience not the gimmicks of 3D. The 3D in RE:A was exceptional, but sometimes no surprise, like the Axe man throwing the ax towards the screen. The movie takes place after RE:E which is good that the movies follow close behind each other. The story is basically Alice trying to find life after the world goes to hell. Yes, there is zombies, but the focus of this movie is ending the Umbrella Corporation. Many elements of this movie takes scenes from the RE Games 4 & 5. Out of all the RE movies made this had more similarities to the game than the previous films. People should remember that these filmmakers make these films to entertain, so other people that have negative things to say about this movie or any other movie for that matter should shut up and enjoy the movie rather than analyzing every little thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Nearly the Best in the Series!,"Before anyone judges me on this review, I have a very deep point to make about RE: Afterlife. It had silly stuff, it didn't make sense and yes there was an overdose of CGI, Even though those elements didn't work, it was still an excellent sequel. Probably the best sequel alongside the first entry from 2002.I have heard so much negativity be thrown at this film. And for what? Come on, there are far worse Horror films than this. Surprinsgly, to me, it was one of the best Sci-Fi/Action/Horrors I have ever seen in a long time. I loved Apocalypse and Extinction, but this one just pushed it a little bit more.The thing I want to defend the film on is the cramming in of characters from the game. Yes, maybe it is a little bit over the top, but it is not a game. It was freakin 2010. Horror films made for this generation are not going to become classics anytime soon! The RE (or Biohazard) games are what they are. The films, (especially this one, since we are up to entry 4 now) are what they are. Sure the adaptations are different but they are not lame. I think the films are actually a lot better than the games.I am so sick of hearing people say, this doesn't work and zombies can't swim or dig. Once again, get with the generation of this age! It is not ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) or ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), even though I love those films. This is Resident Evil! Not old time zombie films.By this stage, it was bound that the Resident Evil franchise would go over the top with everything and anything.There is something to me that makes this Resident Evil sequel more special than the previous 2. I thought after watching Exticntion (which I thought was fantastic) Afterlife was not gonna have a chance in hell of beating this one. Surprinslgy, it actually beats the two sequels! Afterlife is awesome. The violence and action is chaotic and full of more mayhem. I love many of the characters because of their different personalities, the environment and look of the film which is set in a modernized today environment which is ruined because of the Apocalypse w/ the jail setting was an excellent idea to set these characters in. It was more creepier because they could not escape, they were trapped in one place instead of moving around everywhere, like the other films. The area they're stuck in leaves them in total dread and peril. Not to mention the Axeman/Executioner was disturbing looking! They made him look good here. Even though he didn't get much screen time, I still like it. It's good how they brig big menaces back to the series (like Apocalypse had done before) was a cool twist to things! The only slight few problems I would say (mentioning above) is the film is unrealistic and there is too much use of CGI happening.Overall, Resident Evil Afterlife was the most kickass sequel, siding along with the first entry.It deserves 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Final Nail in the Resident Evil Coffin,"Resident Evil - Gave its in game routes an honourable mention.Resident Evil:Apocalypse - Returned full force bringing the excitement Resident Evil 3 to the big screen.Resident Evil:Extinction - Brought suspension of disbelief to scary new levels.Resident Evil:Afterlife - The fun stops here.After watching the latest installment in the now name only Resident Evil movie franchise, I can make one safe assumption.Paul Anderson no longer cares.Relying on a son, nephew or young game playing male influence for research, a book of every zombie movie cliché nearby and a malevolent grin while sat behind his type writer knowing a gullible cash ready audience awaits he has penned the latest travesty in his movie credit library.Plot wise the movie has none. There's a loose and random weave about survivors looking for hope in a world now long beyond saving who through a variety of convenient plot points find themselves in peril repeatedly.As if the unanswered questions from the third installment still going unanswered wasn't enough - We have yet more fuel for the fire with ""WTF"" moments, random slow motion (designed no doubt to build tension in moments that are already laughable!) and scenes installed to wow the crowds who forked out the extra for the 3D seats.The return of a few old characters and introduction of new, doesn't really help the plot go anywhere. The extra characters are with us so briefly that we aren't given anytime to care whether they live or die. In fact the returning heroins characters development stalls at the opening credits and by the end of the movie I didn't care if Milla survived or not.Borrowing far to heavily from Resident Evil 5, villains, characters, scene for scene remakes proves how lazy the movie writers have actually become. Unexplainable situations arise if only to insert a game moment that will have 12 years old jumping up and down with excitement. The movie itself carries a 15 certificate which seems highly inflated since its target audience is in fact the 12 year old life blood that keeps movies like this alive.The same 12 year olds who littered the front row at the cinema will be glad to know the unavoidable cash hungry sequel will be on our screens in 2015 apparently - Leaving just enough time for Capcom to pen the game sequel Anderson can rip off to use as the basis of Resident Evil:Retribution.I'm a long time fan of the Resident Evil series, just because I'm 28 doesn't mean I cant enjoy what is clearly a popcorn movie. What I don't enjoy is seeing what had serious potential reduced to laughable proportions epic in scale.Sitting opposite Skyline as one of the worst movies this decade, Resident Evil:Afterlife proves that Milla will never live up to her potential as an actress, Paul Anderson will never win an Oscar and that a successful game to movie transition remains just out of reach again.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Destroying the franchise...,"It's a 3rd rate movie, with none existent story that all manages to do is combining some music with some stolen characters from other movies like Silent Hill and Matrix and fully destroying the Resident Evil franchise once and for all.Dude, it was not suppose to be a MTV video clip or commercial. Write a story first, then shoot the scenes. It's funny that after this mess, they had the nerve to open the door for the next part too!Although I didn't watch the 3D version of the movie, I must say: Very disappointing experience...

"A hot mess that doesn't just lose the plot, it shreds it, eats it, and craps it out again","We're given a decent start that fulfills the promise of Extinction, the aggravatingly generic Ali Larter is re-introduced, and we get a new cast of poorly sketched zombie-bait with to not particularly care about. They do have back-stories, it's just that they'd fit on a postcard, in big lettering, with plenty of room to spare for the address. All of them on one postcard, I mean.But it's at least competent until about half way through, at which point director Paul W. S. Anderson seems to entirely forget everything that writer Paul W. S. Anderson set up in the first act. He removes Alice's superpowers, and then with absolutely no explanation, they're back again. Ali Larter seems to gain some from being filmed in slow motion in a wet shirt. The zombie-bait gets chewed up with an abruptness that's meant to be surprising but just gives us no time to care about their endings, while lacking the effective jump-scares of Extinction.The third act is just laughably bad. Whole extended scenes are shot in slow motion, Anderson seem to think he's making a Matrix movie, and the villain is played by an actor so comically inept and anodyne that they might as well have done him entirely with CGI and got someone half competent to voice-over.And then just when you think it's mercifully over, it turns into a ""to be continued"" setup for Retribution.So we get half a movie, and not the better half, but the loud, dumb half that takes itself too seriously to have any fun.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If this is the afterlife, it's boring","Alice is back again but she could have stayed away. She returns to kick more zombie butt, too bad she does in it such an old, been-there-done-that fashion. Tired effects from 1999 were used way too much in the movie. What happened? Did somebody see the original Matrix and think, ""Ooo let's let Alice run wild with these cool effects?"" It would have been coolat the turn of the century. Now, it's just plain boring. How many times have you seen the effect where the subject is frozen and the camera swings around them? Or how about the slow motion bullet dodge. That effect has been used in everything from commercials to Stewie and Lois on the family guy.When it comes to the scare factor and gore, the scare factor was weak. Again the producers used a warmed over effect, the peeled open face thing from the Blade series. It would have been better to see Alice and company kill zombies the old fashioned way, with wired acrobatic martial arts moves, knives, swords, guns and bombs.The gore factor was mild, no arterial blood squirting in 3D or anything. Speaking of that, why is the movie in 3D? It adds absolutely nothing to the experience or the story. O.k. Hollywood it's been a couple of years now of having America sit in theaters with plastic glasses on, enough is enough.The movie company already has a Resident Evil 5 in the works. Boy, they do know how to beat a dead horse. (Spoiler alert) Trecia Helfer (6 from Battlestar Galactica) is great but do you really want to pay full price to see her in future zombie flick #5? So, in a nutshell if you like the series it doesn't really matter if it's good or not you'll pay full price to see Alice.

This set of films plays out more like a comic book than most comic book movies.,"I really enjoy the Resident Evil films and this one is no exception. Sure, you really have to suspend your disbelief for some of the stuff, but it is akin to suspending your disbelief in any comic book or fantasy film. These films are telling an interesting story and they do a lot better from one film to another than other big budget movies. Alice continues to wage her war on the Umbrella corporation leading an assault on their headquarters in Japan. Her troops, the many clones of herself. Unfortunately, though she is able to exact a bit of revenge, she also loses her powers thanks to the villain Wesker. Though she rather prefers to be human I think she would be better off with her powers. Well she ends up trying to find those she saw flying off to a safe haven in Alaska, she makes it there only to find a field of planes and no sign of humans other than Claire Redfield who has some strange device on her. Well they end up holed up in a maximum security prison and it becomes overrun and then a big dude comes and chaos ensues. Great action, Milla is probably my favorite heroine in film right now. Well I would say scratch the probably, she is. The film also does really good at making the film look like a 200 million dollar blockbuster on a 60 million dollar budget. The end most certainly suggests another film and I am most certainly up for another go around. I just enjoy the films, they are fun and fast and usually have good action and zombies. They may not be works of art, but they keep me entertained and I applaud this series for that, as I also applaud them for keeping the story intact and not completely ignoring stuff from the previous movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil: Afterlife (0.5 Stars),"""Resident Evil"" is, so far, a 4-part movie franchise that's four movies too many so far. I hate this movie, and those who loved this will probably hate me for hating this. It's complicated. So before I continue, let me get something out of the way. Those who enjoy big- budgeted, mindless, extremely mindless zombie movies will enjoy ""Resident Evil: Afterlife."" And if you're one of those people, I advise for you to stop reading this review by the end of this paragraph. End paragraph.Here we go. Early narration tells us that the T-Virus has spread on a worldwide scale. Almost everyone's a zombie. We also learn that the bastards responsible for making the T-Virus are still experimenting with it underground. We're at the fourth installment, and I think it is time to revisit an observation made by Roger Ebert that questions the existence of the T-Virus, and this damn franchise. He ponders, ""We never understand how Umbrella hopes to make money with a virus that kills everyone.""Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/resident-evil-afterlife- movie-review/",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"3D, the only little savior for this otherwise dud...","The beginning despite being ""inspired"" from Matrix promised a lot. Though all good things come to end but it should not be this quick. The movie loses pace and viewers' interest as well. One does not expect acting skills in movie based on a game and in this you should not expect a ""script"" either. Characters come in abruptly and have no defined role in the movie. Jovovich does what she does best but nothing even close to special or jaw-dropping. Miller & Larter are the biggest waste. But can't blame the actors when they have no script to display their talents.The few positives: 3D, background score and screenplay. Afterlife is one of the better 3D movies. Very well shot with appropriate camera angles, the screenplay is as per the requirement and the background score when the action begins is impressive.Go watch only if you are Resident Evil fan or have nothing else to kill time.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
wow,"I just think it's strange that there have been 1 or 2 decent films in this series. Extinction was a decent movie. How do they keep getting Mila to come back and do these terrible ones. I mean that's barely B quality. I only got 1/3rd of the way through this junk it's so painful.. i mean PAINFUL. To even attempt to watch this mindbogglingly terrible ""film"" making i need pot, alcohol and many pills. But then I'd be dead before the movie ended. So I guess my question is, how does a movie this terrible get anywhere near the rating it has? I mean, I can't trust the ratings on this website anymore. I've seen quality, good movies get worse ratings than this thing. It's disturbing I tell you. What is wrong with people? If i had the option i would rate it -10 out of 100.

Disappointing,"I have been waiting for this movie to come out for about 2 years. Expecting a thrilling action-filled zombie flick like its predecessors, all I could find was one of the most boring, unthought-of and painfully predictable films I had the misfortune of seeing. The action scenes were scarce, too short and not particularly interesting; the special effects were shallow, almost amateurish, and not innovating in any way; and the plot was practically nonexistent. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen that would justify my expectations, only to be disappointed again and again with every passing minute. The only climax in the movie was the opening scene. But even that was not much more than a pale imitation of one ""the matrix'"" fight scenes.To sum up: you already watched all the interesting parts in the trailer. Don't bother with the rest.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil AfterLife Is Okay But Not The Greatest,"Resident Evil Afrerlife is okay but not the greatest that has flaws which I'll get into later from writer/director Paul Anderson. It's the fourth film in the Resident Evil series.Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice the unstoppable killing machine heroine and she's perfect as the character who can still kick some serious ass while looking beautiful doing it. I just wish they had given her more to do -acting wise- than just killing countless undead zombies and various monsters (includine one with a giant axe) most likely created by the Umbrella Corporation.Ali Larter also returns as Claire Redfield from the third film who joins Alice once again in her quest to find survivors. Larter does what her role requires and she gets a decent action scene near the end.Wentworth Miller plays Claire's brother Chris who unfortunately doesn't really serve any real purpose except as a nod to die Resident Evil game fans. Miller's performance isn't that bad it's just his character isn't really developed or his relationship with Claire.Shawn Roberts seemed to be doing his best Agent Smith from the Matrix impression as the villain Albert Wesker unless thats how his character acts in the games. He gets two scenes the beginning and the end so for somebody who's supposed to be the main villain he's not in that much at all. His fight at the end between Claire and Chris felt anti-climatic. Not to mention it doesn't last very long either. A third act that had the same problem some other films (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Transformers 2 to name a few) did as well when the main bad guy is easily defeated within a few minutes.The rest of the cast including Kim Coates, Boris Kodjoe, and a brief cameo by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine are okay but none of them are given any development, substance, or depth.The action sequences are okay but nothing we haven't seen before and there's no tension or suspense. The fact that there's no humor didn't help either. The zombies are all right despite not getting half as much screen time as they did in the previous three films. The monster with the huge Axe was decent despite just showing up with no explanation something a lot of the creatures do.And what was the purpose of taking away Alice's powers early on if it doesn't have any effect at all besides turning her human again? Because a minute later she somehow survives a plane crash in the mountains and apparently walks away without a scratch. This just didn't make a whole lot of sense like many other things. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief when it comes to movies but only to a point.The ending was predictable and a cameo by a certain character during the credits seemed a little pointless expect to set up for another sequel. At 97 minutes Resident Evil Afterlife wasn't that bad it just suffers from the sequel curse by cramming too much into one movie. The film seemed to be made purely for the action which may please some but I like to have a compelling story with well developed character, drama, emotion, suspense, and humor to go along with the spectacle.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A disappointment, not worth watching","The movie turned out to be complete disappointment. It just seems like trying to cash the last drops by making sequels of popular series. The biggest loophole is the lack of clear plot. The movie is extremely slow in the beginning and is barely watchable. However it pics up some speed in later half. But it has the same old action scenes without any purpose or any flow if storyline. Mila too fails to deliver an effective performance. She seems to be in hurry to complete the movie and move to the next story. Also, her kick ass scenes are becoming boring and repetitive. People who has watched the previous parts would be disappointed with action scenes. And the new audience would be confused as to what is happening. Overall the movie does not even represent typical zombie flick. And made me feel waste of my time.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Killed by the third dimension,"The Resident Evil films have been on a long slide downhill since the stylish first movie. But that is expected.What spoiled the film for me was the awful 3D. I am not a 3d fan to begin with but this was just terrible.While mega action is going on you are distracted by shell cases and masonry flying at you, when you glance back to screen the zombies are all dead and Mila is moving on. The shots from the air looked like someone holding an airfix plane in front of a poster. The gratuitous shots of double pistols pointing down the screen were cartoonish and over used. Token pieces of furniture were projected 3d so it looked like the actors were in a drama studio with a backdrop and a couple of props stage front.About a third of the film is shot using compound camera trickery. Anytime someone as much as asks to pass the mustard everything slows down to bullet time and a random object looms out the screen at you.The plot, acting etc. are all negligible, the film is at least a thousand times cheesier than the first; but what do you expect? I look forward to getting my hands on the 2d DVD.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

OK - perhaps I'm being a little cruel but the reality is, unless you're a die hard fan of this franchise, you'll be left wondering where the last 2 hours of your life went. Milla Jovovich does what she can to rescue a weak story line. No 2 scenes really add up, however she is supported by a largely talented cast.

Cheese fest + good paced action,"Tokyo slow-mo opening scene was amazing.Soundtrack is out of this world, it felt authentic but at the same time brought back good old MM feel from original RE. I re-watched the movie and almost every time I heard a track on background it felt as if it was taken from some other movie (except the opening). Honestly, RE:A doesn't deserve it just because they are on completely different levels but it saves the movie for me, plus the pacing of it.It's a super cheese fest, sometimes I even felt as if watching a Bollywood movie - on a brink of a laugh. At the very least I had a grin.Performances. Well, Jovovich is good but best performance goes to Kim Coates, even being as small as it is. And Wentworth Miller is so Prison Break... seems like he adapts one attitude to everything, no diversity.Besides that I don't like movies which change cameras for some of scenes, they feel out of place, the well known FPS is different and it just destroys that momentary believability you have, if you can have one for RE:A at all.Yet I think it's a good evening entertainment watch and if you have a keen ear then the OST should become one of your favorites.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Action packed, loud, and an awesome fourth installment.","Resident Evil: Afterlife (4 out of 5 stars).The fourth film does deliver a lot of action, visuals, and an awesome music score by Tomandandy. The story continues after the third movie. With Alice attacking an Umbrella lab. With an exciting explosive sequence. The film has a lot of action to make this entertaining. With faster mutated zombies. A monster called Axeman. Which had an awesome sequence with Alice and Claire fighting the axeman. And Wesker being the main villain was a fun add on. Fans of the game will see a similiar fight scene from one of the games.The movie is fast paced. Loud. And non stop exciting. And intense with the music score. I did find the movie script to be cheesy with dialogue and some action scenes. There is a lot of slow mo action scenes which was trying to deliver an awesome 3D experience. The cinematography is great. Paul Anderson did a great job in delivering the action sequences. And i cant wait to see where it goes next. The ending ends in a cliffhanger.

Resident Rubbish,"So...Where do I begin? The film received a lot of hype on this site due to it's 3-D nature. I read so many comments claiming that this was the best live-action film to utilise 3-D since James Cameron's Avatar. I personally thought the 3-D was poorly executed even though the director utilised the proper technology in order to shoot the film completely in 3-D. During the film I kept on lifting my 3-D glasses in order to see the difference, and apart from a very clear, crisp picture, I can't say that the 3-D added a significant amount of depth to any of the scenes. So, if you are thinking of going to the cinema to watch this one in 3-D, my advice would be to avoid it at all costs...The plot? Well, it's pretty much in the same category with the other resident evil films, so if you are a big fan of the original on the psone then you are going to be disappointed yet again with this new instalment of the resident evil franchise. The acting is sub-par at best, too many slow-mo scenes which are badly executed and a general cheesiness to the whole of the film still exists.If you are new to the Resident evil live action films, my advice would be for you to avoid it, as it will most likely feel like a waste of time.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a Bloody Mess - it just makes no sense in spots,"In a post apocalyptic world one might tend to think that basic necessities such as food and water would make it to the top of ones hit list. From the opening Alice clone attack it's obvious that what working class survivors are left are manufacturing ammunition. Lots of ammunition. Lots of magic ammunition that automatically reloads itself.It's obvious that one pair of clones are simply mirror images. A blatant and cheap looking way to save money on the special effects.Also, other than food and water it is obvious the ruby red lipstick and hairspray abound as Milla never looks the slightest bit disheveled. I am a fan of a hot, gun-toting babe looking her finest, nut a lack of lipstick and the occasional smudge would be more realistic.Up next is the aircraft graveyard when Alice goes to Alaska to search for Arcadia. The final two craft are helicopters parked underneath trees. This does not make sense since I have it on good authority that after their 1985-1987 border skirmish trees and helicopter rotors do not get along to this day.And did I mention the lipstick? Ali Larter's Claire character is introduced looking much more normal considering the circumstances and probably badly craves some lipstick. We are shown a device that Alice removes from her cute little tummy that may be important to the plot. Natch no mention is made of it again unless it was film that ended up on the cutting room floor.The feral Claire is tied up and thrown into the back of the plane that is powered by he same automatically fuel reloading technology as the ammo.Did I mention the lipstick? After a particularly unbelievable on the roof plane landing we proceed to the main setting, a prison that a small group of survivors has holed up in. One of the few things that makes sense, Fortified prison walls would be more zombie proof. This prison comes complete with the same magic technology as it still has running water. Miracuously Claire's brother has survived and is being held prisoner in the prison - yet not in a prison cell. By the time of their reunion Claire has cleaned up nicely and has the requisite magic lip coating.In order to get the action going we have the introduction of one huge axe wielding boss zombie. Can't have those pesky survivors stay holed up where it's safe.In a last ditch attempt to improve their chances versus the impending released by Mr. huge axe zombie a failed attempt at procurement of a huge armored vehicle the group and removal of the plane as an option (from the roof that is obviously too small of a runway by the resident evil sleazebag human) the group is forced to take to the sewers to reach Arcadia. By now we know this is a ship that has acquired Time Lord technology and is much larger on the inside than the outside.Resident evil human sleazebag has miraculously survived crashing the plane onto the Arcadia and has teamed up with the over the top uber-villain from the initial Alice clone attack at the beginning.Long story short - good triumphs over evil because it's nicer in one final magic ammunition display and a ""Whoa, I never saw that planting the bomb in the uber villain.s plane"" Yes, this is sarcastic.Numerically the rating I give is basically a 1 out of 10. Add another point for Milla just because she's hot. Add another half point for the Ed Woodian laughter and another half point for the, ""Oh well, did you really expect high art?"" factor.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

RE Afterlife rocks in 3D!,"I was lucky I was invited to the premiere in 3D and boy I loved it!! The whole movie is full of very fast action sequences which are largely enhanced by the 3D feature.

Mila J. rocks as Alice (as usual ;) and the other characters are awesome (specially Ali Larter as Claire and the guy from Prison Break as Chris). There are way more zombies but less zombie-action but that doesn't mean the survivors weren't busy...Wesker looks and acts a lot like his video game self, so that is a plus for the gamers who go see it. Now, here is the important bit of this review: If you haven't seen the other three films, do yourself a favor and watch'em before watching this one; otherwise you'll be lost from the first action sequence up to half the movie at least...

Very Mediocre Film In Every Aspect ( keep in mind I am a fanatic of the video game series ),"I'm sure this has been reiterated a lot, but this series of films is drifting further and further away from any concept of the original ideas ( from the video games themselves. ) With that being said, it's not entirely a bad idea to go on that path, but the films are terribly inconsistent with each other. The 1st film was good & suspenseful like a RE movie should be. The 2nd was tolerable and somewhat within the plot of RE. The 3rd was the beginning of an end.I truly like some Anderson's work as a director ( Mortal Kombat, RE, Event Horizon ) but this was a terrible concoction.Milla is a solid actress and on-screen performer, but did we really need to hear her sulk & pout about some plot that's completely irrelevant to the franchise? I mean it's bogus how conflicting the plots are to begin with.As for the 3D graphics ( this is the 1st & only film I've seen in 3D in theatres ) I was utterly disappointed. Most notably when Alice throws some ninja star type weapons at the camera. I mean, Underworld: Evolution had an almost duplicate scene like that without any 3D and it blows the outcome away. The only 3D viewing I enjoyed from this movie was the Executioner Majini's wet-room fight.You could say the film is unpredictable and will leave you on the edge of your seat, but it also makes you question it in every instance.This film series would have been a tonne more appreciated & acclaimed if it had followed the video games more closely and not drifted off. I tolerated the 1st few with a completely made up main character / protagonist because I was elated to see the series come to films. But this film draws the line, sadly I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.Let me put it this way; when Tomb Raider video games came to the big screen they only needed a babe ( Jolie ) to fill any void and do some action, because there's not much history or plot to the games, sheer action. But Resident Evil follows a strict timeline and maintains a pretty consistent synopsis throughout the main games ( RE,RE2,RE3NEMESIS,RECODEVERONICA,RE4,RE5. ) I don't understand how in the 3rd instalment of Anderson's films has the whole world gone deserted, left to an underground secret agency.The biggest grudge about this movie itself ( and the series ) is Wesker is only introduced in Extinction... He's a vital part of the 1st video game and an evolving storyline. This film series may as well have been called something else, like Biolulzard. It goes from a serious film ( RE ) to a comical flick ( Apocalypse ) to a paranormal caravan ( Extinction ) and lastly a psycho drama ( After-Life. ) If there's another in the works, sure I'll watch it because Anderson is capable of quality, but this is a glaring example of misrepresentation. Capcom should not have let you go on with a 3rd and 4th movie. I sincerely hope Capcom allows a new team to interpret a new series of films/remakes.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as it could get,"The first 3 Resident Evils, to me, were the best movies ever made, and that's why i gave them all 10 out of 10!This one was a disappointment: There's TOO much slow motion, it's very short and looks A LOT like the video games (which would be a good thing, but it looks too much like a video game)! Also, there's barely a story behind the action and the characters are TOO fictional!I gave it a 5 out of 10 because it's Resident Evil, and Resident Evil is epic! If it were any other movie, i would probably give it a 3.Even though i said all of this, i recommend this movie because it's Resident Evil and it's still good, but i would try watching it in 3D, because it looks a lot better (that's the one thing good about the movie, the action parts look AMAZING in 3D).",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is one of the best sci-fi actions i have ever seen and it is so wel done, also the 3D just adds to the greatness and is in my opinion better than avatars 3d technology even though they were the same. Don't really understand the people who hate this movie.

Great job done this time,"Resident Evil- Afterlife is full of action,horror and some thrilling scenes .The Axeman fight is really a fantastic experience to be watched. I have watched this movie 4 times since its release.One first day ,i watched it twice.Those dogs are really masterpiece and reminds the game-play of RE5.Wesker is now a powerful and intelligent guy in movie.I loved every action sequence of movie and hope i am going to watch it tomorrow again.If you love non stop action sequence and stunts,it is movie for you,do not go for finding a story or logic in movie,just watch and enjoy it.One more thing i love is shotgun fire which comes with a lot of coins.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as Extinction but it's not far off....,"Resident Evil: Afterlife is one of the movies of 2010 that I have been quite intrigued in because, as well as wondering how the tedious series has yet again gotten another sequel, I actually started to wonder whether this could actually be the Resident Evil movie I've been waiting for. After watching a great trailer and some promising clips of the movie and then seeing the movie, I suggest you just stick with the clips and trailers because that way, you won't be disappointed. So taking off where Resident Evil: Extinction ended, Alice continues to fight against the Umbrella Corporation with the help of 'a few friends'. Following new information, she heads to Los Angeles to find a small group of survivors of the T-Virus outbreak. The survivors attempt to seek out more survivors, escape the zombie-infested city and bring down Umbrella once and for all. The first thing that sticks out like a sore thumb in Resident Evil: Afterlife is the story and how confusing it is at times. Luckily, I have seen Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Resident Evil: Extinction but if you haven't seen those then you may not find it easy to follow the story. The flashbacks don't do the story any favours because, even though they're supposed to explain things, they just confuse matters and aren't really needed. Resident Evil: Afterlife is all action and even then, the action scenes aren't worth going to the cinema to watch as the best action scenes last about fifteen minutes (ten minutes if you take the slow-motion Matrix effect out, which I will talk about later in the review).Granted that the Resident Evil movie series was more about action and less about story but at least the stories in the last three movies weren't confusing and looked like a bit of attention went into them. Resident Evil: Afterlife doesn't have that same attention and instead becomes a mess of all action and no story. The next thing the movie didn't have was hardly any character development or even characters, they were all written so badly. There are only two characters in the movie who have their own personality, Alice is obviously one of them as we see her fight zombies and monsters with a disadvantage and Wesker, fighting to make the T-Virus work for superhuman abilities shown in the previous movies. The other characters blend in with each other and you couldn't care about them at all, none of them stood out on their own and they were about as much use as a chocolate fireguard when it came to surviving against zombies but they did have their moments. Another thing about Resident Evil: Afterlife that isn't so great is the acting. Milla Jovovich and Shawn Roberts are great as Alice and Wesker but the same can not be said for the rest of the cast. Ali Larter plays Claire Redfield and she's very wooden throughout most of the movie and doesn't convince you of her character at all. Wentworth Miller plays Chris Redfield and has the same problem that Ali Larter has but his character isn't really given much to do, which is also another annoying thing about the movie. We're introduced to these characters and they're not given a proper story as to who they are and how they get there. They tell us about themselves in a sentence or two and we're supposed to understand the character straight away. The script feels so lazy and horrible and tries to answer questions only to have the opposite effect and raise more. The movie felt like it was three movies mixed into one: Alice bringing down Umbrella, Alice finding the survivors and trying to find Arcadia and the survivors battling Wesker and therefore didn't feel like I was watching an entire movie.Read the rest of this review at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com and search for 'Resident Evil: Afterlife'Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Resident Evil, After......","If After.... this fourth installment of the series, they make another one, I am surely to not watch this. As much as I enjoyed watching the first movie, and even the other two of the series, this one surely makes the worse of the four.Shot specifically to sell out as a 3D movie (and especially in Greece where I live they have this bad habit of translating the movie titles in whatever they think suits them, so the title was changed to Resident Evil: three dimensional escape!!!!!!! ), it doesn't even succeed in that. Silly action scenes, to facilitate the use of 3D, many clichés and non-existent dialog is what makes this film a total rubbish.There is so much exaggerating in this movie, that you just can't have any more. And there are times that it looks so bad, that it makes you wanna stop watching it.Too bad, because they cold make so much more from this franchise, if they really out some effort in it. I wont go into details, it isn't worth it. But have in mind, that there are better movies out there to watch, than this piece of nothingness!!!!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is the most incredible movie I have ever seen,"I'm writing a review less than twenty minutes after the start of the viewing.. But this movie is so beautiful that it makes me feel like the hero of this movie and I will write my review in the style of films in universe like this
Three minutes after infection: everything is fine, nothing special happens
Five minutes after watching this: although you think about how in a world where there is no one to extract gasoline, the main character can get to another continent - where she will take a working runway, an airplane.. But you refer to the fact that this is a kind of fantasy genre, you don't need to find fault with such trifles
Ten minutes after the start of watching: you catch a wild cringe, you have never seen such a tin that is happening here in your life. It seems that the film was shot by a schoolboy with the money that his parents give him to eat in the canteen, and he buys a subscription to WoW for them, and he has a little left to shoot the film - it's talking about the quality of everything that happens on the screen
15 minutes: acceptance - you put up with the fact that the screen is full of cannon fodder from both confronting sides, and the bulletproof tiltrotor is destroyed by the fall. And I could understand this if it was a hyperbolized film of the beginning of the '00s.. But the first two parts turned out to be quite good.. Unlike this one
20 minutes: understanding - I wanted to back on Imdb's page of the previous film and put the film still not four, but five stars, because.. There must be some difference between the films, despite the fact that even the previous one has already begun to turn out ""so-so"", as is often the case with assembly conveyor-projects, like Fast -n Furious and especially considering that this is also happens with video game films.. But I could hardly give five points for Third part.. I understand that this is not necessary
I know right now, how much stars i can get RE4. Of course, I will inspect it, because. I don't like to stop watching if I started.. But I don't believe that anything will pull this film, so I will publish a review now and do something that is incredibly difficult to do: it's 1/10
I can't imagine how you can make such a bad movie, how hard you had to try to make it so blunder.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Looking for violent entertainment?,"I must be honest that this is my first Resident Evil movie and I am not big into Zombies (except in Shaun of the Dead and Zombie Land) where Zombies are actually funny and not scary. I hate things that just pops up and scares people.So since I'm not big into the genre, I can't say that I really liked the movie. They did have some interesting filming angles, as well as great effect, however, the plot sucked. But I realized that is not the purpose of the Resident Evil franchise. So I do understand.I really don't see where this series is going, but I understand its appeal.I do however love Mia. She is one hot lady.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointed,"This has got to be the worst resident evil so far. there is no story, some action scenes are kinda stupid, and don't judge me wrong, i like a good action movie and am a huge fan of the resident evil trilogy, but this...OK 3D,wow, big deal! you can't base a movie only on the 3D element and some cool camera movement+stop motion. this movie just doesn't live up to the resident evil name :(. The good thing is that, if they shoot a sequel, they can't go any more wrong. there were lots of other things and one of them was that in some slow motion scenes, the characters' movement was a little strange (they really didn't seem to be running/jumping). if you are going to see this movie, see it in 3D...makes it less disappointing i guess.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Weak addition to the franchise, which was already at a weak state nonetheless","I decided to revisit Jovovich's Resident Evil franchise to wrap it up. I stopped watching at the fourth installment, but I realized I had to resume with the fourth movie because I didn't remember much of it. Now I know why I forgot this movie.So far, the worst of the franchise by far. Up untilResident Evil: Extinction (2007), the movies were not great, but they were not bad either. You need to see past the fact that this RE franchise is only loosely based on the games. But RE: Afterlife is just terrible.The CGI is amateur. I felt like I was watching a B horror movie. (Which is definitely not the case, here. This movie used an estimated 60 million budget.)The plot is about Alice trying to destroy Umbrella in the first 15 minutes. After that, the plot is about Alice trying to find Arcadia: the safe haven for humankind.With a bunch of puny jokes, cringe-worthy sentences, and laughable action scenes, this movie ends with a cliffhanger forResident Evil: Retribution (2012). Luckily, you only need to endure for 96 minutes. I guess the only reason I don't give it a 1 star is that this movie is about RE, so the setting is ok.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The worst one yet,"Having really enjoyed (at least as far as this series goes) the third entry in the 'Resident Evil' set of films, I was quite disappointed to see them take a step backwards in this one. 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' is my least favourite entry in the series to date. Interesting, my two least favourites, the original and this one, were both directed by series writer/producer Paul W.S. Anderson. The second and third entries, which he lent out to other directors, were far superior in my opinion. This is a disappointing fact, because I have two films to go in the series and he has directed both of them.The reasons I didn't enjoy this one as much were as follows. Firstly, this one is much slower than the other films in the series. At almost the halfway point in the run time the story is still being set up and characters are simply standing around introducing them self and discussing what to do. There are little hints of action here and there in the first half, but they are hardly anything worth mentioning. Secondly, it felt like this focused a lot more on style than actual substance. The opening scene is a prime example. Very very little actually happens in it, yet the whole thing is filmed in slow motion and with stylish camera angles to make us think this is a great scene.Also, it would have to be said that this series is starting to feel a little stale after four entries. You find yourself asking what exactly am I getting in this edition that I haven't already seen or experienced. I would love to see Anderson think a little outside the box for the next two entries. Try something different to mix it up a bit. Otherwise I feel this series really can't justify six entries.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A solid definite maybe,"I won't summarize the story because that has been done many times already. If you haven't seen the others before watching this one, then be prepared to be confused. It would be like walking into another movie halfway through as this one continues a story established in the previous movies.I love movies in general and I enjoy a wide variety of movies. I love mostly mindless gory action movies and love them even more if there are strange and terrifying monsters involved. Every once in a while I just want a little mindless entertainment and these types of movies provide it for me. If you want a thought provoking movie, then this movie is not for you.Don't go to see this if you want a lot of character development, a deep moving plot or a bulletproof story. Prepare to suspend reality at the door, expect a lot of guts and gore, expect loud explosions, expect unbelievable fight sequences and expect creepy things to jump out of nowhere for no other reason than to try to give you a heart attack. If you don't like those things then don't watch it and don't complain if you do see it against my advice. There are some people that like these types of movies and they will continue to pay to see them which ensures that more will be made.Here is what the movie did well. There was a lot of fighting, a lot of guns and explosions and a bunch of people and zombies dying. There were a couple of hot chicks if that's your thing and a couple of not unattractive guys if that's your thing. For once, there was a reasonable explanation for the excessive amount of guns and ammunition available to the main characters. The 3d made the creepy things jumping out towards you even more creepy. The movie planned on using 3d from the beginning which meant that the 3d was better executed than some of the 3d afterthoughts that have come out recently.Here is what the movie did poorly and why I gave it a 5/10. It relied a little too heavily on the 3d. The entire time I was watching it, I thought to myself that if I was watching it in 2d it would be a rather unimpressive member of the movie franchise. It threw in elements from the games without ever explaining them. I am not a big gamer at all and so these were lost on me and I had to look them up after the movie. There was a lot of slow motion during the fight scenes, again to take advantage of the 3d I think. It made the fights seem even more unbelievable than they normally are because everything is exaggerated. It's readily apparent when the characters meet each other as to who is zombie fodder and who will be left standing at the end. I know I said mindless entertainment but a little suspense couldn't hurt.Overall, I've seen much worse, but I've also seen better. If you like the Resident Evil movies in general for the good points I've listed above then you will enjoy this one. If you don't like the other Resident Evil movies then don't expect this to be any different. If you haven't seen the others yet, rent them first because you won't really understand what's going on. As always, it's a movie. What's more, it is a zombie movie which by definition requires some suspension of reality.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Nutshell Review: Resident Evil: Afterlife,"Think Resident Evil the movies, and the first image that'll come to mind will be Milla Juvovich as Project Alice kicking zombie butt. It's been some 8 years since Juvovich became synonymous with the Resident Evil movie franchise, and personally, I still enjoyed the first one best, followed by Extinction, then Apocalypse for its really awful story. If I have to rate this one, I'll put it below the first and third films in that order, where once again it has its special effects, which is really an amalgamation of things seen before, to save the movie from its weak plot.Paul W.S. Anderson goes back to the director's chair after giving up directing responsibilities for the sequels, assuming only producing and writing credits, and although it's widely touted as having used James Cameron's 3D technology, Afterlife hasn't actually benefited from that because of the way scenes were crafted that didn't exploit that technology fully like what Cameron did for Avatar. Either that, or we're already too tired with the gimmick, and this one doesn't offer anything new to provide any instance of Wow. We don't require any more depth in field please, at least some depth in plot rather than something that looked to have jumped straight out of Prison Break.That's right, Prison Break, with the largest tongue-in-cheek joke being the casting of Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield, brother of Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) who was introduced in the previous film. The first shot of Chris was within a prison cell within a prison, and the irony of it all is when he alone holds the key to everyone else's salvation from blood thirsty flesh lusting zombies trying to get past the high walls and heavy gates, which they eventually do to provide our ensemble human survivors, led by Alice, a fight sequence or two.You may grumble that plot is secondary here so long as we get to see the hotness that is Milla Juvovich grace the big screen and doing what she does best in the franchise. True, Juvovich's Milla undergoes a glam facelift from the grungy look in the previous installment, but even her strikingly beautiful features can't save the film from slipping into the territory of bore. The prologue started off wonderfully though, with its moody atmospherics to canonize how the Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus got unleashed, and picked up from where the last film left off with the salivating promise of a whole bunch of Alice clones all waiting to be awoken to kick Umbrella's behind. Once the fight sequence is over, which included a nice way to get rid of Alice's invulnerability and god-like abilities, there's only so much one can stand on Alice flying around and lull you into a deep sleep with a lot of voice-over mumbo-jumbo.Reuniting with Claire Redfield and trying to figure out the promise of a zombie-free land in Arcadia mentioned in Extinction, Afterlife fell prey to a bunch of movie clichés, that even you can guess who will bite the dust first amongst a group of survivors, who will survive, who will turncoat in loyalty, and so on. There's no real threat here offered by the villains, led by Umbrella head honcho Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) that he looked quite the typical egomaniac who can't just pull the trigger fast enough to get rid of his enemies. Other than that, the finale fight involves two CG rabid dogs that seriously, nobody will think will pose a threat to Alice, even in her vulnerable state. Plot loopholes are plentiful, but don't expect the CG effects to compensate for that. As already mentioned, the 3D here is nothing to shout about.I was a tad disappointed as well with the fight scenes, which seem more like a rehash of what's on offer from the earlier films, with only Claire/Alice's battle with the Axeman (Ray Olubowale) the only fight sequence something worth mentioning. Otherwise for those who are still keen to sit through the end credits, you'll get a coda involving Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) that will only make sense to fans out there, who will celebrate in knowing that the 3D ticket sales had boosted numbers enough for another Resident Evil film to be added to the franchise.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Looks good, does nothing","At this point in the franchise, I have to ask, who is still watching the Resident Evil movies that actually enjoys them? Does anyone glean any excitement, interest or just plain, simple entertainment value from these films? Because, based on what is on display in Resident Evil: Afterlife, unless you are interested in watching a stream of unexciting action sequences with little or no grounding in reality, you will mostly likely walk away from the film with nothing but a feeling of derision.Resident Evil: Afterlife picks up where the last entry, Resident Evil: Extinction, ended, with Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her endless stream of clones assaulting the Japanese headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation, who have caused the majority of the world's population to be transformed into flesh eating zombies (I hate it when that happens). After bringing down the head of this particular unit, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts, one of the worst actors I have seen in some time), Alice travels to Alaska to meet up with a group of survivors led by Claire (Ali Larter). However, she finds only Claire still there, and Claire's memories are gone and she has a device resembling a beetle attached to her chest that is causing both her memory loss and some rather anti-social behavior. Alice and Claire decide to fly down the coast in search of other survivors, finding a group holed up in a prison outside L.A., comprised, among others, of Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Hollywood producer Bennet (Kim Coates), and Claire's brother, Chris (Wentworth Miller). The group must try to escape the legions of the undead surrounding the prison and reach a large tanker ship off the coast that represents their only hope for survival.Resident Evil: Afterlife is a film that exists for one purpose and one purpose only: to string together fight after fight, shootout after shootout, all of them choreographed and photographed with various slick camera techniques that should, I suppose, raise your pulse. That is all the film even attempts to accomplish, because it doesn't really try to do anything else. The story, what there is of one, is both barely an afterthought and mostly cribbed from other zombie movies, such as Night of the Living Dead. Afterlife isn't even trying to be a horror film anymore, which its predecessors weren't really accomplished at, but gave a passing thought to the concept. This is an action movie, through and through, but since the characters are basically non-entities, there is nobody to root for, so all you are doing is watching bodies and objects in motion, with nothing to give any additional depth to any of the proceedings.The acting is mostly a non-issue, because the people on screen are there simply to shoot guns or get knocked off in various zombie attacks. When any of the characters get killed, there isn't even a moment's thought as to their well-being; they are cardboard cutouts, not people. The film introduces Chris as Claire's brother, but that plot development is as pointless as any other in the film, because other than the briefest exchange of dialogue to establish this fact, it serves absolutely no purpose to the story or to the characters. The film does itself an even greater disservice by casting Roberts in the role of the villain, because you would swear they just plucked a random body off the street, not actually went through the process of hiring someone who claims to be an actor, as Robert's performance is akin to someone reading text off a teleprompter. How can the audience root against someone who is so lifeless, without even an iota of energy?Are the action sequences cool looking? Sure, but nothing so impressive to make your forget films such as The Matrix where some of the techniques and images were obviously lifted from. And without any feeling to proceedings, there is nothing for you to invest in. There is no suspense, no excitement, no horror, no nothing to Afterlife. It just is, sitting there looking pretty, and isn't even afforded the decency of a real ending, just some scenes serving as a potential setup for yet another Resident Evil movie. And, as I started off this review, is there any audience that really wants another one? Is there someone waiting, clamoring for yet another Resident Evil film? I find it hard to believe.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Biggest Matrix spoof this side of Revolutions...,"Firstly, i'd like to explain why i rated this movie at 3 stars and not ZERO: 'cause it's really visually impressive, credit where credit's due. Just eye candy, from first to last minute. HOWEVER, that's all there is to it, as with many sci-fi wannabe hit movies, but with a sinister twist to it: absolutely no cohesion (visual progression/sets and general story-telling included).This movie would have generated 20 or 30 good trailers, as long as 2-3 min snippets were kept separate and no one actually watched the movie.Lastly, this is the movie that most boldly assumes the Matrix Trilogy has been either forgotten or remained unwatched by a younger generation. While i applaud the liberty taken to re-shoot bullet dodging scenes and ""bullet time"", maybe as an attempt to break the monopoly of the famed -now classic- Trilogy over it, it deeply disgusts me that even the wardrobe is spoofed. Wardrobe, some superpowers, some character development, camera angles and general scene perspective, CGI, the pace of the action, excessive similarity of quite a few scenes (!?), fight-scenes and concepts, self-cloning characters, and even a non-neutral hue throughout most of the movie which gets situationally changed (as in The Trilogy and its greenish hue).So, this movie isn't really a collection of clichés as some reviewers have said. It's one single giant Matrix-spoof-turned-part-of-a-franchise thing. Really, no one has ever copied it so boldly (or with such a straight face) before. Too bad that being uncreative and sleazily plagiarizing does not a good movie make.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wait for the DVD if you're going to watch it...IMO.I guess I give it a 5 for the remix song at the end performed by A Perfect Circle. 5 meaning the rating goes up just because of the song, without, the rating would be lower. Good remix of a good song.Is it too much to ask for a better plot?

Should have been so much more.,"With a good concept, decent actors and a strong budget, I had expected more. The action is great, even if the slow-mo is a bit excessive at times. The problem is what happens between the action, or rather, the lack of anything happening between the action.This movie is just a series of action cutscenes edited together into some sort of a movie, but there is no storytelling going on at all. It feels like the director couldn't be bothered doing anything but the action scenes. There is nothing smart, no suspense and no thrill. Just action that looks like its copied straight from ""The Matrix"", but without the finesse, and that leaves you feeling indifferent and unimpressed.This movie suffers from the usual sequel virus, symptoms are less smarts, less story, less atmosphere and more CGI to compensate. It's unnecessary, lazy and insulting to the fans that the Resident Evil Franchise does not try to keep a higher level of quality, especially when they have the actors and the money to do something really good.Final verdict is that the movie is ""ok"" for a Resident Evil fan, but even for a fan this is pushing the lower quality limit. Personally I hope they get another director for the next movie, like Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott, imagine that.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the ""best"" is at the beginning with Milla clones ravaging the Umbrella base in Tokyo (all destroyed by a nuclear explosion) and our ""original"" Milla that survived a frontal crash of the airplane she was in with a mountain.Her attitude is quite peculiar, indeed.

"""Afterlife"" is a guilty pleasure, but far from a good film","** out of (****)Are you tired of all the post conversion three dimensional films? How they are so artificial and rather than being in 3-D, it's like 2.5D. Are you tired of the filmed 3-D movies that sacrifice CGI and high production values for filmed 3-D? Are you fed up with filmmakers using cheap 3-D cameras and the product being mediocre? Don't you just hate it when films take themselves too seriously and you just want to sit back and enjoy a fun popcorn flick? If the answers to all the questions is a ""no"", you've come to the right place. Make no mistake, Resident Evil: Afterlife was filmed in 3-D and is no post conversion money grab. Moreover, the 3-D cameras that Paul W.S. Anderson used for Afterlife, were the exact same cameras James Cameron used for his action packed extravaganza ""Avatar"". While the 3-D may add a plethora of money to the budget, is this a cheap film? Fortunately, it is not. The production values are quite solid and the images on screen look so crystal clear and the film has such a nice gritty atmosphere. To add to the fun factor, the third dimensions is highly gimmicky as numerous things come flying at your face. But the question is, is the film itself satisfactory or does the 3-D make the film?To answer the thesis statement, it's unfortunately a yes. Without the 3-D, it would feel like another paint-by-numbers action flick but instead is ten times more stylized. Come to think of it, it is a pretty forgettable and generic outing. Also, the script and characters don't help matters. Albeit, no one can protest about the plot because there simply was none. Afterlife showcases expositions, 3-D, women with weaponry, and highly stylized action set pieces. It certainly is no ""Godfather"" so make sure before going in, you do acknowledge that. Now, what did I expect while seeing the fourth installment in the highly iconic franchise? I just expected impressive 3-D, awe-inspiring action set pieces, and just an overall fun time. Unfortunately, I have to say that the movie met my expectations because it's the truth. The inner, highly judgmental movie reviewer wanted to loathe this movie to the deep core and simply view it to add it in my bottom ten of 2010 list, but, it delivered surprisingly.The 3D: 10/10. Words can't describe the epicness of Afterlife's third dimension. The 3D is so fascinating because it actually feels like you're trapped in the movie. I can definitely tell these were the same 3D cameras James Cameron used for ""Avatar"" and that's the biggest complement a 3D movie can have. I'm a sucker for gimmicky 3-D and it truly delivered in that aspect. Although, there are some scenes that use the more subtle technique, but those scenes are probably only twenty five percent of the movie. Listen to me carefully, only view the film in 3D! It's a huge waste of money not to see it in 3D. Trust me.The Action: 7/10. Had the action been like the first and last ten minutes for the whole movie, my score would have easily been a ""10"". However, most of the action, while still solid, is pretty much generic. Also, while the occasional moments of fantastic action occurred, they were blatant rip-offs of The Matrix (the knife throw scene, the glass shooting scene, the dodging bullets scene, the ""run-on-the-wall-and-do-a-flip"" sequence, and many more). Still, the action was good.Cinematography: 10/10. Easily a ""10"". The movie has a mammoth budget of sixty billion dollars and it clearly shows. The visuals are so enriching and have so much depth. This film was shot in several different locations.Pacing: 7/10. The pacing was pretty good. Some nice breather scenes and when the action graced the silver screen, the word ""epic"" came to my mind.Overall, ""Afterlife"" is a fun action extravaganza. The cinematography, the 3-D, and the action pieces are all worth the price of a matinée. It's just an enjoyable popcorn flick. However, the script and character development aren't anything to write home about, which makes it hard for this guilty pleasure to warrant a recommendation. Either a matinée or rental will suffice.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best 3D experience ever!!!!!,"I saw avatar, Gulliver's travels, piranha, Chronicles of narnia 4step up 3 and resident evil 4 so far. I never enjoyed the others the way i enjoyed this movie.

The explosions and everything were really effective.It is also an edge of the seat thriller. I did not like the first or second as they seemed a bit poor comparably.Milla Jovovich was as usual fantastic. Ali Larter and everyone else were good. The music was excellent.

Escaping evil in 3D,"With each installment in this Resident Evil movie series right now they become slowly less like the games they are based on, with only having an occasional thing from the games added in, which is why I start to dislike these movies more and more because I am a fan of the games and like playing them; now on with the fourth film, It does not change my mind on what I think about these films, especially since we have Paul W. S. Anderson. The fourth film Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) has below average performances, bad CGI effects, action sequences that defy physics and look stupid, bad editing choices, annoying uses of slow motion, and dumb characters who get their selves killed by whatever breaks into the prison; also, since the film was made for 3D, there were lots of moments that were obviously made for 3D that got annoying at times because of the bad effects when they were trying to make certain things look like they are flying into your face.Alice, played blandly by Milla Jovovich, is not that great of a main character with her having little to no characterization on how she is becoming this epic action hero like person who can somehow survive certain things and does the dumbest things in action sequences; her clones from the end of the last movie barely do anything, and the whole movie is her and other people doing dumb things while trying to escape a prison in Hollywood, Los Angeles to get to a supposed safe haven they heard about. We have the return of Claire Redfield, played generically again by Ali Larter, who does not do much in the film except for losing her memory, and trying to remember what happened to her and the survivors from the last movie; she did not have much likability or background to her character, and she was also not that great in the couple of action sequences she was in. Lastly, you have these people Alice finds stranded at this prison who are mostly there just to be killed off or to be annoying to watch; we also have a new character added from the games named Chris Redfield, played ok by Wentworth Miller, who has little to do, but he does have a reason for being there and he helps with escaping the prison.Though he is only in the beginning and end of the film, the film's antagonist that is from the games is Albert Wesker now played ok by Shawn Roberts, who looks like the character in a way but the way he talks and acts makes the character look like a character from the Matrix movies; the way he fights looks unintentionally funny and he does things like from the games that look weird in a movie like this. The action sequences were over the top and defied physics in-between cuts which made it obvious they were on wires flipping around, along with there being bad CGI despite an occasional practical effect used for a mutant and some zombies; what was annoying was the pointless use of slow-motion for action sequences or just for random moments that did not need it, along with there being weird editing choices or random moments it will fade to black to a new scene that is unnecessary, with there also being annoying 3D effects flying in your face.The fourth film Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) has below average performances, bad CGI effects, action sequences that defy physics and look stupid, bad editing choices, annoying uses of slow motion, and dumb characters who get their selves killed by whatever breaks into the prison; also, the film did not need to be in 3D, it got annoying because of the 3D effects it throws at you making you think it is coming at you had bad CGI 3D effects used. I am starting to lose interest in these Resident Evil film adaptations, and losing hope for the movies to be good or to be like the games in any way, instead of a horror survival movie we get an action movie with laughable action and characters you could care less about; I am sure there are probably people who are fans of some of these films, but since the first film, they slowly become less like the games, and I much rather play the games at this point.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Resident Evil: Afterlife,"After losing all her powers trying to take down an Umbrella base again she continues to seek out sanctuary at Arcadia and ends up with some familiar faces in a derelict prison in Los Angeles.Whilst there are the usual impressive visuals and action set pieces and of course lots of zombies being shot, this is the weakest film in the franchise to date.

Afterlife is all about the 3D spectacle,"Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) is a movie built entirely around its 3D experience, and that is both its strength and its downfall. The story takes a slightly better direction than the previous sequels, benefiting from W. S. Anderson's return as director, but it still lacks depth. The movie leans fully into action and spectacle, with a focus on flashy sequences rather than strong storytelling. Watching it in 3D, the visuals and effects shine, giving a level of immersion that helps mask the flaws, but in 2D, it loses much of its impact and starts to feel more like a video game cutscene than a cinematic experience.The cinematography and editing are more controlled than in the last two films, making the action at least watchable without feeling overly chaotic. Slow motion is used heavily, almost excessively, but in the 3D format, it works as intended. The film's standout moment is the chained hammer attack, which delivers one of the most memorable uses of 3D, making it a rare scene that actually evokes a reaction. While the direction is better, the script remains simplistic, offering just enough to move the story along without any real depth.Milla Jovovich once again carries the film, keeping it entertaining with her presence and well-executed action sequences. The supporting cast is there, but nothing particularly stands out. The soundtrack keeps the industrial rock vibe going, fitting well with the movie's style. Overall, Afterlife is all about the 3D spectacle. If watched in its intended format, it is an enjoyable action-packed ride. In 2D, however, the flaws are much harder to ignore, making it a much weaker film when stripped of its biggest selling point.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best of the Resident Evil Saga,"I've seen all Resident Evil movies but not because I'm a RE fan, it's more because I'm a Milla Jovovich fan. I loved the previous ones especially the first one but I think this one is the greatest and show us what is coming next is going to be awesome. Milla is again Alice and she's the best of this film, I fall in love with bad-ass girls and she's the perfect one. The second thing great about this film is the great and awesome action sequences in 3D which is, in my opinion, better than Avatar and any other 3D movie. It's true that the movie doesn't have the greatest plot but it's quite good for what the movie is. Maybe some people will not like the many slow-motion action scenes ""Matrix-Style"", but it shows you the beauty of the 3D can do in a great action movie.8/10 = The best from the saga, and wait for the next one, I'm sure it will be even better than this one!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Resident Evil: Afterlife takes a turn for the worst and escalates to the ridiculous.,"Someone give me a defibrillator! We need to turn this undead franchise back to life before my mind melts. Oh no wait, too late. This chapter famously turned the series into an action franchise. Who's to blame? Paul W.S. Anderson. Oh God, even his name just boils my blood. Alice believes she might just be the only survivor left, where she journeys to Arcadia to which has been broadcasting a signal out. Not is all as she hoped for, and soon flies back. Fuel is low, lands near a group of survivors, try to survive until the final act which teases the next film. We've seen it three times before, the exact same formula. Who thought a fourth time would be clever? Paul W.S. Anderson. Who was behind the genius idea of making nearly every scene part of a noticeable green screen and flood them with horrendous visual effects? Paul W.S. Anderson. Which mortal being conjured up the idea of writing a lifeless script, populating it with bland characters and dull dialogue? Well...quite a few screenwriters, but in this case Paul W.S. Anderson. Who is to blame for my sanity dissipating as I write this review? Paul W.S. Anderson. Words cannot describe how much of an amateur I think he is. Who keeps giving him money!? Stop it! Now! He is so obsessed with showcasing his wife in badass stunts, that he neglects everything else. Granted, Jovovich has fully evolved into the action star she's been progressing on and there are some enjoyable scenes, like the boss battle with the Executioner. But sweet Jesus Anderson just loves himself. I just laugh at how creative he tries to be with the camera, and it flops every time. ""Oh I know, let's put the camera behind those trees...yeah, that'll look sexy!"". Almost every element to this film looked cheap and lazy. The obvious wire stunts, the atrocious CGI, the gimmicky 3D abominations and the convoluted story to which I now don't care. Characters that you think are dead...aren't dead. I just...don't care. Eff you Anderson, Eff you!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great action movie,"I just saw this movie in the cinema today. I know the first thing everyone wants to know will be ""is the 3D really worth the extra cost?"". In a word - yes. I had some trouble adjusting to it (the way I view colors is slightly different from 'normal' vision) but about 20 minutes in I had my focus and thoroughly enjoyed it.There are a fair amount of the cheesy 'traditional' 3D effects (oh look - yet another bullet/shell casing/knife/sword/whatever was thrown directly at the screen for no apparent reason...) in the movie. But what really tips the scales is how much of the normal stuff is in 3D. Every scene in the movie (even the opening credits!) has some 3D element to it, and the backgrounds are simply amazing. Most of the time I felt like I was actually on the other side of the screen watching the story unfold.Which brings me to the story. Fans of the video games already know; the movies are a universe unto themselves, keeping some characters and locales but creating an entirely new storyline. Anyone who hasn't played the games will be left wondering what's going on from time to time. The executioner is one such character who adds nothing to the plot of the movie, but fans will appreciate the nod in our direction.In general the story is predictable as it follows the same pattern as the first three but it's relatively good. Before the second half you already know who will survive and who is zombie fodder. There is some good character development with the main pro/antagonists, a little less with the supporting characters, and none with the zombie fodder. But, you already know who they are so you don't really care.The graphics are great. It's all been done before but it's still visually appealing. The airplane-exploding-in-slow-motion scene is brilliant; one of my favorites next to the beach scene. Again, the 3D is well worth the price and in these cases required to fully appreciate the beauty of the filming. The gore wasn't too over-the-top but I definitely understand the R rating. Older teens (or anyone who has played the games) will be able to handle it though.If you liked the first three movies you will definitely like this one. And if you haven't seen them, but enjoy action movies, you'll still like it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Anderson shouldn't have come back,"I was hoping the return of original director Anderson would improthe franchise, since none of the other sequels had matched the first one.

Review: Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D,"The Pitch: It's Not A Wonderful Afterlife. (Just setting my stall out early.) The Review: It's one of the most commonly held theories in movies that you can't make good cinematic adaptations of computer games. Don't believe me? Then look at this list. Not one live action movie based on a computer game has a Rotten Tomatoes score of over 40%, and the box office for that list is also generally pretty poor. But surely any movie based on a computer game that's managed to get to its third sequel, and has done big box office business quickly enough to ensure that the fourth sequel is already on its way, must be doing something right? Right? If it is, then it's gone over my head. There's an obvious appeal from Resident Evil: the series of computer games – zombies and other mutated creatures, and you get to dispatch them in various satisfying ways. The games themselves have always succeeded in creating atmosphere, but there's precious little of that on offer here. An opening sequence wraps up the cliffhanger from the previous entry, doing so with precious little in the way of wit, imagination or style. It does then kickstart the real plot, prompting Milla Jovovich to have to act briefly in a confession to camera sequence that manages to be both tedious (it's very short but doesn't feel it) and unbelievable.Ah yes, Milla Jovovich. Just because you're married to the director, love, does it really mean you have to keep doing these? You've got a movie coming out with Edward Norton and Robert De Niro soon! Jovovich continues to fill the function of acting as your avatar in the movie world but adds very little else in the way of proceedings to anything. Those missing Ali Larter or Wentworth Miller from their canceled TV series might think they'll get a fix here, but other than the fact they're actually playing characters from the computer games (unlike most of the others here), they're not adding much either.Paul WS Anderson is content to reference other action movies without ever coming up with anything especially original. Shots are poorly framed and have no weight in the action sequences, characters are picked off in uninteresting and undramatic ways (at least throw in a bit of gore if people we don't care about because of your poor plot and character exposition are dying?), and for a movie that should be full of zombies, this goes to great lengths to keep them fenced off and leave you purely in the company of the other insipid excuses for characters, which is completely inexcusable. The games themselves are renowned for their puzzles – the only puzzle here is why you'd want to watch it in the first place? * Why see it at the cinema: If you're a fan of the series, then seek help you'll be going anyway. If you're not, then you won't be going anyway – hopefully. Frankly, if you've read this, if you haven't been to one of these before and are still tempted, then I'd be checking that pulse – the zombies might have gotten you already.Why see it in 3D: Nominally, because this is filmed with the same 3D camera set-up used for Avatar, so the 3D isn't applied in post-production. The effect they have achieved is not only that the 3D looks dark, but in some places it actually appears the movie is in black and white. Still, things will occasionally be thrown in your virtual face, if you like that sort of thing.The Score: 2/10 * You may indeed be wondering why I watched it in the first place? Foolishly, I had eight hours while my wife was out on a volunteer assignment and I could fit in three movies, Cyrus and 'Tamara Drewe' being the first two, and this then being the only realistic possibility for a third. On reflection, sitting in the car for two hours staring at a hedge may have been preferable. Hey, it's not the worst movie I've seen this year, just the second worst. Thanks, Catherine Zeta Jones.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Didn't Even Try,"""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" was a stark and precipitous drop off from its predecessors. Besides being one long rock video with bad CGI, the acting was poor as well as the plot. Not to mention that at times I didn't know if I was watching ""Resident Evil,"" ""Tremors,"" ""Silent Hill,"" or ""The Matrix.""Let me say this: I get that slow motion and stop motion makes an action sequence cool but chill out a bit willya. It was way overdone like a child playing with his newest toy. Take out half the slow motion scenes and the movie is ten minutes shorter.Speaking of the action scenes: there's action and then there's ""come on, get real."" I'm all for bending the laws of physics at times for an exciting movie but my brain has a certain point in which it refuses to ignore the blatant impossibilities. More than once I found myself rolling my eyes at the otherworldly stunts. Just tell me they're in the Matrix so I can mentally accept what I'm seeing. The extreme action and the paradoxically calm faces that accompanied it were too much to bear.There is yet another exception I have with this movie. It's not fair but my idea of zombies has been largely defined by ""The Walking Dead"" and George Romero. ""Resident Evil"" is a totally different production, I know, and furthermore it's based upon a video game which probably has a totally different set of rules for its hordes of mobile carcasses. For all I know, the undead beings in ""Resident Evil"" aren't even zombies; they may be another creation entirely. But, since they look like zombies and behave like zombies I'm holding them to the zombie rules.So, with that, I have certain expectations that were thoroughly defied in this movie. I found these zombies to be fast, strong, slightly cognitive and able to be silent when needing the element of surprise. Look, that is not my vision of a zombie and it's simply not fair. Part of the reason zombies are slow, dumb and weak is that 1.) they're dead and all higher brain functions have ceased and 2.) there are millions of them!! They already have a significant advantage in that they can only be killed with head shots (which is tough enough as it is) then you make their numbers multitudinous which is a recipe for invincibility as a species. There's no need after that to also make them strong, fast, sneaky and somewhat smart. The remaining humans have no chance!Overall this movie just lacked intelligence and originality. They really went the mindless action movie route while liberally borrowing thematic and cinematic ideas from so many other known movies. The bottom line is they didn't even try and that's the saddest part.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The movie was pretty damn good and had some surprises, but due to the thin plot and some weird decisions it didn't quite live up to my expectations...","First of all, I must warn you: If you're expecting Apocalypse all over again, don't! When I first saw the trailers I was looking forward to Apocalypse (which is still my favorite part) on steroids and ended getting a movie with much less super powered characters and Matrix action. If you think realistically, it was a smart move to make the RE movies more survival horror again, but I'm a huge action movie fan and expected more action and crazy stunts from this 3D movie:/... There's still plenty of action, don't get me wrong, but you can clearly see that most of the 60 million dollar budget was spent on the first and last big fight and influenced the script a lot. The special effects are veeeeeeeeeeeeery good, but frankly if you've seen the trailers and clips, you've seen it all... I would have loved to see more action like there was in the first 15 minutes or so. They kinda wiped all the sci-fi away and we were left with a not so scary survival horror movie with great backgrounds and effects and slightly above average action scenes. And you'll be shocked to see what they did to poor Alice to make her ''more human'' :rolleyes:... But all that aside, the plot is fairly simple, kinda like a RE game back in the days when graphics and character voicing weren't that developed, so they had to keep a simple story. So you could say that this movie truly is the best RE game port to the movies, but it's kinda not enough for the big screen movies when you only look at the plot itself... But hey, we've seen much worse! The acting wasn't anything special either, but frankly you can't expect more from a survival horror... Still, the actors do deliver... Especially Milla, oh I love her so much!:D And many may say they don't like the soundtrack, I love it! It packs so much adrenaline or a sense of no hope... I'm interested to see what they'll do in the next one cause this one is clearly just and introduction to something new and doesn't bring a lot of story with it, plus they've really brewed some stuff together that I have no idea how the characters are going to get away after from, you'll understand me once you see the ''ending''XD... To conclude, you should go watch this movie, but don't expect it to be like in the trailer or in the first 15 minutes...

Great 3D movie,"This was a great Resident Evil movie the only thing that stopped it from getting 10 out of 10, is that like with all 3D movies the director feels the need to stick things in your face so you get the 3D feel. That gets old really fast especially if you have seen other 3D movies.If you see the movie in 2D its going to look stupid. When this movie makes it to DVD and BluRay it needs to be released in 3D or again it will look stupid with all the stuff being put in your face. In 3D it looks nice if its not over done but in 2D the film will look stupid and pointless. I have seen Friday the 13th part 3 in 3D when it came out and I have it on DVD in 2D and having pitchforks and stuff thrust at you 2D makes you laugh.If the producers and so on read this please do your self a favor and put it out only in 3D.The vision of this movie will be lost in anything else and just look stupid. I own all of the Resident Evil movies on both DVD and Bluray, and will end up getting this one too but only if its in 3D.I still think that Milla needs to come here and date me but thats a different story lol.Enjoy the movie its not the best one but with all the other junk out there this is by far the best one, and it needs to be watched in 3D.

"It may be OK, if not counting the rip-offs","Among the recent horror titles, Resident Evil: Afterlife maybe an entertaining film. It is fast paced and action packed, and it does provide some enjoyment if you let your brain stop working for an hour and a half.Plot holes are everywhere. Why is everybody suddenly possess all kinds of superhuman abilities like jumping over a meter high, sliding everywhere, while they are not supposed to, except to pay homage to the video game RE4 and RE5 which normal human having superior power. The homages to RE4 and RE5 may also make watchers who are not fans feel absurd since many things are left unexplained, such as what is that giant monster exactly?But what vexes me most is the rip-offs, which are everywhere. Come on are you serious? The opening scenes are from the Matrix. The landing scene is from Escape from New York. Signs on the roof? Thats from Dawn of the Dead remake! Jumping off the roof?

Meh...,"I never expected this movie to be AWESOME. I love the games, like the movies and it is fun to see some things from the games being played out such as characters along with the monsters etc, BUT this movie was the worst of the 4. I feel like this series keeps going and doesn't get any better. There are constant gaps in the plot, random people come into play and we never know why and other people are just gone and again we don't know why. I love the idea of these movies and I know they will never be great, they remain simply a bored-need-something-to-watch type of series for me. I give this one a 3 star rating simply because of what they are. I guess if you don't go in expecting much then they are likable but if you go in and watch them expecting some A+++ movie etc., you will HATE them. There's plenty of action which I guess is good but it doesn't make the movie any better, not enough zombies, b-level acting and for me, not many likable characters, I feel like everyone is so cold. I don't want to hate these movies but every time another one comes out I feel my heat sink a little more.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Acting is going from bad to worst, scripting is so shallow that even 2 years old child can't be foxed. Camera is focused almost always on their faces and background is very blur. It's hell bad movie so just be human to yourself and don't watch it. If you even want to watch be aware that is completely waste of time, money and life.

The most true to the games of all 4....so far.,"If you are a fan of the games you will enjoy this movie. Afterlife is the most true to the series so far. Ignore the complaints of ""no plot or character depth"", they are simply not true. The plot is clear and present for anyone who is paying half attention to the movie they just shelled out $10 to see. I have read several reviews complaining about the lack of zombies or the thin plot or even the fact that the bad guy wears sunglasses, most of these reviews don't even get the lead characters name right despite the fact it is given a dozen times during the film. Yes, Afterlife is not as zombie heavy as the first movie, but not all of the games in the series focus solely on zombies. Why should they when there are so many interesting creatures in the Resident Evil universe? The most important thing to remember is that this is a action movie based off a video game staring a super model! I mean that is awesome, come on. It blows crap like Saw 25 or whatever number they're up to out of the water!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
What is Even Going on at This Point?,"They call these films video game adaptations for a reason. They are meant to be adaptations and not just another installation into that franchise. 'Afterlife' feels way more like video game on screen than it does a film by itself.The film begins with CGI filled action sequenced that is flooded with unnecessary slow motion camera work. It's filmed in 3D, so I guess Paul W.S. Anderson was really wanted to exploit that version of the medium and give the audience it's most visceral film to date in the franchise. While there are some moments of brilliant B-movie fun, 'Afterlife' is just more of the same. And sadly it feels like some scenes are ripped right from the video games without any extra CGI or effects done.As if you weren't already tired of the Umbrella Corp being at the forefront of each and every one of these films, they once again make their unwelcomed presence felt. Minus Dr. Isaacs and now adding pretty much the exact same character in Albert Wesker, the Umbrella Corp doesn't do anything they haven't already done in the series. Seriously, in every film Umbrella spies on Alice & company, attempt to take her down, and have a big confrontation towards the end. Besides a rotating supporting cast, the films are all structured the same way. There's a real lack of creativity here.There's one clear reason why these films are made. Money. The filmmakers know how to produce these features and get people to spend their hard-earned cash on them. I enjoy a silly action adventure as much as the next guy, but there needs to be a little more effort put forth before I can actually certify these as guilty pleasure movies. As of now, they're mindless blood & guts action-horror films. However, the way this movie ends got me undeniably a little bit excited to sit down and watch the next one.+Some fun action scenes-But mostly too CGI filled for my liking-Same old story over and over again4.5/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Again stupid story and some okay action,"So Paul W.S. Anderson is back with another zombie techno action flick and that is basically all this movie is. No tension, no scares not even a decent plot, just a tough chick running around with guns and knives with other survivors killing zombies although there is very few zombies in this movie. With some stuff happening in 3D and the 3D in this isn't all that great. Paul W.S. Anderson made some bold statements about how this is going to be the action movie of the summer and how he is a fan of the video games this movie is based on. He is full of crap cause this movie is a alright action movie but has almost nothing to do with the video games. So the plot is Alice is back again and she is trying to survive while trying to bring down the Umbrella Corporation that is behind the zombie mayhem. Shawn Roberts did a pretty good job portraying Albert Wesker, at least he got the attitude and voice down right. Well to sum it up Paul W.S. Anderson took some parts from the RE games even the creatures and randomly put them in this movie although it doesn't make any sense what so ever, with techno music and slow motion thrown in. I give this movie a 5.6 for it's sort of fun action scenes.5.6/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident evil is not what it use to be. It looks more like Matrix 3D...,"I have watched movie yesterday, and I am really disappointed. Like a real fan on Resident Evil, I expected much more, especially because, the director of the first Resident Evil (which is in my opinion the best of all sequels) was back to direct this one. First things first, this movie isn't a horror really, there is no mystery or scary scenes. This is more like an action movie, than a horror. A lots of scenes looks like they just come out of Rambo, Matrix or some other action movie. Story and plot are not interesting and exciting, in other words, there isn't any. Scenery is also static, it looks too much futuristic. In previous sequels, scenery was changing during whole movie, but in this one, there are maybe 3 dominant sceneries. Unfortunately, all my fears of this becoming an action instead of zombie horror are true. Special effects and 3D scenes are nothing special, but whole movie is based on them. This crew could have perform much better, if there only was a good story and plot. Resident Evil atmosphere is just missing out, even that great music theme from the beginning of the previous sequels is no more. If you miss this movie, you won't be missing much, I am sorry to say that, but that's just it.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Seriously, where are they get the weapons? Giant monster with giant axe/hammer thing is cool, but those aren't just laying around to be picked up.Logic fails this movie.

"A little light on plot, but it's still quite entertaining","With the help of her army of clones Alice destroys the Umbrella Corporations HQ in Tokyo before making her way to Alaska. Once there she finds just one survivor Claire whom she rescues and the pair then make their way to LA. In LA, Alice and Claire find a group of survivors and they all decide to work together to reach Arcadia; a safe haven free of disease, infection etc...Whilst the RE films have kind of diminished ever so slightly with each passing film they have all felt as though each chapter had a new story to tell and that as a franchise it was continually evolving; this helped keep things on the fresh side even when the action became repetitive and the endings became predictable.The issue with Afterlife is that it contains a lot of the negative points that the franchise has brought so far without a lot of positives. There's no real narrative development from part 3 leaving the story feeling painfully thin, the characters (or fodder as they should be called) also don't add much falling into the usual cliches. Whilst you could argue that Afterlife ups the ante in the action stakes it arguably doesn't do this in the right way. At times it looks ridiculous, cartoony and a bit too 'John Woo' though this may work for some people. The villain of the piece is also silly and hard to take seriously (almost like an Agent Smith lite).As usual, Milla Jovovich is good when it comes to anything physical, but not so much when anything else is required. She always seems to take things too seriously and often forgets what sort of film she's making? Then again as her husband is the director she'll know that her job is safe as long as the franchise continues.Whilst Afterlife is entertaining enough to be worth watching, it's quite an odd film as it feels like one of those films that seems to only exist to bridge the gap between two films; in other words it's sole purpose is to set up the next film. For that reason and based on its weak story I can't give it more than half marks.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
On The Edge Of My Seat,"Well, maybe not on the edge of my seat because I was laying in bed but that is not the point. A lot of reviews really bash all the resident evil sequels for being mindless or lacking any enjoyable aspect. I completely disagree. The characters may not be the most developed ones ever but they meet the needs of the movie. You don't really need to know the whole story of every character. The lack of development also adds to the surprise because you don't know them well enough to predict their every movement which is actually refreshing. The continuing action never allows for you to catch your breath. If you turn away for more than a second you will miss something. You have to keep watching. Most movies involving the undead bore me. I don't usually find them very entertaining and I almost never find them scary. Actually I find very few horror movies scary at all but even I wanted to pull the covers over my head a couple times. The only disappointment for me was the ending. I was really hoping for something else. I expected something different from what I was hoping for and from what happened. I guess that is a good thing though. If it ended how I hoped then there would be no point in making anymore movies. If it ended how I expected, there would be nothing to make more movies with. I just feel bad for the characters who are left to endure more of this awful hell. I'm glad I'm not them.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"OK i got my zombies, got my action, but wheres my explanation!?","Ill start by stating i am a resident evil fan, but not of the movies, of the games, and having played the fifth game i know what is going on (sort of) but what about the people who have only watched the movies. I took my girlfriend along to see this and she was confused as all hell when we came out. At one point i remember her asking ""whats with the giant dude with the axe?"" and it made me think, why haven't the directors/screenwriters explained ANYTHING? people who haven't played the games don't know where the hell the majini came from, or even what they are called, only that they are 'zombies' with tentacles coming out of their mouths. and no one else seems to get why wesker is the way he is unless you've played the games. on another point, i don't know where the hell the majini came from in this film, they are just there!! OK more ramblings, this time from a lover of film and not the games. The plot is terrible, there is no explanation (as i have already stated) and the acting was absolutely atrocious. the only person who carried their character properly was Ali larter playing claire. also, the casting for the new characters was terrible as well. Wentworth Miller playing chris redfield?????? what were they thinking, also Shawn Roberts who played wesker carried the character terribly, he well overdid it.OK the good points, the flashiness worked, sort of, but i did have to turn a blind eye to EVERYTHING else but the stylised violence and the endless references to the fifth games enemies (which made no sense in terms of the plot of the movie but it was cool as a fan to see majini and the executioner in the film) and the fight between wesker, chris, and claire was kinda cool (if you overlook the fact that they have used the exact same choreography as one particular fight scene in the fifth game) and these are the reasons i have given it a much as a 5. purely cause it looked kinda cool",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

It was slow to start and I kept falling asleep in the first 15 minutes. Where are the zombies? You don't see the zombies until the end and they aren't zombies. They ran out of ideas and rehashed the old villains from Tremors 3 and Silent Hill. They lost the storyline in the script. The special effects were good. But the fight scenes were lacking in action and drama. They tried to make more prototypes of ""Alice"" and lost the sense of the original heroine.

Astonishingly phony & overproduced; its value withers to nothing over 97 minutes,"The first film was fun, but not super special; the second was passably enjoyable, but overflowed with excesses, self-indulgence, and artificiality. While the third film still bore its own imperfections and excesses, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, with both action and horror that felt more meaningful. I definitely had mixed expectations as I sat to watch this fourth installment in the franchise, but my hopes were raised some following the strong predecessor. As Paul W. S. Anderson returns as director here in addition to writing and producing, the question is now if he learned from the success of 'Extinction' - reining in the impulses, and taking more care generally - or if his increasingly predominant ethos of ""slick and cool"" film-making would take hold once more.It doesn't take long for 'Afterlife' to give us its answer. With the first major scene to greet us we get slow motion and fast-paced action; a panoply of stunts, effects, and violence and destruction; expansion upon those abilities that protagonist Alice began demonstrating at the end of 'Apocalypse'; gleeful, unremitting use of CGI, to an extent that unabashedly wears the contrivance on its sleeve; and extreme emphasis on and solidification of Milla Jovovich as a practically untouchable action hero. There's your answer: this 2010 title returns the series to the astounding, overbearing immoderation, self-gratification, and over the top outrageousness of the 2004 entry, and in fact rather doubles down just as that one had over its antecedent. 'Afterlife' is even more glaringly overproduced, relying heavily on post-production visuals to the point of being a massive eyesore. The acting reverts to the flat, unconvincing portrayals of 2002, if not also chewing of scenery; Anderson's direction feels lacking in the quiet moments, and false in the action-packed ones. While Tomandandy's music is decent in and of itself, as they are used here the themes feel ill-fitting, and too peppy, almost as if this were a child's action-adventure a la '3 ninjas' or 'Teenage mutant ninja turtles.' The writing comes off as decidedly thin, like Anderson was straining to conjure workable ideas for another feature: the narrative is less than engaging as it butts up against suspension of disbelief, the scene writing is often questionable, and the dialogue is tired, bland, and sometimes just plain bad. Whatever extravagances Anderson has shown elsewhere, and that may have inhabited 'Resident evil' before, this reaches an entirely new level.Suffering the same fate as the Nemesis before him, the Axeman could and should have been an imposing, fearsome monstrosity, but here basically just becomes a cartoon (and the same very pointedly goes for Wesker). The zombies are just set pieces; the horror is but a flavor, and the action is plastic, bogus, and phony - and made all the more so for the reckless abandon with which slow motion and CGI are employed, and Anderson's push for The Slick And Cool over earnest thrills and impact. Truthfully, this is so tawdrily, tiresomely overcooked that it looks like something Zack Snyder might have made. There are instances when I'm distinctly reminded of '300,' and seeing as that was one of the most laughably awful movies I've ever seen, the comparison is not a favorable one. In fairness, though bound by the irksome slant of the production, the folks operating behind the scenes were perhaps affected least by Anderson's approach, so the contributions they turned in are swell; everything from practical effects and stunts to art direction and costume design come off better than the writing, direction, or acting. There are scant, small thoughts here that might have been the foundation for a worthwhile story. Unfortunately, 'Afterlife' is so stunningly, boorishly, obnoxiously, appallingly overdone, and unreserved in its pretentious insincerity, that I have to wonder if Anderson wasn't trying to actively sabotage and destroy the very film franchise he had created. Unbelievably, it actually gets progressively worse as the length stretches on, and the last twenty minutes or so are nearly unwatchable.I'm baffled. For as reasonably enjoyable as the first two pictures were, and for as much as the third was almost genuinely great, it's as if Anderson examined those relative successes and decided he should do the exact opposite here. Whatever value 'Afterlife' may have offered, and seems to early on, withers more and more over its ninety-seven minutes until all good will vanishes by the end. Whatever it is one wants out of action-horror, this is the last place to look for it; I've seen more deserving flicks from Uwe Boll and The Asylum. Anderson should be ashamed of himself. I feel like I could continue heaping criticism on this fourth installment in the franchise, but I really don't want to spend another hour typing these words. Maybe 'Resident evil' really should have ended with 'Extinction,' because then it could have finished on a high note before taking a major nosedive. What more is there to say? Avoid this dreck. Even if you're a huge fan of someone involved it's a huge mistake to watch this; only those committed to watching all six RE flicks could possibly claim motivation for checking it out, and even then watching is an act of masochism.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil:  Afterlife IS Thrill and Ride of A Lifetime.,"This film flew with colors and detail. Other than the past RE films it didn't put you in a situation where you were left waiting for the action. From start to finish it is a fun and entertaining thrill ride. The acting was awesome and the humor included seemed to be in the right places at the right time. For a smaller budget and a smaller series I could definitively tell they put everything into the film with what everything they had. It was entertaining and the story seemed to suck you in from start to finish. I LOVED the introduction. The Alice Clones were KICK-ASS!! Go see it when you have the chance PLEASE!!! First of all I would like to state that this IS a Resident Evil film. Soo many people in the past have been negated and hating on a series that is entertaining and trying to be original all on its' own taking. If its not about similarities towards the games its about people hating some cheesy or corny action scenes and dialouge that people bring up or hate against or maybe seem to not even be in the film at all. I find that people tend to want to negate the RE film series rather than make positive statements.1. ONLY see it if you are at all familiar with the series of movies or the video games. If you haven't seen the movies or played the games don't be surprised if your confused and disappointed. A lot of people tend to make this mistake and then make crappy reviews because it was their fault they weren't familiar with the Resident Evil genre from the beginning. Don't criticize on Afterlife if you haven't seen the last 3 movies or played any of the games. Its not the movies or games fault, its yours.2. Its critical to recognize this is a Resident Evil movie, so what you got out of the last three in terms of acting and scares will probably be around the same level of realism in this one. Although in Afterlife the acting and the support in terms of scares totally upgraded and the humor and realistic acting seemed to dwell within this film. The acting was really attractive in this continuation of the series and that was one of the many things that I liked about it.3. I saw Afterlife in 3-D and 2-D. Let me tell you the quality is 50 million times better in 3D. In 2D everything was not as crisp and clear and the life the film was trying to convey in 3D can ONLY be seen in 3D...At least in the theaters anyways. So if you get a chance to see it in theaters I highly advise seeing it in 3D. Its DEFINITIVELY worth the money and time. You won't be disspointed with your purchase.4. Lastly, Enjoy Resident Evil: Afterlife for what it is. Take the film and series on its own and try not to compare or negate things because let me tell you. If you don't like the movies why would you continue seeing them and if you didn't like the story why would you bother even wanting to see any sequels of a story you hated. This film is for the FANS NOT THE CRITICS. So please don't criticize. Thank You! And have a Fun and Entertaining time watching Resident Evil: Afterlife.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

You can see the green screens; the fire of a gun nozzle which is focused on in the first shot, magically disappears in the second shot; the shadows of the animated doors weren't even rendered. There is no proper plot and no character development of any kind.

Do not see..... If not in 3-D!,"Resident Evil Afterlife is an OK action flick. However those expecting something ground-breaking will be disappointed as it really isn't anything beyond your typical action movie. The effects are good, and in 3-D I'd bet they are even better. However, as I did not see the movie in 3-D, I cannot comment and therein lies my biggest argument with this movie. Its obvious to me that this entire movies appeal comes from the fact that its in 3-D and as a result, things like a solid storyline and good old original action sequences are seemingly sacrificed to put greater emphasis on the 3-D aspect. Because I only saw this movie in 2-D, its obvious I am missing out and that's disappointing. I feel like this whole ""3-D"" craze that's suddenly hit the film industry has led many movie creators to neglect the things that count in a film like a good storyline, and are instead more concerned with making sure the film has good 3-D effects. Resident Evil Afterlife is a prime example of this.The bottom line here is only see this movie in 3-D. Without the 3-D effect, you will be too drawn to how unoriginal and bland this film is. Don't expect an engaging storyline which draws you in either, instead just sit back in awe at the amazing 3-D effects. After all, that is apparently all they were concerned with when making this film.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Possibly the best in the series,"I haven't really changed my mind about this film franchise since I reviewed the last one of the bunch (or the ones before, really), but I've probably reached a point where I don't care that much any more and just hope for some good entertainment. Just to summarize where I'm at: big fan of the games, hugely disappointed by the lack of Resident Evil in the actual films.Frankly speaking, I had a good feeling ever since I saw the trailer. There were quite a few familiar scenes, so I hoped for something tangible from the RE universe to keep me going. Ironically, it's not really the RE characters that make this film feel a bit more related to the games, it's a couple of friendly faces of the ""evil"" undead. Excuse me, infected.The story (?) moves on from where it left off and while I couldn't really remember where that was, it seems it had something to do with Alice and her clones and finding the oh-so-clichéd ""safe haven"" in an apocalypse scenario. And really, not much else happens, except a bit of ping-pong between havens, while encountering the odd character that we had seen before in the previous films and some others who are mostly only meat to eat.What surprised me in a positive way was that, had the producers taken a little more time to tie the action together, confer a tiny little bit more depth to the guys and gals on screen, Resident Evil: Afterlife could've counted for a very respectable flick. The way it came out, it just has this feeling of unfulfillment about it that I couldn't shake off.Even so, it gets a passing grade. As mentioned above, the saving grace is two prolonged scenes - Axeman and Wesker fight. While I did keep wondering where one would get an Axeman strolling around Los Angeles, I loved how similar it felt to the game. Also, the shotgun with coins was a nice touch. It was such a fun scene that even the excessive slow motion (and there is a lot of that throughout the film) didn't ruin it. And then, the Wesker scene, where Shawn Roberts took all the effort to make Wesker move and act so like the character in the games that it made my heart skip a beat. Both, very well executed set pieces- as was the intro, actually.To balance that, we had the underwhelming inclusion of Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller) and the ignorable presence of Claire (Ali Larter). Even some of the side characters had more of an impact than these two. But you can't always get what you want, I guess.The positive surprise was complete in that the 3D didn't irritate me the way it usually does. Actually, having seen both versions of the film, it had a more authentic feel than the 2D version. I can't actually complain about how Anderson shot the film, it's just that his way of making things come together is rather superficial. In the end, these films will never really be what the Resident Evil games are, so we have to remember rule #32 and enjoy the little things.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

We return to....the same old story,"We all think enough is enough at some point, and now that is the general feeling around Resident Evil. I know I know, why it couldn't have ended after one movie but to be fair it stuck to itself and did what it wanted to do, sure the movies are terribly written and directed but, well OK that isn't acceptable at all. This was a series that had room to improve, all it had to do was make it less bat-s*** crazy and try to make it feel more personal and less obsessed with stupid things when all it had to do was make it alright. The man, who produces, writes and directs this is Paul W.S Anderson who is now for me nearly at a point of no return, where even if he makes something good, this will be on his back forever.Now maybe my introduction seems a little harsh I mean after all this is what it says on the tin, big action, more zombies than seen before and an actual kind of interesting plot(emphasising kind of). We see Alice searching and looking for the place where survivors may be, she flies around everywhere in this plane and even lands it in impossible places. The plot is hard not to ruin because straight away it jumps right into it and that I can respect, but my main problem is not with the plot, it's with the technical decisions. Anderson manages to blast out this movie that's scenes are chosen horribly, it feels Anderson somehow destroys his own script and after it is all over you just feel some opportunities were missed.A problem I have always felt with this franchise is that it goes too big scale, it can't settle for street to street zombie fighting with normal guns and never feels like the characters do what actual people would do in that crazy situation. It builds Umbrella as this corporation that just has too much money, I mean it builds huge underground complexes which seem to figure in every movie and make it even more insane. The villain of this movie is just so badly created that it just seems stupid to have made that character, the person just seems to be straight from the video game which this uses too much from, and then the movie feels OTT.Can Resident Evil ever get any better is the question on my lips, on this it cannot and this is the first one so far I have actually found bad and not just another poor movie. It doesn't try and that is what I can't respect, it's not like this movie isn't worth a watch but it certainly isn't one I would recommend to many, fans of the series maybe and I know people who love action movies will also enjoy it, but even some will find this an overuse of special effects and one movie that ruins this series even more so.So Resident Evil marches on earning money from a very disappointing attempt and I feel there is a lot of this kind of thing left to come in the future. Whether Anderson feels this is going somewhere is really a hard thing to work out, it rakes in money but critically they are smashed, it's like a moral film question, do you keep on making bad movies if a lot of people don't like them?, my answer is actually to keep on going, but improve your craft and don't keep going at the same old stuff that you've been doing for years.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cringe waste of time,"This is undoubtedly the most cringe movie I've watched and its definitely not even worth quater of the time it takes to watch this.

Resident evil loyal to the games,"Let me start off saying that I'm a big fan of the movies and games. Afterlife starts off with an amazing opening full of energy and was pretty intense. Then it continues on with Alice and her clones trying to put an end to Umbrella. While the action is very good and always gives us something new, afterlife kind of fails in character development in which brings us new characters like Chris Redfield, Wesker and other new zombie creatures like the Axeman for an instance. The Axeman had no story whatsoever and I like that Paul through in creatures and characters from the games but he also needs to give some kind of explanation regarding their origin. Well, thing is when I saw this super zombie appeared and saw him through out the film I supposed that the creature was an experiment that Umbrella created to kill Alice. That was my theory but other people wont know a thing and will be like what is that thing? Chris was a good add on to the movie but having him as a secondary character shooting pistols is just wrong and besides there was like no development regarding the brother to sister relationship(Chris, Clarie). I saw this film in 3D and its the best 3D I've seen, ill give credit for that. Finally, loved the sweet action, effects ,cinematography, the new creatures and characters but lacks of a good script, character development, lack of gore and please for the next film a longer run time at least 2 hours. Anyway good addition to the series. Still give it a 10 cause Im so fanatic.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
almost okay,"This movie was almost okay- up until Shawn Roberts appears as Wesker--Roberts is such a bad actor the movie isn't worth watching after he skows up.

"a huge disappointment ,let this zombie fest rest in peace: contains spoilers","I have to be honest and say that I've never liked zombie films until I watched the first Resident Evil; afterwards, I was hooked. I recorded the latest installment on my DVR, and waited for the perfect, cold night to watch it. Fast forward to the opening title sequence which immediately reminded me of the psychological style seen in current Japanese horror cinema; it was a perfect nod to that genre, and a great opening sequence, it gave me hope. Unfortunately, only minutes later it sank like the Titanic.I don't know if writing the following would be considered, ""contains spoilers"" since reviews for this film are all over the internet, but here goes; after watching the captivating title sequence seconds later a male character with blond hair, who dressed, and talked like Mr Smith (the Matrix) appeared; next Trinity made her appearance dressed like Alice, or was it the other way around?The hot spark that ignited this film was turning into cold ash. spoiler 2: Alice appeared cloned in triplicate, wearing Trinities shiny black leather suit, maybe she borrowed it? I could live with another sexy woman in black leather if she weren't nearly duplicating the shots and effects in what could only appear as a deadpan comedic homage to the Matrix. Sadly, the only difference here is that Alice was fighting armies of Japanese soldiers instead of armies of Mr Smith clones. The first time I saw these effects in, ""The Matrix"" it was exhilarating, eight years later it's sleep inducing.Sadly this sequel makes absolutely no attempt to stand on it's own. It simply regurgitates something our culture has already so fully digested, which for me is the main reason it sank to the bottom of the sea so fast. Maybe, this movie might have been served up best as a comedic spoof. After all, to be fair,it showed us recognizable iconic scenes from another film with it's own actors,dressed exactly like those other actors, which could only be interpreted as an intentional lack of original content, so why watch? I found myself waiting for the movie to shift gears and land me smack on planet,"" Resident Evil."" Instead it seemed entirely content to endlessly mirror shot after shot of the same flurry of slow motion acrobatics and flying bullets. I found myself waiting for Peter Graves to show up, fresh from the grave , zombied face and all. No offense Peter, but really, it would have provided much needed relief. Unfortunately, this wasn't a comedy, and I wasn't laughing.I was really looking forward to watching another resurrection of Alice. I wanted nothing more than to end my long day with a dark chocolate bar and slide into the entertaining world of a slick zombie fest. I was secretly hoping that Alice might find another love interest as sexy as Oded Fehr, his smile alone kills me. I doubt there will be any more resurrections after this one. I can only hope this zombie film lets the dead rest in peace.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A blockbuster embarrassment,I find it baffling that anybody could find this film enjoyable. It's mindless noise with little to no substance. The story is a snooze fest once again meandering while killing our brain cells. It's hilarious how they try to make Alice less of a Mary Sue by having her powers taken away yet she can still survive a plane crash and getting slammed into walls by giant monsters. Though the last three films weren't good either the production design atleast had effort put into them for the budgets they had to work with. But here it's so incredibly phony. Poor green screen and obvious wire work just makes every action scene feel so staged. That show down towards the end with Albert Wesker was comedy gold. Also why does everything umbrella owns has to have that red and white logo plastered everywhere??If you're just looking for mindless schlock lacking any character or logic then look no further than this cinematic dumpster fire.,3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has some moments,It's not that bad of a movie. The story is very weak and there's magic and the endboss is unbelievable - it could of just easily killed everybody instantly with that speed.

Terrible,"Had the potential to be a good film I'm a fan of the games and the previous films I had some beef with but not that much but this put simply is boke and I blame Paul W.S Anderson.

"Resident Evil 4: Afterlife only suggests a good number of new ideas, but let yourself stagnate in your own quirks insists not worrying about its features","The fact is that, after three not-so-successful films (despite the amusing third episode), Anderson's return to directing and his creative freedom granted after the films' profitability seems to have made us glimpse a light at the end of the tunnel for the greater growth of the franchise itself, as much as Resident Evil 4: Afterlife only suggests a good number of new ideas, but let yourself stagnate in your own quirks insists not worrying about its features. In short, Afterlife still feels like a rehearsal.Despite some electrifying action sequences, the film doesn't add much to its fight scenes and special effects. From the frozen camera to highlight the most spectacular moves to the bloody carnage, we are almost always with that feeling of more of the same. More than a decade after The Matrix (The Matrix, 1999), it is as if the film was content to reheat and under-use several of its effects, now quite worn out. The only difference is that we are in the universe of 3-D cinema. By the way, this is the only justification for the existence of the film and to provoke some interest from viewers who are not fans of the series. The film, unlike several productions that changed or converted the format at the last minute, was designed for this technology. Thus, some 3-D potentials are explored, such as the monumental landscapes of the destroyed planet, the planes with great depth of field and the crystalline images of water and glass crossing the screen.In order to maximize the use of 3D effects, Anderson ends up overusing the slow motion feature, with at least 95% of all action moments in the film being shown at reduced speed. There were several action scenes designed for the 3D format, but they would be so impossible to be performed that they cause more laughter than fascination from the audience. In these scenes, we include the entire opening sequence of Alice and her clones' invasion of the Umbrella Corporation's Tokyo headquarters, a rappelling descent from a towering building with plenty of zombie kills along the way, plus a human lowering the tail of the Alice's plane as if it were Superman. Any sense of logic and attachment to the laws of physics is totally discarded here. Anyway, the film has some good moments, like the tense underwater sequence and the aforementioned free fight sequence, but nothing that can save the project from disaster, completed by the bad design of the zombies, which look more like rejected versions of the Reapers seen. In ""Blade II"".At least it's not just another slot in the format, which generates higher revenues for distributors due to the more expensive tickets, with the use of such technology being as effective as in ""Avatar"". However, as I have stated several times in my texts, technological advancement does not guarantee good films and ""Resident Evil 4 - Afterlife"" is far from being at least a passable cinematographic work. With this episode being written and directed by Anderson (who had accumulated both roles in the original film), Milla is the sole focus of the production, who doesn't even bother developing any of the other characters, who are nothing more than walking clichés, with the producer Hollywood being a negative standout in this regard, failing even to arouse dislike. The game characters that appear on screen, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller) and the villain Wesker (Shawn Roberts), appear only as fan service, never being exploited as they should.Right away, Anderson gets rid of what was the hook given by the third chapter of the story for this new film, maintaining a pattern started in the last film of destroying the cliffhangers of previous episodes, with the initial action scene serving just that. In addition, the screenwriter puts the character of Wentworth Miller, who gained fame with the series ""Prision Break"", to basically plan a prison break! Furthermore, the whole prison situation ""honor"" an arc from the great graphic novel ""The Living Dead"". The dialogue is also poor, with actors being forced to declaim at least five catchphrases per minute, with none being particularly funny or striking. The cast doesn't help either, with performances so shabby they border on satire, even the ones that worked well in Resident Evil 3 The Extinction. Personality changes are ""justified"" by brainwashing and mind control, and oddly enough these are still small problems. Wentworth Miller turns his Chris Redfield into a prisoner who appears to be a badass, but who, in the face of approaching dangers, has little action.But I need to stick to the villain Wesker for a while. Umbrella's boss is that kind of antagonist typical of 1980s action tapes, but faded and unoriginal. His morbid pallor, dark glasses - which even serve as a weapon - and his lack of dramaturgical talent are sensational, and form the archetype of one of the worst villains that cinema has ever produced, thanks a lot to the ridiculous performance of Shawn Roberts, who only makes him crack his neck and threaten Alice.For the rest, the film leaves a lot to be desired. The script is obvious - even events and reunions that should provoke some surprise or emotion are casually filmed. In a way, it's like the story doesn't matter. Almost all of the action in the movie seems pointless. What is quite contradictory if we think about the logic of games: in which the phases are divided as steps in a larger mission. Thus, each stretch of the route represents the overcoming of an obstacle towards the final objective. That's not what happens in the movie. Alice's mission seems rather abstract: defeat Umbrella and find survivors. And the imperative of much of the film is pure momentary survival, with no long-term organized counterattack plan. Device of excessively momentary action that could even be interesting, if the film injected more tension into the scenes.In this sense, even the relationship between cinema and videogame is underused, apart from the insertion of some graphic effects, it is difficult to believe that the origin of the saga comes from games. No camera following the characters up close, no projection of the spectator like someone controlling an avatar and moving through a scene. The most we have is the presence of some monstrous mutant figures with fight scenes that resemble the confrontation with a boss to access the next level. And the problem is that this next phase, the film's narrative sequence, doesn't seem to matter at all. The CG, once well done, is again crude; it even seems to have gotten worse compared to the previous movie. Claire Redfiled's (Ali Larter) deconstruction is one of unparalleled incompetence. Danger situations have become futile once again, zombies are little threat - even with all the upgrades, Alice is back to being untouchable, performing diving displays.The final battle is anti-climactic, without any fuss, and even after all the pyrotechnics, Umbrella is steady again, ready to make more trouble and make life hell for Alice and the movie audience. The post-credit scene is a blast, and shows that nothing is too bad it can't get any worse, ending the film almost as disrespectfully as Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse. With an unintelligent script and some scenes that surpass the barrier of ridicule, ""Resident Evil 4 - Restart"" doesn't start all over again, ending in another cliffhanger that will probably be destroyed right at the beginning of the already guaranteed fifth film.Watching all the movies, it's interesting to note that with each new chapter, Paul W. S. Anderson and the other producers seem to want to flee more and more from terror and the figure of the undead. The first feature, from 2002, was, yes, basically a zombie story. The second, from 2004, presented other monster concepts, such as the transformed Nemesis. In 2007, the series' third production was unapologetically an action story, set in desert landscapes - an undead Mad Max, if you will - placing Umbrella's scientists and bosses as the real villains. In this fourth episode, the zombies are finally mere supporting characters. They are slow in coming and are completely sidelined by Alice's arch-enemy, Albert Wesker. The only virtue of this film is that it proves that you can make a film with decent 3D photography for a reasonable budget.And, despite all the faults, a certain curiosity to know what comes next: will there finally be a definitive confrontation? Or, will the characters remain without concrete goals just surviving the film, more and more undead? We look forward to an upcoming film that not only delights in 3-D effects, but uses them to build a good narrative. Fresh Start is the first in the franchise (and that's after three films) that actually seems to have a sense of the sensory potential that something like Resident Evil can offer, even though it never comes close to the claustrophobic horror climate of the games. There are good intentions, there is effort on the part of those involved, but the films would still need more.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good Movie,"I gave Resident Evil: Afterlife a 10/10 because it was everything I expected it to be. It was nothing but action, suspense, and guns. I went to the movie theatre expecting a sequel of a motif that's beaten over and over again; zombies and guns. Though, Iwas surprised that the movie had played a little different from all of the other RE's. In this film, the main antagonist, Wesker, was confronted a lot. In fact, he was killed about 3 times in the movie. The only part of the film I didn't agree with was how he got away each time. He would somehow get in a big helicopter and fly off. It was kind of depressing , seeing as how the director couldn't think of a more creative way for him to escape. In the Resident Evil games, Wesker is portrayed as an extremely cunning individual and can often get out of trouble while still making it suspenseful or interesting. Often, the story would kind of lose its place at times. Scenes would jump from one another and you wouldn't understand what's going on. The movie didn't explain itself that well, but that's why it's a sequel, they expect you to know where they're coming from. Its obvious that the same people who create the game and those who make the movie are two totally different people. As for the special effects, there is a completely different story. The parts of the film that were shot in slow-mo were amazing. They timed it perfectly too. Usually, when things were getting blown up, the slow- mo aspect would jump in, making everything vivid and suspenseful. I think the important thing that the movie enforced was that there was going to be another sequel. Everything was pretty much left in question. No books were closed and that's what I expected. This film was not intended for an Emmy but more to provide us with some traditional RE action and suspense. One other aspect of the movie that I liked were the small clips that were put in from the video game. For those who play RE, they helped clarify or relate to what we understand and tied the plot a little tighter. Again, the reason I gave this film a 10/10 was because it was everything I expected. I wasn't surprised at all with the ending, but, like I said before, that's what I wanted in this particular movie. After all, it was created after a game that's been out for quite a while now.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
leave your brain at home,attention. leave your brain at home. it will not be needed to watch this movie. and WARNING if you attempt to bring it don't expect to leave the theatre feeling fulfilledIt bothers me that guns can fire endlessly. that is until the characters decide its time for a slow motion shot then they discard it and grab another from ?somewhere?It bothers me that alice supposely can fly from alaska to LA on one tank of fuel. Seriously whats with that? This movie has no plot and it would have been much more entertaining to fill in the gap here. If you use your brain you might have been able to surmise that she would have needed to land to refuel... landing at various airports trying to find fuel whilst defending from the undead would have been a more well thought out and entertaining plot IMOIt bothers me that the Hollywood appear to burn straight for 4 years. what is it made of? If it has enough energy to burn for 4 years straight then why aren't we running our cars on burning of Hollywood signs. this completely annoys me ... OH LETS HAVE A KEWL SCENE WHERE SHE FLIES BY THE Hollywood SIGN AND ITS LIKE ITS BURNING AND ITS LIKE A REMINDER OR SOMETHING OF PAST SOCIETY AND HOW LIKE ITS LIKE OVER CAUSE LIKE THE UNDEAD ARE HERE ! nevermind that after 4 years most if not ALL of the fires would be out of fuel.and most of all it bothers me that I watched an ~80 minute movie and I feel like absolutely nothing interesting happened. There isn't really a plot. the main character goes from one place to another. does one thing. then shoots a bunch and its over. It was the same with the movie before this resident evil extinction. who agrees with me that both these 80 minute movies could've been combined into one regular length movie? Go watch quantum of solice or inception and you will feel like you've been around the globe twice and enjoyed every minute of it.well at least there is one fun thing to do while watching this movie. try and count the bullets before the characters reload.PS Paul in the next movie can you just cast KACEY BARNFIELD as the only character. don't worry about the plot or dialog just have her on screen the entire time. god is she gorgeous,2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Seriously bad. Not worth watching.,"I have loved all the Resident Evil stuff for, well forever. I was extremely excited to see this movie and I left the theater feeling disappointed and tired. The writing was just sloppy, the action was average, the plot was stretching, and it was 100% completely over the top. It was just ridiculous. I wouldn't watch this again. I'm sure they're going to try to do it again and do the same thing.

Unbearable,"I'm kinda into Mila thanks to her movie debut with Bruce Willis and I kinda enjoy the Resident Evil general concept. With those two thoughts in mind I settled in for this title. What I was hoping for was a decent production. Boy, was I wrong.It's just... plain dumb an poorly executed. I really, really tried to enjoy this movie as I was watching it with my fiancée who likes the series. And this one left both of us with a bad taste in our mouth.The action scenes are inconsequent both in quality and pace, they lack flair or finesse. I find it insulting when every possible scene of the film is easily predictable (just as the final outcome).What is more - this part of the Resident Evil universe seemed to me as a prequel, not a sequel. The ending firmly established the plot for another production and does it in a way, which I find embarrassing.I could try to write about the plot, but it would just end in me smacking each and every part of it with a big hammer. Alongside with bashing Wentworth Miller for absolute lack of any acting skill, as he seemed to me to be Michael Scofield pasted into this universe. Well... with shooting added.There are no twists (well, for anybody above age 6), humor is non-existent and the actions scenes are surreal in their dumbness, poorly directed and simply boring.To be honest, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a movie worth missing.The one and only good part of the movie is the main actress herself. I find Mila a very beautiful (in a unique and intriguing way) woman.And I suggest watching ""The Fifth Element"" to experience that. It will be fun, exactly the opposite to Resident Evil: Afterlife.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

I tried to give it a go,"So I had this movie on blu ray quite some time now and never watched it. Think I got it for like a pound in a charity shop and I'm starting to realise why. Resident Evil after life is a one time watch and barely watchable the first time round. Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson Milla Jovovich returns as Alice. Now Im pretty sure I have seen the first one but there is such limited story telling here it doesn't really matter whether you have seen all the others or not. The main focus of this film appears to be action based cgi whilst considering what can pop out the screen in 3D from time to time and the content suffers at the expense of this. Milla Jovovich hasn't exactly impressed me as the lead character in this film. In fact I am finding myself wondering how this franchise has even made it this far with such wooden acting. I'm all open in using new characters in comparison to blatant following of video game source material. But I can't get past the facts of what made resident evil such a strong video game in the first place; none of these qualities seem to be prominent in any of the live action films. For a start is this trying to be an action movie or a horror? I interpreted it as both? Yet somehow this doesn't work well for me. It's based on resident evil 5 game which I played some time ago.Okay let's start with the story, the part I consider to be the most important of any film making process. It's pretty bland, Alice doesn't appear to have anything exciting making for a very one dimensional character who at some point is supposed to have lost her powers. These powers soon seem to re-emerge with out any explanation or if they don't she still seems mighty equipped in combat and strength. Even though I believe the films shouldn't just follow the games to the letter this particular film seems like just another zombie film where they are trapped in a building.What made resident evil so interest was the dark house or the police station alongside the loneliness and despair our main protagonists were put through. You'd find an odd character from time to time but you were pretty much alone trying to figure out puzzles and get the power back on. That's what made it scary and jumpy. The police guy Leon or Claire would also have to use some detective skills to solve what caused all this in the first place.Okay back to the film, using consist slow motion juxtaposed with loud rock like music doesn't save a film if the movie has no heart emotion or empathy. Wentworth Miller played a familiar character in Chris Redfield whilst Ali Larter was his sister Claire. Both were fairly solid compared with the majority or the remaining cast. However Wentworth Miller just wasn't Chris for me. It's disappointing to see this film be so dull and uninspiring flooded with action consisting mainly of cgi. You can also see where the wire work would've been for Milla Jovovich character as she seems so unconvincing in some of the action scenes. There is a part on the rooftop where she is shooting like she is playing an arcade machine. Unfortunately sometimes a good antagonist can go a long way in making a film more entertaining till we got Shawn Roberts as Albert Wesker. At one point he throws his sunglasses leaving Chris Redfield trying to catch them why? Why would Chris try to catch them he is on battle with him. Obviously this isn't Shawn Roberts thought, whilst his acting wasn't bad it never stood out neither. Now this scene is a replica of the fifth game, imitating parts with very close to source material shots, it appears to work for the games but not the films. Also the chemistry between certain characters felt rushed or forced. In the game Chris and Sheva appear very much like a cohesive unit. Alice and Claire barely know each other due to memory loss yet they work together like they never left one another.What I would give credit for is some of the cinematography was excellent along with some nice scenery regardless of it being location cgi or studio green screen. The 3D of this movie being the focus there is a lot more computer generated imagery than I'd normally like in a film. It's merged together nicely creating the illusion between on set to off set with fantastic editing. The production design appears to be where the strengths of this particular movie are. There are some nice face moulds for the zombies with the things that are done practical and prosthetic makeup.It's a worthy job to try create elements of the fifth game yet the moments which fail to entertain me most is the predictable story; alongside way too much slow motion panning, complete with the lead actress giving me very little charisma to enjoy. Overall the character development in the games is more interesting giving you the full on experience of living through the umbrella crisis.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprising disappointment,"After experiencing a fair amount of suspense and plenty of fun in the first three (though mostly the first two) Resident Evil installments, I decided to give the fourth part of the series-Afterlife-a shot.Full of hope, I went to my local library, borrowed the DVD, and played it on my Disc Player in the comfort of my home. I never expected to be so disappointed by the halfway mark.Knowing Paul W. S. Anderson from the first Resident Evil installment, I didn't think I would have a completely different experience with this film. For an hour and a half, I struggled to stay awake, predicting every next scene, watching fight sequences unfold with such ridiculous execution that it's hard to believe the movie was released in 2010. The special effects, by some miracle, looked worse than in the previous films, and the characters, devoid of any personality, resembled puppets in a marionette theater.The only reason I even considered giving it a 3/10 was probably Milla Jovovich carrying the film on her shoulders-though, admittedly, I may be biased in her favor. I have so many questions and so few answers-mostly due to the gaping plot holes.Was this a waste of an hour and a half of my life? No, I've seen worse. Did it change my life in any way? Yes, I've found a substitute for sleeping pills.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Mila tries to act here, but you do notice she isn't giving her best. I don't blame her, because the script has no end. Never ending resident evil...zombies, umbrella, blade 3 villain theft. I do believe this would make an awesome series, but to make sequel after a sequel, it loses its freshness.

Does exactly what I expected it would do - best of the first 4,"I just got around to watching the RE films as I found a special offer for the first four on blu-ray for a very cheap price. I have never played any of the games, nor do I know anything about RE i.e. I am not a fanboy. Having watched all four back to back I have concluded that the ranking should be as follows (best to worst):4th (2D version – the 3D version would almost certainly render it the worst of the 4), 2nd, 3rd (Mad Max homage), 1stMy logic is that these films seem to be a basic comic book bang-crash franchise and therefore they should be judged on their ability to deliver thrills, explosions and insanely silly plots. Four does this; two is an enjoyable remix of Escape from New York; three is OK but it really is a Mad Max rip-off; one looks like it came from the video game and no-one bothered to make it look like a film.Once again I am dumbfounded by reviews which complain about the lack of logic and the many plot holes in these films about an uber-babe who fights zombies and blows things up. Go and watch a Merchant-Ivory film if those sort of things concern you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Alice is back with no plot,"I like the Resident Evil movies, but this one had no plot. It's basically Alice and her friends shooting guns at zombies and using some Matrix style fighting. How did Alice get gas to fly the plane and what happened to all her clones after the beginning of the movie? And who was the bad guy with the sun glasses? Well, I guess none of that really matters as long as Alice is able to find a stash of guns along the way. How about when they get through into the sewer system, next shot is them on a boat out to the Arcadia. How did they get the boat, 15 minutes seemed to be missing. And Arcadia was disappointing, at least they could have had some mean mutant monster made by Umbrella on there.FINAL VERDICT: Adds nothing, skip it.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
How did this film ever get the budget,"I've given this 2 out of 10 just for the money they spent on the cars and guns and look... the film and story sucked, u may say its cuz i like the original games, i say its just a very bad film with references from the game. How bad is the story? i mean come on the 1st was terrible i hoped for better in the 2nd and 3rd and here i am subjecting my self to the 4th. my gf wanted to watch this just for that Wentworth Miller guy, what a joke this film was. I guess they spent all the money on the actors (who where terrible) and special effects because the Story script and almost everything else sucked. If you have played the game or enjoy a good story your going to be really disappointed, how ever if u like a load of nonces guns special effects with bad script story but pretty looking characters this is it i guess. please tell me if im wrong but this film was dreadful. how on earth did they get the money to fund this film~!?",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another step stone movie,"Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) is the fourth movie in the live-action franchise based on the video game franchise of the same name and it was written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson and it was another steaming pile of dog poop.Positives for Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010):
Milla Jovovich is still fine as Alice. I can say the same for Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield and Shawn Roberts as Albert Wesker. The zombie horror and action is fine enough. And finally, the movie does move at a quick enough pace.Negatives for Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010):
This movie once again fails to properly adapt the video games. This is another step stone movie in the Resident Evil franchise. Alice is still the main character when we should be focused on the actual characters from the video games. The Alice clone army from Extinction are killed off in the opening scene, so what was their purpose in the first place. Ali Larter still doesn't act like Claire Redfield in this movie. The slow-motion gets overdone here for no reason whatsoever. The Las Plagas and Axe Men are completely wasted in the movie. And finally, Albert Wesker's plan to eat Alice is really stupid.Overall, Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) is another horrible attempt to adapt these games, but my pain with these movies isn't over yet unfortunately.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Competent,"This film was competently made. The action, effects and acting were competent. However, they mostly went to waste with a subpar story and some quite silly sequences.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could be better or worse,"This was about as mediocre as I thought it would be. It's nothing to write home about. Well, I guess it is something to write a review about. Anyway, this chapter features the characters finding a new place free from zombies. There's little plot besides that. That's probably the film's biggest fault. It doesn't have much of a story other than them going to a place where people are supposedly safe. I guess the action scenes aren't bad. The main problem with this is the slow motion. I think it's probably the fault of the 3D people, but there are many times where it just isn't done well.I also kind of blame the 3D for having bad CGI. This is why Roger Ebert was opposed to this sort of thing! I having seen the last two movies but am not a fan of either these movies or the actual video games to really get invested to want to see them all. Besides, there's too many to list by now. They're supposedly over, I believe. I guess if you just want mindless zombie stuff, this is the movie for you. I know a tad bit about the games and from what I know, this is in fact pretty faithful.

Epic Sequence,"""Afterlife"" is not inferior to its predecessors. In fact, we have more fight, more adrenaline, more strength, and more special effects typical of a sci-fi sequel movie. The plot is clever, original and have logic sequence of events. And the music was very well selected and suited the scenes perfectly.As a viewer's we feel energetic with this work full of adrenaline, and with a script that is not so farfetched in our times.Thankfully the character Jill Valentine is back. The fearless, survivalist human with no hacks, only skill, sacrifice capabilities, focus and sheer will.It's so intense that I submerged in the film, and to achieve that the whole work of production needs to be incredibly well constructed. A cinematographic roller-coaster that don't make us feel agonized. On the opposite side of spectrum - made the viewer feel entertained, engaged and with the will to take part in the plot and in the scenes.Overall, I think that this movie deserves all 10 stars out of 10 available.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Milla Jovovich likes money""More of the same, but if you enjoy this kind of thing, that's not necessarily a bad thing.","Bound to please the legions of Milla fans who have doubtless poured over the extras-rich DVDs of the first three Resident Evils, as well as her please-sequel-this gem Ultra Violet.Inventive ideas, dazzling 3D and spectacular production design elevate this fourth in the franchise to a juicy bite above the average zombie movie. More of the same, but if you enjoy this kind of thing, that's not necessarily a bad thing.Afterlife is very likely to please at least most of the fans of the series, but don't expect too much aside from Milla looking great and a groovy visual style.If critics and fan boys weren't suckers for simplistic nihilism and high-pressure marketing, Afterlife would be universally acclaimed as a visionary feat, superior to Inception and Avatar on every level.There are worse ways to pass an hour and a half than watching Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter shooting the hell out of zombies and mutants.Milla Jovovich commands the screen and makes all the RE films a fun ride.

Excellent 3D Effects,"An action-packed continuation of the Resident Evil franchise that is definitely worth watching in 3D. The 3D effects are excellent, and then the film becomes even better.Milla Jovovich is always excellent as Alice, and Ali Larter is the right choice for Claire Redfield. The film is full of excellent action scenes that should definitely be seen in 3D.When I first saw the movie in 3D, it felt like I was watching another movie, and it was even better.Shawn Roberts is brilliant as Albert Wesker, definitely great casting. Wentworth Miller didn't strike me as the best choice for the role of Chris Redfield at first, but after watching the movie more closely, I think he did a good job.The action scenes are excellently directed, and they are even better to watch in excellent 3D. The story is tense and fast-paced, and the characters are fun and interesting.

F***king Perfect !,"Camera work and costumes are beautiful (love Alice's totally hip G.I. Jane ensembles so much!) as well as the very talented casts' performances. St. John the Beloved has seen such an incredible array of filmmakers' creative takes on the book of Revelation that I am almost tired of watching them (not really!), and the RE: franchise is holding that favorite spot along with The Chronicles of Riddick. That whole Noah's Ark/ RED Target theme is, for the most part, a little obscure for most people to fully appreciate right now.

"Fourth ""Resident Evil"" is certainly the best of the sequels.","Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her clones tries to kill Albert Webster (Shawn Roberts) from the Umbrella Coporation in his base at Japan. But Alice and her clones failed the mission. Now Alice is trying to find the survivors safe haven known as ""Arcadia"" in Alaska. Which her friends went there for help but once she arrives, she finds no one there but Claire (Ali Larter), who lost her memory and she seemed to be control by a device on her chest made from Umbrella Coporation. Now Alice goes to Los Angeles to find any survivors along with Claire. They find some survivors (Wentworth Miller, Boris Kodjoe, Kim Coates, Kacey Barnfield, Norman Yeung, Sergio Peris-Mencheta and Fulvio Cecere) living in a Maximum Security Prison. Alice finds out from the the survivors that ""Arcadia"" is actually a cargo tanker travelling along the coast. Which Alice, Claire and the survivors are very close to ""Arcadia"" but having trouble how to get there. While new mutations from Umbrella Coporation are trying to kill the remaining survivors by somehow getting into the prison. Which the group of survivors have to find an new way to get to ""Arcadia"" and helping each other to survive.Written and Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Alien Vs. Predator, Death Race, Event Horizon) made an entertaining, action, sci-fi/horror third sequel to the profitable ""Resident Evil"" series, which (obviously) is based on a popular video game. Jovovich is game as always in the movie. While Larter, Miller and Kodjoe are fine in their roles. While Roberts certainly having fun with his role. This time, Writer and Director:Anderson certainly takes his premise more seriously this time around. Although it doesn't stop Anderson increasing his visual style by giving tribute to ""The Matrix"" and two John Carpenter films like ""Escape from New York"" (Which for some reason an few of the prison sequences reminded me a lot of that movie) and ""The Thing"".There is no doubt that Anderson is planning ""Resident Evil 5"" and probably ""Resident Evil 6"". Hopefully, if Anderson has an few more tricks up his sleeve. For sure, the future sequels of ""Resident Evil"" should be good. I seen this movie only on the regular 2-D version. The movie looked good, despite some very obvious 3-D moments. ""Resident Evil:Afterlife"" is certainly an improvement over the semi-lame/mess ""Resident Evil:Apocalyspe"" and reasonably entertaining ""Resident Evil:Extinction"". Perphas not much Zombie action for some tastes. If you enjoy the games or better yet, the ""RE"" series, you will be entertained.

Sure you finally see Wesker, Chris, and find out Arcadia is fake, but thats the only big things you find out about. So I really think Paul Anderson, in all that time that he spent playing the games should have pulled a little more aspects from RE 5 and Code Veronica, because those were supposable the two games that he used to get inspiration from.

"Alice Is Back with a Vengeance in ""Resident Evil: Afterlife""","After the evil things Umbrella did to Alice and other people back in the first three films, she's back for vengeance in ""Resident Evil: Afterlife""! The 3D is excellent. I very regret about watching this only on DVD. I guess some directors don't maximize 3D, and I'm happy Paul WS Anderson did very well for this film.The opening credits are dark, gloomy, and mysterious. Fight scenes are kickass with guns, samurai swords, throwing stars, and other weapons. The T-virus abominations evolve, as with the Majini zombies and the Axeman. Slow-motion may be generic, but this film revolutionizes it.Alice finds new survivors in Los Angeles, and Chris Redfield is the main course here. Also, I guess the film relies on location. First, in underground Raccoon, second is overland Raccoon, third is the Nevada Desert, and the fourth has more than one: Tokyo, Alaska, and Los Angeles.The plot twists are very good and beyond predictions. Jump scares are present, especially which they are intensified in 3D. I should have watched this in 3D theater!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another worthy addition to the series,"Attempting to lead survivors to safety after becoming trapped in a prison overrun with the dead, Alice and her friends stumble upon the latest mutants sent by the corporation to take her down for exposing their past projects involving her.This is just a lot of fun with a lot of good stuff going for it. Among the best aspects here is the insanely frantic pace here that runs throughout the film which comes from the impressive encounters here. From the opening attack on the headquarters that devolves into a vicious gun-battle across multiple floors and rows of armed guards as the clones rip through the building, to the vicious brawl with the drugged associate at the airfield and the later scene in the prison all come packed With tons of action, shoot-outs, explosions and much more which is a good time here. That sets up the later scenes here with the mutants and zombies overrunning the prison from the showers which causes the flurry of gun-fighting and barricading to hold them off, the battles in the armory as well as the need to keep the main fence up before showing the big, explosive battle on the roof-top which is a great battle full of fine stunts and action so prominent in the franchise. The battle with the behemoths in the shower is fun as well, though there's plenty of fun here in the finale as the scenes in the ship where the big battle occurs between the ravenous mutant dogs and the transformed agent all make for quite a great time overall fighting with plenty of high-quality action, lots of gore, a fairly inventive monster and much more throughout here that keeps this entertaining. As well, there's a lot to like here with all the different beings and creatures found here, as the zombies look fantastic with the addition of their new tentacle-lined mouths, the new masked, hulking monstrosity that towers over everything is a great addition to the franchise and the various mutants featured here provide this one with a really nice mix of monsters to fight off here which is quite enjoyable. The last positive going on here is the rather strong storyline about the need for safety and being duped into becoming part of their plans which would be a logical follow-through to the rest of the series and makes this a lot of fun. There's really only one problem area here, which comes from this one having a lot of lengthy time waiting around in the prison before the escape which puts a halt to the action for a long period of time before it gets going again being the only thing that really hurts this one. While the CGI for the 3D gags isn't all that great either, this one turns out to be another fine addition to the series.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mix of Lord of the Rings + Prison Break + Matrix,"I am amazed by this sequel and movie. Although it was more extreme in some things it is still overall same in rating like previous sequels. I am amazed by the two actors from Prison Break tv series and their role being almost same as in that movie (engineer, prisoner, betraying person), and by graphics especially of that large monster, its axe/hammer and buildings, new abilities of umbrella and zombies. But it is too extreme that it just makes it more unreal and not convincing. This sequel tells us that there might be more positive and problem resolving sequels, like light at the end of the tunnel. There were also feelings of hope and excitement with bit of fear. The feelings are somewhat from the above mentioned 3 movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I don't understand how people can't get this and have different expectations about the movie. It's like a theme park ride, a fun one and if you get it, you get it if not.. whatever. I enjoyed this movie more than the first 3, probably because I watched it in 3D, the scene where Alice jumps off the roof combined with the music got stuck in my mind and is just breathtaking.TL;DR: watch it if you can enjoy a movie just for the sake of the action scenes,zombies, effects.If you're looking for something original/deep maybe you should watch something else.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Action Packed Zombie Thrill Ride,"Never did I imagine these movies to make it this long, but to my surprise they have and it looks like they will continue. I did like Extinction more than Apocalypse, but even I believed it was the end of the franchise. Then Afterlife comes and, although for me it is not as good as Extinction, it is quite entertaining and it blends a lot of elements and themes used in other zombie movies and media.So Afterlife takes off where Extinction left our survivors on their search for Arcadia, the supposed haven located in Alaska. Alice, in an attempt to once and for all stop the evil Umbrella Corporation, gathers her clone army and attacks the Umbrella HQ in Japan. After losing all her clones in an Akira like nuclear explosion, Alice returns to Alaska in search for her friends and Arcadia, but she only manages to find Claire, which seems to be in a stage of amnesia and no Arcadia. Then she and Claire fly to LA where they find refuge in a large prison complex which is inhabited by other survivors. But outside the prison, there are thousands of zombies tirelessly trying to break in the prison. Alice and the survivor have to figure out a way to escape the prison and make their way to Arcadia before the prison is finally overrun by the living dead.The Resident Evil movies are a far cry from the games or themselves. I did enjoy Afterlife prison idea and there's quite a good amount of zombie action and gore, but it falls flat in terms of story and screenplay. The characters seem too comic-book like and the story doesn't make much sense at times, but there's no denying that this movie is quite a ride and the zombies are ruthless, specially the one that carries a giant sledgehammer. Although Milla Jovovich character, Alice, is not from the game franchise, I think she carries these movies and they wouldn't be the same without her. To this point you can't compare the games and the movies, they are now two different entities that only share the same title. The F/Xs and visuals are great, the photography is excellent, and it has a killer soundtrack.I recommend Resident Evil: Afterlife as what it is; a horror/action/pop-corn movie, nothing more, nothing less.

I'd rather have watched a blank screen for an hour and a half. In fact if you're looking for a good laugh which I imagine isn't your intention, this would be a good try. The acting is awful and so is the plot. The gunfights wouldn't even be enjoyable if it was a video game and I was actually controlling her.

Not even really nice if you have low expectations,"Before I watched this part of the Resident Evil installment, I had lowered my expectation to the point of expecting my eyeballs to endure ~90 minutes of violence, lack of story and graphical, visceral combat. Like the other flicks in the genre, basically.The story itself is weak at best. Continuing from the previous movie, she finds herself following a transmission from the self proclaimed haven Arcadia and looking for survivors in LA, where she meets the rest of the film's cannon fodder surrounded by a rather large group of hungry looking people with a bad skin complexion.Now I enjoyed many zombie, splatter, lack-of-story films over the last years. Shawn of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Hobo With a Shotgun, blah blah... Loads. And I was expecting something similar, in all my naivety. From the start of the movie, all the way towards the start of the credits, it felt like I had watched every scene in the movie in other movies. At the beginning I just disregarded them, but as the first 20 minutes came to a close, I realized that it really was a bad ripoff of many well-know action movies. Scenes literally copied from the Matrix trilogy, Dawn of the Dead, The Island... the list is terribly long and wrong.Overall the movie is unsatisfying. The story is weak, the ending annoying, the character development is so bad that it just makes all of them unpleasant and you nearly shout ""YES!"" each time someone is turned to food. The flow of the movie is action packed and predictable, giving the weak story another punch in the groin and like going in thrill-rides in an amusement park, if you keep doing the same kind, you end up not enjoying them anymore. That's how this movie made me feel in the end.",,Anonymous,Horror
