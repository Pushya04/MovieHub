A fine game it is,"While we have new ingredients (= actors/characters) such as the girl formerly having a tattoo and a new bad guy, we also still have our beloved Holmes/Watson duo. And by that I mean the same actors in the role. Jude Law and especially Robert Downey Jr. having a lot of fun again and it shows.Some other characters return and we have the ""vision"" mode in the movie again (at least that's what I call it and I'm sure you know what I mean if you've seen the first guy Ritchie Holmes). Making the Holmes movies is not easy. There is not only a rich written history but also quite a few movies. I have to admit that I wasn't thinking of either. Ritchie managed to create a world (especially with the first entry into his Holmes saga), that can be seen as standalone.So if you liked the first one, you will like this one too. Even if you think you might be fed up by some of the neat tricks he's using or even if you expected Rachel McAdams to be back ""big"" in this movie too.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sherlock at the movies,"Doesn't matter how you look at it, this movie is darn good fun. I loved it from opening credits to the close. So what if the acting is a bit over the top, so what if there are probably too many explosions and bullets and bombs. The end result is a thoroughly entertaining 2 hours at the movies with popcorn and Pearl and Dean ads. Moriarty is sufficiently creepy and played with restraint, Holmes is completely over the top but for me if its Robert Downey Jr there are no complaints. The story keeps moving and the action is terrific. The story is loosely based on the last book of the Conan Doyle's first series of Holmes stories ending with the famous Reisenbach Falls in Switzerland. It also gives a great image of early 20th century on the brink of the first world war. If you want to enjoy a good story with great imagery and costume then you will enjoy this, if you are looking for Sherlock ( wonderfully called Shirley by Mycroft ) as Conan Doyle intended then you may be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Honeymoon in Brighton? Not today.,"So what's been happening lately?There has been a series of bombings and assassinations across Europe and if these activities continue, war will erupt and Europe will become a field of casualties and devastation. And our favorite detective Sherlock Holmes suspects Professor James Moriarty as the mastermind behind all these events.Meanwhile, amidst the bombings and destruction which are ravaging Europe, Sherlock Holmes's partner, Dr. John Watson is finally getting married with his fiancée Mary. After being engaged in the first film, they are finally getting married and a short funny wedding scene has been reserved in the film. They're even going for a honeymoon in Brighton. Or they were supposed to go for a honeymoon.The train the couple boarded was filled with Moriarty's henchmen and a loud, explosive battle ensues eliminating any hopes of an upcoming honeymoon. Even though Watson had been planning to retire from adventuring with Holmes after his wedding, he reluctantly becomes Holmes's partner one more time while his wife is taken care of by Holmes's brother, Mycroft. And the duo will receive an additional member to form a trio: the mysterious gypsy Madam Simza. Together, they try to stop Moriarty from continuing his cruel schemes and Holmes learns about Moriarty's plan to start a war in which he will personally benefit from.There are lots of action scenes that keep the film exciting and keep the film running in a constant, fast pace. The action sequences are louder, much more explosive, and much more energetic than the ones present in the predecessor. They are very loud, operatic, and exuberant. But some of the battle sequences are surprisingly quiet, such as a simple chess game held between Holmes and Moriarty. While you think a chess game would be boring, Guy Ritchie filmed it as if it was a grand battle. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the dialog adds another layer of tension and makes the chess game scene more atmospheric.Not only the action scenes, but the humor here is outstanding. Most of the jokes and humor come from the titular character himself. His bizarre behavior, regardless of his intelligence add a layer of comedy to the film. His trademark hobby, disguising into several unexpected people is just purely entertaining. If it weren't for Robert Downey Jr., the humor here would have collapsed and become a disaster.And of course, the acting and performances by the cast were brilliant and outstanding. Robert Downey Jr. is just brilliant in portraying the titular detective. He is admirable and he is really a man of talent. Don't worry, Jude Law also plays the role of Dr. John Watson perfectly. Together, they form an excellent chemistry. Also worth mentioning is Noomi Rapace as the mysterious gypsy Madam Simza, who not too long ago played the role of Lisbeth Salander in the original version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"". Stephen Fry plays the role of Mycroft Holmes to perfection.I'd like to take some time discussing the character of Professor James Moriarty. He is a very compelling villain. His professional life as a criminal mastermind is hidden beneath his profession as a professor in the University of Cambridge. He is much more intelligent, much more cunning, and much deadlier than Lord Blackwood of the previous film. While Holmes seems to be a detective that can do no wrong in the previous film, here, he will make mistakes. Here, he will feel pain. Moriarty is just a very powerful villain and a very suitable opponent for Holmes. (And remember the slow-motion scenes where Holmes elaborates his fighting strategies in his mind, Moriarty can do it too.) And to further compliment this is the performance of Jared Harris. While he may not look suitable as an antagonist, he actually makes a perfect choice.However, the film uses too much slow-mo effects. This is largely noticeable in one particular scene which has an extensive use of slow-motion. I know the effect is mainly used to make it look more stylish but there is certainly too much of them. Running at a duration of 129 minutes, it could have been shortened if some of the slow-mo effects have been removed.Not only the slow-mo effects, but this film seems to have lost its trademark element of mystery that is present in the first film. Even though there are some mystery present here, they are not as mind- boggling as the ones present in the first film. In the first film, there are just so many questions that popped up and Holmes really has something to work on. But here, it's not mysterious. You know the full details immediately.Nevertheless, ""A Game of Shadows"" is a pleasant experience and a whole lot more fun than the original film. Its operatic action scenes will entertain the audience and its comedic scenes will add a layer of laughter. With powerful performances from the cast, this film is one not to be missed in this movie season.Final Verdict: ""A Game of Shadows"" is a stylish, fast-paced, yet comedic adventure which improves upon its predecessor in several aspects, and surely a highly recommended film.Rating: 8/10Thanks for reading my review on ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"". I do hope this review is useful.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bonkers good fun.,"Holmes and Watson battle Moriarty.I loved it, it is an absolutely bonkers, of the wall thrill ride, and purists of the traditional Holmes stories will probably be appalled, but if you're after two hours of intense fun, and high energy excitement, you will love it.The cast are tremendous, Downy, Law and Harris are all first rate, hard to put a pin between the trio, and ten years on, the special effects are still jaw dropping.It's good fun as well, several laughs, I loved Downey's various disguises, reminiscent of Rathbone.I love how some elements are thrown in, the events of Reichenbach, the appearance of Moran etc, although you can't really think Conan Doyle would ever have imagined most of the events here.Rip roaring good fun, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a relief! The trailers lied--it was awesome. :),"We just got back from the earliest showing we could get a sitter for. I can say with confidence that my fears about this movie were totally unfounded, and I now hold Guy Ritchie and these writers in the highest regard. Without going into spoilers, here are the three concerns that were put entirely to rest: 1) After seeing the trailer, my biggest worry was the use of ""bullet-time"" type photography during a Victorian-era movie. I thought it would be completely anachronistic and pointless. However, they'd already established in this movie and the previous one that Holmes is hyper-aware of his surroundings. The bullet-time was used to convey how traumatic a couple of scenes were to someone with that type of awareness, and it worked beautifully.2) Jared Harris looked so vanilla and soft in the promo pics and trailers that I couldn't imagine him as a fearsome adversary for Holmes. However, his Moriarty is so devious and cunning, and at one time downright sadistic, that I don't think they could have made a better choice. A couple of times I felt like he was channeling his father (the outstanding Richard Harris) without the warmth and empathy that the late actor conveyed. Can you imagine Richard Harris as a cunning, calculating perfectionist that's totally devoid of concern for human life? You won't have to after watching his son. It's freaky. And he sings.3) Holmes' relationship with Watson (and in a small way, Irene Adler) is fantastically developed. Saying any more than that would be too spoilery.So, watching this w/ my husband(who is a die-hard Sherlock fan, and used to read Sherlock Holmes aloud to me every rainy night, complete w/ voices) was a fabulous experience. We can't wait to see it again, and own it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Elementary Holmes,"Professor Moriarty: Are you sure you want to play this game? Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid you'd lose.In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, my mind turns two ways: The first half is guns, gunpowder, and gymnastics. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) contend with the salvation of civilization mostly through athletics, aided by director Guy Ritchie's considerable skill with the camera and graphics.But in the second half, when the duo moves swiftly but intellectually to confront the arch villain Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris), my mind is at equilibrium, renewing my love of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original brainy, eccentric sleuth. The chess game is a marvel of strategy, replete with revenge, intrigue, and just plain ingenuity. Director Guy Ritchie's visuals include delightful Downey disguises and lively speed ramping in a forest bombarded by bullets. Hans Zimmer's music leans heavily on the fiddle to lighten the load of a difficult plot.Watson's marriage, rather than taking away from the bromance, adds unexpected color and creativity. So Ritchie has ramped up the intellectual content and at least balanced it with the athletic, which was a strength of his 2009 version, Sherlock Holmes. With Inspector Lastrade just a memory and Holmes's love, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), appearing briefly, we are left to enjoy not so much the interaction of Holmes and Watson but the explosiveness of Holmes and Moriarty.After a first half of explosions, the second half satisfies traditionalists like me for the chess game of life and death—and that's the suspenseful fate of the world in those pieces. Director Guy Ritchie has improved on his 2009 version.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than the first one,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. I have been waiting for it for what feels like forever now and it truly did not disappoint. The storyline was clever, the dynamic between Watson and Holmes was charming and beautiful, and the effects were incredible. Honestly, as much of a fan I am of the first movie, its sequel surpassed it and my overall expectation. Some the effects were unnecessary at times, but I really enjoy the style in which these movies are edited. It can be slightly confusing periodically, another reason to rewatch, still pay attention closely. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr.'s chemistry was compelling and the supporting actors were on par. I laughed, I nearly screamed, and I even cried. Game of Shadows is gripping, exciting, hilarious,and even draws tears. You'll be cheering throughout and satisfied with the end. Too be honest, it is absolutely one of the best movies of this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not as good as the first, but very entertaining","I, as a fan of Sherlock Holmes and of the portrayals given by Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett, personally loved the first Sherlock Holmes, it was fun, stylish and clever, with impeccably matched leads and a good villain, even with moments of annoying slow-motion, things getting convoluted and draggy in the second hour and Rachel McAdams.Although the trailers suggested otherwise, I very much enjoyed this sequel. While there are a few improvements to the first film, it is overall not as good. My problems with the film come from the eventually annoying slow-motion in every fight sequence, it was fine at first but after a while it was overkill. I also felt there were too many characters some of whom don't have much time to develop, and instead are either come and go or blink and you'll miss. Lastly, the last forty-five minutes or so felt-like the first-rather sluggish in the pacing.However, the film still looks wonderful, with the sets especially absolutely spectacular and a lot of effort is done into making the atmosphere evocative. The cinematography and lighting are also very good, with the lighting in particular giving some scenes a suitably haunting look. The music score is rousing, Guy Ritchie's direction is more efficient this time around, the first hour and a quarter or so goes at a cracking pace and more than makes up for the rather duller half and the dialogue especially with Holmes crackles.Despite some of my criticisms, there were a couple of improvements. One was Noomi Rapace, whose appearance and style is much more suited to the period, McAdams as Irene gave it her all in the first but I sometimes found her hair and the way the character dressed jarring. Two is that apart from the draggy last act the story this time around is much more involving and contains much more going on to compel the viewer, the first was generally a great idea and was fun but got a little confusing by the end. Lastly, Jared Harris as Moriaty, Mark Strong was good but Moriaty as a whole is a more interesting villain, and I loved how cunning yet smooth Harris' performance was.Not to mention Stephen Fry as Mycroft, a wonderful and very thoughtful performance in my view, and he even gets his own nude scene. In fact all the cast bring a lot of gusto to the roles even the sidelined(personally I found this a wise move) McAdams. I do wish though there was more of Eddie Marsan as Lestrade, his ineptness is such a great contrast to Holmes' more clever and inquisitive approach and I would have loved to have seen that come through more. Robert Downey Jnr once again is a very charismatic Holmes, and Jude Law as the more authoritative and composed character of Watson is also perfect. Again they are impeccably matched and work wonderfully together.All in all, I found it very entertaining. Although there are a few things I preferred here, I did prefer the original, but this sequel compared to the film the trailers made it look is equally worthy. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
NO disappointment in this sequel,"Talking about sequels, more often than not, they are disappointment compared to the original. But this team has done again. They brought back the sequel with quality. I enjoyed this film as much as I did in the first part. The action, thrill, intelligence, all are placed perfectly in this film. The screenplay and making pattern is pretty much same as the first part and story moving in good pace. The main characters did a fantastic job once again. Holmes and Watson chemistry is perfect and delivered a great performance. Here I really like the way how the hero and villain play their games, both are very clever and the equality was very interesting. Simply, if you liked the first part, just go for this one. This is perfect entertainment and No disappointments.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A more action-packed Holmes,"""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow"" picks up where the prequel left off; Holmes is tracking down Professor Moriarty, a man he believes is responsible for a series of bombings and mysterious deaths around world. With the help of his pal Watson (off to be married soon), and a gang of gypsies, which includes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Noomi Rapace, set out on a game of cat-and-mouse to find the schemes of the sinister Professor.Though there is an element of mystery in this film, it is not as in-depth as the first film. Rather the focus is on the action sequences and clever humor. This is not necessarily a bad thing though; in fact it helps move the plot along. The first film suffered because the story was slow. In this Holmes though, there is not one second that drags. The story itself is not special, but its pace is what counts. Walking out of the theater, I felt refreshed and glad that I saw this movie.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are once again a true treat to watch as Holmes and Watson. Their chemistry and interactions are perfect; it's easy to tell that both had fun with the script and with each other. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty gives a solid performance, as a cold, manipulative, power hungry villain. Unlike Mark Strong in the first film, he is a believable antagonist. Noomi Rapace is a nice flavor as Madam Sim.The set and costume designs are exquisite, bringing to life of what Europe was like in the late 1800s. I smell Oscar for these departments. The sound and editing is crisply done, and the music is top-notched—Hans, you're truly the best. The visual effects are mostly good, but some scenes were a bit over the top and borderline ridiculous. One of many examples include a woman being thrown from a fast moving train into a river, without sustaining injury or even dying. This is impossible. Then again, it's Hollywood. The filmmakers aren't doing their job if a sense of the ridiculous is not thrown into an action flick from time to time.""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow"" delivers as a great, action-packed, and a rather humorous, popcorn loving flick. Note: the dog dies again.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining and a lot more fun than the original outing,"As much as I loved the character interactions and insane chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, I was very much let down by Sherlock Holmes when I first saw it a few years ago. It was a really stylish and well-made film, but the storyline bored me to tears. I came in incredibly excited to see it, and left wishing it had ended sooner. With the obvious sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows upon us, I figured I would go in with much lower expectations and brace for something along the same lines.Europe is at the brink of war, with many little seemingly unconnected events occurring across the nations. Sherlock Holmes (Downey Jr.) believes it to be the work of the brilliant Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris). He enlists the help of his sidekick, Watson (Law), to help him uncover the truth, before it is too late.With less of a focus on the occult, a stronger plot and a significantly more interesting villain, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows outdoes its predecessor in many respects. It ups the thrills and the action, continues the fun, and delivers one of the better sequel going experiences this year.Even though the story is a bit wonky in certain respects (more on that in a moment), I feel A Game of Shadows manages to feel a lot more grounded than the original. There is a clear storyline, and an even clearer path of where the film wants to go. It stalls here and there, as I imagined it would, but it never lingers like the original did. The art direction is just as incredible as it was, and the special effects seem to have been improved greatly. Where the first film flopped around, this film picks up the slack.While Downey Jr. and Law are just as impeccable and well matched as they were the first time round, the film benefits greatly from the addition of Harris as Moriarty. The character's presence was felt throughout the first film, but the film noticeable lost its edge by simply referring to him in passing and hinting at what a sequel could have had in store. Bringing him into the fold, he immediately is tenfold better than Mark Strong ever could have hoped to be. Watching Harris match wits with Downey is simply astounding, and makes for the most wildly enjoyable parts of the film. There is never a dull moment when he is around, and instead of making the film drone on, he invigorates it with an immense amount of energy. Harris knows exactly how to look deceptive, even with a wide grin and dialogue that does not even hint at ulterior motives. His looks are downright terrifying in a lot of instances. This is his first major film role, and I can only hope filmmakers continue using his dastardly skills for antiheroes and villains alike.I think the film's biggest hurtle, and the one that hurts it the most, is that there are simply too many characters and too many of them did not need to appear in the first place. Rapace's character is nothing more than a plot device, used to connect certain sections together and forgotten almost entirely all too often. The practically blink-and-you- will-miss them moments for Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan feel more like Richie peddling to the fans, as opposed to actually serving a real point to the film. It is fun seeing them show up again, but considering they have little to no effect on the plot, they could have easily just never showed up at all. But the far worst offender of not serving any purpose is Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes. He brings a ridiculous amount of humour to the film, and he is a welcome addition on the onset. But as the film progresses, it becomes clear he is merely there simply to make the film even more ludicrous and silly than Downey Jr. makes it. When the inevitable third film drops, I hope they actually use him effectively, instead of making his appearance feel like a mere tease.What also hurts the film is Richie's incessant need to use slow motion in every action sequence. While it works insanely and surprisingly well for the film's centrepiece involving a foot chase through a forest, it feels like overkill in almost every other instance. We understand from the first film that Holmes likes to evaluate the moves of both his adversaries and himself before he makes them, but watching him plot it out helps drag the film out longer than it needs to be. It is fun and worthwhile when it is used sparingly, or used to draw attention to something specific. But when Richie is one-upping Zack Snyder in the worst possible way, it begs the question of whether he learned any mistakes from the first film or not. At just under 130 minutes, I feel like a good fifteen minutes of slow motion could have been sped up, and would have looked just as great. Hell, Richie potentially could have shown off a bit of his own style too, instead of just what he cribbed from everyone else.While the film still has its problems, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is an enjoyable ride from start to finish. It maintained my interest, where the first film had me counting the excruciating minutes before it would end. Richie still has a lot to learn about as a filmmaker (and even more as a man who creates his own style instead of Tarantino-ing from others), he does know how to make a crafty film. Now if he can stop hinting at future installments and just give us a film that sticks to being about the story at hand, then maybe we might just get the perfect rendition of this legendary detective.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
excellent sequel,"I went to see this film last night and was immersed in it from the very first minutes.The action was constant edge of the set stuff, the locations stunning, the CGI, the acting excellent. The use of slow motion in this film adds to the action.The only possible minus would be a little too much flesh from the weighty Stephen Fry. How Kelly Reilly kept her composure I have no idea, but I would expect it was easy to look away.The best part for me was the verbal war of wits between Moriarty and Holmes especially.Clever writing and acting. Also, the ending; it left me wanting more.It is not often that a sequel is as good as the original film. I would suggest that this is better.

The film has a colorful atmosphere , it's in glowing images with lights and shades that originate strange setting . Set design is of first rate , the movie is very atmospheric , the crowed streets , shady and dirty slums of London , trains , buildings are very well designed but with excessive use of computer generator images . Screenwriter Michael Johnson provides the original plot , creating the basis for this particularly storyline . The film boasts a beautifully cinematography by Philippe Rousselot and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer , both of whom also worked in the former part . This big budgeted production by Joel Silver sparkles with polish and wit and the ending is as exciting as moving and being well directed by Guy Ritchie . Due to Warner Bros.' fast-tracking of this sequel, director Guy Ritchie was forced to drop out of Lobo, while Robert Downey Jr. was forced to drop out of Cowboys & Aliens.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Bigger Action Holmes,"The thing about Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is it's designed more as an action film than a mystery. The first film shows many strange new things to Sherlock Holmes. Making him a fighter with a brilliant mind. It's a great innovation to the character. In this new film, things just got bigger, louder, and more action packed than ever. The film still has the brains but the plot is discombobulated by the non-stop action scenes. The action is really good but it loses the focus to the plot. Though, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are still fun to watch together and the filmmaking is solid. It's probably enjoyable enough as a blockbuster film.The first film already introduced Moriarty. We get to know more of him in this sequel. It shows how threatening and menacing he is. The story is quite clever to show all of his schemes. Just like in the first film, Holmes does his thing. Disguising, predicting his fighting, and other stuff. Interesting thing here is his defiance between him and Moriarty. The action is impressively exciting but it makes the plot somewhat plodding. The best moments goes to the relationship of Holmes and Watson. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have a fascinating chemistry which lightens film.The action is bigger here than the first one. It's more than just martial arts fighting. The film has larger scale and louder explosions. Guy Ritchie did a clever move to these scenes. Giving plenty of momentum and thrills. The performances are good as always. Like what I said, Downey Jr. and Law are both fun together. Stephen Fry is delightful. Jared Harris works better as Moriarty than the one from the first film. The problem of the first Moriarty was he sounded like Mark Strong which made it feel like he is another Blackwood. Harris gives a sly menace to the role. Makes it fascinating. The rest of the filmmaking, the production design is decent and Hans Zimmer's music still nails all the scenes and really fits perfectly to the series.I don't know what will Sir Arthur Conan Doyle think about these movies. He will might remain perplexed by what the filmmakers has done to his works. It's never a bad thing but it feels extraneous to the character. It's still enjoyable and clever. We still enjoy Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes. This is the new Holmes now. It has loud explosions and loud excitement. But it could have used more better mystery which it lacks in these films. Then again, this is just a blockbuster that wants to make things louder and smarter.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Slow action and Holmes' martial arts become tiring after a while,"""A Game of Shadows"" is the sequel to the modern first film, ""Sherlock Homes"" of 2009. It continues with the slow-motion, pre-descriptive dialog of various scenes - especially those involving fighting. While I found the first of the fast-action fictional and comic book character films entertaining, the almost non-stop action began to wear thin after a few years.The real Holmes off Arthur Conan Doyle's creation solved crimes by his cunning and brain. That's apparently not enough for modern Hollywood firms and/or audiences. Now, they must have a Holmes who is a master in martial arts, fisticuffs, and brawling mayhem.So, this film soon became tiring, even though I stayed with it to the end. The one line I found quite clever and funny was by Holmes when he says, ""It's so overt it's covert. As with the previous film, the CGI work with this film makes the London streets and various scenes seem unreal - made up.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This time around Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) has little screen time, but she does drive the storyline. It is too bad she's not there because the chemistry between Irene and Sherlock jumps off the screen. The film feels the absence terribly. Simza is no replacement.

what a mess!,"what's going on here? the first one was okay, but the second one was totally lost. this is a very messy and pretentious movie. we have seen that r.d.j.'s limit in playing a British detective, his way of speaking was such a pretentious phony accent that most of the time was not quite easy to catch since he got to tighten his jaw and flat out his lips to pronounce the accent, while j.l., an English man, never had such problem, because he did not have to pretend that he was a British. then again, what's the purpose of making a detective work became a completely action and fighting movie? lot of slow motions, lot of purposefully quickened fighting scenes which didn't give any depth to sherlock holmes detecting talent, he just became a MMA UFC contender, a middle aged guy tried so hard to do a lot of physical endeavor. what is the purpose of making a detecting movie into an action packed nonsense? the answer might be using this two movies and balloon them into a marketable video game, so it must be full of action, fighting sequence to make it work. but this movie actually mindlessly ruined a quite deep and mysterious character in a classic way. in this two movies, we've got nothing but pretentious dialog, pretentious and over-the-hill chasing and fighting scenes, a very busy and messy treatment in every way to ruin these two literary characters, they were just clowns and fighting robots, and 'the game of shadow' was even worse, more clueless, messy and unfocused. what we saw in this movie were lot of costumes, lot of mimic pretentiousness. it's a very hollow and blurry movie that kept feeding you fighting scenes but less depth of analysis detective works. it became a MMA movie with some scenario and plot. the directing was so messy since the screenplay was ridiculous. there's no character in this movie worthwhile, nobody was memorable. once the lights dimmed, you were just watching a circus on the big screen, very noisy, busy, funny characters, clowns, music kept coming out one after another....there was nothing for you to go along with the detective to solve a case, the movie was for your eyes but not for your brain, and once you realized it's just a farce, then immediately you lost the interest and patience to watch along. this is a soul-less, mindless messy movie. stay away from it.",,Anonymous,Mystery

A tribute to Arthur Conan Doyle's work,"This was a very enjoyable movie with breath-taking action sequences. The 'chase through the woods' scene was spectacularly done through slow-motion but it isn't until ""Little Hansel"" is unleashed when the viewer is left truly awestruck.The scenes between Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Moriarty (Jared Harris), greatly done, are the focal points of much of the movie's plot. The chemistry between Downey Jr. and Jude Law are also further developed from the first movie. My only complaint about this sequel is that Mycroft Holmes' character was dismissed as utter garbage.Hans Zimmer's score deserves a worthy mention. All in all a thrilling movie that conveys Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes to our more 'adrenaline hungry' generation.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Holmes vs. Moriarty exchanges are captivating; the same cannot be said for Holmes & Watson,"Even though there are now two films in Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes, I am still getting accustomed to the athletic, street fighting Holmes as opposed to the merely cerebral genius who used to chase suspects by horse and buggy rather than bash their brains out in back alleys. In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the villain is more formidable, the action consumes more screen time, and the jokes are more cringe inducing. Sherlock (Robert Downey Jr.) has noticeably upped his drug habit with side references to cocaine and routinely drinks embalming fluid rather than boring old brandy.Why the sudden surge for uppers? First, Sherlock is matching wits with Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). Moriarty appears to match Holmes man to man intellectually; however, he has follows no moral code or displays any hint of empathy whatsoever. This makes his the most dangerous man in Europe. I will not divulge any plot points concerning his evil deeds because that is half the fun of a Sherlock story, following the trail as he discovers clues which lead him to the next location. Second, Dr. Watson (Jude Law) insists on going through with his marriage, a prospect Sherlock frequently reminds him will destroy his manhood and shatter his well-being.Sherlock's interactions with these two characters, Moriarty and Watson, define the high and low ends of this film. When Sherlock and Moriarty share the same room, real tension emanates from the screen. Their verbal sword play is a credit to the writing and the actors who joust for tactical advantage just by using metaphors. Two scenes between these men jump to mind. Early on, Sherlock analyzes Moriarty's handwriting while Moriarty warns Sherlock of the dangerous path he is following. I will not describe a later scene between the two gentlemen, but it is the most effective in the film as they mentally assail one another.The low and tedious end is Sherlock's interactions with Watson. The relentless double entendres about their 'relationship' lead the audience to question whether or not Sherlock is homosexual. For a wisecrack or two, this would provide levity and amusement. Unfortunately, the script persistently wails against this dead horse of a joke. A homoerotic double meaning pops up about every 30 seconds when Sherlock and Watson share the screen. It soon grows dreary and began to test my patience, especially during an extended sequence with Sherlock in drag.What always ends up bringing the script back on track is what Sherlock is known for, his fascinating method of deductive reasoning. Before he makes a move, the script may flash forward as he meticulously plans his next position in a street brawl or it may flash a few minutes back in time to show the audience just how he set up the bad guys to fail. Sherlock is always one step behind Moriarty who regularly seems to be the smarter of the two; however, if you are the individual planning the executing the scheme, those following you will always appear to be lagging behind you.I slightly recommend this new Sherlock mainly for the enjoyment of the Sherlock vs. Moriarty moments and the fascinating moments when Sherlock pauses to explain the situation to someone (usually the audience) as to what and why he is taking a particular course of action. I hesitate to strongly recommend this film because of the awful dialogue between Sherlock and Watson and because of the standard Guy Ritchie cinematography style. Guy Ritchie is known for inventive and momentum shifting action scenes. Sometimes bullets fly faster than the speed of light and then shift to 'Matrix' time sothe audience can watch it pierce someone's clothing. Shifting between fast and slow motion in action sequences is helpful to determine the placement of good and bad guys, but after a particular amount of time, these shifts become significantly noticeable where instead they should be only slightly perceptible. When the third or fourth action sequence began, I was prepared and expected the momentum shifts which instead of drawing me into the scene actually had the opposite effect and took me out of it.There are certain expectations and pitfalls a second film in a series runs into. Will it have the same mood and presence as the first film? Is it just there to take up space to make it a trilogy? In A Game of Shadows, Sherlock's character is a bit more interesting because of the drug habit and especially because of the villain; however, Watson is beginning to draw eye rolls instead of applause as the sidekick.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very typical for a sequel.,"This movie is very typical for a sequel, which is of course not necessarily a good thing to say. It means that the movie is trying to surpass its original, by trying to be bigger and better in about every way imaginable. But because most sequels try hard, they also fail at this, which is unfortunately also the case for this movie.No, it's not a bad movie. It's still quite entertaining and well made of course but the movie tries to do things differently from the first movie. The first movie was a bit of a surprise to me. I liked it way more than I could ever had imagined, so I also was quite looking forward to this sequel. And even though it's far from bad, it still disappoint me.First of all, thing that makes this movie a bit different from the first one is because Guy Ritchie is being more Guy Ritchie this time around. I have always liked Guy Ritchie and his movies (well, most of them) but one of the reasons why ""Sherlock Holmes"" came as such a surprise for me, was that it was being quite different from Ritchie's normal style. For this movie he however seemed to have gone back more to his old style of film-making, so that means its characters go far more over-the-top, as does its humor and visual style of film-making (weird camera angels and editing, the slow-motion, etcetera). It doesn't really suite a movie set in the late 19th century.But the movie is also needlessly trying to be different in other ways. It changes settings for instance. I just don't get why you would ever want a Sherlock Holmes movie to take place outside of England. Sherlock Holmes and England go together like fine wine and cheese but above all, I also feel they should be together. The movie however decided it was a good idea to let Sherlock Holmes travel Europe. It's just not the same atmosphere and settings you would expect and want from a Sherlock Holmes movie, in my opinion but perhaps I'm just nitpicking.But another adjustment that just doesn't much to the movie at all, is the addition of a couple of new characters. Sherlock's brother Mycroft is in this but why exactly? And was Noomi Rapace really necessary? It are all little things that the movie did not needed to have in it at all.But what it could had used was a better villain, or perhaps a more charismatic actor playing him. This is professor James Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes' arch-nemesis. His Lex Luthor so to speak! Yet the movie really hardly features Moriarty at all and I really missed the cat and mouse type of play between the Holmes and Moriarty. They are both equally brilliant, with as a difference that Holmes is one the good side of the law (well, most of the time). They constantly try to outsmart each other and be one step ahead of the other, all the time. This is at least the way it all should had been but the movie just doesn't do any of this really.And its story...well, it seems to become a trend but half of the time I had no idea what was going on in the story or what the point- and all of the character's motivations were. It was a bit of a messy told movie at times but if you simply surrender yourself to it, which should be easy to do, you'll still have a good time watching.It's still a real quality made movie, with a great, unique visual style to it. It's obvious this was not a cheap movie to make but it all pays off. The movie is featuring some great action in it, which is perhaps not something you would expect from a Sherlock Holmes movie. But it's really something that adds to the high quality and entertainment value of this movie.The movie is still fun and entertaining, also thanks to its characters (the ones that aren't redundant for the movie) and actors playing them. Robert Downey Jr. gives the movie so much and I honestly couldn't imaging any other actor playing the role of Holmes so great, fun and charismatically as he does.Definitely an inferior sequel but still fun, good and entertaining enough all!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The 1st Movie  Was Better,"Well, I am bit puzzled. What can I say? Was the movie well done? Yes and no. There are certain weak parts and obvious stronger bits. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jnr both are great as Watson and Holmes, as well as Stephen Fry is a very funny Microft. But then, there are some big mistakes in casting. Noomi Rapace is The biggest blunder. She was great in The Swedish Girl Who... Trilogy, but here no. She is weak, pale, blunt, shallow and gray. The only part we remember of her? Her eating some food near The Eiffel Tower. Pity that there is no so much Rachel McAdamas this time, she was great then and good here What else can I say? The movie is well cut and shot, it is dark and ominous, as intended, and some scenes are pure Matrix-quality.

Game of Shadows is a laugh and thrill-packed adventure,"Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows follows the pattern of the first movie with Sherlock & Dr. Watson facing off against an evil villain. In this second going around, the great chemistry and interaction of Sherlock & Dr. Watson take the movie to a whole new level of fun and laughs.I enjoyed the director's style in the movie, though many people will not. The director uses many unique views and lots of slow motion and stop action to highlight the realism of the film. In addition, the director's goes both back in time to highlight how Sherlock unravels specific mysteries and forward in time to visually walkthrough Sherlock's anlaysis of a situation. The style is unique and dynamic.While Robert Downey Jr. has the central role as Sherlock, Jude Law steals the movie with his portrayal of Dr. Watson. Throughout the movie, the pair have great interactions, and their back-and-forth dialogue generates lots of funny moments. Robert Downey Jr. carries off the eccentricities of Sherlock with great enthusiasm, but Dr. Watson's expanded role adds to the depth of their relationship.A pleasant surprise in the film was the introduction of Sherlock Holmes' brother, who added some charm and comedy to the film in his small role. On the other hand, I was somewhat disappointed in Sherlock's nemesis Dr. Moriarty. The actor did a competent job, but the role didn't live up to the hype of Sherlock's ultimate foe.Overall, Game of Shadows was enjoyable with an interesting story line, lots of action, and plenty of laughs. However, many will be put off my the director's unique, in-your-face style, which I enjoyed.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Yes they are both detectives and they solve crime, but thats about it. Many characters in this movie doesn't exist in the original book, a lot of the main story of the film don't exist in the book and Sherlock Holmes don't act like the Sherlock Holmes in the book would have done. The creator of this movie has not given Sherlock Holmes the credit that he deserves. This movie doses not deserve to be called Sherlock Holmes.

Great but by no means better than the original.,"Sherlock Homes: A Game of Shadows is the sequel to the famous Oscar nominated Sherlock Holmes released in 2009 but does it have enough juice to beat or compete with the 'Original'?It has a brilliant story to it and Guy Ritchie keeps his reputation for an action man. The visual effects were mesmerizing!!The only thing that lets it down, is its acting. Don't get me wrong it wasn't poor but sometimes you'd just feel that Robert Downey Jr. was trying too hard to duplicate the effect he created in the first Sherlock installment (kinda like Johnny Depp did it too much in the third and fourth parts of Pirates of the Caribbean). But, that wasn't a big issue as that was overshadowed by brilliant acting from Jude Law and Jared Harris. I particularly liked Jared Harris as Pro. Moriarty, very, very well done.So, does it beat the Original? I'd say 'NO' and I think most people would agree. The story was great like the first one and the action was eye-catching too but the acting, that flow of Sherlock Holmes was just wasn't there and I think that's what this movie missed!!Overall a brilliant family movie with a lot of action and laughs with a brilliant conclusion!!

A Shadow of What It Should Have Been,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes and approached this sequel with optimistic anticipation- only to be very disappointed. A budget that had doubled, multiple locations, and the confidence of a well received first instalment should have proved a solid platform for further success. Sadly, Director Guy Ritchie lost his way.As a pairing, Holmes, played by Robert Downey Jnr ,and Watson, by Jude Law, worked first time around. This time , Jude Law saves the pairing from disaster. I can run with Holmes as a cocaine snorting eccentric, but his eccentricities are so overwrought in this outing that his credibility as a formidable intelligence becomes unconvincing. Although I am happy to see historic capabilities rewritten and reinterpreted, his ability and acumen at street-fighting place an emphasis on the visceral, rather than cerebral which takes the character, for my tastes, far too close to Jean Claude Van Damme and Vin Diesel territory. Those thoughtful deductive powers eschewed in favour of occasional machine-gun analysis.Rachel McAdams role is reduced to a bit part, and is a peripheral figure. Noomi Rapace instead supplies the glamour in a tentative performance as Gypsy Madam Heron which doesn't convince. The Villain, Prof Moriarty, is played , uneasily, by Jared Harris whose visual likeness to Richard Stilgoe does not help the cause. Yet all is not lost. Stephen fry is excellent as Sherlock's brother, Geraldine James has pitifully little screen time as housekeeper Mrs Hudson yet delights whenever she appears, and Kelly Reilly does well in an underwritten role as Dr Watson's new wife.The plot is a noisy mess, and is largely threadbare. Swooping camera shots, fast editing and slow motion have their place but quickly the action becomes all, and the law of diminishing returns quickly comes into play. Which is a shame, because when Ritchie gets it right, it can be very good. This time an escape from an arms and munitions works shines as an ever escalating armoury of weapons is employed against them. Indeed it is such a good scene that the final reel, an attempted assassination, becomes an anti-climax.In summary, the familiar Director's curse of too much money, too weak a script/story, and indiscipline, with no-one around to say ""Guy, No!,"" strikes, which is a shame. Ritchie can write good, funny dialogue (see ""Lock Stock, etc"")but it is not much in evidence here, he can also handle a good action scene (the dry dock fight in the first film). But here he tries to reinvent the Holmes legend again, but only succeeds in losing the good bits and failing to improve with what he attempts in its place.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fiendish name accompanied by a wonderfully devilish performance by Jared Harris. That's no problem. What is the problem is that his duel with Holmes seems geared more towards action scenes than a well paced mystery. Holmes fights in slow mo, dodges cannon shells in a forest, is skewered by a large industrial fish hook, and survives a flurry of machine gun fire in a train.

Back to Conan Doyle's time....,"When Guy Ritchie introduced us to his version of the greatest detective, his slick, stylized action, Victorian theme and intelligent story were distinctive impressions he left along with Robert Downey Jr.'s entertaining depiction of the protagonist. As much as everyone enjoyed the convoluted plot, the transformational landscape of London, the chemistry between actors and their case solving skills, it was frightening to imagine the prospect of a chance encounter between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty that the film left us hanging on to. Guy Ritchie did set great expectations riding on a duel between Holmes and the Professor. However, this 'Game of Shadows' turns out to be a stellar sequel that has successfully engrained the greatness of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works. What makes it even better is of course, Robert Downey Jr.Dr. Watson moves on with real life as his wedding draws closer while Holmes delves deeper into his investigation linking international terrorism acts with Prof. Moriarty. Holmes is still experimenting with chemicals, drugs, botany and camouflage costumes to aid his skills but with such a nemesis, he will require much more than just that. At Watson's stag party, Holmes encounters the fortune telling gypsy Sim (Noomi Rapace) whose brother wrote a note. Holmes' acute observation reveals the lurking danger of an assassin whose acrobatic skills provide a thrilling action sequence at the venue. The following day, after Watson's wedding, Holmes is invited for a tete-a-tete with the Professor where they initiate the game to overcome each other. The first phase would thus involve saving Watson's life aboard his honeymoon train where a cross-dressed Holmes wreaks havoc. Thereafter, it is in Paris that they find Sim, who offers clues to a band of revolutionaries that turned extreme. They are assisting Moriarty's sinister plans of igniting war among European nations. In a subsequent investigation at an arms factory, Holmes is captured by Moriarty, who reveals his plans till Watson gets the better of his gun-man after blasting a light-house. After the most visually dazzling escape and recovery, Holmes deduces that the upcoming peace summit would be Moriarty's ultimate opportunity to spark war. Over the Reichenbach Falls at the Peace summit, the ultimate showdown involved the unravelling of the undercover assassin in the ballroom whereas outside, Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty sat down for an ultimate game of chess in the shadows of mystery.The highlight of this film is undoubtedly the cloak and dagger rivalry between the two masterminds who play their bishops and knights throughout the movie on a game board that is Europe. Make no mistake that Professor Moriarty is the most formidable criminal mind and the grandfather of most villains. But when Sherlock Holmes unravels each mystery with his deductions based on acute observation of things around him, he tends to make you feel smarter till the very moment when he explains it. Thus introducing the dawn moment upon you. Aided by his able accomplice who helps navigate his own darkness and idiosyncrasy, Holmes builds a much stronger bond with Watson as they wage higher stakes in this game. Their trust and dependence on each other creates more than just chemistry between the characters. Their 'partnership' is tantamount to their individual talents. One, a mastermind at unravelling mysteries and another who can balance the madness of Sherlock Holmes.Jude Law feels no aura of great characters around him. He stands comfortably in familiar shoes, doing his best to support or counter the eccentricities of Holmes. However, he has managed to depict the rougher edges of Dr. Watson who can now dodge bullets, fire mortars and deduce observations as well.There couldn't have been a better match for Professor Moriarty than Jared Harris (Mad Men). Not only does he have the suave, grace, aura and sophistication of the great criminal mastermind but he can also portray the coldness of a sinister villain. Just as Conan Doyle had described in his books, Moriarty carries with himself, an authority that is based on intellect, power and wealth but always walks across as a shadow.Robert Downey Jr. is a fabulous Sherlock Holmes. Not only did he improvise on his first act, he has now made himself a mandatory attachment to the franchise. Conan Doyle's Sherlock was always the composed mastermind detective but RDJ makes Sherlock a whole lot of fun while maintaining the essence of the character. As the other Holmes, Stephen Fry provides more comic relief in the battle of masterminds.Hans Zimmer yet again delivers an exemplary soundtrack while the cinematography by Philippe Rousselot captures the detailed art direction of 19th century Europe, the slow motion action sequences: especially the escape from the arms factory.Guy Ritchie had some great writing to enable his nimble directorial abilities. Partly inspired by Conan Doyle's 'The Last Chapter', 'Game of Shadows' is still an invention in intelligent story-telling. As Ritchie departs from the original Sherlock Holmes we grew up watching, he manages to revive Conan Doyle's remarkable story-telling with a focus on powerful characterization. Then, by picking up the best of today's technology and setting it in the 19th century, he also succeeds in creating magical sequences. His take on Reichenbach falls is stupendous even though we know what is coming. The intriguing plot has a lot of witty humor that at times will be hard for Americans to follow but will be adored by those on the other side. Robert Downey Jr. adds spontaneity to it all and draws applause from the audience which is still bemused by an actor who can play both Ironman and Sherlock Holmes equally well.Sometimes, sequels stand on their own without the need to draw comparisons. Such is the case with 'A Game of Shadows'. With its action, intriguing plot and witty dialogues, this one is a complete entertainer and that, is an elementary deduction my dear Watson.8.89 on a scale of 1-10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Tedious, my dear Watson","The world's favorite detective has gotten a makeover. Gone is Arthur Conan Doyle's intelligent, resourceful, eccentric creation, and in his place, we have gotten a swashbuckling, wisecracking, (still) eccentric action hero in the vein of Jack Sparrow. This is Sherlock Holmes for a 21st century audience, complete with all the explosions, gunfights and hand-to-hand combat you've always wanted from the 19th century British investigator but have never before gotten. At least that seems to be the train of thought taken by Guy Ritchie, who first introduced audiences to this updated Sherlock in 2009 in a film that was fairly successful, particularly considering it went head-to-head with James Cameron's Avatar juggernaut. Certainly, Ritchie's take is a breath of fresh air after so many decades of deerskin caps and frock coats, and in fact, many consider it to be more faithful in spirit to Doyle's original intentions, yet there is something missing from this sequel , which follows Sherlock and the ever-faithful Dr. John Watson as they tackles one of their most famed nemeses, Dr. Moriarty, played with devilish charm by Jared Harris. Hijinks, naturally, ensue.Ritchie sets their adventures, which takes them from London to Paris, Germany and, ultimately, Switzerland, against a perpetually but appropriately grimy, dour backdrop that reeks of the industrialism of the mid-to-late 1800s. Though this tale takes place in an entirely different era from his usual works, it is still distinctly a Guy Ritchie movie, bloated with his regular stylizations and love of slow-motion. These flourishes sometimes work, as in segments that show Sherlock utilizing his almost superhuman powers of observation; other times, like in a massive action set piece in a forest, it feels like something lifted out of a Zack Snyder movie, which is not a compliment. Still, most of the action scenes strive for some level of originality, boosted significantly by a gleefully ominous and dissonant score from Hans Zimmer. However, beneath all the visual bravura, the movie feels oddly soulless, treating its characters like pieces in a game of chess. Despite a clever ending that features a couple of nice throwbacks to earlier moments in the film, the plot is cluttered, and it often seems as though the writers were making things up as they went along.The cast features several impressive names, but with the exception of Jared Harris, who, interestingly enough, is the least well-known of all the major performers, none of them are particularly engaging. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as Sherlock and Watson, respectively. They have a pleasant, natural chemistry with each other, but the script never really allows their dynamic to progress beyond the exasperated but reluctantly loyal sidekick babysitting a mad, erratic genius. Downey Jr. has plenty of charisma, as he displayed so gloriously in his ""comeback"" role as Tony Stark in Iron Man three years ago, but one wonders when he might explore roles that stretch his range and acting chops more, as Stark and Sherlock both feel like two sides of the same sarcastic narcissist coin. However, most disappointing is Noomi Rapace, who is wasted in the role of Madam Simza Heron, a gypsy who is supposed to help the main duo in their quest to foil Moriarty's dastardly plan and who possesses all the personality and depth of a plot device. Deservedly rocketing to fame after her excellent performance as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy, she is much too talented to spend an entire movie (her first Hollywood blockbuster, no less) essentially standing around and taking orders while everyone else gets to actually partake in the action.One of the main attractions of Sherlock Holmes has always been his relationship with Watson, which is often depicted with some degree of a homoerotic subtext, and Guy Ritchie's version is no different. In fact, the movie seems to care so much about this relationship, to the detriment of all others, including the one between Watson and his wife, that at some point during the film, I began to abstractly wonder what it might be like if the film-makers just defied convention, took a risk and let them go beyond bromance and into romance, even a closeted one, given the time period. Roll your eyes and scoff if you will, but I would've accepted anything that might have livened up this humdrum affair.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's So Overt it's Covert,"First, let me start by saying that I am a huge Sherlock Holmes fan. I have read all of the stories and novels, and seen many different TV shows and movies about the infamous character. I am here to tell you that even though this movie (along with the first movie) does not follow the traditional idea of Sherlock Holmes, you can be a Holmes fan and still love this movie!With Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, you will surely be entertained. Honestly, there was not a dull moment throughout the film, and though some may complain that the movie was too silly, I would care to disagree. It was a very well executed movie, and I think the constant jokes and humorous action between the individuals, gives us more insight and helps to make us feel more connected to the movie and the characters in general. In my opinion, it was better than the first.People are expecting the exact plot from what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle first wrote. Please let me tell you: those movies and TV shows have already been created. I applaud Guy Ritchie for giving us a twist on the stories. Yes, Holmes and Watson are definitely a bit crazier than the what we read, but that is what makes the movie exciting and different from the many other Sherlock Holmes movies. The point is, that Guy Ritchie's movies were not meant to be the exact same plots as what we have seen before. If he didn't put his own twists into the stories, we would be watching the same movies over and over again. He has given us a fresh look into Sherlock Holmes that we have read about, which I think keeps the stories and ideas of Holmes alive.Along with his excellent fresh ideas and overall movie making, Robert Downey Jr., and Jude Law give great performances once again. They have the BEST chemistry I have seen between a Holmes and Watson character, which is one reason why this movie is so great.Also, I think that the villain, Prof. Moriarty, provides for a fantastic extra thrill. Holmes finally comes up against someone who is the perfect match for his intellect. The movie is 2 hours and 9 minutes, but honestly it does not seem that long because it is so fast movie and thrilling! I highly recommend going to see the film, it is worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Entertaining Movie, Could Not Stop Smiling..","What a great movie, kept me entertained. It was a smart, clever, action-packed, suspenseful film with unpredictable twists. Typical of critics to give it low reviews, my advice to them, go back to your boring, crying, dramatic, senseless movies i.e. Young Adult and leave these movies to us.As a Film major it surprises me how many good films are badly reviewed. Just because the story doesn't have someone crying intensely or it's not really realistic they give it a bad review. If I remember correctly, movies are made to ""entertain"" people, not bore them to death. Last week, we went to see Young Adult and I swear it was probably the grayest most mind numbing movie I've seen this year.What critics should start listening to is the audiences. Because without us, they would be out of a job. Funny how most critically acclaimed movies do so bad in the box office and the low reviewed ones do so well. Might want to start paying attention to those numbers.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Before Watching: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011),"""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" (2011) is the second Sherlock Holmes-movie, and quite extravagant. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows takes up its plot from where the prequel left off but is also somewhat independent. The major benefit from watching the previous instalment is the character relationships, not so much the underlying plot, which is explained thoroughly within the movie. Depending on the taste of the viewer, this added depth could be both trivial and the whole difference, but it would be subjectively recommended.In terms of contest, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows takes a slightly different approach than what the first movie established. Here, the mystery is slightly changed into a cat and mouse thriller, even though the characteristic clue hunting remains. The stakes are higher and feel more real, and the action is elevated to a substantially new level. The antagonist is well written and more menacing, the scenery is dynamic, and the relationship between Holmes and Watson continues to blossom for added highs and lows. There is also a noticeable growth in the character developments, especially in Holmes, which is very refreshing and touching.That is not to say this movie is without flaws. Depending on one's taste and interest, the beginning can feel quite slow with a stag party, wedding, and conversations around those events. Now, things surely happen, but it is still delaying the beginning of the real conflict. There is also a certain escape scene which is very stylized and can certainly be perceived as over the top.All in all, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is thrilling, exciting, and very well done. It is a great sequel which flows straight of its predecessor, and ends in a climactic yet poignant crescendo.My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10.

"Oh, how we've missed you Holmes.","Sherlock Holmes is back; this time he is pit into a game of shadows against Professor Moriarty, admirably underplayed by Jared Harris. En route to locating Moriarty, Holmes and Watson are launched into a number of dangerous missions, from fighting Moriarty's men on a train to tracking the factory in Germany from which Moriarty had bought a large number of shares. All of the missions come complete with thrilling set pieces done the Guy Ritchie way – camera-work putting his effective overcranking and high speed photography on display with the bonus comic moments (the outfits Holmes has on, especially the one in the train fight sequence) as well as humorous dialogue. In a way, the comparison between this and the first film is similar to a comparison between Ritchie's earlier films Lock Stock and Snatch – because it worked the first time, Ritchie follows the same formula but the second time he attempts to give more of the humour and the action to the audience. That perfectly works in Sherlock Holmes 2, this is seriously good entertainment. I have read a lot of comments over the web where people are complaining that Ritchie's hasn't made something faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic work. Yes. A more faithful adaptation for Doyle fans is the BBC series Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch. That should be seen for the die-hard fans of the great English detective, but for anyone looking for entertainment, which is the real purpose of this film, Sherlock Holmes 2 is one to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertaining, but lacking substance","I actually liked this one better than the first one, but the word that I think describes this movie best is ""flashy"". It was very entertaining, but I feel like he could have used any name for the characters, because it just doesn't feel like Sherlock Holmes to me. I'm not worrying about tiny details or anything like that, because adaptations should have their freedoms, but while Guy Ritchie's Holmes and Watson share some common traits with ACD's, they just don't feel anything like the original characters. Holmes is some happy-go-lucky ""detective"" who likes to get into brawls and to dress up in strange costumes and obviously has a thing for his friend Watson. His original brilliance looks more like cheap tricks (and they fail a few times, I'm thinking of two of his imagined fights here). Watson just doesn't have enough of the sidekick feel to me, he just does too well with using Holmes' methods. I have to say I absolutely love the soundtrack of both movies, and my favorite part was the ending credits, I greatly admire them. To sum things up, this was a very entertaining movie, though a bit too fond of slow motion and with a blatant disregard for the characters and history (just look at the amount of goofs).",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I always like the bastard child in a film series;,"A Game of Shadows is the more OCD, less consistent, more creative, brisker and also somehow more protracted, more exciting and bolder entry. It's more flawed but more rewatchable, it's more confusing but it's far less boring.
It does bizzare things, like killing McAdams' character so early, and in such a way that is intentionally obfuscated, and it's a deeply messy movie with Ritchie's signature excess, to pave over the cracks in his ability.
But RDJ is clearly loving his role and Jared Harris' Moriarty is a fun, if inept, part. The chess match ending sequence(s) rivals anything the British TV show thinks is clever, with a nice nod to the books, and the action has a charged wit and an energy.
These films are well tooled machines and I have to say I'd be excited for the cheeky retro-modern escapades in a third entry.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"All hail;Sherlock Holmes,the comic book sleuth!!","""Elementary my dear Ritchie"",as Sherlock Holmes would say!!!The best thing about the 2nd installment of the Sherlock Holmes flicks from the Guy Ritchie stable is that director sticks and remains true to Holmes as we know him from the novels(read the awe inspiring deduction prowess of Holmes); besides invigorating the film with awe inspiring CGI effects and power packed action sequences to take to it dizzying heights of awesomeness.Set in the mystical environs of the Victorian era(I'm a bit partial towards flicks set in that era)the characters,their actions as concocted by Ritchie are far cry from the ones originally depicted in Sir Arthur's novels.Our new age Holmes & Watson,punch,they kick,dodge bullets in uber cool,jaw dropping slo-mo action scenes,but its hard not to fall in love with this adrenaline joyride of a movie.What else can you expect wen Ironman himself is playing the protagonist.Surely Conan Doyle will be jumping out from his seat in heaven,cant say the same about the Sherly purists though.In the most intriguing of scenes, Holmes and Moriarty lock horns over a game of chess ;we also have Watson dancing with gypsies, his wife thrown off a train, Holmes in various disguises (as a chair,as a woman,lol) and yes we have a naked Stephen Fry hitting on Watson's wife.Very Richtiesque and stamp of the director of Snatch,RocknRolla written all over it.Only the director of Guy's caliber nd finesse cud have pulled this off.The dual b/w Holmes nd his arch enemy,Prof Moriarty and the mesmerizing chemistry between Law and Downey Jr. who hit off like a house on fire,are well and truly the high points of the movie.Just the right mix of a shrewd script,subtlety,mind boggling action sequences,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows goes one step above its celebrated predecessor and transcends into an exhilarating joyride that packs quite a punch and how..End your year on a high,Go for it!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' has its own color and interpretation which is different from the original works.The main actors did good job. Robert Downey Jr. so goes with Sherlock Holmes who is good at disguising and playing games, and Jude Law is perfect John Watson. Whom I like most is Colonel Sebastian Moran, acted by Paul Anderson.

Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law does it again .........,"Sherlock Homes 2 - A Game of shadows was a high octane, action thriller coupled by towering performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude law and mesmerizing background score by Hans Zimmer. The sequel starts off where it was left in the first part. Professor Moriarty swears to start a world war by initiating series of bombings in Europe and take advantage of the consequences. The only person standing in his way is Sherlock Holmes. Moriarty challenges Holmes and his partner Watson , who must watch closely each and every deadly step of Moriarty and prevent his misdeeds to wage a war. Guy Ritchie has taken a last chapter from Sherlock Holmes series to create a film where he would meet his arch rival , Professor James Moriarty. Hats off to him for making this film as entertaining as the first one. The screenplay is so tight that you would not feel bored even for some seconds. The art direction is just fabulous showcasing the picturesque location of Europe. The visual effects are so enthralling that was you would love to watch it again and again. The chase scene in the forest is outstanding and handled effectively. Cinematography is fantabulous. Hans Zimmer's background score provide the exact touch to this high- fi gripping drama. Coming to the performances, could you ever think of anyone apart from Robert Downey Jr who can play the character of Sherlock Holmes so effectively. The supremely talented actor is so convincing that he fits this role to T. He is humorous , quick-witted , efficient and acts naturally. Jude Law supports Downey Jr. efficiently . He plays the part of Dr.Watson with amazing charm. Rest of the star cast do justice to their part. Overall , An amazing , intellectual thriller that is sure to keep you on the edge.

What Happened to Technicolor?,"There are two mindsets. Modernization and Traditional. This series is without doubt, for mostly monetary and not literary concerns, determined to the former. That said it will depend on your tolerance for tweaking, or maybe a complete makeover would be more accurate, of the beloved characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.This is first and for the most part an action movie with Holmes keen mind and ""curse"" for observational retainment, rendered as hyper-kinetic dialog and visual flairs. Even the story is compressed for this modernization and is confusing.There is also that ""new"" look of steel blue, gray, and shine that one can only believe is somehow a subconscious feel for the cold and soulless 21st century. What happened to Technicolor? Isn't anything lush anymore? Is this what the Movie goers of today really want to see on a big screen and in 3D no less? There really is no excuse for this lifeless, anemic look.Anyway, here it is and it is here to stay and you the viewer are the lesser for it.

"Inferior, Insipid & Uninspiring On All Levels.","Despite making the right move of heading into the darker territory, the follow-up chapter to Sherlock Holmes fails to capitalise on the excellent platform provided by its predecessor and is a highly disappointing sequel that presents a downgrade in each storytelling element, tries too hard to be funny, and is also marred by its poor rendition of Holmes' arch-enemy.Following the events of the first film, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows continues the adventures of Detective Holmes & his companion, Dr. Watson, as they travel across Europe in a race to prevent their fiercest adversary, Professor Moriarty, from executing his sinister plot of starting a global war, only to find that their enemy is always one step ahead.Directed by Guy Ritchie, A Game of Shadows features more style & visual flair than its already impressive predecessor but fails to add anything of substance to its story or characters. Art direction is incredibly alluring, Camera-work adds a few more tricks up its sleeve but the use of slow-motion shots borders on excessive, Editing is terrible while Hans Zimmer's score is very much a rehash of the original.Coming to the performances, Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law reprise their respective roles of Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson and while their chemistry works, their performance was much better in the last picture. The new additions include Jared Harris, Noomi Rapace & Stephen Fry and all of them disappoint for Harris' Moriarty isn't intimidating at all, Rapace just wanders around while Fry is annoying at times.On an overall scale, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is inferior on all levels for this sequel completely fails to build on the solid foundation of its predecessor, is tedious to sit through, offers nothing captivating enough to keep the interest alive, and despite the modest expectations, fails to recreate the magic of the original. Putting more emphasis on action than its plot or characters, A Game of Shadows is an inferior, insipid & uninspiring movie that ends up making a mockery of two of Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creations.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"""People have an innate desire for conflict.""","This film is pretty much more of the same. Those who enjoyed the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" will likely enjoy this as well, with its wild visual flair, its explosive action scenes, and its amusing chemistry between the two leading characters (plus, some added chemistry with the villain). Those who didn't like all this probably won't like this sequel either.You can definitely expect action in this film; there are plenty of fight scenes, some wild gunfighting, and a lot of stylish slow-motion scenes. I think it's all pretty darn cool, but chances are that all this emphasis on style and action will be off-putting for many folks.As far as the story goes, it's a little disappointing to see that it's very linear, with none of the mystery or intrigue that went into the first film (and all the classic stories). It works as a straightforward actioner, but not so much as a mystery. In fact, it reminds me a lot of ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" Fortunately, the story continues to put the emphasis on the characters; Sherlock Holmes is as manic and ingenious as before, if not moreso, while Watson continues to serve as a quality foil character. What will really make this story worthwhile will be the revealing and exploration of Moriarty, whose intellect matches Sherlock's, and causes the two to become entangled in a form of intellectual mortal combat (which takes on a literal interpretation in the film). It's generally fun and satisfying, but still leaves a lot of room for further exploration (I'm assuming a third film will come along and form this into a cohesive trilogy).Cinematically, it has much the same style as the first film. It's very stylish with lots of interesting camera angles and trickery, and interesting editing. Acting is still very strong, with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law reprising their roles impeccably. Jared Harris plays Moriarty like a classic megalomaniac villain (which is good). I rather enjoyed watching Noomi Rapace in her role. Writing is about as strong as the first film. This production has an insane amount of quality sets, props, and costumes, with quality special effects. Music is still very folky (and it's good that way).Recommended only if you liked the first film.4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 3.5/5, film: 4.5/5)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But their performance didn't help a lot as the story of this movie got the audiences a little confusing even though I know it's quite brilliant to make some twist like that.. The other disappointment is Noomi Rapace's performance which is for me just like a sweetener because of the death of Irene Adler, but she's nowhere for replacing Irene Adler.. Overall, for me this sequel is a little disappointment but I must appreciate Guy Ritchie's work since he did his best in here so this rating is the best that I can give to this movie..",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A brilliant all-action Victorian adventure !,"Having enjoyed the first Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes adventure and having read all the Conan Doyle stories in the past, I was of course looking forward to the next Ritchie instalment with bated breath. And I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed.From the first scenes, the game was afoot. And with not a spare second to dip into your popcorn tub, you're taken on a roller-coaster ride through the darkest depths of Victorian London and pre WW1 Europe, where you get to marvel in some superb set pieces, eye catching special effects and deliciously quirky characterisations.On the downside, the plot is a little slight in substance, and the rather irritating fashion to cram in as many 'dark' scenes as possible (ie night shots, or rooms with no lights etc), can be a little annoying at times. I also thought Jude Laws Watson was a little bland and a let-down in comparison to Downey Jrs all out, take no prisoners characterisation of Holmes. These are only small gripes however, as the film overall is a thoroughly enjoyable romp that will earn a few repeat views in the fullness of time.In addition to the spectacular sets, special effects and performance by Downey Jnr as mentioned above, Stephen Fry was excellent and a good choice for Mycroft, and I thought Jared Harris' performance as Professor Moriaty had a nice underlying evilness about it. I also thought the Holmes' fun 'interior' chameleon disguises were great fun and very original.All in all then, an excellent period adventure film and well worth two hours of anyone's time.

Wonderful window-dressing of a void plot,"A very uneven movie. This is what I thought after having seen this movie. While the special effects, the costumes and the reproduction of late 19nth century social world are superb, the scenario is very weak in my opinion.On the enmity between Holmes and Professor Moriarty, the origins of which are never explained, a whole diplomatico-military intrigue is based, the satanic sinews of which are masterminded by the sinister genius of the Professor. The well attested fact that a rivalry existed between France and Germany in the end of the 19nth century is almost attributed to the machinations of Moriarty who tried to foment war between nations for his own purposes as if deeply ingrained national antagonisms were the work of a single criminal intelligence.Also the dialogues between Holmes and Moriarty which are supposed to be the pinnacles of sophistication and wit and concern a battle of wits as well as ponderous reflections on good and evil, war and peace- were in my opinion naive, obfuscating, adolescent and desperately trying to sound intelligent while they were not.The eccentricities of Holmes and the genius of Moriarty, verified by his Cambridge lectureship were the silliest effort I have met with, to pass a certain form of eccentric Britishness as a mark of special qualities.While I admired the costumes and the dynamism of the movie, I could not stop thinking how silly its whole premises were.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Quite an arbitrary reinvention of the character, but an enjoyable one: I appreciated that psychopathic facet of Holmes taken to paradox and the injection of fun and action. Yet it was still Sherlock Holmes, the genial detective, whose logic skills are beyond human. In the second movie one can find all the good ingredients of the first, but Sherlock Holmes: now that he has found his match and his nemesis, one would expect the main game to be played on the court of cleverness, one would want to assist a titanic chess game between the genius of investigation and the genius of crime, a sequence of formidable moves and counter-moves leading to plot twists one after the other.

Abomination of the Doyle,"Bad movies are inevitable. Some can be loved for camp quality, others endured or even forgiven due to accidental missteps. But this title cannot be forgiven as its sins are, apparently, intentional.The over-the-top optics and emphasis of action over narrative or character led me to ask whether I was watching Sherlock Holmes or Spider Man. Whatever happened to good old storytelling? Is this what iPhone and Google have wrought?In full disclosure: I'm a traditionalist. It's hard for me to imagine a more faithful version than Granada's Jeremy Brett. I can't believe the only way for ""modern"" audiences to know Conan Doyle's detective is a Victorian veneer and visual vomit. At least BBC's latest incarnation with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman preserves author's intent but is placed in a contemporary setting. It doesn't mock the originals.There are a few bright spots - thanks chiefly to Jude Law, Jared Harris, and Stephen Fry. The rest of the troupe could benefit from a Stanislavski house call.If you want to watch a superhero film, this site will give you plenty of excellent titles to choose from (i.e. ""The Dark Knight"").

Maybe not the way a Sherlock Holmes adventure was originally intended to play out but still a lot of fun!,"'SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS': Four Stars (Out of Five)Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as, the most famous detective from literature and movies, Sherlock Holmes (created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle). Jude Law returns as his partner Doctor Watson and Guy Ritchie once again directs (2 years after the immensely popular updated original). Rachel McAdams reprises her role as Sherlock's loves interest Irene Adler, in a cameo, and Jared Harris, Stephen Fry and Noomi Rapace (the original 'GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO') also join the cast this time around. The movie is complete chaos and extremely hard to follow but it's also got a lot of great thrills and energy. I can't imagine this new Sherlock Holmes being very faithful to the original (which I know little about) but these movies are definitely entertaining in their own right.This chapter is based on Conan Doyle's 'The Final Problem' but only loosely. It revolves around the marriage of John Watson to the love of his life Mary (Kelly Reilly). When Holmes learns that his archenemy Professor Moriarity (Harris) might try and harm Watson and his new wife, to get back at Holmes, Sherlock must of course involve the good doctor in his adventures once again. The two team with Madam Simza Heron (Rapace) who's on a mission to find and save her brother, Rene (Laurence Possa), who's involved in a international conspiracy to start a world war with Moriarity (in order to gain a profit from it). It's up to Holmes, Watson and Heron to save Europe and the rest of the world.There's so much going on in this movie and it's so fast paced that it's almost impossible to keep up with. This left me a little frustrated, to say the least, for a large percentage of the movie. Still Downey and Law are once again fantastic, as well as the rest of the cast, and Ritchie's directing is at it's stylized best. Even though I didn't completely know what was going on for most of the movie I still enjoyed it. It's definitely very funny and action packed.

A Game in Which the Viewer Wins,"Sherlock Holmes' cleverness and wit was tested like never before in ""Game of Shadows."" He was up against and equally brilliant man by the name of Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris). Guy Ritchie astonishes again directing this gem.Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) has been tirelessly working to link seemingly random catastrophes. He has linked them all to Moriarty, but he doesn't have enough evidence to make an arrest or a public accusation.Meanwhile, his sidekick Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) has been preparing to get married and hang up his investigative hat for good. Not so fast though, he has to be a part of this investigation whether he wants to or not.As with all Guy Ritchie directed films the plot is intelligent as well as intricate. As an added bonus the visual effects of this movie were excellent even by today's standards.

The game is afoot.,"'Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows (2011)' sort of feels like an unnecessary extension to its predecessor, a slightly less effective version of the same thing we saw back in 2009. However, it doesn't take too long to win you over; even though it is less successful than the first film, it's not a massive step down and remains a fun slice of popcorn entertainment. The action hero version of its eponymous character is no more or less difficult to reconcile with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic creation than it was last time, so it's easier to get on board with in some ways because you're more prepared for it. This time, the picture makes good on the teases of its predecessor by bringing Holmes' shadowy nemesis Moriarty to the forefront. While I don't think he's as intellectually intimidating or insidiously powerful as he perhaps ought to be, he makes for a decent counterpoint to Robert Downey Jr.'s hero and is portrayed with an effectively gentle menace by Jared Harris. Jude Law once again charms as Dr. Watson, and the banter-filled relationship between him and Sherlock is enjoyable if somewhat recycled. Where the feature really shines is in its set-pieces, which are typically really exciting and inventively executed. The absolute highlight is a gunfight/foot chase through a forest, which makes use of the series' signature slow-motion in order to emphasise the bark-shredding brutality of each and every bullet that whizzes by the heroes' heads. It's essentially like that scene in '300 (2006)' (and 'Night At The Museum: Battle Of The Smithsonian (2009)') where the camera zooms in when the action slows and zooms out when it returns to regular speed, but the sequence is no less effective simply because we've seen it before. The action is generally really entertaining, shot cleanly enough to be entirely legible while still retaining a somewhat visceral edge. It outshines the dramatic and investigative aspects of the plot, which are actually somewhat lacking even if they're more than serviceable (the detective elements ought to, in theory, be the most impressive part of a detective story). Still, the narrative is pacy and engaging, effectively propelling you from set-piece to set-piece. Ultimately, this is a fair bit of fun. It isn't quite as good as the first flick, but it isn't a massive step down. It's an entertaining popcorn picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Good, wholesome fun and entertaining from start to end...","""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is exactly as interesting and captivating as the 2009 ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie. And director Guy Ritchie really managed to pull the movie off quite nicely.The storyline was interesting, and had lots of twists and turns along the way, managing to keep the audience in suspense and on their toes. I enjoy a movie that is not predictable to the core, and ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" really managed to throw me off here and there, having me puzzled and trying to fit every piece together. And when the movie ended, there was a great sense of fulfillment as the movie came full circle.Just as the storyline was interesting, so were the characters in the movie. There is a great chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law on the screen, and they each individually bring so much to their respective characters. The villain in the movie played by Jared Harris was really well-casted for the particular role with his charms and talent. These three really carried the movie nicely, but it should be said that everyone in the movie were actually doing great jobs with their given roles.There is a very dynamic and vibrant feel to the movie, sweeping away the audience from start to end.The scenery was really amazing, just as it was in the previous movie, and that really added a lot to the movie as a whole.""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is great entertainment, filled with action, just the right amount of comedy and also some interesting mysteries and suspense as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How's that for a vacation?,"Guy Ritchie created something really neat with 2009's ""Sherlock Holmes"", and manages to equal it with ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"". The part about a series of mysterious assassinations plaguing Europe and possible leading to war sounds exactly like something that governments would do to distract their populaces from any problems. Robert Downey Jr. continues his depiction of the famous detective as having another side that the audience never knew about, with Jude Law's Watson often irritated at the antics. The movie sometimes goes a little overboard on the action, but the intrigue more than makes up for it. I especially liked Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander in the ""Millennium"" trilogy) as the enigmatic Roma woman.The movie probably isn't for everyone, but it pleased me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows Review,"Sherlock Holmes (Dir. Guy Ritchie, 2009) was one of the movies that I most enjoyed in 2009 and I had been eagerly awaiting its sequel. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (Dir. Guy Ritchie, 2011) was however not the sequel I had anticipated.A Hollywood film needs action scenes but Sherlock Holmes cleverly integrated narration and slow motion before a very fast paced fight scene so as to show Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) thinking before a fight, like Arthur Conan Doyle had written. However, the first action scene had no commentary. I was then filled with a sense of dread that there may be no narrated fight scenes at all; thankfully this was not the case. One of the best scenes in the film was the shared slow motion fight, between Holmes and Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris). This scene is narrated by both characters as they think out their fight before it actually happens, this scene is one of the only reasons people should see this film.Yet another annoyance I had with the film was when Holmes and Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) were on screen. Their relationship in the first film was enjoyable and quirky to watch as they would often back chat and argue with one another in a comical way. In this film however they ""comically argue"" too many times to count. It soon became tedious to watch with the knowledge that when they next met each other there would be another round of quick fire remarks between the pair of them.Unfortunately for Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows it is forced to contend with Sherlock (BBC,Writ. Mark Gatiss & Steven Moffat). The characters of Holmes and Watson, played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman in the TV series, are far superior to Downey Jr. and Law's creations. This could be part of the reason I didn't enjoy the film as much as I might have, as I now have Sherlock to compare Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows to.One of the biggest surprises I had when watching Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was the appearance of British icon and celebrity Stephen Fry as Holmes' brother, Mycroft. Although he doesn't resemble Downey Jr. in the slightest, Fry was still a pleasant surprise and provided a lot of comical relief and enjoyment in an otherwise dull first half.The film did pick up in the second half, however, as Holmes and Watson left England for France, Germany and Switzerland. Noomi Rapace's character also featured a lot more in this half of the film. Rapace, who is most known for her performance in Män som hatar kvinnor (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Dir. Niels Arden Oplev, 2009), was disappointingly mediocre in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Her screen presence was so weak; her character might as well have not even been in the film. It seemed that she was solely there to appease complaints from female critics over the lack of female ""heroes"" within the film.But even with the feeble character of, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace), the second half still propels the film forward with new locations and epic challenges for Holmes and Watson.If you enjoyed the first film then this one is worth a watch, if only to see Sherlock and Moriarty compete. If, however, you haven't seen either I recommend checking out the first film before Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In my opinion a masterpiece,"That Movie..man I'm lost for words. I'm currently 21 years olds I went for the premiere back in 2011 when I was like 12 years old. And I liked it back then I remember.
But since they've added it on Netflix I've decided to rewatch both parts.
And oh my god. I had no idea how good of a movie it is .
Ofc every movie has its flaws and and nothing is perfect.
But Robert Downey jr is playing his part excellent being super smart a bit crazy, sometimes cocky yet remaining British with British humor :D. The plot is good imo not many moments when the action slows down so you're always entertained. I wasn't bored for one second watching it.
Adding the music which has a nice rhythm and happy jingles of those times makes you really immersed into the action.
But the technical aspect of this movie BLEW MY MIND. The slow motion in this movie is the best I've seen in the industry. And I'm watching this movie in 2020!!
Not gonna spoil anything but the scene in the woods BLEW MY MIND. Like crazy.
I definitely recommend watching it, I hope that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

Predictable but entertaining,"As far as action movies go, this one is entertaining enough as long as you don't expect anything too original, but then I doubt anybody watching a Sherlock Holmes story in whatever incarnation, would.Downey Jr. and Law have enough chemistry while investigating a major mystery orchestrated by Moriarty. Personally, I find the Holmes/Moriarty angle tedious but probably the audience fed on superheroes movies can understand only a basic plot as such (good vs. evil - it doesn't get any more basic than this).Luckily McAdams is in the movie only five minutes and the leading lady role goes to Noomi Rapace. Unfortunately, all the action scenes are in slow motion, which shows lack of imagination and doesn't necessarily work with different types of fighting. The only great slow-mo scene takes place during the second half of the movie, while Sherlock and his gang are bombed about in a forest.Good popcorn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Superior to its predecessor.,"After the first entry earned mega bucks at the box office, it was a no brainer for Warner Bros to green light a sequel for Robert Downey Jr's pipe-smoking, wise-cracking sleuth and his dependable aide Dr Watson (Jude Law – spot-on once again). What is surprising is that Shadows doesn't suffer from the law of diminishing returns, in fact it is marginally superior to its predecessor. The supernatural tone has been replaced by an atmosphere more grounded in reality and the thriller elements have been traded out for a simpler 'saving-the-world' premise, although it's the upgrade in villain that really distinguishes the two. With the murder of an established character in the opening act, Holmes' arch-enemy Moriarty (played with fantastic intelligence and sinister intent by Jared Harris) makes an immediate and ruthless impression; something sorely absent in Mark Strong's Lord Blackwell. The flashily filmed slow-motion fisticuffs and gunfights – complete with explosions – are tremendously entertaining as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows,"My very first cinema encounter in 2012 is the sequel of a reverberating bromance action flick of Sherlock Holmes and his lover Dr. Watson, two years after the triumph of the unorthodox trio - Guy Ritchie, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law - of rebooting the household name into a bankable cash inflows, this time, at the same Christmas/New Year season, the threesome orgy revels in a more unrestrained burlesque, while all the detective-related mind-trickery is watered down in spite of Prof. Moriaty's existence (an underrated Jared Harris).The film has some self-consciously insipid moments during its 129 minutes running time, for the hefty action sequences, either those slow-motion or pre-mind fighting is overly abused, which functions eloquently in the first episode, nevertheless, the same question here, do we really need Holmes to be an action star like Bruce Lee? (anyway, it could not be worse than WITHOUT A CLUE 1988, a slapstick farce of a swapped identity.) In the face of that the old trick fails to avail for the second time, the ace is that a gay-implied two-player eclipses all the rest of the film (I cannot bring to my mind what's the scheme of Moriaty in a crystal clear detail), and the bickering between these two lovebirds is the thing in its own favor.Against all odds, it's a relief that Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma persists although barely enough to satisfy his loyal audience, and a dramatically emotional twist also propels the film to an overall mediocre level near the very end, Jude Law also has no need to curb his ""innocent- looking"" acting skills, which may be a stretch for him after turning 40. What is totally in dismay is the female characters, apart from Rachel McAdams' opening cameo, The original rising star from THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, Noomi Rapace's Hollywood debut is awkwardly plain, an insignificant and tawdry Gypsy girl, to be sidelined without any glamor, god bless her in the upcoming PROMETHEUS 2012.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Every genre has the potential to be 'done well'... and this film meets those expectations.Holmes: portrayed so many times... yet here we have another great interpretation (along with his relationship with Watson), perfect for putting a smile on your face.This time, perhaps a more realistic approach... no excessive concentration on deduction, we see Holmes with all his weaknesses, but overall, a man of adventure. Perfectly matched to the gorgeously overcast portrayal of Victorian London, yet sublimely mixed with explosive action more typically associated with a Bond movie.No obnoxious violence, sex, or swearing... no need for any of that.

Since when is Mr. Holmes a cartoon character?,"Sometimes one watches a movie and weeps because the story is so strong and compelling that it evokes a cathartic experience. And then there are movies that cause the eyelids to grow heavy and the mind to wander off to slumber land. This movie is in the latter category. Sherlock Holmes is not a cartoon character, yet this movie not only transforms Mr. Holmes into a cartoon character, he is a cross between Daffy Duck and James Bond. Not surprisingly, the movie provokes some unintended (or maybe intended) laughter, but with a ridiculous story that brings new meaning to the word contrived, there is little that can save this movie from DVD land where it belongs. Robert Downey and Jude Law give it a try, but their efforts are for naught. Sometimees the current is just too strong. The story is simply too implausible and the special effects too gratuitous. Okay, tastes change and maybe the producers are playing to a certain audience. But one thing that does not change is quality, and in this respect the movie could have been better.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Really too silly for its own good but fun and occasionally has good spark to it,"I quite enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes films, for all its limitations and irreverence it was pretty fun, so I was always going to return for the inevitable sequel. The good news is that the sequel sees everyone from the first film returning (albeit some of them only for a short time before being used as plot device), so I was hoping that the film would retain the strengths of the first, manage the slightly silly edge better and bring in Moriarty well. It doesn't quite manage to pull all of this off but it does have a decent enough stab at it, although it is unfortunate that the volume and the silliness appears to have been turned up from the first film.The silliness is the thing that bugged me the most here because there is a fine line between having a sense of comedic fun that enhances the story and action, and a sense of silly daftness that negatively affects the same. The first film got the balance pretty good and made for an entertaining romp, this sequel overdoes it a little bit and at times the comedy is too silly for too long to avoid doing damage to the sense of fun. The same happens with the slow-motion ""bullet time"" effects – they are very nice touch but when they are used excessively they become less effective and a little bit part of the problem. Fortunately the majority of the film gets the sense of fun just right. The action is noisy but exciting and the lack of any sense of real danger or consequence is balanced out by the enjoyment of it all.The addition of Moriarty is handled pretty well. OK in a blockbuster such as this there was never going to be a real clash of minds but there is a sense of intellectual game-playing between them that works. In particular I thought Harris was very well cast and got his performance just right throughout. The same can't quite be said for Downey. I enjoyed him again here but he overplays too often and gets dangerously close to spilling over into ""Captain Jack"" excess at times; not his fault totally perhaps but at times he is part of the ""silliness"" setting in. Law isn't as good as in the first film, mainly because the material doesn't focus on the comic interplay between the two characters as much – it still happens, but it happens within bigger events rather than being something of its own. The loss of this detracted from the film to a certain extent. In terms of supporting cast I thought McAdams got a rather rough deal – not only used as a plot device but a plot device that wasn't required! The addition of Rapace is good although she maybe takes it a bit too seriously at times. Good to see the series keeping a link to the character of Lestrade as well, even though he is in it for seconds and no more. Watson's wife I could have done without while Stephen Fry was a good gag done too often.Overall then A Game of Shadows is perhaps too silly for its own good but it mostly manages to replicate the sense of fun that the first film had. The additions are mostly good and I will return for the third film (there almost certainly will be I imagine) but I do hope that they can prevent this series becoming Pirates of the Caribbean and instead focus on the core strengths that it has and play to those.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Lacks the Spark that Made the First Film Great,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was a bit of a disappointment. While by no means a bad movie, it just didn't have the spark of the original.The point of Sherlock Holmes has always been the fact that he really doesn't care about much other than solving his latest mystery. That's why he has no friends aside from Watson, what few romantic relations he's had have always been a bit screwed up, and he's addicted to drugs. While the first movie didn't quite capture those elements to the degree that they could have been (see the TV series House if you want the best version of Sherlock Holmes ever put to screen) they were still present and the film understood Holme's character. This movie doesn't understand Holmes. It tries to play him off as a heroic figure, which was never the point. Holmes doesn't solve crime out of moral obligation or a sense of heroism, he does it for the thrill of solving a new mystery, it's a game for him and one of the few things he truly enjoys.The story this time around was solemn and heavy-handed and didn't allow itself to be fun like the first film was; the mystery was not very compelling and, in fact, hard to follow for most of the movie; but perhaps the biggest issue in the film was the wasted presence of one of literature's most well-known villains. Professor Moriarty, while played very well by Jared Harris, was a let down as a villain. Until the end of the movie, his conflict with Holmes didn't feel like two of the greatest minds of all time locked in a battle of wits. You weren't even really sure why this guy was supposed to be a villain outside of the fact that the movie told you he is.I noticed that this time around there was a different writing team for the film which makes sense because the flaws in the movie felt like they came from the screenplay. The cast was just as good as last time, the direction was fine, but the focus of the story just wasn't there. I would definitely give this film another watch and suspect I'll appreciate it more the second time, but I can't recommend seeing it in theaters. Pick it up at Redbox when it comes out on Blu-Ray. In the mean time, go see Mission: Impossible or The Muppets again.C+",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A new Sherlock Holmes,"This is not your old Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. This takes place in a parallel universe where Sherlock has become a master of martial arts and no-holds-barred street fighting. Any resemblance to the Sherlock we know from the books is purely coincidental.If you see the movie with that understanding, you'll see a great action movie, with Sherlock fighting innumerable Bad Guys. Doyle's Bad Guys also inhabit this parallel universe: Professor Moriarty is a higher math professor, as well as a maniacal ""take over the world"" type. More sinister is the parallel Sebastian Moran.The parallel Mycroft is excellently played by Stephen Fry. I kept asking, ""Why is Oscar Wilde in this movie?"", until I saw the credits.Jude Law makes an excellent Watson. The script has him as having served in Afghanistan (yes, there was a war going on over there then).Irene Adler makes a smallish appearance at the beginning, and Inspector Lestrade an even smaller appearance at the end.There is gratuitous nudity in the movie, but unfortunately, it's Mycroft.If you've read the Conan Doyle books, you know about Reichenbach Falls.

A Nutshell Review: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"The world's greatest detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle returns to the big screen once again after the successful boot up through director Guy Ritchie's vision back in 2009. Ritchie returns to the director's chair, along with main leads Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson respectively, going in to what would be the duo's toughest challenge yet with arch rival Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) whose intelligence rivals that of Holmes and is the equivalent of the greatest criminal mind out there, adopting loosely from Doyle's short The Final Problem, and following on from the seeds that were cunningly placed in the earlier film.We return to Victorian England which sets the stage for Holmes to continue where he last left off, tailing ex-lover and thief Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams in a bit role only, which I suspect is for continuity purposes) who unwittingly becomes a part of an assassination attempt. With Holmes spoiling Moriarty's plot, we soon get to see the villain himself in the flesh, given that he only existed in shadows in the earlier film, and learn of his dastardly plans to catalyze a European theatre of war at least from which he would make money from shrewd investments carefully positioned in commodities and supplies. Yes if you did not already know, war is actually profitable business.But it's not that clear from the start, and one of the quibbles I have from this installment is how we constantly get led by the nose from one episode to another, journeying with both Holmes and Watson, the latter having his wedding and honeymoon to Mary (Kelly Reilly) rudely interrupted, outside of 221B Baker Street, London and England in general, to go on a whirlwind European tour of a few countries as they chase the villain and his many henchmen to throw a spanner in their works. With mystery films there are clues and red herrings left behind in which the detective will break or revisit them in due course, but many times in this film the cheat mode got set, leaving room for plenty of convenience to happen and for the narrative to skew events to whichever direction it so desires.While Professor Moriarty may be the strongest villain in Holmes' Rogues Gallery, the character here proves to be anything but. He's ambitious in his plans and shows no mercy in its execution, but he's somehow lacking that inherent menace that villains possess. His demeanour played by Jared Harris may throw anyone off guard that this academician has a brilliant criminal mind, and holds his own in fisticuffs against Holmes since they share similar strengths in analytics. It's not that Harris didn't play the role to expectations but I felt he got hampered by the limited screen time and to have plenty of his actual dirty work committed by others, makes him a brainy villain instead, that didn't get translated too well for the big screen.So thank goodness that the Downey Jr and Law pairing still contain as much chemistry and fun as seen from the first film, and this camaraderie worked up advantages for the buddy relationship between Holmes and Watson that carried the film through as they go country hopping and crime busting. Again filled with plenty of innuendos and double entendre in their dialogues, the bromance here continues to be solidly strong, that a new ally in gypsy Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace) stood out like a sore thumb, unable to blend in with the duo naturally, and in some ways made her feel like an unwelcome female entrant into an all boys club.As with almost all Guy Ritchie films, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is technically strong, with the look and feel of the film, consistent from that of the first, being one of the winning elements in my books. Incredibly detailed and intricately crafted, the sets, costumes, CG and production values are all top notch in transporting us back to an era that once was. The multiple flashback scenes that showcase how we get to where we are at the point of the narrative, and those events that play out in Holmes' mind, were all done with precision as we cue in to his thought process, and one of the plus points is that of Moriarty's input at times when it got boiled down to an intense battle of minds. And not forgetting Hans Zimmer's powerful score that's a natural companion piece from the first film.I don't recall any other December period with that many blockbusters making their bow in Singapore, and this installment of Sherlock Holmes proves to be up there amongst the greats, but in some way lacked a certain X-factor to be truly memorable. Hinting at another film adventure, I hope the next one if it does get made, has what it takes to make the trilogy a definitive modern interpretation.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Blunder of a Sequel,"Sorry Holmes fans, but this one falls flat on its face. And breaks its nose. And then gets kicked in the gut.It's as if Guy Richie took courses from Michael Bay on how to make a typical American movie: Think about the cool special effects first and try to build a story around them after...though, really, the story is not that important.After an astonishingly good first instalment that featured top-notch acting, storytelling AND great special effects (and despite Rachel McAdams), Holmes returns for another caper with Jude Law's Watson in tow. This time, they are facing Professor Moriarty. What the movie is really about is hard to say, however, as the script was so weak, it kept getting lost in the line of fiery explosions, effects and Downey Jr. in drag.Were the special effects good? Sure...but we saw similar ones in the first one which were not really improved upon, and the fact that there was more story, less effects last time made them all the more impressive. This time around, you are beaten over the head with them and left wondering what they were trying to get across in the first place.Yes, Holmes has a misfire. With Downey's acting wasted on a second-rate script (if you could call it that), the two-year wait for this dismal sequel was a waste. We can only hope they learn from this, though a third instalment couldn't get much worse. Unless it's actually directed by Michael Bay.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This film will not disappoint you,"Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) is on the trail of a case that if left unsolved could lead to a world war. His arch enemy, Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) is in the process of striking fear into the general public and creating political tensions between France and Germany to hopefully start a world war. As he puts it in the film, mankind is prone to fighting and it is inevitable that the world will come to blows...he just wants to own the bullets and the bandages.A gypsy fortuneteller's brother has been recruited by Moriarty to assassinate a prominent government official in hopes that this assassination will be the final straw in a long drawn out plan to move France and Germany to war. Sherlock Holmes, enlisting the aid of his long time friend and colleague, Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) and the fortuneteller, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace), set out to foil Moriarty's plot and put an end to his reign of terror.I actually enjoyed this film more than the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" released in 2009. The balance of action and humor are excellent and the chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law is excellent. Jared Harris is very good in his part as the evil Moriarty. The film, although 129 minutes in length, moves along at a great pace. The use of slow motion during a scene when our heroes are fleeing a most dangerous situation is excellent.I recommend this film even if you didn't see the first one you should enjoy installment #2. I have a feeling there may be a 3rd iteration in the coming years.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This is the sequel to the best ""Sherlock Holmes"" film. Does it manage to rival the first one?","""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" (2011), a lot of you are already aware of this. But if you don't know, my all-time favorite Sherlock Holmes movie is ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009). So, as you can all imagine, I had high hopes for this sequel. There were some good things in ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"". But overall, I was just underwhelmed when I saw it. ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" has an overlong and cliched story and the acting was hit and miss. The plot is, a villain named Professor James Moriarty plans to instigate a war and it's up to Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson to try and stop him. When I first heard what the story was going to be about, I got excited. Professor Moriarty is, in my opinion, the best villain of Sherlock Holmes, and I was looking forward to seeing him on the screen. For the most part, the execution of the story does deliver and it did maintain some resemblance of interest out of me. However, there are a lot of slow scenes that drag the movie down and there are a few different cliched things throughout. Maybe that's because this film was written by different people than the first one? That being said, the action scenes and fight scenes are very well-done, just like in the first one. Plus, there are a few different parts that I truly enjoyed. The opening is strong and it intrigues you into watching within the first ten minutes. Like I've said, if a film doesn't spark your interest within the first ten minutes, it's not worth watching. But, I was hooked within the first five minutes. Then, after about 30 minutes, it starts to go downhill and drag out. Roughly, the first and last third of this movie are fantastic for the most part. The climax and ending are exceptional and it ends on such a strong cliffhanger! I won't say anything else about the plot at the risk of spoiling anything, but let me assure you, it has an ending that you will remember for the rest of your life. As for the acting, it's just hit and miss overall. The best performances come from Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Jared Harris, Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly. Sadly, the rest of the cast do an average to mediocre job with their characters. But, as usual, Robert Downey Jr. Nails it as Sherlock Holmes, he was born to play this role! Jude Law is outstanding as Doctor Watson and Jared Harris does a phenomenal job as the villainous Professor Moriarty. Some of the redeeming moments are when Holmes and Moriarty interact with each other. They nailed the main protagonists and antagonists! If the whole cast was that strong, then the film would be more on the right track. Now, I think it's time that we get into the positive elements here. The sets/locations are stunning and give the film a beautiful atmosphere. All of the special effects are first-rate, which is no surprise since this movie came out in 2011! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is exceptional. Hans Zimmer is one of my top ten all-time favorite film score composers and this one is no different. ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" had big shoes to fill after the stellar first movie. Unfortunately, I just wound up being a little underwhelmed and feeling kind of empty at the end of the day. I don't completely hate this movie, I just expected more out of it. I give this film a 3 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 6 out of 10 stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is a very marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10 and I consider it, by my standards, a bad movie. It's such a shame, because the first film was a masterpiece. But, that's reality in the world of movies, sometimes sequels can be a letdown. Still, I think they should make a third one. Hopefully that one would negate the flaws of this film? Who knows? As far as ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" goes, I'm just up in the air with how I feel about it. Maybe it'll get better in time? That being said, I am glad I saw this film, I just don't think I'll be looking at it again for quite a while.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Game of Shadows,"I was a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in the first Sherlock Holmes, and while I was excited to see him again as Sherlock on screen, I was afraid I would be let down by yet another sequel. However, that was not the case at all! Sherlock in a Game of Shadows by far blew away my expectations and surpassed the first movie in my eyes. Sherlock is wittier than ever, while at the same time more stealthy, serious, and plays an amazing protagonist to the Antagonist Professor James Moriarty. Whether it be an action packed scene, funny dialogue, or just plain enjoyment, I was thoroughly enjoyed and hooked in from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fun film,"In order to enjoy this film, you have to stop comparing Downey Jr.'s Holmes to any other interpretation of the character you may have encountered. If you take him as a stand-alone character, completely disregard any other interpretation of Sherlock Holmes - including that of the books - then you have a fun, action-packed movie that's guaranteed to entertain.I personally enjoyed ""A Game of Shadows"", more so than the first film, and even laughed out loud on occasion. If you walk into this film expecting to be blown away by a complex plot, then you are sure to be disappointed. Instead, accept it for what it is - a fun movie with enjoyable action sequences and Robert Downey Jr. doing what he does best...with a questionable British accent.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not bad,"The goal with any Sherlock Holmes story is to create an intriguing plot, full of supernatural brilliance, allows Holmes and Watson to banter and bicker, and not let any of it get too convoluted. These Ritchie films struggle with the last part. Still, there's enough Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-esque comedic action fun (with a heavy helping of audacity in the action direction) that not following every little detail isn't much of a bother. In the end, it's really all about Law and Downey anyway, and they kill it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A buddy cop movie from 1800s! What's wrong with Guy Ritchie?!!,"I watched Game of shadows with hope as I enjoyed his earlier outing of Sherlock Holmes even though I am a big fan of the books and TV series. The last movie was different and attempted to modernise the story to keep the interest of the game generation. This one is truly awful! Firstly Both Sherlock and Mycroft are reduced to being clowns at times in the hope of funny lines which just fall flat.The movie is just a buddy cop movie from 1800s and not even a great one at that!Watson played by the directors buddy curiously seems to have more to do than Shelly(yes,that's what his brother Mycroft calls him in the movie!)himself. Whats wrong with British Directors and their obsession with homosexuality! Here there are numerous double entendres and references to gay time with Holmes and Watson! A particularly ugly scene is one where Watson falls between Holmes's legs and they banter!Holmes doesn't wear masks but looks more like a Tranny with his ladies attire with lipstick all over his face.Sadly all these don't even raise a smile which I could have accepted if that was the reason behind everything.The idea that Holmes was a cerebral sleuth is long left behind with the director Guy Ritchie's obsession of slow-motion action scenes. The point is Guy Ritchie had one of the best characters, scripts,etc and didn't need to reduce it to just plain rubbish British crime caper.If the names weren't Sherlock Holmes and Watson, I could have accepted it as a pretty ordinary buddy action movie with some good scenes.This is pathetic!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Exceptional in Every Way. One of the Best Films of 2011.,"This is without a doubt a superior film to the original and simply one of the best movies of the year. I enjoyed everything and every moment. Robert Downey Jr. again proves why he's one of the cinema's masters. Moriarty is the perfect villain and watching how these legendary characters match wits is everything I had hoped. The shear adventure, fun and wit are masterfully tempered by a dramatic overtone. The action also held up well and some of those scenes are the most imaginative and most beautifully presented scenes of any film this year. There's a race through the woods, slo-motion sequence that's as visually stunning as any art house film ever made. Released during the time of year where often times pretentious films make an Oscar grab, this action/adventure movie vaults right to the top of my best of the year list.I loved this movie yet I'm a complete Sherlock Holmes novice. Never read the books nor have I even seen the old shows or movies. I know the legend and the basics but not much else. I saw the first film because I'm a RDJ fan. So, I bring no baggage to this franchise. As film, I was entertained by the first and highly engaged by the second. This movie is simply a well structured, fun and remarkably smart movie. Moriarty's motive is solid and ominous. Holmes takes his quirky genius presented in the first film to new levels. Watson was the stunner for me. He's every bit the partner and as big a factor as Holmes all the way through. Even his actions are smart and fit the plot perfectly. There's depth to all the roles. That's what I loved most.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Extraordinary game which anyone can easily understand and enjoy.,"This is my first movie review. I liked this movie very much. Its much better than MI4:Ghost protocol. Even the action sequences-specially near the arms-ammunition factory- are excellent. Kudos to the director.The plot and the story may be normal, but the game played and the twists take us into the movie. Its the best suspense-thriller movie i faced in recent times.Robert Downy Jr was excellent at his acting skills and the guy portraying Dr.Watson was also good but could have been better. Few action sequences were far from normality, but few are absolutely good. I don't know why people rate it low, but its good. I wanna watch it again (if possible). Its worth my money.I recommend it for the people who read Sherlock Holmes stories and like the character and like the character as much as I. The story seems to have been taken from the short story 'His last bow' of the Canon Doyle stories. I don't remember the exact short story. Its good and reached my expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Holmes Again and Again ...,"It opened on Christmas Day and the Sherlock Holmes sequel proves to be quite a gift to moviegoers. In ""A Game of Shadows,"" Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Holmes and Dr. Watson, carrying on a fine bromance complete with trivial spats, heated arguments, wrestling matches and unwavering loyalty. It's clear that these two would do anything for each other, including sacrificing their lives.While there is a mystery afoot in ""A Game of Shadows,"" the theme of the first Sherlock Holmes movie and its sequel are the same — they both deal with love and loss. Holmes feels great affection for Watson, but the good doctor is about to get married and Holmes is clearly jealous of the bride.While Watson prepares for his wedding, his best man, Holmes, prepares a wild stag night. Even though it doesn't go quite as awry as the bachelor party in ""The Hangover"" it certainly isn't focused on Watson. Holmes uses the evening's opportunities to gather more clues to his latest mystery, the diabolical scheme of his arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty.Seemingly not quite able to deal with his best friend's nuptials, Holmes derails the honeymoon — at one point donning a drag ensemble — and throws Watson's bride from a moving train. While his actions look extreme, the audience trusts that Holmes knows what he's doing. Also, Holmes truly loves his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) but he faces losing her to the evil clutches of Moriarty, too.One of the best features of these Sherlock Holmes movies is the use of super slow motion in the middle of hectic, fast-paced scenes. It's a fascinating juxtaposition of styles and it makes certain sequences absolutely mesmerizing, including one scene in which Holmes, Watson and the band of gypsies they've enlisted for help come under fire from Moriarty's well-armed henchmen. There's something really satisfying about watching a bullet travel in slow motion and pierce through the jacket of a sprinting Watson.A new addition to the cast is Stephen Fry as Holmes' brother, Mycroft. He is a hoot, especially since he prefers to walk around his manor house in the nude. Little surprises like that make this sequel much funnier than the original.While part of the appeal of these movies is to figure out the mystery, the thing I liked best about this sequel was watching the two delightful characters of Holmes and Watson, inhabited by immensely entertaining actors, have so much fun together on screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Good Movie to Watch,Sherlock Holmes: It was a movie with so many action - comic - thriller and hallucination points I saw both of the series which has been screened and I liked them both. both of them followed almost the same cinematographic techniques which was very interesting and grabbed my attention which was Sherlock Holmes hallucinations or better to say imaginations of analyzing the real actions in his mind (I mean all of the fight scenes) and I think the director used Phantom Camera to facilitate his goal in order to convey it perfectly to the audiences... One of the most interesting points which I think was the weak point of the story is related to usage of Adrenaline by Dr to woke up Sherlock Holmes in the train ; the story of Sherlock Holmes was first published in 1887 but the first invention or discovery of Adrenaline was in 1895 by a Polish physiologist Napoleon Cybulski but as I said before Hollywood movies conquer your heart and captures your mind with marvelous special effects and make you to hold your breath and distract you from the real world so it wont let you to you think about it and you as a viewer forget to just think about it. I think this series will be continue because Sherlock Holmes typed a question mark with a typewriter and it had dual meanings first to the Dr to show that no I am still alive second for the audiences to show that do you think that it is the End of the series ? it means it will be continue.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining and fun,"This film is about Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson trying to outsmart the horrifying plot of Professor Moriarty.""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is what a blockbuster should be.

And the castle on the cliff at the end is so beautiful and stunning what made me go wow.

Racy. Interesting. Intriguing,"As a Holmes fan, I couldn't have asked for a better take on the stories and the character of Holmes & Dr. Watson. Robert Downey Jr & Jude Law make their roles come alive with such élan that you just refuse to believe that anyone else could take on these roles. The only cast member who I felt was out of place was Jared Harris who acted as Professor James Moriarty. Somehow, I felt the role need someone more cold, calm yet menacing, and deep. Holmes' relationship with Watson is highlighted in this film. Their chemistry is hilariously funny as there are a few scenes involving Holmes dressed as a woman that brings the comedy to its peak with the lines ""lie with me Watson"". The action scenes were awesomely backed by beautiful cinematography. Some of the scenes help build a connection between the character and audience. For instance, when Holmes's sees everything as he says his curse; it engages the viewer on his personal thoughts. The train ride to Watson's honeymoon & the one with face-off between Moriarty & Holmes are my favourites. The movie ends with a hint of the next sequel. It has been some time since the game of shadows has released. I really am looking forward to the next Sherlock Holmes movie in this series.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worse than the first one,"The first hour or so of this movie is decent, but then it gets very nonsensical and chock full of extreme exposition dumps, and crazy bad conveniences to get the main characters out of trouble.

The second half of this movie feels like a fever dream of nonsense.Why on Earth was Rachel McAdams' character killed off off-screen?

"Fun, but not without flaws","I'm not going to give you a scene-by-scene critique, just a few observations about this fun but flawed movie. It's been said that the second Sherlock movie lacks the witty banter of the first and is too frenzied for its own good, and I have to agree. The banter isn't terribly memorable and what little you get is jammed into action scenes that border on incomprehensible if not preposterous. The pace is breakneck, but I suspect it was necessary to cover up plot holes and distract viewers into not paying too close attention. The first movie was fast too, but not as frenzied and really allowed you to lose yourself in all the steam punk majesty of the art direction and score, which is evidence here as well. I just wish Ritchie would allow the audience to check out the details that are wasted on fast-cut flicks like this one.In the first movie, we were treated to some really funny, smart homo-erotic bromance scenes, but in this movie you get a tarted up Holmes in drag encouraging Watson to get on top of him. Oh, how droll. What seemed subversive in the first movie, just seems like shtick in the second.Then, we have poor Noomi Rapace (the original Lizbeth Salandar) who is completely wasted in the role of a gypsy fortune teller who rarely gets any lines.Yet despite these shortcomings I still enjoyed the movie as popcorn entertainment, and I'm likely to watch it again if only to catch some of the stuff that flew by so fast the first time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertaining, although I still prefer the first film","Considering how much I enjoyed the first film and being someone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes movies and TV shows (The Granada series with Jeremy Brett series being the most notable), I was looking forward to seeing this film. Now having seen the film I can say I enjoyed it, this sequel has elements of action, humor, adventure, and camaraderie. Yet, it lacked a certain polish that I was expecting as sequels are supposed to be superior and more colorful than their predecessors. This film is not better than the first film but it isn't a waste of time either.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The classic duo of the world's greatest consulting detective and his trusted medical companion. This time they have to deal with a new nemesis Professor. James Moriarty also known as ""The Napoleon of Crime."" Along, the way they meet a gypsy Madame Simza, whose brother Moriarty has hold on.Downey Jr. and Law continue to have great chemistry. The way that they play off each other makes this almost a buddy picture. There plenty of action, changes in scenery as well as tongue in cheek humor. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty is a much more interesting villain than Mark Strong's Lord Blackwood from the first film. Also, Noomi Rapace is a much better leading lady than Rachel McAdams was as Irene Adler. Guy Ritchie continues to show off his directorial style, particularly with the somewhat lengthy slow motion sequence where our heroes are running through a German forest with bullets crashing and splintering through the trees. The music, photography, and production values are splendid. It was also fun to see Stephen Fry as Holmes equally brilliant and eccentric brother Mycroft.However, although there were improvements in some areas, I still feel the first film is better as it had more personality. Some purists have criticized Guy Ritchie's Holmes films for being more about action and comedy then about mystery and deduction. I prefer the first film mainly because it was more like a detective movie where there was a good balance of both deduction as well as action. Here, it is more of a breathless action-adventure yarn with a second half that drags a bit. Also, the supporting characters such as Mycroft or Mary Morstan could have had more development.Still, if you don't take the movie seriously (which I don't think your supposed to) it has plenty to enjoy. Even though it was a lesser film than the first I might still buy it when it comes out on DVD. This film was a big success at the box office as well as with the public, so there will probably be a third sequel and when that happens I will be looking forward to it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"It's elementary Watson: this movie sucked, was it Grand Theft Sherlock?","It is ironic that Sherlock Holmes uses deduction and logic and this movie throws that out the window in favor of a confusing mess of roller coaster images.""bullet-cam"" worked very well in Three Kings but only for a few instances and brilliantly. Ritchie has invented ""roller coaster cam"". Guy Ritchie seems to think a ""bullet-cam"" should be used constantly even for the slightest scenes. It is not clever but tiring and way, way, way overdone.The plot is weak at best and confused by constantly noisy effects and over loud music and soundtrack, and a somewhat muddled dialog track.Sherlock Holmes in the old, old movie with Basil Rathbone, engaged the audience with clever deduction, logic, verbal bantering and clever writing and editing.Ritchie decides to make Grand Theft Sherlock, to the horror of fans who love the subtlety of Doyle. Ritchie really needs to read Doyle before making another mess. Read the original stories folks, you will be richly rewarded.Within a few months you will have forgotten you saw this mess, and when the third ones comes out, you will have forgotten the messy early ones.Oh,the plot, something about world war and saving the world and war is human condition, yada, yada, yada...I think Ritchie's mom gave him a camera for Christmas and he said, ""Look ma, I can take one second shots of everything and people will think it is a movie"".",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This Sherlock Holmes movies is confusing and violent,"I have many Sherlock Holmes movies some with Basil Rathbone, Ronald Howard, Christopher Lee, Ben Snyder and more.
This is the worst Sherlock Holmes ""A Game of Shadows"" 2011 I have ever seen with Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes. It has some humor in it but it does not equal the amount of violence right from the beginning. Many scenes of fist fighting, buildings and rooms being bombed and injured and dead bodies under the debris.
Robert Downey is dirty and injured 95% of the time when he is not in disguise so enemies do not recognize him
Some of the cast I liked was Jude Law plays Dr Watson,
Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza Heron who is looking for her brother
After watching this for 2 hours and 7 minutes the only thing I found out was is that Professor Moriarty is still Holmes evil enemy.I don't know what this movie was about. Every body seemed to be an enemy to each other and modern guns were being produced.Downey Jr plays in more Holmes movies. I did not see them but after this one I probably won't see them.

MY REVIEW: The Game Getting Riskier and Funnier!!,"Sherlock Holmes, in his second outing played by the Robert Downey Jr. who like an old wine is getting better and better with time and his side kick played by charming Jude Law take on their fiercest adversary, Professor Moriarty played creepily by Jared Harris. Guy Ritchie in his second outing, gets under the skin of Sherlock and his sinister world better than the first time and gives you the show of wit and action that keeps you awed during the whole run time. Action scenes like one in the train and one in the jungle are done exceptionally well. The bromance between Sherlock and Dr. Watson holds the movie together overshadowing all female characters what so ever. The story holds many surprises and keeps you engaged till the end.

Lived up to the 1st,"We all knew this was coming with a setting up like the end of the last film. Sequels have been popping up more and more recently, they are a sure seller, but this one definitely lived it to it's first instalment.Guy Richie's signature blue tint is back in force but didn't manage to depress me, the comedy between Robert Downey Jnr. and Jude Law certainly lightens the mood. The angles used for the chase turn a now normal and possibly mundane scene into something new and raw, we move with the punches as the camera swings around. Things that are so often taken for granted in films such as establishing shots, are used perfectly so the only questions the audience is asking are the ones the story has set up.Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes is bloody marvellous, I'm not afraid to say that he is quite simply perfect and the final fight scene is epic.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Should have been the third movie,"Apparently, unlike most of you, my wife and I found ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" to be dreary and uninvolving. Rachel McAdams (""Irene Adler"") provides nothing more than a cameo; and Noomi Rapace (Madame Simza), who impressed so much in the ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy, is simply too remote and cool to provide much chemistry. The cliché gypsy fortune teller has flair; Rapace barely registers beyond her action sequences. Note to Naomi: Watch ""Golden Earings"" with Marlene Dietrich to see how it is done. Speaking of action sequences, there are WAY too many in ""...A Game of Shadows"". Action sequences require a tension build and there simply isn't any. Perhaps, worst, Jared Harris essays a bland Professor Moriarty. Then there is the story; little mystery, lots of noise and a climax that should really frustrate fans of ""Sherlock Holmes"". It is more appropriate to a third, fourth or even fifth movie.Memorable performances by Robert Downey, Jr., Jude Law and Stephen Fry (""Mycroft Holmes"") plus top-not production values are all that saves this movie from being a total ""dog.""

I adored the 2009 film, and thought that Ritchie and his stars (Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law) did a great service to the character- delivering a fresh take on it, at least in comparison to previous films, while still maintaining a classic mystery story. However, 40 minutes into this one, I was ready to fall asleep. The first act of the film has its moments, but felt extremely sloppy and thrown together. I actually hated it, and that's quite a feat, as I generally love films, and am very hard to not please.However, I am glad to say that once the film hits the halfway point, something happened- the pace picked up, the characters fell back into stride, and everything seemed to fit together much better. The pieces of the puzzle fell into place, and the film worked darned well. I fell in love with the characters again, and in particular, the finale was amazing. So, I am happy to report that despite a shaky beginning, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" ended up being a good, fun film. Not quite as good as the first, but still a lot of fun.The plot is a bit hard to follow (mainly due to the somewhat-sloppy first act), but the plot boils down to this- Sherlock (Downey Jr. is perfect... 'nuff said) finds himself in a battle of wills against Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris in a chilling performance), whom is hatching a scheme of some sort, which may lead to a worldwide war from which he would profit. It's pretty basic- Sherlock must stop the villain. It's simple, but it works, mostly. (Although a few subplots involving Moriarty's henchman, and other aspects of his plan seem slightly convoluted.)The acting all around is marvelous. Like I said, Downey Jr. is perfect- when is he not? Jude Law is a lot of fun as Watson. Jared Harris makes a great foe for Holmes, and comes off as someone you both despise and admire. Kelly Reilly as Mrs. Watson is fiery and fun. Noomi Rapace as the gypsy woman is interesting, though a little under-utilized. Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes was hilarious, though a bit over-the-top. I even liked Rachael McAdams in her cameo of Irene Adler. (I'm one of the few people who didn't hate her in the first film, although this just may be the fact that I have a massive crush on her.) The acting is all solid.The action was a step up. From a fun chase sequence involving an assassin at Watson's bachelor party, to a massive sequence where Holmes must outrun artillery fire from an army, it is all magnificent. Although I must complain slightly about the use of ""Holmes vision"" in this movie. I am referring to the ""slow-motion"" moments in the first film where we enter Sherlock's head, and hear him plan out his moves. It didn't seem to work as well in this movie. In fact, the first time it happens, I wasn't sure what was happening, as it was stylized a bit differently in this film. I wish they had stuck with the way it was in the first film.The film was shot beautifully, and the music was all suitably magnificent. From a technical standpoint, this is a very well-made film.So I am going to go back and address my initial complaint a bit more. That is, the sloppy first act. Something about this film just felt a little forced. It felt like the director and writers knew that there was a quota and formula for films like this, and just followed the basic outline. It didn't have much heart for the first 40 minutes. I could have sworn Ritchie was running down a checklist: ""Uh, I guess we need a small pre-credit fight sequence... check. A first act chase scene, I guess we can throw one in. Make the humor more blatant. Check."" It was too sloppy and formulaic.However, like I said, the film does reach a point where, all of the sudden, everything started to fall together. And once it picks up, I was able to forgive a lot of the mistakes of the film.I'm giving ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" a 7 out of 10. The first part of the film kinda sucked, but once it picked up, it became a treat, and fit right back in with the fun tone of the original. If you're a fan, go see it!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining - worth adding to your collection!,The review stays same as that of previous part i.e that of the movie released in 2009 with additional added changes into this one. The worth mentioning changes into this one are introduction and characterization of Sherlock's brother who is also eccentric in nature and comparatively a superior villain.Final Verdict: The movie is Entertaining.

horrible stupid teenager flick,"This movie is bad in everything I may Imagine,I can save cinematography and thos high speed camera shots. All the rest is crap. There is not story, the plot seems to be wrote by an high school teenager. The lines are basically senseless just to get one or two smiles. Everything has been already seen, no pathos, no mystery.Acting is terrible and there is nothing to be remembered, is it a sequence on sketches like benny hill meets Bud Spencer, a lot of teenager jokes and stupid fights, this is a movie well focused for young teenager that will smile for old jokes between the characters and macho statements every scene or two. This movie will be easily forgotten by everyone (just to test: ask someone who saw the movie what was the story about three days after he saw it, you will be amazed by his reply)what a waste.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Are you sure you want to play this game?,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a one of the rare sequels I enjoyed just as much as the original, if not, even more.Holmes(Robert Downey Jr) and Watson(Jude Law) re-unite to face their rival, Professor Moriarty who Holmes describes as ""The Napoleon of Crime"". The movie started strong, kept a good pace and had quite and intense ending.The performances are all solid from each cast member and this sequel is more humorous than the first movie which made it more enjoyable. The script was well written and Holmes, as usual, was quite witty and quick. I also enjoyed the visual effects and music in the movie. Hats off to Guy Ritchie and Hans Zimmer on a job well done. Just like the first movie, the mind games continue however in this movie, Holmes is challenged by the Professor, to avoid spoilers I will just say this:Professor Moriarty: Are you sure you want to play this game? Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid you'd lose.Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows is a clever, enjoyable and action packed movie, just as well done as its predecessor. This movie will not disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Outshines It's Predecessor,"Infinitely better than its predecessor, A Game Of Shadows is the perfect portrayal of this version of Sherlock Holmes. The plot is easy enough to follow, without giving away any of the twists, and that's mainly down to the dialogue being audible.Visually it's a whole lot more impressive than the first, but more than anything the soundtrack adds to the excitement in scenes. A brilliant portrayal of Moriarty, and really all of the cast fit well, and got rid of some of the less favourable characters. This one really allowed moments of wit and humour without it being forced, too.The first was fairly good, the second is excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Sherlock  Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is a much better film than the second half of its title would lead us to believe","Let's admit it. Whatever our feelings are about self-taught film director Guy Ritchie (""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""Swept Away""), he certainly has taken Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's world-famous character of Sherlock Holmes and transitioned him to the screen in a way that stands out, that is unlike what we expected. For the better or the worst (and that depends on your own perspective), he has presented the character in a way that is unique, almost self-described. In spite of my few reservations about his style, Mr. Ritchie made 2009's ""Sherlock Holmes"" into a devilishly entertaining re-envision and his new film, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is just as good. Even if it does need a better title.In this second installment, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) go up against their most famous and formidable enemy, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). As we learned at the end of the first film, Moriarty is at least equal to, if not more clever than Holmes himself and the quest to bring down Moriarty's wildly complicated scheme is more of a competition of wits jumping hurdles.Mr. Ritchie and his screenwriters (Michele Mulroney & Kieran Mulroney) are clearly more interested in individual moments than they are in the big picture. For just like in the first film ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is far more interesting and much more exciting when it concentrates on scenes rather than a whole entire. Professor Moriarty's plan, which I will not give away as a means of saving review space as opposed to giving away plot information, is so hyperbolic and overly complicated that to try and work it into a cohesive, ominous, and prone-to-logic storyline would be suicidal to the patience of the audience, and to the movie. Watching it, I found myself not really giving a hoot about following the clues or articulating the schemes of the characters, but locked upon the individual moments. It's watching Holmes and Dr. Waton decipher and devise their next move, often with bursts of kinetic action, that really ring the bell.It's like a big chess game, where you don't really care about the players' strategies as opposed to just waiting to see how many pieces each guy can knock off the board.Casting proves a benefit the second time around. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, two of our best actors, are just as splendid as they were in the first picture, and do a fabulous job with the witty banter they are supplied with by the screenplay. Although I wished there was more menace in the character for him to portray, as Professor Moriarty, Jared Norris is an inspired choice. Sadly, Rachel McAdams is hardly in the picture at all this time. Her replacement character is well-played by Noomi Rapace. Unfortunately, her performance is lot more interesting than her character.I do still have reservations about Guy Ritchie's directing. His toggling from slow-motion to kinetic speed, a gimmick I've seldom appreciated by any director, still irks me some, and at times he seems to forget that he's making a movie set in the 18th century. But when it comes to action, he's a near-virtuoso. There are more action sequences here than in the first, so this plays to his advantage.With great performances and packing a walloping amount of effective humor, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is a much better film than the second half of its title would lead us to believe. And as 2011 comes to a close, it's one of the better films to cap off a twelve-month span which frankly has not been all that good for the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Very entertained, but not a perfect second","Watching the precious Sherlock Holms is quite shock to me. I've been reading the stories since my childhood, and Robert really did well in performing the detective. It's so good to see the first, so I have been look forward to see ""A Game Of Shadow"".It end up with delight, but not satisfaction. The frame of the movie extended due to the genius professor. However, the storyline became so straight which decrease a taste of complication. Moreover, with more emphasis on the fighting scene, it turned out to be ""less exciting"" sometimes, because it filled with slow motion fighting, which loosen the rhythm of the movie.With all the disappointment mention above, I still felt entertained in the end. Everyone just did their jobs well, the conversation is fun, the music is even better than the first one. Despite some disadvantages within the movie, it's still worth watching.If you're book fan of Sherlock Holms, you would find out disappointed because the quiz in the movie is not so mystic. However, if you take it as an action movie, it's still doing well in many aspects.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fun time,"This movie was a lot of fun. Robert Downey Jr. Is one of the most watchable actors working today and he's going to be pretty good in anything you chuck him in. Guy Ritchie is one of the best director's working today, and while I always enjoy him working on films he's written more than anything else, he is still able to bring his sense of fun, style and charisma to the movie.I think the only thing that stopped me enjoying it quite as much as the first one was that the mystery wasn't as strong. It felt like there was less for Holmes to have to do detective-wise. I do think it was a more fun film overall though.I'm not sure if the third one will ever arrive (surely?) but based on the strength of the first two, it should. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""A Game of Shadows"" Not Exactly Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes! A Different Packaging of Sherlock Holmes.","It was 3rd January morning 10:15 AM; a 2$ ticket in my hand; seat number F 3; second block, fourth floor, BTM, Bangalore. More or less 32 people are sitting inside, 20 stuffs working outside the hall; two snacks shops; four security officers, including one woman officer; three ticket counters; two elevators and two escalators, one is coming up and one is going to down. This is the way of expression that I have learned from ""Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows"".The film shows Sherlock Holmes' superhuman intellectual brainstorming, meditation and precautions of every-single steps; before taken by his enemies. I think, Guy Ritchie's version of Holmes is full of errors. The climax is started in the beginning,Professor Moriarty: Are you sure you want to play this game?Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid you'd lose.Professor James Moriarty, the role is played by Jared Harris is an unforgettable villainy. Holmes's elder brother, Mycroft Holmes was expected more roles that was missing. The 'slow wits' and puns are the only entertainment, that at least make the audience laugh.Dr. Watson: Did you just kill my wife?Sherlock Holmes: I timed it perfectly!The movie is primarily based on the short story ""The Final Problem"" by Sir A.C. Doyle and also from many of the other Sherlock Holmes stories: ""The Sign of Four""; ""The Greek Interpretor""; ""Valley of Fear""; ""The Speckled Band""; ""The Dying Detective""; ""Bruce Partington Plans""; ""The Adventure of the Creeping Man"" and ""The Second Stain"" are included in one single motion picture. Isn't it sounds idiotic?Sherlock defeats Professor Moriarty by pulling him over Reichenbach Falls, with both of them falling to their apparent deaths. Holmes is later shown to have survived. This was meant to be the final Sherlock Holmes story, ""The Final Problem"" by Sir A.C. Doyle.Robert Downey Jr.'s 1992 biographical role on Chaplin is noticed in Holmes. It is not exactly that I read and imagine about the literary character of Sherlock Holmes. Calculations, actions and re-actions are overdosed. There are many abstract and unnecessary clips broke the central story, was totally unexpected. Cinematography is like an artistic boon of modern technologies. Here science, arts and literature are brilliantly juxtaposed.Sherlock Holmes riding a pony, ""Slow and steady wins the race"" is a good wit and moral.

"its not holmes, and its not good.","the film in and of itself is not too bad, aside from the ridiculous and at times downright vulgar cinematography - the acting is for the most part competent, and the dialogue is funny. it is undeniably a film many people will - and have - enjoyed my mistake was watching this after already being a fan of the television series starring jeremy brett. oh, and also being a fan of the books. as i say the film is not too bad, i am just annoyed to the point of offense that a whole generation, if not the entire world, will be mislead into perceiving this as the definitive sherlock holmes. its not. its a very very loose interpretation of sherlock holmes held together by a few misused quotes, as performed by captain jack sparrow (there's nothing wrong with that, i liked the first pirates of the Caribbean, and its not meant as some sort of a jibe - but after about 30 minutes it suddenly struck me - EVERY mannerism is copied point for point off of captain jack sparrow.) and there is nothing wrong with 'loose interpretations' either - i have liked many. but the dialogue and story writing are just TERRIBLE in comparison to the original works, and ignoring them in favour of THIS script is just wrong. i mean the plot is truly awful, and not just from a 'this is not how the book is' kind of way. its just plain bad. i guess the thing im most annoyed about is how despite being English himself, guy ritchie has managed to take every subtlety and all propriety that was brilliant about sherlock holmes and replace it with crude Hollywood clichés and americanisms.i just urge anyone who reads this, even if you still decide to watch the film, to at least download/rent the ""adventures of sherlock holmes"" starring jeremy brett afterwards, and see how much better it is. i really honestly don't mean to be a buzz kill, these films do have their place, but if you want a Hollywood blockbuster then go see the terminator or die hard or something. if you want to watch sherlock holmes, then this is not it. its like james bond starring tom cruise with an austin powers accent, im sure it could be done, and im sure it would get a (shocking) 7.8 star rating on IMDb, but for the love of god, it really shouldn't.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I can really see how this movie has a potential for another movie. At some points this movie can be kind of hard to understand but you can put the pieces together and understand the plot.

It was a great bromance in its most asexual sense--after all part of the story line was Dr. Watson getting married. Perhaps unintended but it showed a powerful relationship they had together as much as Dr. Watson had his frustrating moments not completely understanding the motives of his partner but ultimately trusting his incredible acumen in dire situations.I also enjoyed that there was more story line plot than just one action scene after another. Finally, Downey Jr. nailed down the English accent and even the expressions of an Englishman .Clearly, one of the top ten movies of 2011.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Maybe this looked good in Ritchies head but he forgot that it had to make sense for the audience. I mean he did make Lock, stock and two smoking barrels etc. so i expected more creativity.

Defines bad movie in the post-modern era,"A Game of Shadows: In an era when our most popular films are really little more than roller-coaster rides through comic book worlds, can anyone actually make a bad film, with standards so low. Well - you can make this film, I guess. ""A Game of Shadows"" is truly awful. I admit I even watched it twice, because the first time through I couldn't get any sense of what the story was all about. The second time around, a number of narrative threads did seems to run through the film, eventually tied together (rather arbitrarily) at the end. But I realized that the story (or stories) here merely form a kind of scarecrow on which director Ritchie could hang set-piece action sequences, camera tricks and CGI wizardry, while the actors mugged like children in a bad school play about someone or other they called ""Sherlock Holmes,"" for no other reason than they had heard the name while running around a TV set with an old movie playing on it.Childishly campy, visually ugly (that mind-numbing slo-mo - stop it!), badly written, and horribly over-acted; of course it made millions. That doesn't stop it from being a bad film.Note: There are currently four series of films attempting to revise the canon of Conan Doyle's brilliant Victorian detective for the 21st Century. One from the UK (Sherlock, for TV), one from the US (Elementary, for TV), one from Russia (Sherlock Homes, for TV), and the internationally produced films of Guy Ritchie, starring Robert Downey. Notably, each involves a radical re-envisioning of the character and his place in the world. We may have reached a point in history when filmmakers simply cannot give us the Great Detective as he was imagined by Doyle and played (with variations) throughout the 20th Century. Rating the 4 series: Sherlock Holmes (Russia): 9 of 10, with strong stories and a believably proletarian nerd Holmes. Sherlock (UK): 6 of 10; excellent first season has been betrayed by Steven Moffat's flashy showmanship until the stories are incoherent now (Season 3), the characters no longer likable, the focus almost completely lost. Elementary (US): 4 of 10; the redefined Holmes, a nervous, unsympathetic recovering drug addict, is not without interest, and any show with Lucy Liu in it gets the benefit of her quiet but charismatic presence and talent. But basically, this is just a routine American police procedural with a gimmick. I doubt that Hollywood can do anything else. Sherlock Holmes (Ritchie/Downey): 1 of 10. This series lacks any coherence in its stories or continuity. It's just a series of set-pieces with running around, fist fights, explosions, and campy jokes.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
my review of sherlock holmes 2 a game of shadows,"Sherlock Holmes 2 A Game of Shadows The sequel to Sherlock Holmes has more pizazz and atrocious slow motion camera shots then any film this year. The story is a coherent one but the action sequences slow it down. Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriaty, a genius mathematician who wrote the book The Astronomicals of an Asteroid are common enemies. Professor Moriaty distract Sherlock Holmes evidential and clueless mind while building ant-Christ missiles and bombs in a abandoned stockyard. While Holmes is busy with talking to a fortune teller/gyspy played by Noami Roapooce, Dr. Watson is getting married and enjoying his honeymoon with his beloved wife. But soon Sherlock Holmes invades Dr. Watson's life by meeting with him intensively on the train and throwing Watson's wife off a bridge to catch up with his brother Mycroft Holmes who is setting up a summit auction party in Switzerland. But for Watson's wife, he is embarrassed to be around Mycroft Holmes because he is in the nude. Robert Downey Jr.'s accent is great. Even Jude Law portraying Dr. John Watson is fun. I have no problem with the art direction. It is gorgeous in 1891. You have London, Paris, Switzerland, Berlin and Scotland. It sets the mood for a Sherlock Holmes story. The problem is the action sequences. For a young audience Sherlock Holmes goes from a detective having fun with clues and spy games in the first half of the movie to a elite stone cold action hero in the end. The slow-mo scenes are in every corner. It reminded me of the Matrix Reloaded or a PC computer game. The editing is way off in the sequel and the original score is the same from the first movie 2 years ago. No new piece of music. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows has it's flaws but it is still a quirky film with humorous and naughty moments to pleasurable movie entertainment. If you want a film that really is like the Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories go back and re watch the films from the mid-40's or early seventies PBS Mysteries that reinvented the Holmes character as he is in the book, a clueless detective looking for mystery. Robert Downey Jr. is the right choice for portraying Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law is reliable as the infamous Dr. John Watson.

Brilliant and Highly Enjoyable!,"Lets start backward and cut to the chase first, this movie is brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable. There are myriad different pieces which have all worked well on this but the biggest by far is the screenplay and direction. And to put some smarts at it, what makes it great is you neither have to remember the first, nor have to watch this as a sequel. You will also not find the need to compare it to others. In fact, you could watch this first and then watch the part that came before, and you would be equally thrilled with both. Lets start separating the gems and get into why this movie is a great watch.First the screenplay and direction, where Guy Ritchie has done what he does best. The characters are well carved out, there is a plot, there is a case, and there is a solid END. The writers Michele Mulroney, and Kieran Mulroney have packed this with originality and simplicity. It does not take a genius to follow the plot and is not like watching CSI or a murder mystery. This one is more like admiring a great book visually by enjoying the moments of humor, appreciating the twists, and applauding at the end. Bottom line, the story is wise and keeps you entertained. Guy Ritchie has done this enough number of times to establish a knack for it and he does not disappoint. Just a great story is not good enough, and if it was not for the cracking acting by the cast, nothing would live up the screen the way it does on this one.The chemistry between Jude Law and RDJ is flawless and is brilliant enough to make the real pair look fake. RDJ packs the punch, looks the part, times the moves and lines, and is the best portrayal of Sherlock so far in any movie or TV show. The characters all appear a natural part of the story and appear and disappear just as they would in a real setting. The sets and the setting, including the look and feel of all characters is true to its core and, even Stephen Fry is not bad with his cameo. The elevation in this definitely comes from Jared Harris. JH plays the professor and carries the character beautifully throughout the movie. He almost competes directly with RDJ both in character and screen presence and keeps the balance of having to wait till the end. Jude Law is charming as always, and complements the role in every aspect. Pick any movie within this genre and you will see how good all the characters jive on this one, because just seeing Sherlock would not have cut it.Then comes the cinematography, the visual effects, the action sequences, and the tiny details of critique that can be used to start ripping it apart. While each person liked, or hated the visual effects, each person is sure to agree on one thing, that this movie is intelligently made and acted, and the intent of telling a good story is clearly visible and felt. We all hate to see sequels just because the first one was a huge hit and the team just wanted to capitalize on it.Kudos with this one to the team and I cant wait to see another addition to this!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Above & Beyond the First.,"I had really low expectations on this one. Sequels are rarely as good as their predecessor, and I had read a few negative early reviews. Haha. I'm glad I went and saw it for myself. Honestly, I loved this movie.It's a pretty fast-paced film; a nonstop thrill ride filled with mystery and intrigue. Downey and Law are great together, as always. Their 'chemistry' is spot on, and they really feel like friends who have experienced much together. Noomi Rapace is a great addition to the cast as well, and Jared Harris plays an excellent villain in Moriarty.It's a really fun film as well; don't even get me started on the action sequences. They are thrilling and extremely well shot; the cinematography is beautiful. The forest sequence (if you see the film, you'll not what I mean) is one of the most awesome action bits I've seen in a long while.

Better Than the Last,"When my supervisor at Dish said that the next Sherlock Holmes movie was out on DVD I knew I had to watch it. I have been reading the books since I was a child and had always wondered how they would include Holmes' amazing intellectual insights without using a narrator. They did an amazing job of it. Sometimes these amazing leaps of mental agility would be stated plainly, or stated as if it were very plain to Holmes rather.

Do Not Waste Your Time,"My girlfriend and I just returned from seeing this extremely sad excuse for a movie. For the first time in a very long time I actually considered walking out of the theater. If It wasn't for the fact that I invested thirty dollars into it we would have left. I'm not sure what was worse: the plot line that was way to hard to follow, the unnecessary amount of explosions, or the fact that I had to endure seeing Robert Downey, Jr. dressed in drag. But put them all together and you have one of the worst movies ever made. Many times I had to keep myself from nodding off only to be awoken by an explosion of some sorts (I wasn't aware they had machine guns in 1891). How many times do I have to watch the same fight scene taken straight out of Snatch? I get it Guy Ritchie, you have access to a high speed camera. I'm not sure how dumb you think the general public is but how long are we going to have to see movies that have zero substance? By the end of the movie I was genuinely hoping that Sherlock would die so that I wouldn't have to even think that a third one of these movies could be made. Unfortunately, Mr. Ritchie, you and Hollywood win in the end because I just blindly handed my money over to you. I thank you in the long run because the next time I consider going to a movie I might think otherwise or just take my money and flush it down the toilet, at least then I'll know I kept a few dollars out of your pocket.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A whole new Holmes,"Guy Richie's interpretation of the much loved novel character Sherlock Holmes will be despised by any fans of the books or the original films. Luckily for me I'm not one of them. Yes It's much closer to Hollywood than Baker street and yes It's filled with slapstick humour, but none of this takes away from Robert Downy Juniors quite brilliant take on Sherlock Holmes or for that matter Jude Law's performance. Unfortunately we see a very male orientated performance with amazing unused female talent. Then again Stephen Fry's slightly arrogant, camp upper class performance deserves all the attention it receives. So why a 9 out of ten? Because as you watch it you forget all of the negatives. So what there are slightly too many slow-mo shots, an abundance of slapstick, less emphasis on Sherlocks intellect and more explosions than a bond film. You'll be way too engrossed in the pure brilliance of the film to worry. It's hilarious, witty and filled with more action than you could of ever hoped for. A must see. Just think less of the past and more of the future of Sherlock Holmes and you will love it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Slightly worse than the original... but good,"Even more full of action sequences that scream ""big Hollywood production"", this is not as good.
The actors are as efficient in their roles, even with the small changes the story has (Watson is about to get married and with that the duo adventures).
The plot takes us outside Great Britain at some point, and the movie takes a hit visually when we part ways with the Victorian period. Besides, more characters are presented (all ""meh"") and the scale of the story gets continental, which makes it a bit forced.But all of this is in service of the villain of this story, the Professor Moriarty, and here is the biggest difference with the original. In the other, the villains were ok. But here, the superb Jared Harris gives his character a malicious presence that matches only his genius level intelligence, making the perfect Sherlock adversary. And yes, the plot gets too big and forced, but also ultra epic, and still perfectly told by Ritchie. Again with an amazing conclusion, it makes every 'boring' second in the other acts count. Also, visually and in dialogue, gets to an incredible level (with insightful but cynic words about the inevitability of War, and the conclusion of the battle of the minds between the two geniuses).The especially bad of this movie was the sexist and criminal role for Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, and the pathetic cast of Stephen Fry as Sherlock's brother, failing miserably in his ""comic relief"" role.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sherlock Holmes???   Didn't seem like Sherlock to me.,"This Hollywood movie is a disgrace to the intelligent, wise, intuitive detective ""Sherlock Holmes"" character. Instead of being focused on his detective skills, it focuses on special effects and violence so much that his character and the shallow plot are minimized. Therefore, if you enjoy Hollywood movies with special effects and violence more than plot, then I recommend it. However, if that is what you want, then why see ""Sherlock Holmes""? There are hundreds of movies with that emphasis, and with even better special effects.

"Great decors, great music, great characters","I watched this movie together with my husband in cinema. I liked this Sherlock Holmes even better than the first one! There is a great atmosphere, created by beautiful decors and great music. Some people might not like the slow-motion action-scenes, but see them as a parody on movies like James Bond an you will cherish them like I did (think on the effect Inglorious Basterds had on you)! Although the title makes you expect a dark movie, this is a cheerful movie with a lot of humour, and not very much of a shadow. Some critics criticise the movie for it's thin plot line. I don't agree. There is really a lot happening! Maybe some things aren't very likely to happen in the real world, but in my opinion this is one of the charmes of Sherlock Holmes. The historical settings are by the way very plausible. Characters are quite multi- dimensional...Holmes is not only a genius, but he is also a little bit pschycho (in a good way) en turns out to be quite lonely sometimes. Here you see one of the strenghts from the first movie again. Although my husband and I mostly watch art-house-movies, we enjoyed watching this movie, because this film was so well-made and so very entertaining!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Law and Jr. ooze charisma,"Dr. Watson's Stag night, Wedding and Honeymoon go awry as he and Sherlock Holmes join forces with a gypsy to outwit and bring down adversary Professor Moriarty.Guy Ritchie explores the time period further and creates a detailed and richer world. Cobbled and dirt streets, sweeping landscapes and skylines all add to the atmosphere of old London and Paris. The effects and costumes are amazing, the sets fantastic - secret passageways, opera houses and trains. The music with the familiar theme of the first fittingly returns.Many of the pacing issues of the first film have been corrected, but arguably there is less subtle humour and more all out gags. That said, the essence of Sherlock remains intact. The story is less convoluted than it's predecessor and despite some stifled lines the two leads are Law and Jr. are on fine form oozing charisma. With their unmatched rapport they can do no wrong as they are so well cast and have so much chemistry between them.Although there is a little too much crash and bang in Ritchie's set pieces,there's enough wordplay courteous of writers Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney to keep it becoming just another action.Both Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes and Jared Harris as Professor James Moriarty are both perfectly cast giving fitting and wonderful performances. Familiar faces of the first outing make appearances and it feels like a true an equal sequel.Overall it's more of the same and Guy Ritchie delivers a great continuation of the adventures of Holmes and Watson.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Downey Charms Inside Surprisingly Simple Plot,"I couldn't wait for the weekend to begin because I knew I was going to hit up a popcorn, blockbuster double-header in the theater, Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, a back- to-back pairing almost unmatched this year. Two incredibly big budget franchises with two incredibly charismatic leading men. These are the box office battles I just live for. Since the weekend numbers have already come in, we've seen Sherlock Holmes dominate the weekend ($40 million vs. $13 million for Mission Impossible), so the honor of first review goes to them.Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows picks up fairly close to where the last one left off. Watson is getting married and Holmes is closing in on his arch-enemy, Professor Moriarty. The two masterminds face off against each other in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse which threatens not only the life of our quixotic hero, but his best friend and possibly the entire world beyond.It's likely been said before, and as much as I hate repetition I'll forego it this one time, Robert Downey Jr. was born for this role. Obviously the historical version of Holmes was tweaked and crafted around Downey's skills and persona, but the magical merge between the real person and the literary classic created something perfect which will be cherished by viewers for generations to come. All future attempts at playing Holmes, which I am sure there will be someday, will be weighed against Downey, a bar now set incredibly high. His charm, wit and energy flow through the scenes effortlessly, keeping the audience in tow no matter what is going on. He also lets his co-stars, like Jude Law (as Dr. Watson) and Jared Harris (as Prof. Moriarty) own the moment equally, not overshadowing their own crisp deliveries and subtle mannerisms. From back-to-front, the performances throughout were playful, charming and more than enough to please any afternoon crowd.So if everyone was so great in it, why is the rating so low? That is a fantastic question.The downfall here is the script. If you are going to create a story for the world's most renowned investigator, you need to plunge the imagination of the audience into a world of multiple story lines, interconnecting webs of deceit and subterfuge, something only Holmes could solve. The first film had this, but Game of Shadows rolls out a plot all too plain for such a complicated enemy like Moriarty. There seemed to be an effort to cover that up by actually showing a room full of interconnecting threads built by Holmes, to demonstrate how complicated this all really was, but that felt a cheap way out for writing a more complex story. Moriarty is the epitome of villains, the mental match for Sherlock Holmes, and in the end he just turns out to be greedy, a motive far below the weight of his character.Guy Ritchie, the returning director, held up his side of the bargain, but didn't push anything forward in terms of the style and execution. We got more slam-to-slow-motion shots and a couple good moments of Holmes playing out the oncoming violence in his head in order to predict the exact counter maneuvers. I will give both Ritchie and the screenwriters credit through for the final scene between Holmes and Moriarty, which I won't go into detail about, but it was a nice twist on a familiar theme in this franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
fast pace cinema at best!!!,"In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, my mind turns two ways: The first half is guns, gunpowder, and gymnastics. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) contend with the salvation of civilization mostly through athletics, aided by director Guy Ritchie's considerable skill with the camera and graphics.But in the second half, when the duo moves swiftly but intellectually to confront the arch villain Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris), my mind is at equilibrium, renewing my love of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original brainy, eccentric sleuth. The chess game is a marvel of strategy, replete with revenge, intrigue, and just plain ingenuity. Director Guy Ritchie's visuals include delightful Downey disguises and lively speed ramping in a forest bombarded by bullets. Hans Zimmer's music leans heavily on the fiddle to lighten the load of a difficult plot.Watson's marriage, rather than taking away from the romance, adds unexpected color and creativity. So Ritchie has ramped up the intellectual content and at least balanced it with the athletic, which was a strength of his 2009 version, Sherlock Holmes. With Inspector Lastrade just a memory and Holmes's love, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), appearing briefly, we are left to enjoy not so much the interaction of Holmes and Watson but the explosiveness of Holmes and Moriarty.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sherlock Holmes Should Be Treated With More Respect!,"The first ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie was an unexpectedly great one. Before I watched that film, I did not think Robert Downey, Jr. could ever be acceptable as Sherlock Holmes. However, after watching that one, I admit that I was mistaken. Therefore, despite the unpromising trailer for this second installment of this franchise, I still went on to watch it, expecting this to exceed the action and humor of the first.However, things did not really go very well in this sequel for me. The process of Holmes anticipating the next moves of his enemies in fights which was so innovative in the first, felt tedious in this one. I felt Guy Richie delved too much into close-ups and slow mo effects, fight scenes and explosions to hide the material deficiency of the script. This movie had more flourish than there was substance.For the actors, only Jude Law for me played his character Dr. Watson as I would expect. Robert Downey, Jr. was NOT Sherlock in most of his scenes! Sherlock would never go drag and almost flirt with Watson the way it was played out here. I did not like it. The gypsy character of Noomi Rapace was quite unnecessary it seemed, just an excuse to have a new female character. The eccentric character of Sherlock's brother Mycroft as played by Stephen Fry was teetering on annoying. The very laid back way Jared Harris played Holmes' arch-enemy Professor Moriarty lacked palpable passion and life opposite Downey's hyper-acting.Overall, except for a well-written cerebral confrontation scene between Holmes and Moriarty towards the end where they verbalized their moves as it be in a chess game, the rest of this sequel was a big disappointment for me. Hints of charm like the first movie were still evident in certain scenes, but the whole was not very satisfying, especially for traditional fans of the Sherlock Holmes books. Making Sherlock overly buffoonish is definitely NOT the way to make him click for this new generation. I think Richie and Downey have got to reassess the way they bring Sherlock to life, if they are thinking of a third installment.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
sequel better than the prequel,"The idea of this sequel consists, of course, in using the same actors and the same basic idea but this movie is directed with more confidence and a sense of humor as well as a sense of identity, as far as I can see. This story is clear to the viewer from the beginning and remains such at every turn. The film is full of action set-pieces but intelligently constructed and fitting very well within the Holmesian proceedings. The tone is fairly appropriate and the characters are right. Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law have a very strong chemistry with one another. There will surely be a third installment with the same lead actors but anyone who hasn't disliked the first and the second movies won't be be stopped from going to the movie theaters.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Super-stylish, steampunky fun for everyone!","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is as good, if not better than its predecessor ""Sherlock Holmes"". Robert Downey Jnr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as Homes and Watson respectively, giving expected, predictable, but absolutely fantastic performances. Downey Jnr's histrionic performance and Law's straight faced ex-military doctor has such brilliant chemistry between them, clearly the actors themselves like each other(although, they seem more like a married couple than friends).The camera work is clever, and the editing is fast-paced and very Hollywood. In a good way. The smoky, dusty, steamy, misty cityscape of victorian London is iconic, British, and provides a stable substrate for the real action to take place.Dialogue is simple, effective and funny, especially Holmes, often switching between English and French, with wisps of German thrown in. But don't worry, there are no subtitles and the narrative is easily followable even if the words are gibberish.Noomi Rapace (Girl with a Dragon tattoo Original) is the cunning (and remarkably sexy) gypsy who helps Holmes and Watson to deduce the tricks and traps laid by the fabulous Moriarty.Moriarty amazingly portrayed by Jared Harris, and is possibly the best character in the whole film. Cool, calm, but very very intimidating, Harris uses his silence to scare the audience and is the binary opposite to Holmes, but yet very similar in some ways.I won't say much, but the final scene is sensationally composed by the former ""cult"" director Guy Ritchie.You don't need to see the original film to be able to follow A Game of Shadows' narrative. In fact, there aren't really any references to the first film at all.If you like a stunning visual style, with British brains and American brauns then Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is definitely suitable for you!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but we expected much better,"I loved the first Sherlock Holmes movie and couldn't wait to see this one. Before I went to the theater I was worried by some of the reviews that I saw posted, but I went into the film with an open mind. Well after the first couple of scenes I could see why the critics downgraded this movie and that's ashame. I think that Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect Holmes and in the first film, yes he was quirky but not annoying. In this film he has moments where annoying comes through. The film makers are making the same mistake that way made with the Pirates movies. In the first Pirate movie Jack Sparrow was quirky brilliant and in the second some of the brilliance remained but the quirkiness was starting to take the forefront. In the last two film quirky had taken over, especially the last. This is the same thing I see happening to Sherlock Holmes. He is a brilliant detective with a few idiocracies but they are staring to change him into a clown.I also didn't like all of the choppy camera work and there was way too much of the slow motion. It works in the last scenes with Holmes and the Professor but by that time you've had so much that you might be ready to tune out and thus the meaning of the mental battle is lost. I hope that if they decide on doing another (I don't think the box office will be as big as it was for the first movie though) I hope they go back to the brilliant Holmes and leave the quirky at home.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A letdown,"This movie was the most disappointing movie I have seen in recent memory. Not because it was horrible, it wasn't. Rather because the first movie was one my favorite movies of the last decade. I loved the occult/mystery angle, Mark Strong's absolutely delicious turn as the arch-villain, Rachel McAdams turn as the decidedly sexy and ambivalent heroine/villainess, Robert Downey's descent in drug induced madness to catch the villain, the Holmes/Watson dysfunctional co-dependency, it all worked wonderfully and was incredibly fresh in my opinion. This movie had none of that. It was, rather, a steampunk version of a James Bond movie. Holmes' analytical violence was rendered silly as he is now endowed with such superhuman strength and speed as there really was no point to thinking about his opponents moves. Rachel McAdams makes only a cameo, and is replaced Noomi Rapace's character who seems to be their only to check off a box regarding a female demographic. The latent Holmes/Watson homoeroticism is cranked up to ten. There is no mystery angle, as Jared Harris' Moriarty is reduced to a SPECTRE conspiracy mastermind. I literally found myself nodding off around the 1:45 mark. If you're up for a steampunk James Bond movie, I guess this is OK. But know it has none of the originality that made the 1st movie so special.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not bad... for a sequel,"One of the easiest ways to sum up Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows would be to say, 'If you liked the first one then you'll love this one too.' It's basically more of the same, but if what was done the first time was a winning formula, then who really care? (it worked for Terminator 1-3!).You have more witticisms from Robert Downey Jr as Holmes, more of long-suffering Jude law as Watson and more trendy and stylish slow-mo directing, courtesy of Guy Ritchie. This time round they team up to lock horns with arguably Holmes' most famous villain - Moriarty.You could call it all a re-tread of the first film, but in different locations, but that would probably be overly cynical. It's a new story in itself and, while certain purists complain that it's not completely faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original books, it's got its own charms. It may not be a hundred per cent accurate or believable, but it's basically Hollywood's take on what Sherlock Holmes was and - in my opinion - it's a pretty exciting take.

An At-First Confusing But Eventually Compelling Chess Match Between Holmes and Moriarty,"One of the first criminal-geniuses in genre fiction is Professor Moriarty, the ever-present nemesis of Sherlock Holmes. The latter calls him ""The Napoleon of Crime"". Part of a successful Holmes film is how well Moriarty is portrayed. In this installment of the Robert Downey/Jude Law Sherlock Holmes film series, Moriarty is played by Jared Harris, a British actor and one of the best casting choices for the role to date. (Andrew Scott also makes a fine Moriarty, albeit a younger version, in the updated-modernized ""Holmes"" BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.) Prior to Moriarty, few if any criminal-geniuses were portrayed in genre literature, and Conan Doyle's creation remains one of the best. (Later characters in genre fiction of a similar nature include the Joker, Mr. Ripley, Lex Luther, and Dr. Hannibal Lecter.)The film is at first rather confusing. We learn there have been a series of unexplained explosions around London causing lots of carnage, dismay, grief, and fascination for Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.). A woman then carries a package to a wealthy older man attending an art auction, which turns out to be a bomb discovered by you-know-who. Inside the bomb-package is a letter addressed to a gypsy fortune teller who practices at a cabaret in London. During a bachelor party for Dr. Watson (Jude Law), Holmes intervenes to save the gypsy from an assassin. We don't quite understand the connection between the gypsy and the bombings until well into the film.Holmes soon realizes Moriarty, who fronts as an Oxford professor, is behind the attacks, but he doesn't know why. He meets with the professor at his office at Oxford and there Moriarty claims he is intrigued with Holmes' abilities, the only reason Holmes hasn't been blown to bits like other lesser Londoners. They agree to engage in a chess match of sorts. Moriarty, in true Conan Doyle style, believes he will outdo Holmes. Thereafter, Sherlock and Watson meet with his brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) who indicates he will be attending a peace conference in Switzerland where the major powers will negotiate to prevent an international war. Eventually, as events plays out, the peace conference and Moriarty's scheming will intersect.The typical devices of the first film are all here, particularly the slow-motion flash-backs and action sequences with Holmes' voice-over describing what's ""really happened"". Although much of the movie is probably not what Doyle had in mind, Downey still makes a splendid Holmes, always playing his character just a bit understated. Jude Law reprises as the straight-man Dr. Watson, although his character is not quite as well-developed as Martin Freeman's interpretation of the character in ""Sherlock"". Highest marks for Jared Harris as Moriarty who nearly steals the show. Despite some of the confusion at the beginning, it's enjoyable once the plot becomes clear.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Part two,"As a sequel, it feels as if the first film was just increased in length. There are many callbacks to the original and it wastes no time introducing characters, relying on the audience having seen the first. Like in the title, games are referenced repeatedly which is nice writing. Without Rachel McAdams the movie loses a lot of its charm previously but the addition of Moriarty as a great villain and match for Sherlock makes up for it. I really do not have anything extra to say about this movie that I didn't say about the original. However, Downey's costume department really steps up their game here (in a mostly comedic and funny way). Definitely refrain from seeing the sequel if one hasn't seen the original considering this movie could be seen as less of a sequel and more of a part-two.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Like a Bourne movie plot twist in the movie, this Sherlock script also puts the audience at a sudden emotional tailspin and successfully uses the off balance of life and death to creep into the movie late making for a surprising suspenseful and even at times scary compelling experience. Richie has successfully introduced a new level of slow motion action to good effect along with a color scheme and set design that seems off but captures the period feel of the movie well.

Excellent fun,"Excellent fun Putting that aside, the first Sherlock Holmes was a breath of fresh air for a character that had become something so obsolete as James Bond over the years.

The presence of Rachel McAdams as Irene also brought a different dimension to the first movie because she was a great partner and, as Sherlock mentions in the story, she is ""the woman"" and I could not hide my disappointment when I noticed that her presence in The Game Of Shadows would not only be important, but also brief... very brief.Instead of Rachel McAdams, now there is Noomi Rapace performing gypsy Simza Heron, a character that appears and disappears and no one even notice that during the movie.

A more than decent sequel to a ripper of an original,"The last couple of years have given moviegoers a mixed bag of modernised Hollywood revivals of classic franchises: some pleasing hits – The Adventures of Tintin, The Muppets – and quite a few ill-received misses – The Smurfs, Alvin and the Chipmunks. So it is a pleasure to kick of the year with a fine sequel to what is perhaps the most successful of these adaptations, along with Steven Moffatt's inspired BBC television series Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Old- fashioned slick and smart plot developments and the traditional period English setting are skilfully blended in with the high-tail action scenes of today's summer blockbusters. Its appeal to both laidback and serious cinema audiences will surely continue to generate the promising commercial success that it has been enjoying thus far. On this outing, the novel mysticism of the menacing Lord Blackwood has been left behind, and the old eroticism of the slippery Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is present only briefly as more elements of the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are introduced. Stephen Fry makes a delightful entrance into the series as the irrepressible detective's brother Mycroft. Usually there is an awkward rivalry between the two, where Holmes is frustrated by his brother possessing superior intellect and wasting it with his laziness, but here they are mostly very co-operative allies. The villain of the piece is a very familiar figure, the unbeatable Professor James Moriarty, but he has also changed. While in this film, as always, he is described as being faceless and consistently elusive, his pompous countenance is revealed within the first half hour. What's more, Jared Harris doesn't play him with nearly as much wicked relish as his predecessors; Guy Ritchie doesn't seem to want us to view him as a diabolical mastermind, but more a neat personification of the inevitable corruption and conflict present in modern society.However, the overall film is far from dulled down and certainly not as restrained as might be suggested from those aforementioned characterisations. The outlandish escapism is partly given in by the spectacularly gripping and often humorous action sequences. Chaotic explosions certainly abound, against a variety of backdrops, including a stirring performance of Mozart's famed opera Don Giovanni and an exhilarating chase through the woods that has spiky wood splinters zooming in every direction. Early on, there is also the classic comical assassin evasion, involving the enigmatic gypsy Madame Simza (Noomi Rampace from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). The other half is of course given by Robert Downey Jr.'s reprisal of another typically erratic role, but this is one of his better excursions of eccentricity. Jude law puts in some fine work also as Holmes' much more sensible and long-suffering roommate and associate Dr John Watson, who exhibits a deeper maturity as he prepares seriously for a marriage to his equally sober girlfriend (Geraldine James).Much lighter this time, yet filled with a stronger sense of doom and danger than the first film, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows might not bring anything terribly new to the table, but it presents its familiar yet reliable products with fine gusto, and aptly manages to keep its audience engaged and energised throughout its sizeable two hour duration, a time that can be treacherously difficult to sustain interest with.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This film definitely does NOT fall for the sequel ""curse""","Sherlock Holmes lived up to my expectations, clever, funny and action-packed to the rafters. The first one was good enough, and when i learnt that a second was in production i was buzzing to see it. It was one of few films that i felt confident it wouldn't fall into that dreaded sequel ""curse"", and when i saw it on Wednesday, it didn't disappoint one little bit! I was hooked from the start and i was that way until the end where Holmes (Robert Downey JR) printed a '?' on Dr Watsons work. This surely means an arrival of a third film? I think Stephen Fry done an excellent job as Mycroft (Holmes' Brother) and as did Jared Harris as prof. Moriarty (Holmes' Arch Enemy).Overall this film is definitely one of my films of the year. 10/10 & *****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Detective joy as our old bickering duo try to thwart old Professor Moriarty,"It's a difficult task to make a franchise let alone one on an already popular character. Sherlock Holmes is well known as the greatest fictional detective, and the original reboot by Guy Ritchie was well received. This sequel has a hard task to follow and personally I like it.Our heroes again laugh and bicker their way through a bygone England, but they also travel to mainland Europe as they aim to thwart Professor Moriarty in his dastardly scheme to start mass war.Again we have the startlingly brilliant sets and terrific acting. The dialogue is funny and the action thick and fast. However, the puzzle is a bit convoluted and the story hard to fathom at times. You won't lose attention but you do need to concentrate. Joining our friends from the original movie, Stephen Fry comes on into the action playing Sherlocks' brother as ""Stephen Fry""(!), but this is more than masked by Jared Harris brilliantly portraying Pr Moriarty.A good sequel for which all who saw the original will enjoy. The original was the better film but this is still very good on its own right. A good romp.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Don't let the haters fool you. Entertaining and engaging film, better than the first.","What these Hollywood critics don't understand is that Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is an ADAPTATION. The films aren't supposed to be verbatim of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels. Besides, if the movies were made to resemble the books, 85% of the population wouldn't be able to enjoy, let alone understand, them due to the vocabulary/dialogue. Imagine Shakespeare brought to the silver screen, along with all of the old English dialogue. Everyone praises ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"", but they aren't anywhere close to their book counterparts either. Both series are entertaining and engaging, as is Sherlock Holmes. You will laugh multiple times. You will find compelling characters. The story is full of twists and turns. The action is exciting and well-thought-out. The cinematography is excellent. Robert Downey Jr. is charismatic and lovable as Sherlock. This film is well worth the watch, so be your own judge and see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Distinctly lacking in mystery,"Guy Ritchie's sequel to the surprisingly fabulous Sherlock Holmes is an enjoyable romp concocted from many superficially similar elements to the first movie, but at the same time fundamentally less satisfying as a piece of storytelling or as a homage to Arthur Conan Doyle's detectives. At heart seems to be a recurrent weakness in Ritchie's approach to directing, which is to return to the scene of a successfully committed crime and try to up the ante. After his initial success with 'Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch' Ritchie drove his career into a cul-de-sac with ever more convoluted reworking of the British gangster movie. His Sherlock Holmes was a new departure, whilst retaining his trademark stylised hyperviolence and successfully deploying his flair for popvideo like visuals to the backdrop of Victorian London. The visuals and the violence are intact, even improved on with a bigger budget and the confidence of the original global hit in the bank, and Robert Downey Junior is still hilarious and mesmerising with his Depp-like hypercamp re-interpretation of great detective. What's lacking is the decent storyline. While the original film employed mysticism and some real plot puzzlers which were untangled wonderfully in the denouement, there is not that much mystery to the sequel. Yes, there is lots of confusion as to what there is going on in the opening reels, but nothing really intriguing to ponder before the action kicks in. From that point there is little time for the plot to expand into the space between the setpieces, gags and Downey Jr and Law's homoerotic banter. That itself is an example of what was delicious and slightly daring in the original feeling a bit treadworn already in only the first sequel, along with the pre-narrated slow motion fight scenes. The only genuinely new factor in play is the character of Moriarty pitched perfectly by Jared Harris who is understated, yet convincingly menacing. If someone can come up with a gripping yarn, a third outing with the talents of the director and stars now firmly established in character would be welcomed, but if its only further spills and thrills we can look forward to, Ritchie might be better to quit while he's still ahead.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

sherlock holmes? where?,"this movie is a(nother) disappointing proof of the impression that most of the money in movie business is in the hand of the wrong people.this has nothing to do with anything anyone would associate with the sherlock holmes that has been main character of real literature. there is no connection visible whatsoever to that kind of clever developed character.dialog is stupid, unrealistic and scripted to a point that makes it unbelievably disappointing that the makers obviously think that the audience is completely dumbed down and wont recognize a pile of verbal garbage that is desperately modified to sound good.characters are completely unbelievable, shallow and exaggerated in a way one would expect to see in a comic movie. with the difference that in those movies the components fit together to create something interesting at least. this movie fails miserably there. it's a mess.story is non existent, calling it an excuse for the action scenes would give it too much credit. they are not even trying to do that.the action scenes you would expect from a super-hero movie. and that's what it actually is. it's iron man in medieval times without that metal suit trying to do some kind of parody of sherlock holmes. this is the only point of view that would make it work somehow.the actors are trying but it's a pointless effort with this direction and script.there is a lot more that is just wrong about this movie. i don't have words for it at the moment. it feels like the mess that they call movie has left my brain in a similarly messed up state.i am actually shocked to see this average rating it has at the moment. it cant be right. it just cant.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This film's no mystery to see.,"When talking about the greatest fictional detective of Britain Sherlock Holmes, and the many movies based on this iconic character, many have seen the most memorable of actors, Basil Rathbone to be the one we think of the most. Lines like 'Elementary, my dear Watson' have been used from generation to generation, letting others know of the legacy of the character Sir Arthur Doyle had given to the world.Since 2009, director Guy Ritchie had given this generation a NEW Sherlock Holmes, portrayed by former SNL comedian, Robert Downey Jr, who had gained the role of also portraying Iron Man. Downey had given a fantastically stunning performance in both the Iron Man AND Sherlock Holmes films, that it's difficult to explain how more good he's become. The way that he pays good tribute to the character of Holmes and what Rathbone had given, he also manages to create his own Holmes as well. He's smart, witty, and strong willed, especially with his amazing predictions. As for Jude Law, he himself brings new depths into the character of Dr. John Watson, Holmes' sidekick. The chemistry between the two is in such well depth, that it almost makes you think that the two of them are brothers. With that, the original stands as a strong, well determined piece of art that is both fun and intense.With this new film, it's much of the same. It continues the story of Holmes, with a new case that could possibly be his last, or at least that's how I felt about it. Sherlock and Watson are reprized by the duo of Downey and Law, as they try to figure out what plan is in develop by Professor Moriarty, played by Jared Harris. Harris gives off the attitude of a smart villain, giving everything his best shot, and does a well done job at doing it. Stephen Croft plays Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes, and gives a few good laughs with his cheery performance, and his ways of assisting his brother in the film.Is the film as good as the original? No, I found some scenes to be a bit slow, boring, and not well examined. But is it good? Yes. Is it worth the ticket price in theaters? Yes. I guarantee that audiences who enjoyed the first film will enjoy this new film, and it deserves a viewing every once and a while. If you got the time, then Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is one of the perfect works of art, and in my opinion, one of the best films of the year.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A much superior sequel with an excellent title,"Having enjoyed the original, I was worried that the cast and crew would fail to maintain the quality and disappoint with the sequel, but I was really impressed by the stunning visuals, witty jokes, intelligent plot twists, and especially the brilliant performance of Mycroft from Stephen Fry. To summarise, this movie was, not only better than the original, but excelled most films by all standards, making it the, or at least on of the, best films of the year so far. Downey Jr and Law have given a spark of life into characters that haven't been portrayed in literature or media as greatly as this since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories. The plot twist right before the credits reminded me of cinema that inspired so many other amazing films. I recommend the viewing of this motion picture to anybody.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Highly entertaining but less innovating than the first feature,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows is an enjoyable follow-up of the first movie with the same line-up and includes everything fans and critics likes about the first feature: the camera work, the images and the exotic locations are breathtaking, the visual special effects and action scenes are also mind-blowing, the soundtrack is once again very intense, the movie contains a lot of humour and slapstick scenes and the flick finally features a solid acting that is rated up by some new actors like the Swedish shooting star Noomie Rapace. You will get very well entertained for almost two hours in this ride of action, humour and tension.The reason why this movie though can't keep up with the first part is that its story is less intriguing, less surprising and simply less twisted. Many elements of this movie are quite predictable and stereotypical for this kind of genre while the first part had several well thought twists. Some scenes of the movie are simply too exaggerated like the escape scenes in Germany and the final showdown in Switzerland. This is effect loaded Hollywood popcorn cinema as we see it every day and the talent of many great actors and some great pieces of literature are somewhat wasted in here.Another important problem is that the actions and goals of the main villain remain somewhat superficial. In general, the different new characters should have been more developed. The actors do their very best to give the somewhat ordinary characters a unique soul but sometimes they struggle a little bit and their talent gets a little bit wasted in this movie.The script should have been more detailed and precise and the movie could have needed a healthy dose of around ten minutes of additional running time to portray us the uprising and the first evil actions of the main villain and his first acts of terrorism in the beginning. On the other side, the ending on the castle in Switzerland could have been more detailed and one could have shown us what happened to the different characters after the final showdown.Even though these important flaws, the movie is saved by all the positive elements mentioned in the beginning of my review and the ending creates some high hopes for a possible third part. I hope that a possible third feature might unite the amazing script of the first part with the solid acting of the second part with more impressive sound and image effects to create a nearly perfect flick honouring one of the most fascinating characters in the history of literature where the traditional meets the modern.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Remember When They Said the First Film Couldn't Be Surpassed?,"A+The first film truly was a surprise treat, I myself much expecting much less of it. Of course, I was blown away. Then came the news of the sequel, and then came the anxious trepidation. Would it flop? Could the previous story really be matched? Under the helm of Guy Ritchie once again, the film soars and abounds. Everyone is back, including a few new faces. Stephen Fry is a nice edition as the brother of Sherlock Holmes, and Jared Harris makes for a one intriguing villain. And let me not forget Paul Anderson, also well done.My only real complaint is (SPOILER) the afterthought Rachel McAdams becomes after she's been murdered, but Noomi Rapace is up to the task of playing yet another great character. She isn't the femme fatale-inspired character that McAdams was, but all the same very enticing and great to watch on screen. The plot moves at a steady pace and builds tension quite admirably. The comedy is well orchestrated but does not over shadow the plot twists which will demand your attention. And the climatic showdown between Holmes and guy's character, well it's one of my favorite film moments in a long time.Strikingly original, exciting locations and Hans Zimmer composing, the question is not if it can match up to the first film. No, the debate becomes which one of the two is superior to the other, and I myself have not been able to reach a verdict yet.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Damn Good Show Old Boy,"On first viewing I was completely underwhelmed by this second outing for the world's greatest detective, although this might've been considerably flavoured by a cinema that would've been more effective as a fridge.A second sitting, though, revealed a well-paced and thoroughly entertaining period romp, channelled, of course, through Guy Ritchie's highly-stylised lens.The roguish, yet gentlemanly bromance between Sherlock and Watson, continues to blossom here, allowing for all manner of shenanigans typical of the period, and to add my voice to others suggesting likewise, both actors seemed born to play the parts of these characters.The rest of the cast perform admirably, although naturally playing second fiddle to our two detectives, with Stephen Fry joining in the hi-jinx as Sherlock's brother.Noomi Rapace is largely wasted as a Gypsy plot-adhesive, yet continues to make a name for herself, regardless.The story itself is one of diabolical ambition typically reserved for a Bond movie, with Moriarty, Sherlock's adversary wonderfully pinning down the archetypal villain in just the right measure of charm and menace.The music is flawless, the scenes exciting, and the possibility of a further adventure is on the cards. All in all, it's pretty hard not to enjoy.My only real criticism is a lack of moral understanding from Guy Ritchie, highlighted in two separate, but related conversations. In the first we hear Holmes analysing Moriarty's handwriting, which he claims suggests a lack of empathy bordering on moral insanity, yet within half an hour we hear Holmes criticise Moriarty for indulging in a hobby of feeding pigeon's which he dubs ""...winged vermin"". Surely even the most ignorant of moralists understands that it takes far more empathy for a person to relate to a bird than it does to another human. This actually shows Moriarty to have, either greater empathy than Holmes, or simply a lack of empathy regarding people.That very minor detail aside, though, I thoroughly enjoyed it, although that may have also been coloured by the fine bottle of red, and the roll of green, I enjoyed whilst watching it.Here's to the return of our fearless duo.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Average: 5.5,"The 2009 Sherlock Holmes was a relatively slow-paced, more actiony take on the world's greatest detective (sorry, Batman). Though there were a bit too many punches thrown and not enough clues analyzed, it was definitely a good time, held up by the considerable talents of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. While this pair's chemistry is back and as strong as ever this time around, most the fun is conspicuously absent. The film's first hour or so is actually too fast. The overall plot is easy enough to follow, but the individual scenes are not. The action is edited in such a way that I actually had to work hard to follow what I was watching. Nothing memorable really happens, leaving a pretty bad first impression. One minute, a bar fight. Two later, a wedding. The transition was jarring enough that for a split second I actually asked myself how Holmes and Watson got to where they were. That's a bad sign if I ever saw one. The villain, Professor Moriarty, is trying to preemptively start World War I by bombing and supplying various European countries with war materiel. Holmes repeats throughout the film that Moriarty is too careful to leave any clues behind. This leaves Holmes to deduce what he can from the various locales. Since a significant amount of this deduction happens at scenes of Moriarty's crimes, the villain really does feel one step ahead of Holmes, creating a more tense atmosphere than that in the first film. The suspense keeps the movie together to the same degree that the pair of leads' acting does. Despite tripping over its own feet in the first half, the film finds its pace in the second half. The action is coherent, the story starts to come to a head, and the film stops trying to make me laugh every three minutes. Holmes starts moving in on Moriarty, and things get more deliberate. The film catches its breath. Suddenly, one can focus on little details that might or might not carry meaning, just like Holmes does, bringing you into the film in some very clever ways. The final twenty-or-so minutes of the movie are easily the best of it, with a very good mix of detective work and action that make every prior scene look amateur by comparison. However, this is certainly not enough to make up for the criminally lackluster beginning and middle. In addition, one thing that fans of the original will definitely notice is that the soundtrack is simply not at the same level of quality as the first movie's. Especially at the title sequence, the music is a bit too overpowering, which would be fine if it was not so aggravating. Though not a bad film by any means, A Game of Shadows is a classic example of a sequel that, despite its best efforts, simply cannot live up to its predecessor's legacy.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Improved round, but there's a better boxer","Guy Ritchie's first go around with Sherlock Holmes felt a lot more like ""Snatch 2"" with pigs, slow mo punching and dank leaky interiors, but here he has genuinely improved. Despite the bore inducing overdose of patented Ritchie camera shutter ramping and slow motion, this is actually sorta kinda qualified to be a Sherlock story.Modeled hazily on The Final Problem, there's more mental gymnastics with Moriarity and less British pit boxing. Nice recovery Guy.What bothers me the most here, is the inclusion of too many guns blazing scenes - a near contractual requirement for any director working with 80s fossil, producer Joel Silver. John McTiernan joked about just this point working with Silver when making Arnie's Predator. His solution, or Flip Off to Silver, was having Bill Duke fire the ""Painless"" mini-gun surrounded by the other commandos dumping lead into the jungle - and hitting nothing. In Die Hard he had the terrorists do the same thing shooting glass. But that is another story. No, I have nothing against guns, but Sherlock is not an action hero, he is a heroine addicted supercomputer and he wins the day with his mind and eye, not running from mortars.Overall it is money well spent if you want to escape. Though the movie is so dense with quick cutting for more than two hours I don't really remember anything from the first half of the film at all. While Downy Jr. enjoys playing our dear detective and Jude Law perfectly at home as Watson, in the meantime Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have done better with their interpretations on BBC's Sherlock. How about that? Guy Ritchie beaten out by a TV show. You don't even need slow motion to see the knockout blow from those two show how it's done.It is nice to see Noomi Rapace in there.

"Boring at times, but ending makes up for it","There was bound to be a sequel to the original Sherlock Holmes from 2009, seeing how much money it made, even with Avatar being released at almost the same time. And here it is,although I wouldn't really call it a sequel, because the old story is mentioned nowhere in the film.The film, like the old one, is full of gags and jokes involving mostly Holmes and an exasperated Watson, who should be on his honeymoon. These are all pretty funny, but the film does get boring around the middle, and you feel like you're just waiting for the climax. But when it does come you are rewarded for your patience. Again, like in the first film, Holmes uncovers Moriarty's plan to wreak havoc on the world, and stops him from executing it by throwing him off a cliff. But Moriarty pulls Holmes down with him. Everyone thinks he died, and Watson writes a book about him, honoring him as 'the best man of the law I have ever known'. I won't tell you the ending, it's a surprise and maybe the best part of the film.In conclusion, I don't think this is as good as the old one, but it's still enjoyable enough. I suggest you go see it if you haven't already, but don't expect to be blown away. Expect to be amused and entertained, but no more. If you do that, you'll enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

OK sequel benefits from a terrific villain to match wits with Holmes,"""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is not as good as the first film in the series, but it does benefit from an interesting villain. Don't underestimate how important that is to this kind of movie; when you have a hero that's as smart as ol' Holmes, you better have someone that he can match wits with or the whole thing will be a snooze-fest as you wait for this lamo to get trounced by the world's greatest detective. If anything, I was disappointed that these adversaries didn't get to share more screen time. The second half is interesting and well crafted enough to keep the audience entertained though, so it more than redeems itself for me. It's unfortunate that the detective work and mystery play second fiddle to some of the action scenes and humor sequences, and I felt that some of the revelations and plot twists were way over the top, but overall it's enjoyable.

"Look, Up In The Sky, ....","Is there an age limit for modern movies? Or an IQ limit? I thought the first Sherlock Holmes movie was bad, and then I watched ""A Game Of Shadows"" at a friends house. I must say right up front, I do not like the idea of Holmes and Watson as superheroes who can defy gravity and rational behavior with equal dexterity. I liked the more pedestrian movies of long ago with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in which the two acted normally and solved mysteries.But there is another component missing from those films, and that is a coherent script. This is not the first modern movie I have seen which lacks continuity and order; it is as though movies nowadays have a schizophrenic quality wherein the plot diverts from reality and descends into periodic madness. Are Hollywood screenwriters now all on drugs, or just some?Well, enough. I have made my point and I am obviously outnumbered judging by the user ratings. I do think Robert Downey is one of the better actors around nowadays, and Jude Law made a better effort this time. I just long for some indication of the superior workmanship that Hollywood was known for and which began to recede in the mid 70's, approximately after ""The Sting"", which may be the last great American movie.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Go See this masterpiece,"One thing you have to love about ""A Game Of Shadows"" is the pitch which it starts. The touch of comedy makes it enticing to the eyes and ears. With over 2 hours of watch time, Holmes delivered a enough juice to keep you watching.With a more like Jackie Chan fight scenes, lovely disguises by Holmes and it was fun to see the dynamic duo, battle together in a sheer masculine type male bonding, with Watson being the joker in every scene introducing jokes and fun as the plot untangles.Holmes brother Mycoft was also introduced, as in the books Sherlock Holmes brother was more in touch with his power of observation than Sherlock himself. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle made Holmes brother smarter and better than Holmes in his books the only different being he had more political ambition than Holmes and less interest in being a detective.Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) is up against a criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) who is Holmes' intellectual equal. The story starts off with the death of the Crown Prince of Austria. Holmes deduces that the prince has been the victim Professor Moriarty.Holmes goes after Moriarty, but always seems to be behind all that is going on. The two masterminds start a game of who will succeed a game which Moriarty's lack of conscience led to chaos and death.The movie did have an initial faceoff between the two major players Holmes and Moriarty, a faceoff that was less exciting than I hoped.No need to say anything about the acting, as it was the main steed in the movie riding hard and strong till it crossed the finish line in front, the acting was something extraordinary, good delivery of lines, wonderful facial expressions and grand gestures; making the actors more like the character they represent than being distant from the movie, what am saying in few words is, the actors were the bomb.The scenery was well crafted to fit and suit the screenplay which (screenplay) was a grand gesture of mastery. Directing must have been made easy for Guy Ritchie (who directed the first Sherlock Holmes) as the screenplay to me did the main task.

In Name Only,"I suppose I'll sound like a broken record. I enjoyed this movie, but, like the first, I almost never think of it as a Sherlock Holmes film. If Indiana Jones were to be transferred into Robert Downey's body, it wouldn't make any difference. Because of the name recognition, many entities are capitalizing on the Holmes name. Making him a quirky indecipherable enigma, or making his partner a woman named Watson who is of Asian descent. These are certainly interesting but so far removed from the Holmes mythos that it does nothing for me. This is a wild adventure with lots of twists and turns, leading to some really dramatic moments; but it's also so full of contrivances that I have to suspend so much disbelief. People just know things without the ratiocination that was the whole of the original character. We could use a dose of that in any new Holmes incarnation which would really substantiate the character.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Masterpiece..!,"When we go to a theater to watch a movie, there is one desire that always crawls our hearts. The desire that the movie comes out to be entertaining. But this one, I assure, will raise that desire to new heights for the movies yet to release in your lifetime. It is not an ""entertaining"" movie. It is a creation of a Masterpiece. I have not read the Sherlock Holmes books. So may be, many would disagree with me on the thought that no movie could have justified the character of Holmes better. But my friends, I have seen more than a couple of thousands of them. And that perhaps grants me the ability to praise one when I feel like. I will give the movie 9.9. 0.1 deducted, because the word ""Perfect"" is not heard in this world. Call it fate, I could not watch the movie when it came to theaters. I got the chance just a couple of hours ago. And I am glad that I got this pleasure on a day which had not been very good for me. Hats off to Robert Downey Jr. for a performance even he himself will not be able to forget in his life. And special gratitude to Guy Ritchie for crafting the Masterpiece out of a great character.

Similar to the original,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows resembles the 2009 Sherlock Holmes in many ways. It has the exact same sense of humour, the actors haven't lost their touch in the slightest in the two passing years, the action scenes are very similar, as is the music and the pacing. And this is a good thing, it really is. If you liked the first film, then this won't disappoint at all and you may even like a bit more if its story is more to your liking.Yet personally I cannot help but feel that novelty played a large part in why I liked the 2009 so much. It was a version of Sherlock Holmes I hadn't seen before. But now with a sequel I don't have that. I've already seen much of what it has to offer before, and the new it has is not enough to pull me back in completely. It's also worth mentioning that don't really like Jared Horris as Professor Moriarty. His acting here is very workmanlike. It gets the job done, but I would have preferred to see more spirit from him, even little hints of brilliance and menacing intellect.Still, it's by no means a bad film. Downey Jr. and Law are still absolutely brilliant in their roles, the rest of the returning actors do a good job, technically it's just as professional as the previous one, the story is one of the classic Holmes stories told well and as a whole it'll keep you entertained. I wasn't as thrilled by it as I was with the original, but if you're looking for more like that one, this is an excellent film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sherlock Holmes 2 is brilliant!,"Sherlock Holmes is back with a bang! Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows continues with the adventures of Sherlock Holmes(Robert Downey Jr.) along with his sidekick Dr.John Watson(Jude Law).

This movie has some of the best action & chase sequences in the history of action movies. The moviegoer is literally on the edge his/her seat in anticipation of what's going to happen next. Thank god, this movie wasn't in 3D. It was mind blowing on it's own & 3D would have ruined this movie. I must say, that it's much better than the first movie. Robert Downey Jr. is outstanding as detective Sherlock Holmes. No one else could have pulled off the role of Holmes, in the brilliant manner that he did. Jude Law is excellent as Watson, Holmes' trusted friend & sidekick. Downey Jr. & Law share great chemistry. Together, they create magic on screen! Noomi Rapace is effective as Madame Simza Heron. Professor Moriarty is a brilliant villain. Jared Harris has done an impressive job. I really wish that Rachel McAdams had more screen time. I really miss Irene Adler in this movie. Stephen Fry is hilarious as Mycroft Holmes. The ending, will simply take your breath away! So, I would like to conclude by saying, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is worth a watch.

Same steampunkish perspective of books that were nothing like the sort,"If you have seen the first installment of the franchise, you come with certain expectations. Well, those expectations are met in full, as A Game of Shadows has the same feel as the first film. Now, however, people cannot nag that this is supposed to be a prequel to Doyle's books and thus the youthful superhero stuff is not utter tosh, but some sort of smart reimagining. No, it is not. It's just special effects poured generously on a transparent thin copy of the original stories. Sherlock Holmes is extremely brilliant, but he doesn't even explain much what his deductions are. He barely has the time, since he is in gun fights and explosions half the movie.The only reason I did not fail the film is the presence of Jared Harris, who we see more and more often in American productions such as Fringe or Mad Men and he is great in all of them. As things stand, I really wish they would resurrect Moriarty in the third part, rather than replace Harris with some nondescript villain.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
this is not a sherlock Holmes movie,"this is an OK movie for goof ball action. it even might be a bit intelligent. some mega critics said that its inevitable that Sherlock should be modernized with action. i disagree. we have Indiana Jones, star wars, aliens etc of action that fits its ORIGINAL story line. would anyone love an Indiana Jones movie where he played in the park with his young son, a nice feel good family movie? they might but not if you called it an Indiana Jones movie, he is an action hero. super man needs to fly, the hulk needs to rage, Sherlock Holmes needs to solve mysteries. were we given any clues so we could play along? did Watson try to solve the clues on his own and always get them wrong? well, i don't remember much of that.go ahead and make your action movies full of explosions, fights and the end of the world. when done with some smarts and common sense, they are great. i love them.but when it comes to being Sherlock Holmes, stay with Arthur Conan Doyle character. he was original and deserves the credit for creating this character by leaving him the way he was born.a few have said that this is what the new movie should be, that he has evolved. get a life please, there are a great many smart and intelligent movies made in the mystery genre that are very successful. so why mess with that formula? why? greed, the ignorant masses don't care and like being dumbed down by exploitation of action while smarter movies don't make as much money. having a familiar BIG character, BIG stars and BIG action makes BIG money. even if its not fair to the history.well, its not like Hollywood from what ever country they film in cares about history. its one of Hollywood's biggest flaw. they can make good movies by messing with history, but haven't even better movies been made by not messing with it? even if Sherlock is fictional, messing with his character is like making sparkling good guy vampires.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great Performances, great writing, and a better story make this worth the watch","In 2009 Sherlock Holmes became a break out hit making over half a billion dollars and successfully brought the brand into the mainstream blockbuster film community making both Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson both known to the average film goer and relevant to modern cinema. While the movie's story and concept themselves didn't boast anything new or above average, the movie did boast lightning in a bottle chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as the leads as well as the very cool and stylized take on late 19th century England from director Guy Ritchie. Because of the chemistry and the style Sherlock Holmes was able to be successful with audiences as well as critics which now brings us to the inevitable sequel A Game of Shadows. While Shadows doesn't have as much to prove as its predecessor it certainly had a whole new set of problems to deal with; the biggest being just another sequel that tries so hard to recapture the original, but ultimately failing like so many other sequels out there.

The overdose of comic relief ruins the entire movie,"I did not have high hopes for this movie. Knowing that the previous film was an average B movie, no more is expected from this flick.This whole movie is packed with idiotic comic relief and totally improbable action sequences. And this Sherlock character, my God is he ever annoying! He cannot open his garbage mouth without saying a stupid joke or mock his partner, even in a totally inappropriate situation where their life is hanging in the balance.This movie is full of clichés and cheese that I found myself at many times looking at my watch and wondering when this movie would end, and I also took a brief 2 minutes nap! Yup.Anyways, I won't elaborate more on this film. All you need to know is that it's a ridiculous and exaggerated action-comedy. But if you are the kind to enjoy an action packed film with every line coming out of the actors' mouth is a joke, then this movie is for you! If you however enjoy a smart and coherent movie, this film will bore you. Quite honestly, the only reason I went to see this film was to see The Dark Knight Rises' trailer in theatre, well at least that was worth my while.Anyhow, this film is not total crap, though. I give it a 6/10. A 7,7/10 rating as of today is really beyond me. At most this movie should have a 7/10 at best....if only it wasn't plagued with comic relief.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brillliant,"I enjoyed this movie. I found it to be unpredictable, always being on the edge of your chair. It had a great deal of action, and hand to hand combat compared to the previous film. The plot of the film was very complex. The best word to describe the movies' plot is ""clever"". This is the only fault I find due to the lack of knowledge a viewer may have if he/she hasn't viewed the previous film. This movie was also filled with a great deal of humor; which I also found to be ""clever humor"". The performance of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law was impeccable, realistic, and both had great chemistry when portraying their roles as such close friends. Noomi Rapace, who portrayed a Gypsy woman, had an great performance as well. The sinister professor and villain in this movie is portrayed by Jared Harris, who in my opinion, made his character very believable and one of the greatest acts in the entire film. What I liked most is the element of surprise this movie carried, constantly making theories of the end but being astonished by the real final outcome. The ending of the movie was the perfect icing on the cake. I left the theater thinking to myself ""absolutely brilliant"". All in all, this movie was one of the greatest mystery films I have ever seen. There was never a dual moment and it kept the wheels of my mind constantly turning.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Doyleian isn't even a word but it should be.,"First and foremost what sets Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movies above many other previous attempts to adapt the detective to the silver screen is the fact that it changes enough and keep enough the same to appeal both to hardcore Sherlock Holmes fans as well as the sensibilities of modern action movie viewing audiences. One of the main things that stands out is that instead of Watson being portrayed as the clueless buffoon and comic relief many other movies have made him into the Ritchie Watson is much closer to the original character and it benefits the films greatly. The mix of Doyleian detective drama and Guy Ritchie style action and bravado works far better in A Game of Shadows than it did in the first movie. The Chemistry between Law and Downey is fantastic and needless to say neither of them phones it in when it comes to the acting. Whereas the plot of the first movie was rather dull and forgettable with only the chemistry and skill of the actors saving the movie from being ""bad"" the second movies plot, although not exactly a masterpiece, is a lot more interesting and engaging. Mostly because unlike with the first movie I can actually remember what happened.In what seems like the best casting decision in the history of film making this movie has Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes and if that isn't enough for you to want to see it then you probably have some sort of brain dysfunction and should contact your doctor as soon as possible.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The second outing with Holmes and Watson is just as fun and action packed as it's predecessor. Terrific entertainment!,"Guy Richie's modern take on Sherlock Holmes for me has been interesting and refreshingly different. The first film I wasn't sure what to expect but it bought out a terrific comedy duo between Holmes (Robert Downey Junior) and Watson (Jude Law)thanks to a witty script, excellent acting and exciting action.Their second promises more of the same and delivers. Coming up against Holmes ultimate Nemesis Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). They suspect him of dozens of killings across Europe in a plot to start a world war as he is into arms manufacturing. They are joined by Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace) from the Swedish version of the excellent Millienium Trilogy films and come into contact with Holmes brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry). The story is quite predictable as we know who the villain is from the outset unlike the first one, which did have more of a mystery. The women of course like the first outing are criminally underused, though Noomi Rapace gives a great performance and makes the most impact of the limited female characters on screen. Another criticism is even though Jared Harris gives a good performance as Moriarty, he just wasn't as menacing or have as a sly demeanour as Mark Strong who played Lord Blackwell.However I loved everything else though the film did start off a bit slow, once it got going it was at it's best. Robert Downey Junior and Jude Law give excellent performances once again, which are just so much fun to watch, particularly Downey Junior who just makes the role of Holmes seem so effortless to carry out, it's almost bewildering in it's simplicity of his portrayal. Of course what makes this comedy duo so fantastic is that script, which is just as wise-cracking and witty as the first one and though some of the comedy is quite silly, it is meant to be in a funny and goofy way as this whole movie just has the air of not taking itself seriously, which made it a real delight to watch. Special mention must also go to Stephen Fry as Mycroft though in a cameo appearance he makes the most of in a hilarious and cracking performance.Guy Richie's directing is equally exquisite with wonderful scenery and editing of slow-motion during the action sequences, which were choreographed to the highest quality, with plenty of excitement attached. The musical score is also wonderful. Though I did have a few gripes with the film (not every movie is perfect, even the ten of out ten movies). I loved this from start to finish. This is one movie and franchise that knows how to have a heck of a fun time and lets it audience experience the same feeling. Let's have a third one please!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The movement of the camera is well adapted to the dynamics of the scenes with the help of cuts and viewpoints.The plot is directly connected to that of the first part and the dramaturgy is built up coherently and excitingly. There is no further development of the characters, but this is not necessary because of the first part. The overall construct of the characters used is built up consistently. The film finds a good balance between humorous and serious scenes.

Lipstick in the gun cartridge,"You probably know already that this is modeled after The Final Problem. Doyle's design with that was a heroic end to Holmes so he could go back to more literary aspirations. Of course the public wouldn't have any of it, so the series went on. But here's the thing. Doyle came up with a convincing account of Holmes escape; he never left the cliff. The film's solution in keeping with everything else is daft movie logic. Everything else from Doyle's story has been amped to blockbuster scale, Moriarty is in control of entire nations, Holmes has to save Europe from war on a cataclysmic scope.Logic is not strictly the point of course, something else is, which brings us to the titular game. This is the one ambitious bit.Now Sherlock Holmes is no ordinary detective, by this point he's vested in the public mind with practically superhero powers. What Doyle had in mind however was simply expert boxer and a master in logic, meaning the ability to see structures of causation instead of trifle detail. The whole point extending to the writing endeavor itself was structured chaos, a chain of events that appears chaotic to the remote viewer but in fact had been plotted that way by a writer in full control. The plot only made sense when he told it in the end, for example the miraculous escape at Reichenbach, not so miraculous upon hearing about it (in the original).In the film this is expertly rendered as Holmes being able to know the plot in advance, then reality resumes as envisioned. But this is Moriarty's plot on a larger level, where the same rules of structured chaos apply - people on the streets experience acts of random anarchy but we know it is all being scripted and controlled by Moriarty. So the arch is that Holmes will have to rise to the level where authorship of the world is decided and there best the existing writer in storytelling wit.(If you want more Doyle reference about this, an early description of Holmes in Scarlet is that he knows nothing about philosophy or politics but an immense deal about crime fiction. This is how Holmes solves cases, the same way writers plot them. This conceit is key in detective fiction, a writer's fiction. Another famous example? Dashiel Hammett, Pinkerton agent turned detective writer.)This means that Holmes can no longer be in the same room as the plot and really has to trust that he has written characters astute enough to carry out deductions in his place. Watson has learned enough from Holmes to see this part through. Clever.All the threads point towards film noir, including Moriarty as a Dr. Mabuse type controlling from out of sight.",,Anonymous,Mystery

When Gilbert, the famous actor in the U.S. of that time wrote to Conan Doyle asking his permission to use the Sherlock Holmes character in his stage production, and with what limitations, Conan Doyle replied ""Murder him, marry him, do what you like with him"".

Every penny worth it ! once again !!,"After much speculation and expectation, one has to say Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr have together pulled it off once again with a crunchy screenplay and acting with at most ease. With Jude Law and Noomi Rapace bringing justice to their characters, Jared Harris proved to be the perfect foe for a super hero with no super powers. Screenplay was well written with enough wit; adding to the twists and turns unfolding one after the other. Action sequences even though are not breath taking, are loud enough to keep audience glued to their seats and a special mention for two the sequences, One when Holmes salvages Mr and Mrs. Watson and the other when Holmes and Watson run for their lives.Guy Ritchie, deserves all the accolades not just for being the captain of the ship but also for being smart enough to serve all the desserts cold to the audiences. As a screenplay writer Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney have saved the best for the melodrama, Game of Shadows has a stellar last 10 minutes which will not just grab all your attention but will make you forget all the logical flaws you noted or tried to note down during the previous 119 minutes. Robert Downey Jr as cool as ever; with Jude Law trying to match him frame by frame; with Noomi Raplace providing enough support to both of them; with Jared Harris proves to be their perfect demon, Game of shadows proved to be the one to watch out for.1 (Guy Ritchie) + 1 (Robert Downey Jr) + 1 (Jude Law) + 1 (Jared Harris) + 1 (Screenplay) + 1 (Wit and Fun) + 1 (Gladstone) + 1 (BGM) + 1 (Holmes - Moriarty Chess play) = 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Some major no nos; worth a low investment watch,"A Game of Shadows tries very hard to be Mission Impossible but with eccentric characters and 200 years ago.It's unfortunate; they attempt to replace Irene Adler with Moriarty as a foil for Holmes. It makes for an interesting enough plot but loses some of the fun of the original: instead taking itself a bit too seriously.The effects are as stunning as any modern movie but rely heavily on slow motion ""predictive"" shots. The slow-motion shots provide an interesting walk-through of Holmes mind, and A Game of Shadows successfully breaks its formula by adding Moriarty into Holmes' mind. This really is pretty cool. A Game of Shadows unfortunately has issues when it adds unnecessary slow-motion shots to each action scene; they unnecessarily draw out scenes to the detriment of shot quality.There was one nudity scene where even the scene characters can't unsee things they never wanted to see, and neither can we.The acting itself works; they got the mannerisms true to expectations.The plot kind of just rationally happens and some elements fail to suspend belief: urban disguises are absurd and only worked by artificially blurring the background.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The most fun I've had all year. Even a simple game of chess becomes enough to put you on the edge.,"In case you don't already know my thoughts on the first Sherlock Holmes, I loved it. I loved its fresh take on the literary detective, I loved how Guy Ritchie's directorial flourishes fit wonderfully with the mind of Sherlock, I loved the slick action and fantastic production values, and I loved the wonderful chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Bigger, but not quite better than the first film, A Game of Shadows features everything I liked and disliked about feature one, and it's about as good a December blockbuster as you can get.Like the first film, the film is light on plot, occasionally uneven, and a tad more confusing if you're not paying full attention. However, Ritchie continues to show what a great fit his stylistics are for this movie, and the action, which is perfectly paced, staged, and choreographed, continues to thrill and astonish. The friendship between Holmes and Watson continues to set the screen ablaze, but begins to play things up more. Producer Joel Silver once said that Downey and Law's chemistry had this ""Butch and Sundance"" quality to it, and he was right. Their chemistry is the main attraction, absolutely electrifying, surprisingly emotional, and often quite funny, occasionally hysterically so.Though, with the exception of the film's villain, the supporting cast isn't quite as strong. Jared Harris couldn't have been anymore brilliantly cast as Professor Moriarty, but Sim, the film's leading lady, isn't very much of an improvement over Irene Adler, even if Noomi Rapace has a bit more to chew on than Rachel McAdams did. Still, the film is beautifully designed. Sarah Greenwood's stylish production design is gorgeous, Phillippe Rousselot's cinematography is ever so flowing, the costumes are beautifully realized by Jenny Beavan (who, in my opinion, provided the best costumes of any film in 2009 for the first Sherlock Holmes), and Hans Zimmer raises the pulse and fun with his exciting musical score.Prognosis: A light, refreshing piece of popcorn entertainment. Probably the most fun I've had with any 2011 movie. When even a simple game of chess is enough to put you on the edge, you know you're in for a good time.*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Action Film - Particularly for Holmes' Fans,"If you are into action films, you will love the latest film about our favorite detective. Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. Watson try to kill their foe, Professor Moriarty because Holmes believes he is linked to a number of recent crimes. They discover that Moriarty invests in companies in England owning cotton and other goods. He plans to start a war so that there will be a high demand for the goods, so he can make a fortune. Will Holmes succeed in preventing this war?The cinematography of the movie is impressive. Several action scenes are filmed in slow motion, making it more thrilling. However, the lighting of the movie is gloomy and, for me doesn't really match the tone of the movie since it is a combination of action and adventure with a dash of comedy.The storyline of the movie doesn't quite work for me either. Although the film is like ""Mission Impossible"" in the 19th century, it's a bit difficult to hear what the characters are saying since they have a British accent, and the plot gets confusing at times. I did enjoy the ending though. It is interesting watching the director's comparison of the face-off between Holmes and Professor Moriarty to a chess game.I recommend this film to teens 13 and up, especially to fans of Sherlock Holmes.

Sherlock Holmes is back!,"¨Slow and steady wins the race. ¨How can you go wrong with a movie involving one of the best literary detective characters ever?

Downey Jr. is just a great actor with a perfect sense of comedic timing. Sherlock Holmes isn't a great movie, but it's really a lot of fun. It has plenty of action scenes, interesting characters, and a lot of funny moments. Add Guy Ritchie to the mix and you have the perfect popcorn flick. Sherlock Holmes may not be Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, but it does live up to the original film. This sequel is perhaps a little lighter and easier to follow which allows for a better pace, but it also is much simpler and the plot pretty plain. What makes this movie stand out from other ordinary action films are the actors and the action scenes. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have great chemistry together and they share a lot of funny scenes. Jared Harris provided a decent villain who could compete alongside Holmes with his intelligence. Noomi Rapace who really shined in the Swedish Millennium trilogy, doesn't really stand out in this movie and doesn't do much since she isn't given an interesting character. I think she is misused here and it's too bad because she is really a talented actress. The screenplay written by Michele and Kieran Mulroney is pretty solid. A Game of Shadows is a decent sequel and is a fun movie, but it does have several flaws nonetheless.We are back in 1891 London right where the first film left us. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) believes that Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) is responsible for a series of bombings across Europe that is threatening world peace. No one else seems to suspect Moriarty is involved and the press believes a group of anarchists are responsible for the explosions so Holmes decides to investigate on his own. Moriarty isn't pleased to find out Holmes has been disrupting some of his plans. Irene (Rachel McAdams) continues to work for Moriarty delivering certain packages for people who sometimes end up dead, but Holmes gets in the way a couple of times. Meanwhile, Watson (Jude Law) is back visiting Holmes the day before his wedding expecting to celebrate his bachelor's party, but Holmes has other plans. He has intercepted a message from Irene for a gypsy named Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace) and wants to find out what the Professor might be planning. At the bar Holmes saves Heron's life after discovering that Moriarty wants her dead since her brother who works for him has been sending some messages to his sister. Watson doesn't get the bachelor party he was expecting, but he makes it to the wedding the next morning. The honeymoon will also be interrupted after Moriarty threatens Watson and his wife, so Holmes decides it's time to save his best friend by throwing Watson's wife (Kelly Reilly) off the train and having her rescued by his brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry) while he and the doctor try to stop the Professor from beginning a World War.Like the first film, Sherlock Holmes is very grayish, since that is probably what London looked like during 1891, although this time we get to travel all over Europe as Holmes chases Moriarty from one place to another. The plot is way more simplistic than the first film, but the action sequences are very similar. Ritchie always includes these sort of really fast paces action scenes with a lot of editing (which I'm not a really huge fan of since sometimes it's hard to follow what's going on with so much cutting and pasting. There are also some slow motion scenes which are sort of cool looking, but also a bit distracting. I think the best part of the series is the performances from Downey Jr. and Jude Law. This is what makes the franchise work and makes for an entertaining film. The action mixed with the comedy works really well and makes this an enjoyable movie experience. A Game of Shadows isn't one of the best movies of the years, and it isn't very memorable either, but it was a lot of fun and much better than other action films. It is very similar to the first film so if you enjoyed that one you will definitely like this sequel, and if you didn't than I don't think you will really be interested in seeing this because it follows pretty much the same design. The costume design in this movie is also pretty good, and it was fun to see Robert wearing all sorts of costumes throughout the film. A Game of Shadows is fun and you won't be disappointed.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Step Down from Perfection,"I spent my childhood watching old Sherlock Holmes movies with my dad and trying to convince the other kids on the playground to pretend to be Dr. Watson so I could play Sherlock. Needless to say, when Guy Ritchie attempted to re-brand Holmes and Watson as action heroes in 2009, a move that caused much gnashing of teeth from others, I went into the theater with high expectations. They were exceeded. I loved everything about that movie, every performance, every shot, every line of dialogue, and every note of Hans Zimmer's score. It was perfect.The sequel, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is a pretty good movie, but it can't beat perfection.What I feared would be missing going in, and what indeed was missing, was the sense of the unknown. Would Sherlock Holmes work as an action movie? It did, and still kind of does, and still was surprisingly faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's source material. How would Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law do as Holmes and Watson? They were, and still are, the freshest take on the characters since Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. How would Guy Ritchie do helming a big-budget blockbuster? The style from his gritty crime films translated well into the epic scale, though in the sequel there's more style than substance.But the most crucial surprises came from the plot. It was an original story that created a new enemy for Holmes. Lord Blackwood, played chillingly by Mark Strong, was a crafty adversary who may or may not have had supernatural powers. Here he is replaced by Holmes' most conventional enemy, Professor Moriarty, played by Jared Harris, and his right-hand man, played by Paul Anderson. I won't name him here, because only hardcore fans of Doyle's canon will appreciate it, and for them it would be a spoiler. As the title implies, the focus of the film is a ""game"" of cat and mouse between Holmes and the Professor. While it's riveting to watch, the lack of a clearly defined mystery like in the previous film makes it harder for the audience to play along.The main flaws lie with the script. ""Game of Shadows"" ditches the first film's stable of writers (including Lionel Wigram, who spearheaded production of the previous film and has now been reduced to a producer credit) in favor of Michele and Kieran Mulroney, known for a couple of Indie comedies. While the previous film had some quirky comedy, the new script ratchets it up to sometimes annoying levels. (A pro-longed ""breakfast"" analogy during a fight sequence is especially groan- inducing.) Also, the movie goes even further into action movie territory than the last effort, favoring chase scenes and explosions over a plot actually worthy of the great detective, with a story that seems made for James Bond rather than Sherlock Holmes. The movie also borrows more generously from Doyle's stories, so while die-hard Sherlock fans will grin at the many references, they'll also probably be able to see what's coming before Holmes and Watson do.It's obvious Warner Bros. took more interest in the sequel than the prequel. While this means a welcome bigger budget, apparent in more exotic locations and bigger (and more frequent) pyrotechnics, it also means more studio meddling, possibly evident in the heavy recycling of the tricks Guy Ritchie used in the last movie. I'm sure, if left alone, Guy Ritchie could have created a sequel just as fresh and interesting as the prequel. Even Hans Zimmer's score, while still good, consists mainly of recycled cues from his other Sherlock score.The saving grace is the great cast and their chemistry with each other. Downey Jr. and Law play off each other just as well as last time. Stephen Fry plays Sherlock's older brother Mycroft, another character exported from Doyle's canon. He and Sherlock call each other by the pet names ""Mycey"" and ""Sherlie"" respectively, which is not from the canon, but feels right, and Fry even looks like the Sidney Paget illustrations from the canon. His share of the comic relief is the wittiest. Sadly, Eddie Marsan's Inspector Lestrade is reduced to a cameo, at best.But the best scenes are between Holmes and his nemesis. Rather than following the clichés that come with most portrayals of Moriarty, ""Game of Shadows"" takes the Professor back to his roots as a respected math scholar who leads a double life as a crime lord. Jared Harris is perfectly cast in the role, and the climactic scene between Downey Jr. and Harris is spine-tingling good and alone worth the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An excessive but fun sequel,"t has some clichés and cheap turns, and I won't even speak of the ending - but it's still a well crafted action movie. I have quite the taste for Guy Ritchie, and even though he revels in excessive slow motion it's impressive at the same time as it's just a bit too much.Robert Downey jr. seems to have found a role he really loves playing and he's a perfect fit. The role allows him to bolter in absurdities, he's an absolute delight to watch throughout and he's in no way afraid to go the extra mile. Jude Law is also quite fitting, and seeing how I got used to him in the first movie I'm no longer looking for Nigel Bruce whenever someone calls out for ""Dr. Watson"".On the other side of the scale Noomi Rapace has next to no presence, nor has the main villain Professor Moriarty. Two dull and easily forgettable roles, in Noomi's case it's OK, has she is hardly needed, but I would have wished for a more compelling villain.It takes far more time for character development than expected, and unlike many of it's kin it does relay on a script rather than constant action and explosions. Though the Downey jr. reincarnation of Holmes is clearly more of an action hero, and the mystery has been replaced with saving the world(at least in a sense) the movie does know it's place and knows not to throw away great character dynamics - and though the action scenes are excessive and extravagant beyond belief it does set a more adventure-esque mood not too unlike those of previous Sherlock Holmes interpretations.The movie contains a lot of quality humor, often playing on the semi-homoerotic undertones we are so familiar with in regard to Sherlock Holmes. Sometimes it's just too hard to buy into it all, and as stated some of it is just too much - but it's a constant riot and Domney really keeps it together. Certainly met my expectations, if not exceeding them.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Disjointed, lousy sequel","Let me get this out of the way first: I loved the first film. In fact, for this one I had high hopes especially since we were finally dealing with Moriarty.This film severely disappointed me. The story was disjointed, and there was no clear direction of that story until the very end. They used their iconic cinematography, wild action scenes, and silly humour to carry the film nowhere to the point that both my friend and I were actually bored of it. And that, unfortunately killed the ending for us during which we did not care at all for the characters nor for what kind of ending the film carried. I never read any original Sherlock stories, but I found that Robert's portrayal, though well acted, was excessively ""OCD"" and ""insane"" - far more than the first film.I'll be honest - I far more enjoyed Brent Spiner and his co-star portraying these characters on Star Trek the Next Generation than this film.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Even better than the first,"The cinematic reinvention of the English sleuth in 2009 was such a success that it was clear we had a new franchise in the making and so two years later the old team are back for a second outing with the same leading actors – the brilliant Robert Downey Jr as the eponymous detective and engaging Jude Law as his long-suffering companion in a duo with evident chemistry – plus the same director (Guy Ritchie) and the same musician (Hans Zimmer).Sequels so often disappoint compared to the original, but ""A Game Of Shadows"" is even more confident and fun. This may not be high art but, in terms of sheer entertainment, this is almost as good as it gets. The threat could hardly be larger - the instigation of a first world war – and, as Professor Moriaty, Jared Harris supplies a splendid villain, while Stephen Fry is a delight as Holmes' older brother. The first movie was weak on women and here Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly have little to do, but at least Noomi Rapace (""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"") looks the part as an exotic if sullen gypsy.In truth, except for all the deduction from detail, period settings in 1891, and wry humour, this adventure is so frenetic, with one action sequence after another and Ritchie's trademark rapid cutting alternating with slow-motion shots, that this could almost be a Jason Bourne or Mission Impossible movie. But, heh, who\s complaining? Certainly not me.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Keep Calm and Carry On, Watson","After a good, solid first outing by Guy Ritchie featuring excellent cut-and-thrust chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law, and a suitably mysterious and involving plot, I was unsure what to expect from the sequel, but there is no dip in form here, 'A Game of Shadows' is excellent, its canvas is the whole of Europe, Moriarty is on the move and the game is afoot! The action is well-paced, Holmes and Watson's relationship is under strain and darkness and daring abound as a spate of bombings shakes Europe.The introduction of Stephen Fry is inspired; he provides an excellent second foil for Downey Jr. and also a degree of gravitas that was missing before. Noomi Rapace is superbly cast, a pity she was not given more to do, but excellent to see her in a big circulation movie, hopefully more to come. The stand-out performance however is Jared Harris, oh how different from his meek and mild-mannered role as Lane Pryce in 'Mad Men', his Moriarty is superb; not a blustering caricature of evil, thank goodness, but the best kind of villain, a super-intelligent man of strong desires and no morality. The scenes that he shares with Holmes are riveting, none more so than the last one, which is superb cinema.To conclude, despite the very tacky strap line 'A Game of Shadows' IS bigger, it IS better and it IS funnier, but not at the expense of an excellent Gothic action thriller with a tremendous denouement.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A great sequel, not as well-written as the first one, a bit more action-focused than detective centric.","For most of the film, it feels like Guy Ritchie is just doing the slow-motion, hyper-edited mashup close-ups of guns loading and firing for his own sake. There's a bit more style than substance with this film as opposed to the first, probably because of the increased budget. However, the focus on style does pay off during the epic hyper slow-motion action sequence during the third act. What I love is that these films were able to compose their own visual identity, something that we barely see today.It's a shame Rachel McAdams is barely in this one, as she was one of the best characters in the first film, and had great chemistry with RDJ. Every character is charismatic and engaging when on screen, the sets are beautiful and alive, the costumes are beautifully designed and the set pieces are well orchestrated.The screenplay is much weaker this time around, with the story getting too diluted by the middle to the point where I felt a bit disengaged honestly. But the dynamic between Sherlock and Professor Moriarty made up for it.Both films are highly enjoyable and rewatchable, a perfect duology whenever you want something really fun to watch, that is really well crafted at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good time that beats up the original (in slow motion),"I want to start off by explaining why I only gave this movie a 7. I enjoyed it thoroughly and laughed out loud several times (much more than I did the first Sherlock Holmes movie). That being said, there were a few scenes that seem unnecessary are somewhat drawn out. These are the type when you hear the audience let out an audible yawn. I won't give them away, but you will see what I mean if you watch the movie. However, this does not make the movie un-enjoyable, just be aware that it is fairly long and there are parts when you will feel the length.After saying all that, I must give it the credit it deserves as well. The movie is clever and entertaining. You will laugh at several parts if you have a sense of humor. I'm happy I watched it in the theater and I left feeling that the ending was appropriate and gave me the emotional payoff I craved. Robert Downey does an exceptional job and really carries the movie the majority of the time. Watch it, enjoy it, but be prepared for a long ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The story has an exciting plot with mystery and extreme information that makes you question what the human brain is capable of.

An avid Sherlockian LIKES it,"I think I've collected every radio, every film version of Holmes that there is... Wotner, Ronald Howard, even Stewart Granger's TV movie.I have to admit I was less than satisfied with the first film. I found Downey's performance somewhat off-putting for the same reason that I found Jeremy Brett's earlier episodes a little challenging - too frenetic. I also found the style difficult. It took getting accustomed to the flashbacks and the ""thought"" segments... and rapid-fire video work.The first film also had an implausible ending. However, this film, despite some faux-pas and inconsistencies, which I feel were done knowingly... to serve a film that was sort of ""in-it-for-the-fun"" rather than sticking to the canon or to history. It's good melodrama... in the way that the extreme Victorian stage melodramas could be so over-the-top as to be actually good fun.Therefore, I can overlook things that were ahead of 1891. I must admit that the look of the period was right on. The ladies dresses were spot on for ca 1890, rather than a more 1900 look, which is a very easy error.I'm also willing to allow Downey the deviation from Canon. Watson wrote in the Canon that Holmes was fastidious in his appearance, and cat-like.... tho' Holmes was not neat otherwise. Downey plays him consistently Bohemian. There is leeway... Doyle never really allowed us to see that ""other"" side of Holmes' life... that mysterious world of opium dens, Bow Street Runners, going undercover, disguises, boxing, fencing, etc. It is this secret side to Holmes' life that recent versions have made hay from.What I actually really liked about this one was the foreshadowing of WW1... the munitions firms, anarchists, revolutionaries, sabre rattling. All of that was happening in the 1890s, but Queen Victoria and then Edward VII, kept the lid on by the fact that they were the senior members of a vast European Royal Family. The war waited until 4 years after Edward's death in 1910.Moriarity's machinations were in keeping with the Canon.... and with real rumors that were circulating at the time... that the munitions barons, etc were exacerbating problems and, in fact, promoting war.I find it an interesting pairing that ""War Horse"" was released at the same time... Despite their extreme differences... I would strongly urge people to see both films... within days of each other.Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows lays a not too unreal groundwork, while War Horse will show the absolute futility of it all... the decimating of a generation of young men.... For what? All that WW1 really did was sell armaments and munitions.. and lay the groundwork for WW2, which laid the groundwork for the EuroZone... and today's problems.The linkages in Sherlock's extreme melodramatic fiction to the realistic War Horse... to our present problems is somewhat intriguing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Meet the new great super hero of the last century,"The first Sherlock Holmes not only took off Madonna's shadow over Ritchie's works but also reinforced the idea that troubled icons such as Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law and Guy Ritchie himself still ruling the box office.Putting that aside, the first Sherlock Holmes was a breath of fresh air for a character that had become something so obsolete as James Bond over the years. Like Daniel Craig renewed the world's most beloved spy, Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr. renewed the world's most beloved detective.Fans of the books liked Ritchie's new approach, although many still questioning the presence and importance of some facts and characters like Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) in the first installment, since that character is mentioned in only one story. The presence of Rachel McAdams as Irene also brought a different dimension to the first movie because she was a great partner and, as Sherlock mentions in the story, she is ""the woman"" and I could not hide my disappointment when I noticed that her presence in The Game Of Shadows would not only be important, but also brief... very brief.Instead of Rachel McAdams, now there is Noomi Rapace performing gypsy Simza Heron, a character that appears and disappears and no one even notice that during the movie. If some fans say that the presence of Rachel in the first movie was useless, now they have reasons enough to do the same with Rapace's character. Of many films I've seen lately I haven't watch any that features a so useless character that has nothing to contribute for the development as happens with Sim Heron.The name of Noomi Rapace in the credits is just an indirect way to promote and link her name to David Fincher's remake of the first part of the Millennium Trilogy. That's so that way that here in Brazil both movie posters of Game Of Shadows and the remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo are arranged and disposed in hall theaters intentionally.The Game Of Shadows is a great action movie. The slow motion scenes and the scenes representing Sherlock's logical reasonings and his practical side were maintained and improved and for me those are the best scenes throughout the film together with its linear plot and great story development. But I think that some exaggerations turned Sherlock Holmes more like a new great political incorrect superhero than just only a clever detective.Many people loves the eccentric figure of Downey Jr. and his cynical way of acting, but I personally don't like his constant habit of always acting like everything was a big circus. Jude Law was great as always and Jared Harris as Moriarty really is the great villain that you should never met.Also happened in this movie what happened with Soderbergh's Ocean's 12, a film filled with improvised dialogs and full of inside jokes between a bunch of friends.But despite all of that the film flows as it should, the plot development is linear and holds our attention, keeping what it promises during its 129 minutes.And Guy Ritchie proved that he could stop being a director of cult action movies to become an excellent blockbuster director without losing his own style.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the worst films ever made,"I really can't see what people saw in this. I was told that it was better than the last one, but all I saw was a confused mess that made no sense whatsoever. Apart from Jared Harris the acting was universally atrocious. Even the normally reliable Robert Downey Jr was bad. For once I agree with the newspaper reviews. This was definitely NOT Sherlock Holmes. The relationship between Holmes and Watson was played mainly for laughs and was strained to breaking point. If you're going to make a film a Holmes you should make sure the characters are true to the original source. Conan Doyle's Holmes and Watson were three-dimensional characters, so much so that some Americans think they were actually real people - the characters in this film were one-dimensional at best. The set pieces were overlong and boring. I was so bored I actually fell asleep for a few minutes (the only other film I fell asleep in was Attack of the Clones). If you want to watch a much more thoughtful and superior version try watching the second series of the BBCs Sherlock (which covers some of the same ground). All in all a big steaming dog turd of a film.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Stuff,"Thoroughly enjoyed it. Much better than the first film. Downey Junior plays a much more eccentric Holmes to good effect. His play-off's with Law are good with some nice comical touches. Jared Harris is a great addition to the cast, playing the inscrutable Moriarty with the right amount of menace & intelligence without going anywhere near pantomime territory. Paul Anderson is good as Moriarty's chief sidekick but both the female leads are somewhat pointless and whilst there's nothing wrong with the acting from Rapace & Reilly they are pretty superfluous in the grand scheme of things.Ah, the Stephen Fry character, Mycroft Holmes, is - well, in my opinion, it just about works, it certainly works better in the first half of the film than in the second, although there is a good comedic scene with Kelly Reilly later in the film. I think Fry could be utilised better in the next episode.The action scenes are great as is the cinematography.The main irritant I have with the film, and it's been mentioned in other reviews, is the use of the slow-mo in all the action scenes. It's simply used too much to be truly effective, it works in the scene when running through the woods but elsewhere it's overdone, something Ritchie needs to curb in the next episode.All in all a good attempt but could do better",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""He played the game for the game's own sake""","'He played the game for the game's own sake' would be a perfect description of Robert Downey Jr's take on Sherlock Holmes. He's matter of factly slick, inadvertently cool and cheekily eccentric not to mention a king of one liners. He returns to deliver superbly in this sequel to Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' in an enthralling cat and mouse game between prodigies involving a clash between him and Sherlock Holmes' classical, scheming nemesis, Professor James Moriarty played by Jared Harris.Ritchie has directed a complementary film where everything and everyone seems to complement everything and everyone else whether the acting, dialogue, score or the sets. The plot is well crafted if not masterful but undoubtedly vastly entertaining. The usage of flashback storytelling, as seen in the prequel to this film, gives many enigmas in the movie a sense of finality; you can't help but be in awe of the manner of storytelling presented to you not to mention the filming style through which the narrative is presented. Don't be put off by the slow, almost uneventful start, it is certainly made worth your while very quickly. Occasionally, it can be hard to keep up, such is the pace with which events transpire, it does lose you at junctures but fear not, only temporarily.This light hearted iteration of a mystery thriller is absorbing and compelling, much like its predecessor and we have to attribute it to the director and the acting talent in the film that the light hearted tone hasn't become slapstick as much as a new spin on the mystery and intrigue associated with Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes.Robert Downey Jr. may yet again have been the star of the show but it's the chemistry between his Sherlock and Jude Law's Watson that really shines. Their dialogue interchanged is so fluid and natural not to mention damned entertaining.Everyone's holding out for the climax though and it probably wasn't as fantastically revealing and ingenious as the first movie, but was well built up nonetheless.

Not as good as the original,"Sherlock Holmes is back along with the original cast. While there's much to enjoy about this film, it wasn't as good as the original. It felt as if they were trying too hard to equal or better the first film. The film features even more witty dialogue than its predecessor, and more frequent as well. (Wow, that's a LOT of dialogue!). A significant amount of time is wasted on trivial moments, hence the film feels much longer than the already long running time.Guy Richie is back in the director's chair, yet the film is not nearly as visually stunning as the original. Nor is is nearly as masterful either. And not as interesting a plot either with conveniences left, right and center that diminishes all credibility. The humor at times felt forced and unnecessary. It even felt as if the actors had a difficult time reprising their roles.The scene at around the halfway mark where the characters escape is INCREDIBLE!!! This scene features some of the most amazing photography and visuals I've seen in a long time. Its a pity Richie did not utilize this style and effects throughout the movie. Its as if he put all his time and effort into this one scene and it was indeed truly awesome!As for the film itself, yes, it is a well made film, but I'd much rather watch the first film a few times over than give this one a second viewing.

"Not the best of Holmes, but a great action movie","After seeing the trailers of the original Sherlock Holmes, it was with much trepidation that I watched the film. Holmes is supposed to be an intelligent man, extremely refined and gentlemanly, with an air of dismissive irreverence towards social norms. I wasn't sure if Robert Downey Jr's macho portrayal of Holmes would do justice to the character, nor was I convinced that Guy Ritchie's action-oriented approach would suit the persona of the world's greatest deductive detective. But I was pleasantly surprised by the movie nonetheless, with the intelligence of Holmes deductions a bit of a delight. Needless to say, I was looking forward to the sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.If you're a fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, this movie won't appeal to you too much. If anything, it's even more of an action movie than a game of wits. The clever deductions that are so typical of Mr Holmes have been replaced instead by cinematography of the ilk of that fight scene from the first movie.But if you forget the fact that this is a Sherlock Holmes story, then A Game of Shadows is a very good movie. It's all about Holmes' anticipation and Ritchie's special effects and excellent non-stop action instead. Go in without any bias and you will enjoy this movie.The characters of Holmes and Watson are pretty much par for the course, and Downey Jr and Law pick up from where they left off in the last movie. The character of James Moriarty is weak. While he's portrayed as being an evil genius, I needed to be convinced of his genius more through the plot's narration than through the actions of the character on screen. I have no complaints with the acting of Jared Harris, though, whose expressions and overall acting were top-notch.I must mention Stephen Fry, who plays the role of Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes. Fry is absolutely fantastic in this role, completely captivating the audience in every scene in which he's present—never overacting or underacting.Final Verdict—All put together, this is a good movie, if you can forgive the change in Holmes' powers of deduction and general method of doing things. It's not terribly clever, but it keeps you hooked with quality entertainment for the entire duration.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another bombastic adventure captured at 1000 frames a second...,"I was a huge fan of the first and went in with high hopes for the second. I was not disappointed. As a fan I might add. The big sets are still here, the frenetic chases through the streets, Holmes trade mark pre-fight slow mo sequences and a forest chase that is sure to delight the action hungry audiences.Personally, I absolutely love the new take on Sherlock, dismissing the more traditional Sherlock was for some, a huge disappointment. In fact, I'm more than well aware of the more die hard Sherlock fans who were not happy to see a masculine Holmes barreling his way through dozens of thugs, swinging his fists and kicking his way through doors.Some may also be disappointed by the fact the ""mystery"" didn't really tickle the intellect. I would agree as well. That I do think the detective side of Sherlock didn't really shine. Sure, Sherlocks brilliance was shown every so often, but not in the novel way we would like to see in a brilliant detective. The mental battle between Moriarty and Holmes was great, but could've been better. Maybe given some space to breath in between all the machine guns and explosions.The same cast is there, and the witty banter between Holmes and Watson will often bring a laugh or two. The dialogue still as entertaining as the first. The female plays a more slightly up front role in the film, but it is still a film for the fellas. Needless to say though, Noomi Rapace's role does not disappoint but nor is it stellar. Moriarty is played by Jared Harris who died a fine job in depicting a timeless villain.Really, all you really want to know if it's worth seeing right? Yes. Yes it is. It's an action film. A fun film. Don't go in for paradigm shifts or mind boggling puzzles, but enjoy the visual roller coaster Guy Ritchie has created for us. There are some wonderful camera shots and angles he employs that are sure to delight. Some of the older or more ""stiff upper lipped"" movie goers may be a little disorientated by them however. The phantom shots are great, Guy has a bit of a love for these sequences and they are shot well, giving a wonderful new pace to the action.What you get one you shell out the money for your ticket is a wild romp in the park with Sherlock. Brilliant action sequences and well played characters. Sherlocks brilliance is somewhat overshadowed by the action, but the film still stands as a fun, fast paced movie which should delight many viewers at almost any age.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's about the same amount of enjoyment as the first,"From the people I spoke with that saw this movie. Some liked this sequel better than the first one and others thought the first one was better. I am in between cause there was some aspects I liked about the first one more than this sequel but there are aspects to this one that I liked more than the first one. I enjoyed the constant duel between Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty where they are constantly trying to one up each other. It would have been far more interesting if it showed more of Moriarty's schemes and more about his characteristics. For Holmes's equal he didn't stand out all that much. But some of the best scenes are when Holmes's and Moriarty are on screen at the same time, even there conversations are fun because of the intellectual way they try to one up each other. Anyways Jared Harris who played Moriarty didn't stand out as much as I would have wanted him to be. As for Robert Downey Jr. he is good but sometimes he tries to make Holmes's a bit too kooky. I don't know if he is trying to copy Jack Sparrow but his character threw me off a bit at times and not in a good way either. So yeah I liked how the villain at least had more of a presence this time compared to the first one and felt more ominous. And I also liked the action sequences, they didn't seem all forced and was entertaining to watch because it was well choreographed and cool. Unfortunately the movie just seemed a bit messy at times and all over the place without it being fluid. If the movie flowed a bit better it would have been more engrossing, I can see how they wanted the movie to be fast paced but it just didn't work. As for the plot it's alright, but since it's a Sherlock Holmes movie it would have been better if it has more intellectual and well crafted detective work gone in. But the movie just seemed more convoluted than it should have been despite the simple story when it comes down to it. Overall it's about the same level of enjoyment as the first.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

a nauseating muddy mixed up mess,"The film is a nauseating mixed up muddy mess, from beginning to end. Incredibly gimmicky and shallow. Nearly unintelligible dialogue. The gimmickry present reminds one of how the works of Arthur Conan Doyle should *not* be turned into CSI, Batman, or James Bond. And sadly other recent works within the ""Sherlock franchise"" fall prey to this evil temptation (eg: the BBC's recent Sherlock series). Save your brain. Save your money. Keep your lunch in your stomach. Avoid this film. Instead seek out works with Jeremy Brett. Other portrayals by Robert Downey Jr., even by Benedict Cumbersplatch / Smebersmoch / Hoobersmich / Cumberbatch, are rather akin to shallow harlotry in my view. Mostly unconvinced. Forced. Contrived. Gimmicky. But Jeremy Brett's portrays were near perfect. So search for them instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Everything That Worked in it's Predecessor is Thrown Out and Made More Generic,"I was really excited to see ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"". I highly enjoyed the first film, and with Guy Ritchie returning to direct, and the addition of Jared Harris playing Professor James Moriarty joining the stellar cast, I had little doubt that 'Game of Shadows' would blow me away as much as the first film had. And then the trailer came out, and the doubt started to form. Robert Downey Jr. creepily cross dressing, giant gun fights, and recycled jokes made me worriful that the movie may fall where the first film excelled. Sadly, I was right.Watson has now moved out of 221B Baker Street, and Sherlock has become obsessed with linking evidence to the infinite web of crimes Moriarty is behind. Now, when a single clue reveals itself to Holmes, he embarks on a determined endeavour to take down his arch-nemesis once and for all. It's hard to explain the plot because some of the main plot points happen for no reason, so it's difficult to even write a proper synopsis. Seriously, things happen at random in this movie. Like within the first 5 minutes the most enraging, lame, and downright stupidest move the writers made happens for almost no reason.All main cast members return from the first film. Robert Downey Jr. is back as Sherlock Holmes, and as before, he's great. He is completely into this role and you believe him. What is really great in this movie is Sherlock vs. Moriarty, and this is really where Robert Downey Jr.'s acting in this movie flourishes. He gets really confident and serious, and you're just thinking ""it's going down"".Jude Law is perfect as Watson. I think I prefer Jude Law's Watson to Martin Freeman's Watson. But the two adaptations are set in different time periods, so I think Jude Law is the perfect Watson for the 1800's, and Martin Freeman is the perfect Watson for the 21'st Century. But Jude Law's Watson is perfect with the smart-ass remarks. He is totally Sherlock's backup and he hates it, but he accepts that and he deals with it, and it makes for some great comedy.Jared Harris is good as Moriarty. His first appearance on the screen, you know that he is in control. He's very calm, very smart, and menacing. The only thing I wish had been different about him is the actor. While Jared Harris is pretty good, I really wanted someone younger than or as old as Sherlock. That would be a great parallel for Holmes to deal with, but instead he's like sixty years old. This really sucks because I loved the Moriarty in the first ""Sherlock Holmes"". He was young, skinny, very threatening, and had this seriously scary voice. But now he's just this normal, heavy-set, old guy.The fights in this movie suck. You may remember in the first ""Sherlock Holmes"", a lot of the fighting was hand to hand, and I loved that aspect. In this movie, we get like two fisticuff scenes and then the rest is gunplay. I hated that; don't make the action just generic slow motion bullet fests. That's my main gripe with this movie is it feels like someone wrote an 18th Century action film and just added in Sherlock Holmes at the last minute. I know that's not what happened, but that's what it feels like.The major thing that sucks about the Guy Ritchie movies is that after watching BBC's ""Sherlock"" series, everything else seems second place. Everything that is done in the Guy Ritchie films, the BBC series does better, which makes enjoying the Ritchie films difficult because you're constantly comparing to something much better.I will personally not be buying this movie. I'd only get this movie if it was like a $5 movie in the bargain bin. I heard a lot of other people say they liked it, so I'm not saying everyone will hate it, but I did. And isn't that the point of a review, to state your opinion? So I did not like ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"", but you might so at least rent it or borrow it off a buddy. Who knows how you'll feel?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Holmes","No one expected much from 2009's 'Sherlock Holmes'; Guy Ritchie doing Holmes with Robert Downey Jr.? Many predicted it to be a huge failure, but wait, it turned out to be surprisingly good; a rather likable action-packed mystery romp bolstered by sparkling chemistry between its two leads. It garnered a generally positive critical reception and enjoyed box-office success, thus making a sequel inevitable.'A Game of Shadows' follows Holmes and Watson (Jude Law) as they encounter the sinister Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) and are forced to partake in a mysterious game of cat-and-mouse to outwit the cunning villain.This film's predecessor largely worked because of its well-matched leads; its story was relatively simple and nothing special, however the note-perfect casting of the detective duo managed to elevate the movie to heights it may not have reached otherwise. Downey Jr. continues on the path he strode on the first film, bringing a certain degree of swagger to Conan Doyle's iconic creation, inducing him with a few drops of the action hero charm and irresistible charisma he so perfectly honed as Tony Stark. While Jude Law, essentially the straight man, acts as a great foil to his partner and also gets a number of moments to shine, one in the film's third act is surprisingly touching. It's the dynamic between them though that makes this movie what is; they are the new Butch and Sundance, as far as I'm concerned, bouncing off of each other brilliantly and giving the film its beating heart and soul.When Daniel Day Lewis was originally cast as the iconic villain Moriarty, I found myself in a state of glee; however, he eventually passed on the offer to portray the title character in Steven Spielberg's much-delayed 'Lincoln'. Jared Harris was cast instead and after being rather good in 'Mad Men' he continues to impress, proving a formidable antagonist to our heroes, exuding a presence of unmistakable menace. He shares a number of great scenes with Downey Jr., most notably their first meeting and a third-act game of wits. The reliable Stephen Fry lightens the mood as Holmes' brother Mycroft, while the fantastic Noomi Rapace is unfortunately wasted in a rather bland role.This being a Guy Ritchie movie means action; so yes, the slo-mo of the first film returns, but thankfully doesn't manage to outstay its welcome (just about). There are fisticuffs, explosions, shootouts and big collapsing buildings. Holmes' near-superhuman fight-strategising skills also reappear throughout. Fortunately, all the action sequences don't manage to get in the way of a rather engaging story, with a script more intelligent and complex than that of its predecessor, with the writers wisely devoting some of the standout moments to encounters between Moriarty and Holmes. The film also moves at the pace of a freight train, continuously galloping forward, never leaving the viewer bored or unengaged, as the plot zips from London to Paris to Germany to Switzerland in Bond-like motion, making a nice contrast to the London- only setting of the original.To put it simply: this film is bigger, bolder, funnier and better than the first, with even more bromance between Law and Downey Jr. and much more memorable villain. Building upon the strengths of the first movie, this is easily Guy Ritchie's best film yet, with snappy one-liners, exciting action, humour and moments of genuine emotion. Let's just hope that third time really is the charm.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Spectacular! entertainment and a Splendid! sequel.,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a worthy sequel and has everything that the original did and then some more, the high production quality and great cgi effects come together for a high caliber piece of entertainment. The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is the backbone of the franchise.Guy Ritchie has crafted a franchise that is a shining example of what a big-budget studio movie should look like and all the ingredients it should have. Above all Guy Ritchie has shown how to reboot a old legend, a hero, for the new generation.If you want to see the Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes in its purest form then watch the 1984 series of Jeremy Brett but the Guy Ritchie Sherlock is a different version, an update for the present generation.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The End?,"Wait, wait, wait, I think it's one of those rare cases where the continuation of the original better. In defense of the painting in 2009 I can only say that it was the first and presented to the audience modernized Sherlock Holmes. What we will show today? Watson married, Professor Moriarty wants to unleash the First World War, and Holmes is on a diet of coffee, tobacco and coca leaves.Scenario - a great chess game between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty. But right on red. As you must remember, a professor in the first part of a system of wireless detonators stolen and used it in this part, rather obviously did not apply, you can invent things. In the ""Game of Shadows"" Dr. Evil, he who tries to knock their heads against the two powers, I will not name names, but I will say that one country spoke French, and the other in German. It would seem, why should he? Yes, just part-time professor and another ""Lord of War."" A Sherlock acts as a catch-up - to calculate the great professor of mathematics - mission impossible.The visual component - Guy Ritchie, getting the budget by about a third more than in the first part, so turned around that ... in short it must be seen. The scene in the woods, in my opinion, generally the most beautiful of those I've seen this year. Slo-mo, explosions, scattering trees, the big guns for the last time so I cut off the brain, only a third of ""Transformers."" Winter blockbuster, but with a firm sense of humor and a director Ritchie. At least a gypsy camp ...The actor - ... (hello, ""Snatch"") and wait for what is now the scene Brad Pitt is out, and goes ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" Numi Rapas. No, this is not a film about which you're thinking. The charming young fortune-teller seeking his brother, who is the key to a great mystery of Dr. Ha ... Holmes. Vasily Livanov before the release of the first part said: ""All the bad guys!"" When he was invited as a consultant in Hollywood. Later, Robert Downey Jr.. refuted this statement, creating a distinct character. The second part of the missing spark in his eyes, but the game is also good. You can not say about Jude Law - replays. Of course, Guy Ritchie puts everything in such a way that at first glance it is not noticeable, distracted by the beauty, the passions, special effects, but for now, promatyvaya again, these scenes in your head, you notice - something was not right.Finale - ""bomb disposal"" - all, the audience leaned forward. The atmosphere was tense to the limit, the pawn on e4, elephant elephant beats, the Shah, who watched ""Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson: Mortal Combat"" or read a book, understand what it's all over, I'd add that touched to tears, but at 2014 has already announced the third part of Robert Downey Jr. adventure.

Disappointing,"Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) again battle wits with arch enemy Professor James Moriarty.There is wrong-doing afoot. Our entertainment history is being rewritten to such a point we will no longer know or remember what came first. What we have now is a Sherlock Holmes as an Action Hero, something Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never contemplated. Now the Green Lantern is gay. Spiderman once had a dark suit. Snow White will now be remembered for her troubles with an evil Queen and not for those happy-go-lucky dwarfs (except for Grumpy, of course).Where will it all end? Will Anne of Green Gables become the new Laura Croft? Will Nancy Drew become a hit-manum woman? Will the Hardy Boys become the new Batman and Robin? And, those poor three little pigs, what will they become? And, will we ever hear that we are glad those superheroes are on our side or hear the last line in the fairytale that ""they lived happily ever after?"" Point made? Maybe.I feel many of us would have liked Robert Downey Jr to become another Action Hero (yes, other than Iron Man) with another name and not Sherlock Holmes. And, he still could have a sidekick as, perhaps, a Watson with another name too. Put Sherlock Holmes back where he belongs. Downey is not even close to being a Sherlock Holmes. But, it is what it is and we have what we have and there doesn't seem to be much any of us can do about it. Well, that is, unless I become king. Then it will change back to what it all was. Pity that it cannot happen. I would be a good king.As for this event, you will see a lot of very good CGI, a very fast talking Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr ) because -- remember: he doesn't have a British accent and his talking at light speed will cover that up. So what we have here are fiction, and fantasy where only the names remain the same as written by Sir Arthur, who at this point must be spinning in his grave at warp speed.The first half of this movie is a complete mess. Nothing flowed where one could understand what was going on; hence nothing was going on. When characters talk in darkened scenes with clipped English, it is difficult to follow anything. What we heard was something about Watson's marriage, mind games with Moriarty that came to nothing, and protecting a gypsy fortune teller (Noomi Rapace as Madam Heron) whose brother is missing. The second half was more in tune with what the movie should have been all along, but still there was no caring about anything except to have this over with. And, it was much too long.Downey's Holmes overacts all the way thru and this is most annoying. He is too causal and too flippant. The comedic banter between Holmes and Watson was lame, not funny and most of the time unintelligible. Jude Law's Watson tries to be serious but is often taken in by Sherlock's prankish behavior. Wasted in here was Rachael McAdams as Irene Adler. The only serious persons in here are Moriarty (Jared Harris) and Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan) who together wished there was not so much action and a better script with the old Sherlock back.If you have no idea who the real Sherlock Holmes is, then never mind. Enjoy this mindless Action Hero story and have a nice day. But, for the record, as an Action Hero movie with CGI trappings, let us hope that we have seen the last of this fraudulent Sherlock Holmes. Also, for the record, Robert Downey Jr is a good actor, but not when he pretends to be Sherlock Holmes. And, although I did not like the first Sherlock movie with Downey, I must admit, it was much better than this one. Had the scenes been slower and easier to follow, this may have been okay, but not the way it is now. The Editor must have been on a scene time limit schedule.Whenever old fairy tales or once admired Action Heroes that existed in our past come alive again and have involvement with the dark side or do things we are not familiar with Hollywood calls it ""rebooting"" and we will be truly lost. Look what they did to the new Star Trek story. That, folks, is where we are headed. Yes, there is wrong-doing afoot. Can't you see it? Did I mention that I would be a good king?Violence; Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great dumb fun,"I'm a fan of the books and was not a fan of the idea of Holmes being played by what seemed to be an American WWE fighter lol. But this film is such good fun and I've watched is many times (and will again). The rapport between RDJ and Jude Law is wonderful. Fry does an excellent turn as Mycroft and Jared Harris is a quietly, creepy psychopathic villain. He looks like he stepped out of the C19th! Noomi Rapace (brilliant in the Millennium Trilogy) is good here though not used enough. Kelly Reilly gives great support as Watson's wife. This film is a hoot. The cinematography and editing superb. I just love it. I can't wait for the next in the franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A step up from the first of them,"The first film of this series was for me of average quality, the kind of movie that felt like a generic Hollywood action adventure movie labelled as Sherlock Holmes. A Game of Shadows is however in my opinion a level up from the first instalment and a movie that is just generally funnier, better done action wise and all in all just generally much more thrilling. It isn't necessarily massively new and refreshing and can at times be pretty basic but take nothing away from this, this is a blockbuster done well. It again of course stars Robert Downey, Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Dr. Watson of which both are on the trail of that most famous of Holmes villains, Moriarty.It excels in most part at getting the fighting done in a way which at least at times can feel pretty nice, nice in a way where it feels real of course. The slow motion used in certain scenes is fantastic, an addition that not only just makes parts of the movie more exciting but also it shows Guy Ritchie can do action very well indeed. As for Ritchie well he directs this kind of similar to the first one in the way it's paced but brings more out of the actors and characters they play, as mentioned it feels funnier and more thrilling and that is really down to Ritchie knowing what was needed to be done.Additions to the cast like Stephen Fry, Jared Harris and Noomi Rapace do little to take away the staring role Downey, Jr. has but nevertheless I think they are good additions and make up a cast that is well put together. RDJ even sounds better in this one, I felt with the first he quite often mumbled and his lines came out at a frantic pace but in this he although can be a little too fast, still makes a better go of it. Jude Law as Watson is better as well and although neither is brilliant here they are good enough to not ruin this movie or rob it of any of its credibility.The film can drag just a tiny bit toward the end and they do a decent job of not letting your attention drop, it does start to get more basic toward the end plot wise but by the end I felt satisfied enough. The score of Hans Zimmer + Lorne Balfe makes the action not only more pumped up but just generally sounds good, you can always count on both but especially Zimmer to create something pretty nice. The film can actually think itself pretty smart at times especially with the thought process Holmes goes to when just about to fight, of course if you see the first movie you are used to it but it still feels a little gimmicky how it is done and played out afterwards.So overall Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is one movie that is good and I think an improvement over the first one that felt so mediocre. Guy Ritchie hones in on his craft and truly makes something that although of course is big and can be typically blockbuster, is still a fun adventure and one that I think most can just about partly enjoy at the very least. Oh and the cinematography, it is really well done actually and the movie is also pretty well edited, the story flows very nicely and the way it looks especially in more fast moving or fighting scenes is one that is very good especially.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent but not Brilliant,"This Movie is good,but not Outstanding.Firstly,too many slow mo effects have been used as some others have pointed out.Secondly,it lacks the mystery of he first one....it is more of an action movie.The visual effects were stylish though not quite used appropriatelyHowever,the actor's performances were quite decent especially Robert Downey Jr.Seeing Sherlock struggle to stop Moriarty was quite satisfying.There is some comedy though it occurs infrequently.The characters in the movie also have quite a bit of depth,especially Moriarty. I am still a bit peeved that Moriarty was portrayed more of a Mafia Boss than a ruthless and cruel villain.Overall,this is a decent but not groundbreaking film that focuses on action but not mystery as I had expected.Still,it could be better............significantly better.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fun movie to watch,"If you have read the Sherlock Holmes books, then you would easily make out that character of Sherlock in the movie doesn't come out quite like that. The character of Sherlock in the book, suits when you are reading the book. Putting the same serious character out in the movie would have been a disaster. The character of Sherlock, in my opinion, is much more fun for movie-audience.Alright, looks like this is what the movie makers have done: They have taken character of Sherlock from the book and tried to ponder what could make his character more appealing to movie-audience? ""Let's add humour to the duo of Sherlock and Watson"", ""Let's add some good action to the movie"", ""Let's make a spicy story"".. Sherlock in the movie is an overexcited person who enjoys solving mysteries and enjoys it to an extent that he forgets everything else. This involvement of Sherlock's mind in solving mysteries gives him special power to figure out things and predict precisely what could have happened in a ""crime scene"". Although there will be some parts where you would wonder how could Sherlock have predicted that?The story is not too complicated, what I found to be more complicated was the English Accent. It always seems like the English folks keep adding more and more complicated words in sentences... big show-off! Thanks to the subtitles I didn't miss much of the story. Unlike most of the regular stories that involves solving mystery, in this movie you would know from the beginning who the villain is. What remains mysterious in the movie is how the villain tries to accomplish his goals. Sherlock and Watson are trying to stop the villain from achieving his goals and hence prevent the next world war.My suggestion: This movie is fun to watch with family.

Sensational Sherlock!,"Sherlock Holmes' intellect and kudos appears to be challenged, from his judgement, to an extraordinary degree. Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) disturbs Watson's (Jude Law) Brighton honeymoon by venturing around the gates of France, Germany and the Alps in Switzerland in an investigation behind the mastermind and equally academic Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). His remarkable sense of empathy and wit prove indispensable in this impressive sequel due to Moriaty's sadistic and charismatic volume. In this ravishing sequel, Holmes undertakes the hero role beyond any extremes of the first movie of the Guy Ritchie franchise.The complex plot and swift nature of moving through discovery and intelligence is balance astonishingly well due to Guy Ritchie's camera and technological advancements and his visualisation for the scene. The music is delicate and remedies with the situation with such beautiful tone and timing. This replicates Holmes' movement and motive as he attempts to form an understanding of the motivation behind his arch rival's menacing path. There is a wonderful scene that depicts the whole scenario that the film plots out for us, the Chess game. Here, ideology demonstrates themes of death, fate and the suspense of making the correct decision whilst attempting to countermand your opponents every thought of conquering the world.Despite the element of mystery that the Sherlock Holmes franchise has possessed, so far Guy Ritchie has introduced a vast amount of intense action which works notably in comparison to the rest of the narrative. Not only does it reveal an additional coating to Holmes' manner, but, it modernises a series that critically needed freshness in a fashionable sense if the Sherlock Holmes brand was to continue to exist and platform itself in the modern arena that Hollywood imposes. The third instalment unquestionably has a mass of expectation to topple this second chapter.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

With amazing slow motion effects, fast paced and intelligent action, a spellbinding plot, perfect acting, gut-busting comedy, and a fitting setting, This movie a most definitely a MUST WATCH! If you liked the first one (as did i) you may wonder how could #2 best such a compelling start. I must admit that at first even i was a bit skeptical of this movie due to the fact that most sequels never live up to the first one's glory. But surprisingly ""A Web Of Shadows"" did and in my opinion bested the first one! In Conclusion, Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing job on this movie in my opinion and i definitely nominate this movie for an Oscar. Fast paced, Intelligent.

Another Sherlock Holmes film and Another Missed Opportunity,"Yes, it is time for another Holmes film. I'll speak in general terms as to why I still don't like this series so you don't have to worry about spoilers.If there's one thing I hate it's uninspired movie making. While people can say there was large deal of inspiration in this film it was not situated on the topic I consider to be essential when making a Sherlock Holmes movie. When you put a title like Sherlock Holmes on a movie, Your talking about a famed literary character. Someone who solves crimes with a passion. The same way many of us might focus our attention on a common hobby Holmes focuses his attention tenfold on one objective: solving problems. His one goal is to collect every bit of possible evidence from a crime scene and then use his powerful deductive skills to ascertain the particulars in his investigation.The fascination comes from his exactness. His focus and concentration on the precision of his conclusions makes him more of a computer than a man. ""A calculating machine"" as Watson put it, donating his whole life to putting pieces of evidence together and see what the finished product shows. An yet, through the cold nature of his personality you see a glimpses of humanity. His friendship with Watson that strikes much deeper than it appears, his love of music that shows how human he is in the presence of genuine art, and his zeal for a dramatic conclusion of triumph that was his form of art. When you look deep enough you realize his work isn't that of a computer, but that of an artist.In the context of this perspective this movie misses on a level not seen in sometime. I understand this is just an opinion and that my opinion is worth as much as the other thousands of reviews on this website, but I truly think this movie fails to capture the spirit of the books. When Holmes and Watson communicate to each other, it resembles that of a bitter couple then that of two people who genuinely respect each other. Needlessly arguing over trivial problems that never existed in the stories and you can only find their style of arguing from a modern day bromance. Holmes is very logical, but it seems superficial and meant to be more of a hero advantage than an authentic skill of an individual. I understand there is a need for action and that Holmes was a fighter in the books, but fighting was only present when necessity called for it. Holmes's physical ability was like any other skill in his repertoire; there for the purpose of furthering progress in an investigation. In this movie, fighting takes place for the sole purpose of the excitement of a fight scene. This seems to be a reoccurring error that is present at every turn in this movie. For example, in the stories Holmes would be careless and say hurtful things because they were required to overcome an obstacle in his investigation whether listening to non-essential facts or the threat of having his plans disarranged. In this movie he was a jerk for the sake of entertainment. In the stories Holmes was cold natured because emotions corrupt his judgement and lead to illogical conclusions, I don't even need to explain how much this wasn't the case in this film.A person I found very disappointing was Moriarty. In the short story ""The Final Problem"", Moriarty was supposed to be the great obstacle Holmes would overcome at the cost of his life. Doyle at the time intended this to be the last challenge for his detective and intended to be the ultimate class of intellects. Holmes in the story realizes after a series of cat and mouse mental confrontations that he must make the supreme sacrifice to rid the world of Professor Moriarty and he decides to follow through with it (or so he was meant to). The Movie completely failed at capturing a sense of this. The substance and development in this film was lacking to such a great degree it was depressing. You would think you were watching a video game storyline with the amount of effort they put into the development of the Holmes/Moriarty rivalry. We start out towards the end of their feud, this is not a problem since the story too took place towards the end showing that this isn't a fatal error. The error comes in when you consider that their rivalry is not interesting nor engaging. There is no depth to their personalities and is ultimately as engaging as two opposites confronting one another in a reality TV show. The is no authenticity to their mental struggle.I understand I'm asking a lot for a movie to meet my specific expectations, but I believe my view is the core of many Sherlockian fans. It's not like these have to be specifically exact, but there is a need for a ""ballparkish"" attempt at recreating the spirit of the stories. The BBC series ""Sherlock"" does a decent job of this. This movie, on the other hand, seems to be a 19th century based spy movie with elements of a Michael Bay film sprinkled on top. Without the crucial character development that made the stories great, this is simply a superficial action movie with ""Sherlock Holmes"" as the title.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Some great tools used by a great director performed by great actors to compile the great movie!,"The thing with SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS is the same as it was with the first movie. Allow me to elaborate. This man indeed is a wondrous legend on paper. When Conan Doyle created the character of Holmes; the detective with his top hat and smoke pipe from 221B Baker Street he inked down a man with great thinking powers, a man who does most of his works in the minds' eye. A mystery solver. What Guy Ritchie did in 2009 and what he is doing once again is enhancing Sherlock with guns, explosion, cinematography and some fine action sequences. The movie is brilliant on its own and the books are brilliant on their own. The moment you mix this up you would either be a hater of one and a fan of the other, which is the case with every movie that's adapted from a book. I loved the books and I surely love SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS.The most obvious next question is what's the better movie? My opinion, both movies are indeed great. The 2009 picture looks better at times, since it was the first of its kind in this period of cinema. It gave a new face to Sherlock and Watson back in 2009 and this time it's just another story for the same faces. Also it would be only fair to state that seeing Holmes comprehend a situation proactively before he attacks his enemy was quite a treat back in 2009 and came as a surprise back then. This time not so much? On the other hand the 2011 version of Holmes takes him back to an almost identical version of the character as it was written in the books by Conan Doyle. Holmes is a man who does most of his work in his head, this is his signature move. This time Guy Ritchie focuses more of connecting Holmes and Watson back to the basics to avoid any slander from the critics who love to always compare his work with Conan Doyle's. Therefore on a very neutral level the answer to the question in my opinion is in terms of originality the 2009 productions gets the win and in terms of sincerity to the source of the fictional character Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson the 2011 version takes the bow.There is trouble in Baker Street again and the man himself needs to stop Professor Moriarty (Javed Harris) from destroying the lovely set of Victorian London, Paris and Switzerland. Yes I did mention the word set deliberately. Just as it was in 2009, Guy Ritchie without a doubt hits it way out of the ball park and over the next few football fields as well with his cinematography and the Victorian London set the movie is shot in. The movie does move a tad bit too fast making it hard for the viewer to actually savor its true beauty. It reminds me a little of Hogwarts itself. What Guy Ritchie lacked in terms of pace and intensity in the earlier stages of the movie he matches up with this glorious treat for the eyes. There are a few obvious moments of frustration evident in the movie at first to create the require sense of interest. Some unnecessary acrobatics at the bachelors' party of Dr. Watsons makes it quite obvious making the fight sequences a bit of a farce.The VerdictGreat movie, in fact it did feel like somewhat being at the opera. Just as when the first moments began to pull the entire plot down, it woke everyone up with a bang and gradually excelled itself to a decent climax. Watch out for the part when they use Hansel to hunt Holmes and Watson down. Some great tools used by a great director performed by great actors to compile the great movie!Title: Sherlock Holmes; A Game of Shadows Starring: Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, Noomi Rapace, Rachel McAdams, Stephen Fry and Jared Harris Rated: PG13 Rating: 7.5/10 129 Minutes",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Expected level reached, another gr8 film starring Robert Downey Jr.","After watching the first film, released in 2009, i became a die-hard fan of the franchise. I was watching those highlights from the movie which were stunning. I was EAGERLY waiting for the sequel to come. Expectations were high, and unlike other people who thought this sequel would be no-match comparing to the 1st part, i had faith in both the Director and Especially Robert Downey jr. I was not at all disappointed.The Chemistry between Sherlock holmes(RDJ) and Dr.Watson(Jude Law) is shown in a more detailed manner. RDJ once again proves himself that HE IS Sherly. The cinematography is perfect. The entire movie has Breathtaking action sequences. His dialogue delivery, action scene fluency and facial expressions were SUPERB. RDJ steals the show.The film does not have any moment of boredom but continues to entertain the audience which is the HUGE plus point. Mycroft(Stephen fry) was hilarious, he did his role without mistakes. Professor Moriarty(Jarred Harris), the antagonist, did it greatly. Simza (Noomi Repace) was brilliant.On the whole, the film is Stupendous. It will entertain you to the core. Don't miss this film. On my consideration, 'Game of Shadows' is amazing and better than 'Mission of Impossible 4' I give this film 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Vidiot Reviews,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of ShadowsCSI in the 1800s wasn't as glamorous as today. Back then, all semen found at the crime scene had to be tested by the detective's own tongue.Which explains why the Victorian era England depicted in this action movie only has one super sleuth.Recovering a letter from a doctor murdered at the behest of Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), investigator extraordinary Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and his steadfast sidekick Dr. Watson (Jude Law) follow the clues found in the correspondence to a fortune-teller (Noomi Rapace).There, they learn that her brother, an anarchist, has been dispatching bombs throughout Paris as part of the professor's diabolical plot to profit off of a world war.More focused than its predecessor, Game of Shadows highlights Holmes' humanity, while continuing on the tradition of slow-motion action sequences and homosexual overtones.Besides, who would have a better eye for detail than a gay detective?

"Liked the first film, loved this one!","..saw this one at a late show last night...Have to say, as much as I enjoyed the first film (and I did very much enjoy Ritchie's take on Holmes!) this one just takes everything that was good and fun about the original and amps it up to 11.The chemistry between Law and Downey is just crackling. It is so much fun to watch these 2 natter at each other. The mutual love and respect is spoken thru actions, deeds and performance. Very well executed by both actors.The action sequences, a bit heavy-handed in the first film, are perfected in this one. Each and every one is an edge-of-your-seat affair, tremendously shot and executed.Stylish, yes, but the style doesn't make them as clunky as they were in the first film.Really hope there is a third entry in the series.

"Holmes gets more explosive, not complex, in second Ritchie adventure","The success of ""Sherlock Holmes"" in 2009 certainly opened up Warner Bros.' pockets wide enough to give director Guy Ritchie a bit of free reign over the sequel. His choice of what do with that cash, however, didn't have to be as straightforward as it is in ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows."" In other words, there are explosions. Lots of slow motion and lots of explosions.Just as the first film was about witty banter and bare-knuckle action, ""Game of Shadows"" follows suit to an even greater degree. Perhaps it's the inclusion of Holmes' arch nemesis in Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) that would lead one to believe a greater degree of intellectual thought and mystery would be infused into this second outing, but he serves merely to up the stakes as far as what Holmes must overcome to outsmart someone as clever as he.""Game of Shadows"" is a chaotic action ride that jumps willy-nilly from locale to locale (London, Paris, Germany, Switzerland). It moves so quickly that if you blink you'll miss the reasoning for going from Point A to Point B, even though it hardly matters in the long run. All parts of the mystery are explained/introduced before you can even begin to process them and suddenly we're in the throws of a new action sequence.As far as non-stop entertainment goes, here's a blockbuster that doesn't dawdle, though every so often that wouldn't be such a bad thing. Fans of the traditional Arthur Conan Doyle character who figured for some reason this would be a return to form compared to the 2009 film will be sadly mistaken yet again. There's not much mystery to savor, just the endless pursuit of Moriarty and an attempt to uncover and foil his plans.Stars Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Dr. Watson are as sharp as ever in this new adventure, with Watson getting a bit bigger of a spotlight this time around. His impending marriage helps to further the emotional divide between him and his partner and makes their banter all the more effective.The story, for what little of it matters, involves Holmes' pursuit of his soon-to-be rival, a man he believes responsible for a series of highly political bombings. After Holmes saves a gypsy named Sim (Noomi Rapace) from being one of Moriarty's expenditures and Watson's honeymoon is interrupted by machine-gun fire, they head to Paris to pursue Moriarty, though Holmes knows that his rival has threatened Watson if he does not relent.The new faces in the series, which in addition to Sim and Moriarty includes Stephen Fry as Sherlock's infinitely more logical yet no less quirky brother Mycroft, don't do too much for the film, Sim in particular. Moriarty is the necessary foil for Holmes, the Joker to his Batman to say the least, and Mycroft always ends up being one of those nice change-of-pace characters in the Holmes universe, but Rapace is rather wasted as Sim. She's not a love interest and she just goes along for the ride. Her motivation is typical and uncomplicated, though the same can be said with all the characters, even Moriarty, who though formidable should come across even more menacing than he does.Ritchie turns all the action scenes in ""Shadows"" into his slow-motion playground. One particular scene involves Holmes, Watson and Sim running through the woods as Germans launch all matter of artillery at them. We get various isolation shots on the characters as they run and inside looks at how the artillery fires, not to mention trees exploding at a snail's pace. Any thought that something other than purely stylish entertainment lies in store dies in this scene.To be fair, however, the final act in Switzerland proves to be the film's best. Here, deduction plays its biggest role as Watson and Sim try to identify a man surgically altered to look like another and Holmes and Moriarty engage in a game of chess in which chess is completely secondary. It's a gripping and fun final scene that captures everything Ritchie's vision of Holmes is about. Although Sherlock's internal thought process breaking down how to attack his adversary flirts with being too much in terms of using that same technique over and over again, the end results of the scene proves to be most intriguing.""A Game of Shadows"" is infinitely more engaging than stimulating, though certainly to some those qualities are interchangeable, and this second outing for the reinvented Holmes will be a mild affair. With as many sharp and wild turns as the film takes, however, not to mention the exploding that happens around each corner, boring will not likely cross many minds.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Back, bigger, better","The year is 1891. There have been several bombings of large cities in Europe, and though he can't be linked to it, Moriarty may be behind it. But what's the endgame? Watson is getting married(and nobody thinks that's going smoothly, with his compatriot around), and with their relationship continuing to be like an old marriage(or a bromance), Holmes feels and behaves like an abandoned child. The latter matches wits with his new nemesis, and it's brilliant. In the first one, our titular lead is set up as a magnificent genius(and this one references it, with surprises), and in this, he has more trouble. The climax is phenomenal because of this. James is perfectly cast, as is Mycroft, the elder brother of our hero, Stephen Fry(his rapport with his sibling is priceless). The hilarious British comedy returns, with plays on words, crisp dialog and quirky, memorable characters. Rapace, the woman formerly known as Lisbeth Salander(until Rooney Mara's performance was witnessed by man), does a great job as the intriguing gyspy(and we meet her ""people"", and they're pretty likable and fairly treated) fortune teller who provides an opening into the case. McAdams disappears almost immediately from this. This remains an action adventure suspense mystery, and it keeps to a really fast pace. You get to breathe with the gorgeous establishing shots of Paris and Switzerland and take in all the rich details, writing and exposition. This doesn't fill you in on the original, and it is best to view these in order. There is again technology on the verge of what was possible at the time. This is a fun ride that requires paying attention and several views might benefit you. There is some disturbing, violent(mostly bloodless) content in this. I recommend this to any fan of the first and of the people involved in its creation. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A decent sequel, more of the same but a bit more over-the-top","A Game of Shadows is very similar to its predecessor in overall style. It isn't much better or worse overall. The best additions are probably Stephen Fry as Holmes' brother and Jared Harris as Moriarty, Holmes' most dangerous adversary.The strengths and weaknesses are similar to the 2009 original movie. The style is cool, the action is good but I'd prefer it to focus on problem-solving, the clues are only there for the characters, not us, the plot is broadly predictable although there are a few nice twists, there are plenty of funny moments but also ridiculous and unbelievable parts.It feels like it had the potential to improve on the original. Make the plot less contrived and clearer for the audience. Complexity is fine, but not for its own sake. Let us try to work some things out, but that means letting us see the relevant details for ourselves.One frustrating aspect is the chess game at the end. I play chess. I can follow moves without the board to some degree. But first I need to see the board! They based the game on a real one (Larsen vs. Petrosian) but then don't let us see the game!I can understand that many people don't play chess and don't need to see it. The point is the mental game between Holmes and Moriarty. But for chess enthusiasts, let us see? How hard is that? You can fit many things into the frame. You can draw attention to the dynamics of the position. Holmes sacrifices his queen to open up an attack. Will it succeed? That's not obvious straight away. It's interesting. And it's completely wasted.Harris is really great as Moriarty but it still feels a little anticlimactic. I would have thought he'd have more under his sleeve. Some other parts were also a bit disappointing. Considering the crazy violence some characters survive, it's hard to know whether a death is to be taken seriously or not. It messes up the tension so that some real deaths have less impact.Anyway, it's pretty entertaining, like the first. Clever, but only on the surface. With some cool action, although it feels random and has little consequences. A decent movie with the potential to be great but it never rises to the occasion.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If you are a Sherlock Homes fan, you will be surprised even with its original story you can see the spirit and essence of Sherlock Holmes all over it. They did such a great jobs in picking the actors too, each one of the actors just has such a quality that is so fitting to his/her characters.

The most surprising film I have ever seen,"I have to say that Sherlock Holmes: a Game of Shadows was absolutely terrific. It totally blew me away by how great it was.I went to see this on a cold night back in January, not expecting much, but it ended up delivering. Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing job as Sherlock Holmes and the way that Jude Law as Watson participated in the plot made him not seem like a sidekick but an equal.Jared Harris was brilliant as Professor Moriarty. He is definitely my favorite movie antagonist ever. This film is funny, the plot does not drag and it has lots of action and mystery. I love the first movie and this was just as good. This sequel definitely did not suffer the fate of most sequels. It is a rare, brilliant sequel that will leave you on the edge of your seat for two amazing hours.

Certainly worth watching for pure enjoyment that beats the last movie to death,"I speak for allot of people when i say how long we have been waiting for a number 2 after the good work done by number 1. Number 2, a game of shadows is certainly worth the wait, despite the trailer looking a little bit of a step down. First the plot. The story carries on from the cliffhanger at the end of the first, when Moriarty, a mysterious man with a concealed face, steals a weapon at the end and Sherlock ends with the lines ""Case reopened."" This sets this one up with homes practically devoted to finding out what he is up to and, of coarse Watson becomes involved and they end up travelling across Europe on the brink of a war between France and Germany. Its a step up from the last which was more about England and England alone. The hole of the western world is now in consideration. How this works with the character of Holmes is better than what i thought and this effects the plot in a significant way. Moriarty is a weapons dealer and so on but has friends in high places. ALLOt of high places so a war is in his interests and Holmes thinks he is the one who caused a series of explosions that, of coarse, France blames Germany for and vice verca. the whole mechanics behind this and how Holmes figures each step out is brilliant and, when he isn't doing that, hes getting into a fight or two. The slow down moments where Holmes devises his enemies take down has adapted to be better and way more flashy and there's allot of slowdowns in the action, maybe too much at points and you just want it to get on with it, but when it works, it is proper quality and makes it unique to any other movie. Seeing individual bullets slowly whizz past, breaking up trees and skimming clothes is great. There's great use of CGI and that really helps with some situations that i wouldn't imagine fitted with sherlock Holmes, but it does and it does it well. The plot is interesting and keeps you watching, but its the whole Holmes-Watson relationship which really keeps the humour and plot moving. Also, Mary also returns as a slightly more significant character, as does Eirine as a slightly pointless character that should of just been left and Lestrade as my favourite character with only one line. The last two should of been in it more as how good they were in the first, though this still is good without them playing that much of a part in it. What makes it also brilliant (without spoilers) is that the ending sequence with the plot isn't about action. There's no big fight (that actually happened, anyway) but the mechanic, the use of a chess game, the use of what was thought pointless moments of the movie actually being very significant is brilliant and ends great. There is a reason to be sad at the end however, so bring a tissue",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Indescribably poor,"I didn't like the first SHERLOCK HOLMES film very much at all, so I had little hope for this sequel. Unfortunately, it's even worse than the original, moving further away from the source material in a bid to deliver big bucks, action packed excitement. Downey Jr. plays Holmes as a superhero type in a Victorian setting, utilising his physical prowess and mental skills in a bid to bring down some typically shadowy villains.First of all, for an action film, the action is very poor. A GAME OF SHADOWS was made during a trend for ultra slow motion in cinema, and the slow motion sequences are ridiculous. I don't know if they're meant to be edge of the seat or exciting, but despite the cutting edge technology they look very fake and the CGI augmentation is all too obvious.Downey Jr.'s acting here is rather pitiful and his Holmes is required to cross dress and do other stuff that's about as far away from the spirit of the literary Holmes as is possible. Jude Law and Jared Harris work hard in support, but Noomi Rapace's fortune teller is out of place and Rachel McAdams remains awful. The worst thing about all this though is the nonsensical script, which turns realistic detective fiction into teen-friendly grandiose fantasy that remains frequently incomprehensible.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) - The Masterful Continuation of a Detective's Odyssey,"In the grand tapestry of cinematic adaptations, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" (2011) stands as a brilliant continuation of Guy Ritchie's reinvention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective.

The Victorian-era London is once again brought to life with meticulous attention to detail, creating a world that is both atmospheric and visually captivating. Ritchie's directorial choices, including his signature slow-motion sequences, contribute to the film's distinctive aesthetic and enhance the overall viewing experience.Hans Zimmer's evocative score returns with a haunting intensity, complementing the film's mood and contributing to its overall cinematic grandeur.

The mind's game is more often sophisticated than the weapon's damage,"What worked:
The movie is as smart, quirky, humorous as the first one and it is entertaining overall. Having very little knowledge of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original work, I must say it is a smart movie. Editing is remarkable, and Holme's character stood strong amongst all others
What did not work:
I would say the action sequences were over the top, personally. We get to see Holmes in some action scenarios which were larger than life , and maybe more explosive than the usual cat and mouse game or the use of head over the weapons. That's my opinion. Also, some of the ending scenes were less stimulating, making it less exciting than the first one

Trick of the Mind,"For those of you that haven't watched the first Sherlock Holmes it really does not matter. I am always effie about big box sequels because they are never really better than the first. However, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is remarkably so much more exciting and smart than its predecessor and it made me laugh a ridiculous amount.The plot takes part months after the first movie, where Dr.John Watson (Jude Law) is about to marry his fiancée Mary (I must warn you that I had the most suspicious feeling about this ""wife"" character and indeed she does play a pivotal role in the movie) and Inspector Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) to be his best man and to throw his best friend and partner in solving crimes a stag party. Of course being Sherlock Holmes, he has other obsessions on his mind.Where this party takes place we get to meet the lovely Madame Simza, (played by a lovely and very bohemian Noomi Rapace, the Swedish superstar known for the Original Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"")and even though she has little dialogue in the film she goes along for the ride and stunts with the boys.This movie introduced Professor James Moriarty who is the complete duplicate of Holmes, if Holmes was evil and out to cause mass destruction. This adversary is perfect because whatever mind trick Holmes plans on executing, Moriarty is one step ahead of him. It's so smart to see how both characters think and play around with each other.You are thrown for a loop and at moments when you think one character has the upper hand the tables are turned. You really don't know who survives until the very end.This movie was so much fun, there was enough action and aerobatics that made the first Sherlock Holmes movie exciting and successful but always an equal amount of humour and cleverness for the fans of the old school Holmes. This movie was like a chess board. Never knowing you're opponent's move until it's done or when only a few chess pieces are left can you try to piece it together, but this movie has never once confirmed my predictions for what's going to happen next.Bravo Holmes and we must really ask the question: The End?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The effects were pretty good and the dialogues were perfect for the scenes. Stephen Fry's portrayal of Mycroft was better than perfect - it exceeded even the Mycroft from Arthur Conan Doyle's books!The only disappointment was the handling of Irene Adler... she could have been given more of a role. But that doesn't dent the movie at all, and the conclusion is pretty perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The first one was stupid fun. This one's just stupid.,"Especially Sherlock himself. He doesn't appear very intelligent at all, in this incredibly boring sequel. Granted, he wasn't particularly genius in the first one either, but the visual translation of his intellect was at least fairly entertaining. Here they actually just gave up and turned it into a joke.Sherlock comes off like he had a stroke or something. His entourage isn't any better and Moriarty was there too. All there's to say. He was apparently present in the movie. He didn't do much though.The style becomes an enormous frustration point as well. From over-edited foot chases to nonsensical transitions between scenes. The editing in general is just weak here.This movie already feels like its 30 years old.The actors do their best, given the terribly written script. Not that it matters much. Probably would have been better with much worse performances.The tone is all over the place. The movie starts with a bombing. Followed by a quirky funny scene. Followed by a murder of a previously established character.Throughout I was wondering what the hell was going on. The characters in this movie spend a lot of time talking about the plot and almost no time showing it. Which made the action scenes ring hollow, pointless and completely tension free.This entire movie plays like a filler episode on a mediocre TV show. It's very boring. Very, very boring.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Second viewing... Even better!...,"Lots of action, a fair smattering of comedy and a thrilling plot go together to make up this film. Most of it works pretty well, however there is a bit of a weak link and that is the part of the story involving the character played by the, woefully underused, Noomi Rapace. I thought it was a little weak and didn't quite have enough believability (for me). Having said that, the rest of the film was very thrilling and entertaining throughout with a great ending! Over all, I did enjoy this film a lot more than I thought I would at the beginning.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A true phenomenal master piece,Sherlock Holmes a game os shadows is one of the best adventures ever seen. It would sound odd but it's better than the first one. I still got no idea where sherlock girl went ? Did she died or what he went insearch of her and that path leads to more and more new mysterious events. The detective role played by sherlock and his friend is too good. Director did a great job plotting a scene where they are using their brains and brawn to track down a nefarious nemesis. Even a villain character used his masterpiece ideas to be in power and was going to create a chaos between European nation . Can't wait to see part 3 which they are working on.,9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best of the best competition,"That's where we are at with this movie, Rathbone, Brett, are the Holmes of old. Great actors, but now we have another strong group, in a well crafted flick. It was entertaining throughout, which made up for the little glitches. I read Doyle as a child, everything in the library; before Los Angeles got over 6-7 TV channels. I also enjoyed the great Rathbone flicks and all of the later productions, which were lacking until Brett on PBS. The first flick was choppy, but it was the fun in spots. They put in work and made this one a sweet ride. They even tied in the most famous scene of all times from the old classics. What I liked most is how they highlighted the social quirks, of Sherlock and MyCroft alike. This movie was the rebirth of Holmes. Great job. Who is the best Holmes?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sherlock Holmes vs Prof. James Moriarty,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is another movie I can watch anytime, anywhere. It takes everything I loved about the first movie and makes it even better. Robert Downey Jr. And Jude Law are perfect as Holmes and Watson, and their friendship is a big part of what makes this movie so good.The story is thrilling, with Holmes going up against Professor Moriarty, who is his smartest and most dangerous enemy. The action scenes are bigger, and the chase through the forest is one of my favorites. I also love how the movie shows how clever both Holmes and Moriarty are, constantly outsmarting each other.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Even Better than the First Movie; Fans Should Love It,"I really enjoyed Guy Ritchie's first SHERLOCK HOLMES. So I should warn those who didn't, you may as well just move along. But if you're like me and thought his first movie was a fun new spin on the classic character, then you'll probably have a blast here because it's even better the second time around. The second movie ramps everything up to the next level with a stronger story and better action sequences while retaining all of the fun elements of the first film. I haven't gotten tired of this series yet, and if Ritchie can keep the movies as entertaining as they've been, I hope we'll get a few more out of him. A GAME OF SHADOWS adopts elements from the Holmes tale ""The Final Problem"" (one of Doyle's stories I haven't had a chance to read) with the battle of wits between Holmes and his nemesis. As the movie begins, Holmes and Watson have gone their separate ways as Watson prepares for the approaching marriage to his fiancée Mary. Meanwhile, Holmes is deep into his latest investigation surrounding recent events: bombings, suspicious deaths, countries on the brink of war. All of the trails he has uncovered converge on one man: Professor James Moriarty. Holmes fears that Moriarty's plans might have worldwide consequences and enlists the aid of his trusted colleague Watson one last time in a bid to uncover the nefarious plot and put an end to it. But Holmes may have met his intellectual match in the professorYou won't hear me complaining about Ritchie's action-infused version of the classic detective. If you want the usual Holmes sleuthing, there are hundreds of other sources out there, but I like to think Ritchie's movies maintain the heart of Holmes while adding a nice action punch to kick it up a notch. I love the ""Holmesavision"" method of sharing Holmes' train of thought and bring the audience into his mind while he does his does best. There's an awesome moment in the final act of the film where we experience to two genius minds attempting to out-smart each other when Holmes confronts Moriarty. It was a cool means of bringing something new to my favorite element of these movies. The story is fun, with Holmes and Watson breaking free from the confines of England to travel Europe in their pursuits this time around. The action sequences are bigger and more extravagant and Ritchie loads it up with his slow-motion/ramped speed, stop-n-go style. Another aspect I appreciated in the film, the stakes definitely feel higher. There are a few moments in the movie where I genuinely wondered if all of the characters would make it out alive, and at times wondered if Ritchie planned on ending the franchise here before it went any further. A GAME OF SHADOWS is a total blast, and I'd go so far as to say it was one of my favorite movies of 2012. My only concern is that it couldn't be topped in a third movie. The scope on this one is about as large as a good Holmes movie can get without going too over-the-top, and they've already brought out the detectives most cunning enemy: Moriarty.If you want to make a blockbuster icon out of Sherlock Holmes, you can't do better than Robert Downey Jr. He continues to be great in the role, even if he does come off as a little cartoonish this time around. RDJ brings equal parts eccentric and intelligent to the character and comes across as just shy of insane. Jude Law is again the perfect straightman as John Watson. He looks like he's having more fun this time and has a few funny moments of his own. Rachel McAdams was my least favorite part of the first movie and I'm happy to say her character, Irene Adler, receives no more than 5 minutes of screen time. The best characters in this movie, though, are the newcomers. Stephen Fry (as Mycroft Holmes) and Jared Harris (Moriarty) steal their scenes. Harris was a great choice for Moriarty. There had been a lot of early talk that Ritchie and the producers had been considering some A-list names for the character, but it worked so much better with Harris. He's confident, conniving, and sociopathic. He's a perfect Moriarty for this sort of Holmes film. Noomi Rapace (from the Swedish Millennium trilogy) has a role as a gypsy fortuneteller drawn into the chase, but she hasn't got much to do here.Whether or not A GAME OF SHADOWS is worth your time all boils down to whether you are a fan of Ritchie's vision for the character. Being a fan of the first, I absolutely loved this one. It's an action-oriented SHERLOCK HOLMES on a bigger scale and an excellent chess match in the final act to sum up the battle of two great minds.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bloated sequel,"In 2009 Sherlock Holmes was re-imagined by Guy Ritchie as an ass- kicking and mentally unstable private investigator with a weakness for a variety of mind-altering substances. Played by Robert Downey Jr., Holmes was Iron Man without the vast fortune, super-suit and fashionable beard, but with the same genius-level intellect, capable of predicting the exact outcome of a fight with a foe before the first punch is thrown. Though heavily compromised by Ritchie's sledgehammer subtlety and love for annoying Cockney geezers, it was still an entertaining take on an extremely familiar character, with Downey Jr. at his twitchy best and demonstrating a convincing English accent.A Game of Shadows, the bloated sequel rushed into production after the international success of its predecessor, turns the doctor from idiosyncratic eccentric to a babbling pantomime. When we meet Holmes, he is rescuing his flame Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) from a bomb intended for somebody else. The package was given to her by the scheming Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), and after her next meeting with him, she disappears. On the eve of his wedding, Dr. Watson (Jude Law) arrives at Baker Street to find Holmes deep into investigating a splurge of seemingly unrelated murders and business acquisitions linked to Moriarty, and at Watson's bachelor party, the two encounter a gypsy woman named Simza (Noomi Rapace), the intended recipient of the letter that accompanied the bomb.Without any sign of the storytelling flair of the books, A Game of Shadows becomes little more than a series of punch-ups, shoot-outs and inane exchanges between Holmes and his trusted Watson. At one point, the heroes are fired at by an increasingly ridiculous arsenal of machine guns as trees shatter and fireballs explode around them in ultra slo-mo. Any resemblance to one of literatures most beloved characters is lost, and it feels instead like you're watching a movie about The Transporter's British granddad, albeit with a touch more style. Mad Men's Harris is impressive as Holmes's most challenging foe, but Rapace's character is so redundant that she is reduced to just a pretty face for the poster. Shockingly, the main problem is Downey Jr., whose hyperactive shtick is as tiresome as the plot he is caught up in.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An action packed feast for the eyes and thoroughly enjoyable entertainment.,"Reading some reviews I can't understand why some people get so serious about something that is clearly about entertainment and entertaining it certainly is. I enjoyed the whole movie thoroughly and will definitely watch it again. Furthermore I particularly liked some of the filming, some great camera work going on. For me this is an excellent and highly enjoyable movie. I laughed all the way through and so did the rest of the audience, a good sign I suspect Dr Watson.

Welcome Back Sherlock!,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is the second installment in the Sherlock Holmes franchise and it does not disappoint. While it lacks the charm of the first film, it makes up for that with the thrills, wit, and some clever action. It also makes use for the slo-mo scenes that made the first one really enjoyable. Also this film has a better and popular villain that all fans of Sherlock Holmes know of: Professor James Moriarty.Guy Ritchie's film joins Sherlock and Watson together on another adventure and this time they aim to stop the evil Professor Moriarty from destroying the world.This movie works because of the wit and interplay of Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law. Just like Iron Man, I can't see anyone else playing a better Sherlock than Downey. I love his sardonic attitude and it's a nice feature to give to Sherlock. Jude makes a good Watson and I really can't see anyone doing better. Jared Harris makes a good Moriarty. I didn't know what to expect out of him.Overall, this is a really fun film. While it doesn't improve on the first film, it's still a welcome addition to the Sherlock Holmes franchise. This movie is action-packed and it features some cool stunts. it doesn't hurt to have scenes where Downey dresses in drag. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a great action film but not a good detective film, with great performances by our iconic duo and antagonist, you're in for a ride","Following the events of the previous film; Detective Sherlock Holmes is on the trail of criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty, who is carrying out a string of random crimes across Europe.Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is once again helmed by Guy Ritchie, who directed the previous film, thus carrying over his direction and visual storytelling to make for one whole experience. Although the film follows an original premise, it incorporates more closely elements of Conan Doyle's short stories, including ""The Final Problem"" (1893) and ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" (1903). Robert Downey Jr. And Jude Law reprises their roles as Holmes and Watson, but other returning actors/characters are Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, Kelly Reilly as Mary Morstan, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade and Geraldine James as Mrs. Hudson. New characters are Noomi Rapace as Madame Simza ""Sim"" Heron, Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes and also Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty. The best performances are of course Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law and Jared Harris. I think it's quite unfortunate how Rachel McAdams doesn't get more time to shine, because she was one of the highlights of the previous film, the same goes to Stephen Fry and Kelly Reilly, Noomi Rapace too. They should have been used more and a little bit better, but the film length, I get how you don't want the movie to be stuffed with material. After all, Guy Ritchie is known for his fast-paced and energetic action scenes which often serves as a great cinematic choice, he uses the fast-cutting and slow motion to build momentum in the story and to create a high-impact viewing experience. Thus, slowing down the story in favor for more character moments becomes an after thought, there are still a lot of great if not superb character moments between Holmes and Watson, but also Moriarty. These actors gets plenty of time, using that time to give brilliant performances.Rewatching Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows made me think, it's actually better than I remembered it. I remember it being a lot of action, that haven't changed, but the acting and how great of a villain Jared Harris' version of Professor Moriarty is. It's amazing. I still like the first film the most, but this is a great follow-up, it's different in a lot of ways and thus Ritchie showed us how he doesn't want to play it safe. Though I liked the action, it just didn't feel like Sherlock Holmes, except the final action sequence and ending. I really like the third act in this film, its quite excellent and I believe the first act is too quite great. But that second act is where the rating goes down. It's filled with jokes, some are too childish, and it's also full of unnecessary action. That's the second act, where they travel through Europe by train and Paris, the film was great in London and Germany, of course The Reichenbach Falls. That game of chess played by Holmes and Moriarty is and was how their showdown would go down. The action sequence in Germany is memorable and both brilliantly shot and edited. For an action film, this is quite a great film, as a Sherlock Holmes film it just doesn't hold up but I strongly believe the sequel will be great!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I always repeat scenes of playing chess,"A well-known intellectual, Professor Moriarty, had big plans for the stability of the European state. Moriarty is now an enemy who has a capacity equivalent to the equally intelligent Holmes.Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows has a better story than the first film. This sequel leads to Sherlock's nemesis, Professor Moriarty. Sometimes, a sequel becomes a burden and actually makes the film a flop. However, it is different from this Sherlock Holmes sequel film. The film has improved with a story that develops with the presence of new enemies on an equal footing. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows has a great story premise. It has a dense story plot, much more complicated conflicts and good and interesting dialogue. The film is somewhat more dense, but Irene Adler's presence becomes a new color in the Sherlock conflict and also becomes crowded with iconic characters present. In fact, Irene Adler is already present in the first film, but in this film the role of Irene Adler becomes more and has an influence in the course of the story. Even Mycroft, Sherlock's older brother, is also present in this film. This second Sherlock film has a story with a mature mystery, with attacks from much larger and dangerous enemies that add to the rancidity of this film. The development of the mystery story that is presented leads to a story that is a puzzle. One of the interesting scenes is the game of chess.Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is still with the same cast as the first film. In addition, this film is still with the same formula as the first film. The film also has several scenes made in slow motion which adds to the interest of this film. This film has indeed developed both in terms of story and conflict. It has a dense, complicated, enigmatic and entertaining plot with Sherlock Holmes' ridiculousness behavior.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An improvement over the first,"""Sherlock Holmes"" was a great movie. This is even better.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as the famous detective and his sidekick Dr. Watson, as they try to take down their fiercest enemy, Moriarty.This is a great movie. The action scenes were great, and the story was great as well. The slow motion sequences were always put to good use, but there was one sequence, in which they are running through the woods, in which it worked the best. Guy Ritchie proves that he is still the guy to direct these films.However, what makes this film great is the actors and their characters. Watching Downey Jr. and Law interact with each other was always amusing, but another aspect that made this film great was Sherlock's interactions with Moriarty. Moriarty is just as smart and as cunning as Holmes is, so while this proves a great challenge for our famed detective, it is always intriguing to see them interact with each other. For this reason, it is always fun to see who comes out in the end. And speaking of the end, I won't mention what it is, but the last scene is so strange and so well done that it is without a doubt the best scene in the movie.Overall, I recommend this film. This is unlike any Holmes that we've ever seen (other than the first film). He is old London's Jack Sparrow, and therefore, he is such fun to watch. A 9/10 for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great action movie but not a great Holmes one,"This movie is amazing.... and I would have given it a 10 rating only if it was the same movie without the Sherlock Holmes character I mean it is a great action movie but lacks the deduction parts of Sherlock Holmes I mean if you counted them in this movie they will be less than 4 or 5 deductions. And I didn't expect that from a Holmes movie. So, I rated it 8 because it is really good: full of chases and actions and fights. Of course, I recommend watching it but I still insist on my opinion that this shouldn't be a Holmes movie. The first part of this movie was a far exciting than this one because the deductions were many and amusing. But the effort done in this one is pretty good too.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Absurdly nothing like what's in the books. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle must be weeping in his grave by now. If you have a contrary view, then follow up your disagreement by first reading ONE of the books.The director seems to have it confused with Batman; I would not be surprised if he actually had some sort of Sherlock-Belt along with a baseball bat.

Game of Shadows is a solid sequel.,"To those raised on the Holmes or Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Bret, 2009's Sherlock Holmes, starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role, came as something of a shock, some might say a revelation. Here was the esteemed detective as action hero, battling the forces of crime not only with his keen intellect and powers of observation, but also with fisticuffs, gun play, and a near precognitive ability to predict his opponents' motions. It was highly unconventional, a complete departure from past portrayals, but it worked. And in Game of Shadows, it works once more.The formula director Guy Ritchie has taken works because it adds new aspects to the persona of Sherlock Holmes, thus broadening his appeal, while keeping largely intact the things which endeared generations of fans to the character in the first place. By which I mean that although this version of Holmes is far more action oriented than previous incarnations, his ultimate success still depends on his ability to see details and make connections that no-one else can.And while the wisecracking, somewhat rakish Holmes seen here may come as something as a shock, it should be remembered that Doyle's great detective has always nursed a morphine habit and delighted in backhandedly belittling lesser investigators, and that the author did on at least one occasion refer to Holmes's study as 'Bohemian.' So while Downey's portrayal may be something of a stretch, it is a least partially grounded in the Doyle's work. And regardless of its faithfulness to the source material, there's little doubt that this Holmes' wit and unconventionality are highly amusing.The action scenes are very good, with choreography easily equaling that of most contemporary martial arts pictures. It's especially interesting, if a bit credibility stretching, to watch as Holmes works out each movement of the upcoming fight within his head, then makes a few minute adjustments to achieve the desired ends. Nor has the big reveal, in which Holmes shows how he has fit the pieces together and outsmarted the criminals, lose any of its impact. As is to be expected in any good mystery, even the smallest details, going back almost to the beginning of the case, can have great importance at the case's end.I will admit however that while the chain of clues didn't seem to have any gaps, it wasn't entirely clear what set Holmes on the trail in the first place. More seriously, at times film becomes a bit too goofy for its own good, and it seems that the actors are unable to resist cracking up just a bit. And based on one scene around the halfway mark, I would urge Downey to avoid playing members of the opposite sex in the future.Overall though, Sherlock Holmes- Game of Shadows has successfully captured the magic of its predecessor. It combines action, humor, and unexpected twists a package that should satisfy and entertain most film goers.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A typical Guy Ritchie film!!,"With rotten status on rottentomatoes.com (59%), I was not so eager to watch the movie. But finally decided to give it go for Guy Ritchie, and Hanz Zimmer's music.

Brilliantly shot, great acting, awesome direction and great music make this movie one of the best I've watched in 2011.With its twists and turns, Sherlock Holmes - A Game of Shadows is a typical Guy Ritchie film (If it weren't for him, the film would have barely made it to the theaters). Plus points are direction, music and ya, Robert Downey, Jr., who comes up with a really good performance. I thought is was way better than the first installment, for it had a much simpler story-line.

Robert Downey Jr. returns as Sherlock and so the game is afoot!,"It took me a while to watch this film...I wanted to see it at the theater as I really enjoyed the first one, but I never made it. Finally got it as a gift and have to say that I enjoyed it just as much as the first one. I know many out there do not like this version of Sherlock, but this is one of my favorite versions of the famous detective. I am not the biggest Holmes fan admittedly. My other fave Holmes is Peter Cushings, I really enjoyed ""The Hound of the Baskervilles""...in both these cases I really enjoyed the actor playing Holmes.This film has Holmes trying to match wits with his greatest adversary, Professor Moriarty! A man whose genius is only matched by his nefarious desires. Sherlock must once again team with his good friend Dr. Watson as they have to go through Europe to figure out Moriarty's scheme. Once again there is a lot of humor and a lot of action. Some may find this off putting, but I really enjoyed it. The movie starts out with Sherlock on the tail of a familiar friend, he takes his good friend Watson to his stag party where then his wedding, has a great encounter on a train and ends up at a very nice castle in Switzerland. The locales are great in this film too, by the way.I enjoy films from this time period so that is probably one of the reasons I enjoyed it and the predecessor. Probably explains why I enjoyed the film ""The Raven"" as well...though that one took place in America. I also enjoy a good train action sequence, whether it be in a movie or even a video game. This film has that too. At times though the film does move around to much which is why I did not score this film a 10, I really enjoyed the film, but at times it became difficult to follow!So while it may not be the popular thing to do, I enjoyed this film. Cannot pretend I didn't. To me these Sherlock are the perfect combinations of action and humor. That is the kind of role I like Downey Jr. in, action type films with some comedy. I do not really enjoy his totally serious films or his comedies. So basically I like him as Starks and Sherlock I guess. I am looking forward to the next Iron Man film and I also hope I can look forward to the next Sherlock film.

If they stop the franchise now it will be remembered as a good romp and a whole lot of fun for the price of a ticket. One more and it will be over the top. Sometimes the movie does take you over the top but before you fall off the ledge it redeems itself. If they go for number 3 think of Aliens. Yep they will ruin it. As far as Digital Fx, come if they are a least somewhat transparent let it go, but when the do the castle on top of the mountain for instance next to the raging river it is way too obvious.

incoherent,"The movie is handsomely filmed and has all sorts of clever special effects but the story line was totally incoherent to me. RDJ's Holmes looks like he has not only shaved in days but he hasn't bathed in days, either. Jude Law's Dr. Watson looks equally scruffy. Didn't anyone shave in the 1890s? There's a lot of bantering between Holmes and Watson which is entertaining but very little of the deductive reasoning that was the core of every Holmes story. And yes, in the books Holmes did know some sort of Asian martial arts but these new movies make him into a martial arts expert an a par with Bruce Lee.

When will he get to tackle the role which will make him the new Brando? This one isn't it, but amusing all the same. A true roller coaster of unrelenting action. The storyline is hard to follow at times but we can catch up easily along the way. And what about Ritchie's (this Madonna's Ex) style of slow motion and freeze frame shots to great effect. Are we witnessing a trademark in the line of Leone's majestic close-ups or Kubrick's cold reality? Time will tell.

To be honest, I was not a fan of the original despite it being somewhat of a ""classic"" among occasional movie- goers. The sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows, isn't necessarily better in the story- telling department, but it is better in every other aspect as compared to the first.The film definitely has a better grip on the manic and silly Sherlock Holmes, and finally Downey Jr. nails the character. Jude Law is funnier and more charismatic, and the antagonists are violent and evil. The stylized, brutal, and bone crunching action that was present in the first film is now at full force in the second film. It's wonderfully choreographed, exciting, and unique. Sets are a neat stylized ""Tim Burton"" take on Britain, Paris, and more. The action set pieces are a combination of hilarious mishaps and neat Sherlock-esque action.The most rickety aspect is the plot. It starts totally manic, hair brained, fast paced, and illogical but ends totally smart, stylish, intense, and wonderfully cheeky. It's a film that pulls a 180 in terms of being watchable, and shifts wildly from manic insanity to clever intensity by the end of the film. It's a film that's hard to digest: not because it's deep or complex, but because it starts out as a hair brained origins story with no direction and ends with a bang - but not the dynamite, explosion kind. Whatever that hard to digest element may be, this film is charismatic, exciting, funny, and a pleasure to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very good indeed,"A must see, I saw the first one and thought it was going to be boring during the first several minutes, but I stuck it out and gave it a 7. This is definitely a strong 8 and I really was going to give it a 9.This movie is sad then funny then happy. One thing for sure you will not be disappointed.Although this might not be the Sherlock Holmes you new from reading old books from the past, it's still very much entertaining.

Sherlock getting better...,"I must say that I rather enjoyed the dialogues in this movie which was quite intriguing. Guy has done a good job not just with the words - but you'd be impressed with the action sequences too.The storyline is is not the best by far and though there might seem as if there are loose ends in between, it all fits right in once you're through the sequence of events happening in the movie.The bond between Holmes and Watson is as strong as ever. And then comes the Professor. Being the bad guy he does a pretty good job at it. Though not as fearsome as one would portray, he's one good opponent for someone like Holmes, nevertheless.This movie is not like a run of the mill good guy gets bad kind of a story. It may seem like it. It's about Sherlock Holmes and his ability to make his every move necessary just like what you would want him to do at that time. Go see!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Downey Jr. Has done it again!,"Well it wasn't really a shocker that the fabulous Mr. Downey Jr. Has ceased to amaze us in his return of Holmes. Personally, I think this one outshines the first. Even though the first one was fantastic, this one just blew me away. It was full of suspense, mystery, and action that it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. When you would think that it would come to the end, it just kept going. It was one of those movies that had me disappointed when the credits rolled in. It defiantly left me hungry for more. It also had its perfect amount of humor. With Holmes sass filled attitude and Watsons series but calm wits, this dynamic duo did not fail to make the audience laugh. I also enjoyed the new characters that were brought it. Jared Harris did an excellent job of portraying the spine chilling doctor villain. And sadly with the mysterious death of Rachel McAdams that Disappointed us all, there was a new heroine that came into the picture. Noomi Rapace, who played the beautiful and sneaky Madam Sim, was a very interesting newcomer. It was definitely a different mix with the two heroes, but her role Was a key to the mystery and She fit In just right with the rest of the cast. I've seen the movie three times since it was released in December and I cannot wait till its out on DVD. If you have not seen it yet, I would very much recommend this on your list the next time you are looking for something to do on a Friday evening.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A total disappointment (and I liked the first movie),"While the first movie was a bit unorthodox regarding its portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, it functioned because of the good performance of the main actors, a very convincing villain and a good plot which had more than a necessary amount of mystery for an SH plot, made even stronger by toying with the elements of the occult. Occasional action scenes, though sometimes overdone, were rather original and few and far between to annoy.The sequel though seems to be written by a different set of writers. There is no plot whatsoever above the basic premise which can be told in a sentence or two. The only mystery present was what actually connects all too many random and overly long action sequences and dispensable characters together. And though the main actors might still be pushing hard, their lines rarely work, being written poorly as they are. To accommodate for the weak script, Robert Downey character's eccentricity seems to be simply pushed much too far this time that it becomes annoying rather than fun. Jude Law repeats the first role as much as possible with the lines he's been given and is a rare memento to what worked well in the first movie. Rachel McAdams was a rare miss in the first movie, so the fact she doesn't play a larger role in this one can only be a plus. I'm still puzzled by the gypsy woman character's purpose in the movie, but it only underlines the weak script as this character is actually one of the main ones. And the villain himself leaves an impression of a low-level local gangster given to play with higher stakes (selling weapons to opposing countries, rather than illegal liquor) which, unfortunately for the script writers, doesn't automatically create a character of a top criminal mastermind. As there was no secrecy about him or his plan or his ulterior motives even, the ""game of shadows"" being played between him and the SH is reduced to running around the Europe at seemingly random locations, fighting (in the most direct sense of the word) the forgettable villains alone while trying to save the world. And if that might sound more like a James Bond script to you (as mentioned in some other review), you would not be mistaken.Just avoid it. It made for a very tedious experience and the only thing I cared about while watching was that it finishes as soon as possible so I can forget about it.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Brilliant.,"This was great. However it had different qualities to the first film. It had brilliant acting from Sherlock and Dr Watson. Stephen Fry was also surprisingly brilliant as Mycroft, as was Professor Moriaty. In places I didn't really understand the plot as it was complex, though in a nutsell it was people being killed by bombs.The plot was basically Professor Moriaty's gang setting bombs on key political figures in Germany and France so as to set a war on the contries. Parts I loved; The slow motion gun shots. The comic banter between the characters. Parts I didn't like; The plot grew complex, I didn't understand it in places. I would of liked more mystery. However overall it was a brilliant film and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Who loves a good action film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than the First,"I haven't seen the first Sherlock Holmes in a while, I bought it as a blind buy and when I watched it, I thought it was pretty good, but stopped short of greatness. I just thought that the villain was kind of lame, I mean we knew who he was, and it seemed that he was not smart enough for Holmes. This film fixes that, it is way more interesting this time to see Holmes try to outwit him, because Professor Moriarty is pretty much Holmes equal.Everything that I liked in the first Sherlock Holmes movie is present here. The best part being the chemistry between Holmes and Watson, Downey Jr. and Law must have known each other all there lives, because they have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen in a film. The action scenes are fun, although one of my problems is that director Guy Richie uses way too many slow motion shots, and shows way too much. However the comedy almost never misses, this is one of the funniest movies I saw from last year. Robert Downey Jr. steals the show, he is now one of my favorite actors, and the Sherlock Holmes character is one of my favorite movie characters. The film always keeps you guessing as to how Holmes will escape, and when it ends, I had a huge grin on my face because of how brilliant it was.Like I said, the action scenes can be annoyng at times and there are a few boring parts, and Watson's wife seemed entirely pointless and just slowed the movie down, but I enjoyed this film, and I await a third movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Its obvious who is running Hollywood now.,"I give the movie a 3 because I like Downey and Law, but the plot is so garbaged up with political and social agendas that I couldn't enjoy the movie. Just more gay-ism being shoved on the public. Downey should refuse to do another sequel unless another director takes over. Its obvious Guy (Gay) Ritchie, the director is using his movies to push his gay lifestyle agenda. I believe that the Sherlock Holmes franchise could be like the Mission Impossible franchise, but instead of trying to put together good movies they use a good movie to push their social beliefs on the rest of us. I say boycott Ritchie and the producers. It was a waste of good acting. Downey is a great actor and should take his talents elsewhere.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best bromance on the big screen is back again with avengeance,"Having watched and enjoyed the previous Guy Richie Sherlock Holmes film at about the same time last year, it was nice to re-acquaint myself with the franchise on its second instalment. All the elements that made the first film great are back again, more so in some cases, and it was great to see that Richie still hasn't lost his eye for the visuals. I will give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.Countries in Europe are being brought to the brink of war due to a series of bombings that appear to be being perpetrated by extremists. The truth is, they are all the work of one man, Professor James Moriarty. It is clear that there is only one person who has the capability to stop him; Sherlock Holmes. Of course he drags Dr. Watson into it and manages to ruin his stag night in the process. The damsel in distress this time comes in the form of a gypsy fortune teller, Madam Simza Heron, whose brother has been incorporated into Moriarty's plan. Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes also gets involved and that makes for some interesting times. The question is, can Holmes and Watson foil Moriarty's plans? Well, as you can probably guess, those Spoiler Police with their fiendish disguises may well be in the room at this very moment, so I must be very careful not to say too much (again).As we've come to expect, this film looks great, Guy Richie really knows his craft and all the tricks are in evidence here. Some really superb 'bullet time' effects and some great fight scenes are fast becoming Richie's hallmark. A great soundtrack from Hans Zimmer also backs up the visuals perfectly. All the performances were great, in particular; Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as Dr, John Watson, both did a great job reprising the bromance that was so successful in the first film. Also worthy of note were; Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza Heron, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, Jared Harris as Professor James Moriarty, Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Paul Anderson as Colonel Sebastian Moran, Kelly Reilly as Mary Watson and Geraldine James as Mrs. Hudson.Lots of action, a fair smattering of comedy and a thrilling plot go together to make up this film. Most of it works pretty well, however there is a bit of a weak link and that is the part of the story involving the character played by the, woefully underused, Noomi Rapace. I thought it was a little weak and didn't quite have enough believability (for me). Having said that, the rest of the film was very thrilling and entertaining throughout with a great ending! Over all, I did enjoy this film a lot more than I thought I would at the beginning and so I'm very pleased to deem it Recommended.My score: 7.7/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 19,468 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 59/100 (based on 173 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

Facile pap,"I wrote my university thesis on Sherlock Holmes. This is a crock of rubbish. Hollywood-ized, exaggerated, unbearable trash. It seems to expect us to believe that Holmes is a Matrix-era Neo with super-hero-styled martial arts abilities. Downey could hardly overact more without this film being deemed sheer comedy. Indeed, that would be what this is, were it not so woefully bad. 'Suspension of Disbelief', anyone""? Aye...not even worth a free download. One wonders why anyone would pass this script or agree to act in it. It must just be a cynical hope that some money can be made. The first film had, at least, a slight nod to the brilliant restrained excellence of a TV actor such as Jeremy Brett, in his utterly British, ironic and subtle acting of the detective icon. Downey and whoever acts Holmes (he's too 2D for me to care who he is)simply dissolve into a pap of loud SFX and rushed stereotypical trash. All that is sloppy with modern Hollywood distilled. I give two stars for the waterfall finale with Holmes and Moiraty: that was poignant....sadly undone by a facile ending.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dull Retread,"I liked Guy Ritchie's first Sherlock Holmes movie, even though it had so little to do with Sherlock Holmes that one suspects the writer learned everything about the original from half-listening to a friend describe a story he'd read 20 years ago. But if you took it as a movie about characters that just happen to have names like Holmes and Watson but are otherwise their own thing, it was pretty decent.That cannot, alas, be said for the sequel, which is just plain dull. The movie lacks, for the most part, the intriguing flirtation between Holmes and Irene Adler, instead bringing in some strikingly bland characters to populate its muddled story. The direction seems unnecessarily gimmicky even compared to other Ritchie films, and while I wouldn't describe the movie as a *huge* waste of two hours, it is certainly two hours I could have spent in a better fashion.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

He would have never let his good friend Dr. Watson down, nor would he have harmed his wife in anyway. Mycroft would never have paraded around his home nude in front of a guest... the list goes on. I had to get up and leave the theater, it was so bad. Why is it when American's make a Holmes movie it is nothing like the story. Just follow Conan Doyle's books they are a hit on their own.

Sherlock Bond 006,"Author: unbekannternutzer from Switzerland this movie is a(nother) disappointing proof of the impression that most of the money in movie business is in the hand of the wrong people.this has nothing to do with anything anyone would associate with the sherlock holmes that has been main character of real literature. there is no connection visible whatsoever to that kind of clever developed character.dialog is stupid, unrealistic and scripted to a point that makes it unbelievably disappointing that the makers obviously think that the audience is completely dumbed down and wont recognize a pile of verbal garbage that is desperately modified to sound good.characters are completely unbelievable, shallow and exaggerated in a way one would expect to see in a comic movie. with the difference that in those movies the components fit together to create something interesting at least. this movie fails miserably there. it's a mess.story is non existent, calling it an excuse for the action scenes would give it too much credit. they are not even trying to do that.the action scenes you would expect from a super-hero movie. and that's what it actually is. it's iron man in medieval times without that metal suit trying to do some kind of parody of sherlock holmes. this is the only point of view that would make it work somehow.the actors are trying but it's a pointless effort with this direction and script.there is a lot more that is just wrong about this movie. i don't have words for it at the moment. it feels like the mess that they call movie has left my brain in a similarly messed up state.i am actually shocked to see this average rating it has at the moment. it cant be right. it just cant.---> This is just what I was thinking op the movie when it finally ended, James Bond the previous century!!!

"Nothing Up My Sleeve ( Or In My Head ), Dear Watson!","This film is not recommended.Those crazy cut-ups are back! Yes, in the tradition of Laurel & Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and Martin & Lewis comes Holmes and Watson, once again in a rip-roaring comedy adventure romp that brings thrills and action to the forefront while leaving reason and logic in its dust. This sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, continues the revisionist mode that made the first film so very popular. While it's not to my personal purist taste, the film is mildly diverting but elementarily unsatisfying.Yes, it's more of the same formula as the last installment: a mystery is afoot, solved not so much by the powers of reason and deduction. Instead, it's the explosions, gunfire, disguises, comic shenanigans, and some minor sleuthing on the side with a decidedly modern twist for today's younger audiences that embodies this Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as the resourceful Sherlock and his doctor friend and their gimmicky misadventures ensue.The plot this time around concerns the evil Professor Moriarty ( a formidable Jared Harris ) who wants to profit from the war any illegal way he can. It's not that deep or though- provoking. In fact, it's simplistic, obvious, and not the least bit involving. The script has its creative limits, with its anachronistic joking and puns. Previously the first film introduced elements of the the occult which made that film hackneyed and tired. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows leaves those elements behind and now it tries to wisely plays up the political drama and intrigue on a more realistic scale. Unfortunately, this sequel is even more simplistic, obvious, and less interesting than its predecessor.Of course, it's still up to Holmes and Watson to stop the villainous professor. Of course, it's still the exquisitely detailed sets and high octane set pieces that are the series' trademarks to success. Of course, it's still the frenzied editing of the film that invigorates the mystery. But the film, though technically adept, is a muddled mess in the script department. The true culprit is not Moriarty, it's screenwriters Michele and Kieran Mulroney who are to blame for their less than stellar contribution to this series.All of the expert direction is by Guy Ritchie, who again helms this franchise. But he cannot disguise the gaping holes of logic and inconclusive storytelling. Ritchie knows how to keep the action flowing with his stylish kinetic movement and stop action techniques ( which become far too repetitive and overstay their welcome ). Nothing ever lulls. This is robust filmmaking and there's no time to think about any loopholes with the script or its characters. It's ADHD time, fast, loose, and impulsive. Keep it moving by all means possible.Perhaps one sequence, a beautifully choreographed montage of still images and action shots, provides a clue to the film's visceral adrenaline rush and its lack of emotional connection and build-up. The high point of the film comes as our heroes try to escape an attack in the forest, bullets ricochet off the trees in an almost slo-mo ballet of sorts as the figures weave and dance around the exploding shards of wood. The fragmenting in this woodland environ is exquisitely photographed by Philippe Rousselot and enhanced by the Hans Zimmer's musical score. One can admire the imagery in this scene and many others. Yet this overall effect continually undercuts any tension or suspense and distances the moviegoer from any real integration to the non-stop action on the screen.The actors seem to be relishing their roles and hoping the moviegoers like the film's tongue- in-cheek humor and daredevil stunts. Their ""bromance"" continues in the capable hands of pros like Downey and Law. Their chemistry remains palpable and their comic timing cannot be faulted. While there are some weaknesses with some of the other cast members, particularly an underused Noomi Rapace and overindulgent Stephen Fry as mere comic relief, they really never advance the plot but they don't interfere with the escapist mood of the film either.Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a game of deception, but not of shadows as its title may suggest. Instead, the film plays a game of smoke and mirrors with the audience, trying to grab their attention although it really has no substance or clear vision in its empty head. Its sleight-of-hand may manipulate some critics or moviegoers with its cheap thrills, but its visual tricks are slight indeed.

Just one sequence is worth it.,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) The certainly most famous detective of all times returns in an action packed adventure of lies and treachery. Holmes and his side kick Watson are trying to assemble bits and pieces of a puzzle to find out the identity of the person who is behind terrorist attacks, that took place in Europe, and foil his evil plans.After watching over half an hour, trying to find out where all this was going, I found myself closing my eyes (unwillingly) for a couple of minutes, because of boredom, simply bad slapstick comedy and more then horrendous storytelling. The Screenplay is predictable, yet ununderstandable, trying to hard on creating a suspenseful script a la Robert Ludlum. Nevertheless, after an hour we get to know where the screenwriter wants to take us, but the beginning is just messy.The Direction and the photography (technically speaking) have pros and contras - I appreciated a lot the use of tripods and other technical devices like travelling or steady cam to get some clean still shots at the actors and make the action more comprehensible. Specially nowadays, that most Hollywood action movies are shot with shaky cam. Simply embarrassing. - Less appreciated, was the fact of non innovative narrating, everything is as we expect it to be. The fighting sequences are rather slow, using multiple slow motions, way over used and sometimes repeating the same action too often which kills the surprise effectThe editing is likable in most non violent sequences. During the fights, it is flashy and unbearable at most. Already seen jump cuts in the time motion makes the action anything else then fluid. The rhythm of the whole narration is rather deceiving, boring and maybe too distracting sometimes.The actors did quite well. But I wouldn't throw flowers on the stage either.I am not wise in special effects but they are mostly well done and I must admit that I was quite impressed in the forest bombing sequence. The Time Motion jump cut was rather pleasant, I would even say needed if not, actually impressive in that sequence.Anyway, Guy Ritchie has proved to me once more, that he is a very talented director who lost it all after Snatch. Not even with a Blockbuster, bearing the name of one of the most respected Man on earth ever, was he capable of returning to his magnificence of filmmaking. For me, Guy is a one hit wonder and will always be. 4 out of 10 for an unmemorable movie, but a plus for one impressive sequence.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One more proof that IMDBs voting system is utterly useless...,"Having seen a few trailers for GoS, I actually wrote it off. Ritchie's first Holmes movie was okay, but not great. Still, I like his style plus i like Downey Jr., Law and Rapace. So, when I suddenly read many positive reviews from fellow moviegoers on IMDb I made a grave error: I took them for real. And bought the DVD. I should have known, that reviewers, that rave for one movie (but have, according to their history, never seen another) are most likely plants: pr-agencies, marketing- and one-review-industrial-accounts.I paid dearly.What's good about this movie? The direction is solid - even though it is the fourth (or fifth?) remake of ""Lock, stock..."". I'd wish that Ritchie would eventually broaden his visual and narrative style. Acting is okay. Visuals are okay.So - what's wrong? Pretty much everything else. But the main problem is: This movie has no plot, no script no story. The characterizations - if any - are ludicrous. The story arc is incoherent. Worst of all: It is plain boring. I could have switched off anywhere in the movie and would not have missed a thing. Alas: the dog fell asleep on the remote.It's a shame, that by now almost every new movie get's a terrific rating on IMDb instantly. Sure: it's an Amazon company and Amazon want's to sell.

I walked out of the cinema on that one and I vowed never to go back.

"A trainwreck. Movie about buffoonery, not Sherlock Holmes. Should have called it buffoonic Captain Britannica","There is an uneasy vibe one gets from the trailer of the new Sherlock Holmes movie, a vibe that the movie might suck and dear god does it suck and suck hard. Where do I start? The awful grating British accent of Downey which falls apart in that sped up, manic tone that Sherlock Holmes has throughout the movie or the super-hero Sherlock Holmes that can do the entire Jackie Chan routine in his head or that the entire plot is dumb as a rock, especially for a movie with the words Sherlock Holmes in its title.The movie does feel high budget. There are expensive looking shots and special effects that litter the movie as the Europe-trotting duo go on their adventure. However, the main theme of the movie is costumed buffoonery - Holmes disguises himself as a woman (for some weak plot points), Watson has a bachelor party, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson squabble like an old couple while we get bombarded with a bevy of unlikable buffoons like Holmes' brother and a squawky Prof Moriatry. All of this buffoonery going on in a paper thin plot, a plot that feels like its been lifted from Captain America; Germans and weapons. Captain American Britannica would be a more accurate title than Sherlock Holmes.There are bombings because it seems like they had a budget for a bomb exploding and wanted some costumed bomb explosions. The plot doesn't tell a story but more like puts all the set-pieces into a time line.

Sherlock Holmes was really James Bond??,"In this dumbed-down society we live in where people seem to thrive on films brimming with explosions and car chases I can see why this film appeals to so many. However, to those of us who actually expected (perhaps naively) to see a Sherlock Holmes film with some good story telling, strong characters and something to actually stimulate our brains, it fails to deliver. In fact, on numerous occasions, I was battling to stay awake.I don't have a problem with Robert Downey Jr or Jude Law as actors, but in this film they weren't at all believable. In fact, if I had walked in through the middle of this film without knowing what it was and without hearing familiar names, I'd have had no idea that it was supposed to be a Holmes story at all. Overall the film is daft, shallow and boring, feebly attempting to rely on the cheap thrills of action over plot and with, at times, all-over-the-place camera action to make even those with the strongest stomach feel somewhat dizzy and queasy. And why all the humour? Is the film supposed to be a mickey-take or a parody? I think not, so why inject all the humour? It's totally unnecessary and only serves to pull severely away from the Holmes stories and characters. If you're going to make a Sherlock Holmes film then you may as well do it properly or not at all.In summary, perhaps if you go into it imagining that somehow James Bond has been transported back in time and is pretending to be Sherlock Holmes, then it might be almost palatable. Otherwise it's a complete let down, a shambolic excuse for a film.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing sequel.,"I enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes a lot. The mystery, the dynamic between Watson and Sherlock and the camera work was brilliant.This sequel disappointed me. Unnecessary ultra-slow motion effects, an overly eccentric Sherlock, messy plot, superhero action ('Sherlock vision' is kinda ridiculous) and lack of investigation ruined this movie for me. It feels as if the movie has been created for the sake of showing off. Even the 'bad guy' doesn't get the chance of showing his acting abilities - and the man can definitely act!It seems Guy Richie couldn't handle the success of the first movie. I hope for the third installment (if there will be any), he'll focus on story, characters and dialog instead of fancy effects and locations.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Looks Good, But The Story Isn't",I think that most Sherlock Holmes fans enjoy his tales because he uses his intelligence to see what others don't see. Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is basically a smart ass who was a bit of a action figure from the 1800's. If not for the wonderful sets and great actors the movie would have been a real worthless piece of crap. The story was confusing as it went on until the end when more was revealed. Up to then there's all these action scenes that really don't make a great deal of sense most of the time. There's so many really good Sherlock Holmesstories out there.

Mediocre sequel,"Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in the sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. While I still maintain that the films would have been more enjoyable if the casting were reversed, the way each character is written is cemented even further in this second installment. Robert Downey Jr. is the eccentric detective, and Jude Law is the boring, superfluous straight man who's consistently annoyed by his partner's antics. The setting for this film is Jude Law's wedding to Kelly Reilly. In the art of storytelling, when a character is married the audience is usually supposed to see that his or her journey is complete and their usefulness to the plot is over. So, Jude Law's character is viewed as even more boring and superfluous!As Jude and Kelly are supposed to be enjoying their honeymoon, the famed villain Moriarty, played by Jared Harris, attacks, leaving Bob to save the day, and leaving Jude to continuously complain that he'd rather be enjoying his wife than fighting bad guys. Still, if you liked the first film, Sherlock Holmes, you'll probably like the sequel. The action-comedies are pretty similar, and director Guy Ritchie returns with his slow-motion action scenes. These aren't my favorite Sherlock Holmes films, but they're not terrible either. I just would have preferred Jude Law as the lead.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not about Sherlock Holmes,"I think Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law would make a very good pair for a Sherlock Holmes movie, but unfortunately this movie is nothing but action and explosions - i.e, it is a movie about with two main characters named ""Holmes"" and ""Watson"" but there ends the resemblance with Arthur Conan Doyle's work.If you are looking for a video game style shoot-em-up movie then this is for you. If you know who Basil Rathbone is and you are in the mood for that, by all means avoid ""A Game of Shadows"" It is visually interesting but absolutely sucks as a Holmes movie.There are some good, if small, efforts to build the credibility of Downey Jr as a Holmes character but they are even too extreme for Doyle's style. There is no sense of class from Downey Jr in this role - it's as though he's remaking a Victorian version of ""Iron Man"" and it's an awful portrayal of Holmes. He appears to possess not just a superhuman intellect, which he should, but superhuman hearing and vision. Um, no. Apparently this Holmes is also a prizefighter - huh?Finally, the cinematography in the numerous action scenes (making up more than half of the movie with visually interesting but utterly mindless fluff) is bizarre. There is a hyper-focus on minutia such as extreme closeups of bullets flying by characters in slow motion. Numerous explosions are painstakingly displayed in three dimensions, crawling slowly across the screen in super slo-mo. It's like examining a hair on a fly's eye from every possible angle . . . for 60 minutes non-stop.If you are interested in a modern interpretation of Sherlock Holmes that Doyle would recognize, continue looking (check out the BBC's version?)",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Game of Insipid,"** out of (****)Back in X-mas '09, Richie unleashed ""Sherlock Holmes"", which rang with critics as well as audiences alike. It was inclusive to a few clever gags, some well choreographed action set pieces, and a slick, neat style. Fast-forward twenty four months later and you have the exact opposite. ""Shadows"" may be eccentric and ambitious in its attempts, but the result is rather unsatisfying. What's even more disappointing to hear is how the film starts off with a bang, but unfortunately lets up before its two hours clocks in.I won't waste my time and energy deciphering the plot since it's pretty much the same concept except with some twists and turns thrown in along the way, so onto the acting. First of all, the performances are undoubtedly up to par. Without the star power, the films wouldn't carry its weight as great as they have. Downey Jr, Law, Rapace, and McAdams give it their all. In terms of a script? Very jumbled. I will say this though: If you look at the movie in parts, it's a whole other film (an impressive one). But alas, since the film has to run its course, watching it all play out is like watching someone re-arrange the pieces of a Jigsaw puzzle. You know that in pieces its parts are much greater than as a whole.The major knock against this film is the pacing. The film begins with this ferocious first hour. Action-heavy sequences interspersed with smart dialogue and a very well-guided direction. But once the second hour hits, the script/writing/direction is too misguided. If you're coming here for one thing- and one thing only: The cinematography is definitely up there. Every scene soars with its visuals. Same with its action.If you want a full-throttle of a ride, ambitious and daring in its actions, see the first half and then leave. The second is not worth bothering for. Richie, for number tres, take a bit more time on how you map out your film direction. It's unfortunate to see such a promising start with such a wimp of an ending. ""A Game of Shadows"" quickly fades to ""A Game of Insipid"".",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
'A wandering minstrel I --A thing of shreds and patches..',"That quote form a Gilbert and Sullivan lyric defines this movie's appearance. Remember that particular pleasure of reading Arthur Conan Doyle's intelligent and vastly entertaining stories about a man and his sidekick whose braininess unraveled impossible mysteries that no one else could solve? That man was Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick was Dr. Watson, and neither of the ghosts of those two fascinating and intelligent gentlemen can be found in this lengthy, boring mess of a film that seems to be concerned only with action movie clones so popular today and setting in a period that allows beautiful costumes to hide the lack of story. Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney are responsible for hiding behind famous literary characters to create a script that is likely less than 5 pages long. Guy Ritchie is the star of this noisy piece.Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and his longtime trusted associate, Doctor Watson (Jude Law), take on their arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), with the help of Holmes's older brother Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) and a gypsy named Simza (Noomi Rapace). Now make a movie-long story out of that and you have the second installment (and hopefully the last) of Sherlock Holmes a la Guy Ritchie. The endless fighting on the screen is also populated by some fine actors such as Rachel McAdams, Eddie Marsan, and Kelly Reilly. If the viewer is entertained by the countless costume changes by Robert Downey, Jr. and by some fairly silly swashbuckling by all concerned then perhaps the two hours will pass quickly. But in the end there is simply no story or resemblance to the creations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to warrant plagiarism of his books. Pass.Grady Harp",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Inane.,"Peppered with enough pointless slow mo and colourful explosions to keep most people happy Sherlock Holmes 2 is bloated and direction-less. It just about flirts with a vague and familiar plot involving an evil genius and a possible world war but never quite embraces it properly and fully. The film also manages to skip any meaningful character and story progression by virtue of a succession of languid expository sequences and monologues. Furthermore, it fails to engage or involve the audience as its overtly 'clever' central characters have to constantly remind us what is going on and more importantly, why we should care. The trick with this kind of movie is to show us the intellectual merit of our characters but to always let the audience be smarter, it has to be this way otherwise there is no connection, no cinematic symbiosis.It is too easy to lambaste the film for not holding true to the source material, so i wont do that here but it is important to note that the film is astonishingly short on mystery or indeed, any interesting ideas. Instead we get so-called 'clever' disguises, whimsical plotting and an overwhelming sludge of absurdity more akin to that of a Tom Cruise era Mission Impossible film.Finally, Guy Ritchie continues to be director of interest although this is not always due to the importance or success of his films. Indeed, he seems to have a few ideas up his sleeves but sadly gleams too much delight from showing us the same ones over and over again from project to project. How is the fighting between Sherlock and his faceless baddies here any different to Brad Pitt's bare knuckle forays in Snatch? Also, how long can we endure the Tarantino-lite, pseudo-intellectual rumblings of his central characters who seem intent on talking around the films hollow plotting with puffed up similes and mindless metaphors.Anyways, this all results in the movie being a mildly watchable piece of cinematic pap.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Magic and clever investigation replaced with fights and CGI,"I truly hate Hollywood when they totally destroy an original idea/concept or old great character and then they proceed to 'rambo- modify' it to fit the actual time.Sherlock Homes, the first one was a complete and utter useless movie and the second part seems to do pretty much the same.The great charisma of Robert Downey Jr does not save the movie from it's obvious flaws.. and they all converge into just one point. Character.Actual Hollywood seems to think that Sherlock Holmes is boring, so, they mutated his character into some kind of SWAT-Rambo-Hard-to-Kill-Know-all- Kung-Fu-Styles person.This completely annihilate the concept of the Sherlock doing detective work, the mind over matter, intelligence over physical attributes... I could go on and on..Game of Shadows gets deeper into this game, alternating action scenes with calm scenes with abundance of useless dialog pretending to be intelligent but, in the end, only confuses their audience.The movie has too much action for a ""Sherlock Holmes"" or, any detective movie that could be called like that.This all could be forgotten if we somehow had some interesting characters, a compelling storyline or some kind of magic in the film itself, but, none of this are present.Instead, we get a flat movie that displays as a succession of one scene after the other with no connection whatsoever between them, really great actors with stupid lines and no compelling reason to do what they do.I totally lost hope for a nice Sherlock Holmes movie and suggest anyone looking for a intelligent and challenging movie to look elsewhere, this is just popcorn junk delivered to young audiences that have absolutely no idea who Sherlock Holmes actually was.Oh, and the Matrix-Like scenes about Sherlock taking down enemies, it probably was a good scene if it was in ""Terminator XX"", but done in a movie about a charismatic detective with a talent for thinking, it feels SO wrong..Not worth the title, probably if they changed it to anything else would be a passable popcorn movie, but exploiting such a wonderful character as this, is insulting.Sad times indeed for cinema.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Copy, paste and forget the secret ingredient. Still cool...","It seems that the writers managed to detect whatever people liked from the first movie, and literally repeated that hoping to please them again. The worst is that, reading other reviews, this cheap initiative worked fine for most of them. But there's something even more threatening than cloning your own movies. In the first movie, Holmes is confronted to apparent magical powers challenging his skills and reasoning (which is the most important thing in the plot), while in the second, is the plan simply lowered to an evil strategy around warfare? You can even see Holmes and Watson holding a gun in the DVD cover and posters... food for thought.Let me go a bit further in guessing. This reminds me what happened with The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Daemons, the former with truth and depth, the latter with lies and lack of imagination. It makes me wander if somebody from outside the cinema industry has affected both Sherlock Holmes and Da Vinci Code sequels for some reason.One more thing, the dialogs are twisted way too much, compared to the meaningful, short and hilarious punch lines succeeded in the first movie.Now the good thing about A Game of Shadows is the adventure, the chemistry between the actors and that this version of Sherlock Holmes is totally enjoyable and cool.

"My dear Watson, it appears we've become caricatures of ourselves...","The first Sherlock film, while surely a departure from the traditional way a Holmes story is told, I thought to be quite enjoyable, despite its few flaws. Game of shadows, however is an entirely different experience- and not in a good way. I won't sit and dissect the entire plot if the movie, but I will tell you what it does well, and what it fails miserably at doing.The good: There is no shortage of witty banter or a good time to be had watching the two leading men go about their mysterious trade. When the action scenes occur, they are fast- paced and visually stimulating to watch. The film does a wonderful job at being an authentic-feeling period piece ( for the most part.) Characters are often dirty, bleeding, and they retain their bruises for days after a skirmish. Also notable is the score, which contributes to the mystique of the Holmes universe, but with a smattering of action film- style ambiance added into the mix.The Bad: Unfortunately, so many things are wrong with this film. I could buy in the first film that, given his genius level and insatiable appetite to learn, Holmes was a skilled fighter. However, game of shadows seems to endow him with superhero qualities, as he dispatches trained soldiers, Russian Cossack ninja's, and the like. The film falls flat during most scenes and lacks interesting character development, personality, and subplots altogether. Downey and Law are THE only element keeping the film afloat most times. More frustrating is the films over-use of the bullet time sequences, and the strong vibe that the movie is thoroughly impressed with itself throughout the entire sitting. Particularly eye- roll inducing is what I like to call the ""Jack Sparrow"" effect; in that the producers seem to think the audience are a bunch of idiots who ONLY want to see Holmes at his absolute craziest. This is forced in every scene, and the result is an, almost, cartoon version of Downey's portrayal in the first film. Lastly is the movie's lack of direction and ""bite"" to its plot. Most times it's unclear what the objective is. And Moriarty's lack of showing his criminal genius is a missed opportunity, his evil plans somewhat esoteric.Bottom line:Game if shadows is worth a rental if you're a fan. But don't expect to be dazzled. Shadows is at it's best when playing up the tense moments of deduction by Holmes and company, but those moments are few and far-fetched. Sometimes great actors are given not-so-great material. (I'm looking at YOU, Phantom Menace)",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

'Observancy is a dying art.',"So sayeth the late, great Stanley Kubrick regarding the self-perceived genius of his final film. He was talking about the tiny details inserted into every scene of Eyes Wide Shut, leaving the sharp-eyed viewer with more questions than answers with every viewing. Sherlock Holmes' ability to notice these fine points, and the camera's ability to linger on them just long enough to give you a fighting chance of solving the problem before he does, is one of the few quality aspects of this film. As for the rest of it, A Game of Shadows adheres to the typical conventions of a sequel. That is, bigger, louder and more ambitious, but ends up being nowhere near as fun as its predecessor.With Dr. Watson (Jude Law) happy to have the events of the past behind him, he makes plans for his long-overdue marriage. That is until news spreads regarding a series of mysterious bombings in and around London. Never one to work alone, Watson is again dragged into the deep end by the crafty Holmes (Robert Downey Jnr.). And so, with the help of Holmes' highly inappropriate brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry) and Simza the gypsy (Noomi Rapace), they are led to Holmes' greatest adversary, the evil but equally cunning Moriarty (Jared Harris).If that sounds more like a trailer blurb than a synopsis, it is because attempting to explain this plot in detail would only result in digging a deeper hole. One of the strengths of the first instalment (trying to steer away from the word 'original' here) was a plot that was balanced enough to keep the viewer's attention without seeming too simple, and allowing for some enjoyable interplay between the utterly immersive Holmes and Watson. This time around, however, director Guy Ritchie substitutes substance for style, placing great importance on keeping the film moving from place to place to place with very little deduction in between.These efforts to keep the audience's mind occupied actually end up having negative effects, as the film degrades into more of a visual spectacle, and less of a romping mystery, with every passing scene. In fact, from the absurd set piece involving a firefight on a train halfway through the film, the rest of the story seems to almost give up on anything that could even be considered rational or believable. Suspension of disbelief is a key requirement when watching films like this, sure, but Shadows takes things to new levels of foolishness, wasting the chance to deliver a fresh, clever sequel.Despite these occasionally over-the-top moments, the action is mostly well directed, albeit with a tendency to overuse slow motion and crash zooms at key moments. Holmes' re-imagining as an expert martial artist is still fun to watch, and his methods of predicting his opponent's entire move set before the fight has even begun are more refined in this film. His prior planning to prevent poor performance meets its match during the climax when we see Moriarty studying Holmes in the same way, resulting in the film's best moment by a long margin.Speaking of our hero's arch-nemesis, Moriarty's presence is disappointingly underwhelming. The best villains are able to invoke a feeling of dread even when off-screen, but it seems this much-lauded mastermind is content to be the office general; watching the good guys fight off hordes of faceless henchmen while he sits in his swivel chair, stroking his cat and practicing his best 'I've been expecting you.' Again, this is not the actor's fault- the character simply suffers from inadequate screen time to develop a truly menacing persona, while other insignificant side characters clog up the scenery (not including Rapace's Simza, who has the whole hippie-gypsy dread thing going on to great effect).But, for all its pitfalls, it would be unfair to give this film anything less than a straight average score, particularly in the light of almost all other blockbuster franchises still alive today. Yes, RDJ's characterisation has regressed from 'charmingly pompous' to 'borderline psychopath' in the last two years, but he and Law still try their darndest to make it work.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Michele and Kieran Mulroney, best known for writing and directing the bizarre movie Paper Man in 2009, find a way to produce a screenplay that makes the literary legend of Sherlock Holmes boring.

Guy Ritchie's directing style worked well in his past films Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but comes across as very jarring here. His endless quick cuts and slow-mo action shots stripped the film of any excitement and give it an endless snail pace.Downey Jr. and Law deliver a few laughs together, and their chemistry attempts to give this movie some semblance of entertainment value, but in the end the it has too many strikes against it for them to overcome.

Boring and unable to hold my attention.,"If the first film was relatively pleasant and positively entertaining, this film is a complete disappointment. Boring from start to finish, it brings no intriguing mystery and merely turns the most famous English detective into a relatively eccentric action figure.If one of the biggest problems of the first film, for me, was the anachronism of the characters, too 21st century in their behaving for the Victorian era, the problem of this film is different, although the weight of anachronism is also felt. For me, the biggest problem here is a poorly written script, without an intriguing mystery to solve in which we can follow the protagonists. In fact, the film explains everything right from the beginning, and everything that comes after is a kind of search for evidence, where Holmes tries everything to prove Moriarty's culpability in the bombings and his intention of provoking a war. That is not enough for me.The cast is generally good. Again, Robert Downey Jr. is the star and does his job well, despite the degree of eccentricity and unlikelihood of his character. Here, if flaws existed, they were due to the material he received and not to his work. On the positive side, I highlight Jude Law, very good in a more discreet and naturally British character; Noomi Rapace was a good addition also, and looks gypsy enough to look credible; Jared Harris is an excellent Moriarty, as cold, cultured and brilliant as required by the character. Stephen Fry and Kelly Reilly are average: they made good performances but their characters, despite the important support given, seem very limited and appear only in specific moments. Besides, they both had problems: Reilly looked bad in that costume and Fry was pompous to the point of being annoying. On the negative side, I highlight Rachel McAdams' very expendable cameo, Paul Anderson's little relevance and Eddie Marsan's marginalization, with the actor being demoted to the role of an extra.Technically, the film is excellent and has very high production values and a lot of money clearly invested. Cinematography is very pleasant, although there are moments when the use of slow motion was unnecessary. Good colors, good filming work and a pleasant look, together with sets and costumes usually according to the time and the environment, deserve a very positive note of attention and contribute to making this film palatable and visually elegant. There is a lot of imagination in all and credibility is a problem that could be felt. The pace is good, even better than in the first film, but the soundtrack, despite being good enough, is not that good nor does it bring news, seeming to have been entirely recycled from the first film.Personally, I expected more. Despite being a little far-fetched, with some anachronistic characters and other small problems, what really displeased me was the lack of a good plot that would hold my attention.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But if you want some of that and something more then honestly the breakneck pace of this leaves no breathing room whatsoever, it's all at one pace, which may be exciting and thrilling, but it is also not very entertaining.Left feeling like my brain had been assaulted rather than entertained. Too much action not enough sleuthing and way too much editing and directing. I'm getting old. =/",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pile of Cr@p,Maybe you all thing differently but Holmes was a detective.He looked at the evidence and deduced the crime. He now seems like James bond with more. he is able to fight and even predict the movements of his opponents.Holmes was a character that reviewed the facts from s crime and items that were not noticed and put the jigsaw together.He can predict a fight before it can take place!! The slow motions just seem more like the matrixFor me this is nothing to do with the real sherlock Holmes that went to a crime that has happened and solves it.,3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not for Sherlock Holmes Fans,"Taking one of the most iconic literary and film characters and turning him into an action film lead is ridiculous. Doing it with two of the finest actors of our time is blasphemous. Sad waste of money, intellect and time.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not Sherlock Holmes,"It's not Sherlock Holmes. It's just a tiresome action movie, over-reliant on CGI and over-the-top set pieces, that ruin the feel for the period in which it is set. In this one Holmes appears to have a superpower that enables him to glimpse into the future not unlike Nicholas Cage in Next (Which btw is a much better film). File this next to League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Wonder Woman.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
German's Wake Up,"For the past three years I have developed the habit of watching movies and by now I have watched over 1600 movies mainly of the year 2009-2012. After watching the Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), I was unable to stop myself to write a review at IMDb, the movie clearly depicts the German's Army consists of useless soldiers, the country which in reality has conquered almost all of Europe, in the early history of the 20th century was shown in the most degrading and humiliating manner. The entire squad at the bomb factory was so nincompoop that they were unable to stop a band of four guys and a woman. They used all possible means even the heavy artillery guns but failed miserably. It is requested that the movie maker may be suggested that please make things more realistic than fairy tales, thanks.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Off to a slow finish..?,"Allow me to expand, I found the first Sherlock Holmes an outstanding film, its original but not on the point of experimental. Robert Downey Jr. is a thrill and a laugh to watch in most of his appearances; As Sherlock Holmes though, he was something else, a brilliant mixture of intellect and humour.. Which, in most cases, equals sarcasm on the brink of annoyance. Now, in this one, I think he decided to take the jump, and land straight in the ball-pit we call annoyance.. And the only thing that structures him as a character is maybe being a little bit of a badass, MAYBE. The film start of slow and, yes, ends in a cliff-hanger but getting to the cliff is not a thrilling journey so.. Is it worth it? I've tried to watch the film twice; the first time I managed to get through the first half, the second time I found myself distracting myself during the first half, purely to get to the second. NEVERTHELESS, it is still a movie, a Sherlock Holmes movie too! The picture is great and there are some good action scenes.. But don't expect to be sitting through the credits with a stupid look on your face like 'that was AMAZING' cos its more than likely you're going to be sat there staring at your phone or half-asleep.. or both.",,Anonymous,Mystery
new  adventures,"a nice surprise. same tension, same inspired plot, and remarkable war between bad and good guys. crumbs of history and extraordinary scenes . and art to gives total show. one of its virtues - chess game. the second - presence of Stephen Fry who does ideal role for a substantial detail to film. basic ingredient of success - it is not only a sequel. only new page. the silhouette of novel is more present and the fight scenes are only introduction to a more profound question. all as result of precise measure of a director for who eccentric manner to reflect things is just personal sign. and proof of Robert Downey Jr extraordinary science to give to a character a lot of qualities.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Henry and Kristl shed a light on Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011),"""So that was a cool version of Sherlock Holmes, a bit matrix like..,"" Henry said. He was savoring a triple XXX in his lap from which he took small sips.""The slow moves certainly give me that impression,"" Kristl said. She was drinking some tea that Henry made for her because she was of the coffee and boos. For the moment at least.""A regular action movie with lots of special effects and cool moments. As a movie it is cool how they let you see how Holmes can predict what is going to happen.""""A far cry from Conan Doyle's hero though.""""Maybe.. but those series were getting dull anyway and certainly needed some 21st century updating.""""I am not sure I like the result.""""I wouldn't have expected anything less from you,"" Henry said wistfully.""You know me too well,"" Kristl grinned.""Hey.. I just see movies as entertainment, you see them like.. like..ehh"" Henry rubbed his forehead.""Art?""""Yeah.. art. Make that Art.""""It's a different viewpoint.I just can't help it and think that with all the eye candy effects and the whammy specials, the essence of Sherlock Holmes just evaporated. I mean, Holmes doing Kung Fu fighting? That is something new. And Holmes in a setting outside of Great Britain? That is new for me also. And having a prominent brother? I think there is one in the original books and I understand he is even more brilliant than Sherlock is. His main weakness being that he never leaves his house, which makes Sherlock more effective. But here he seems some important guy, although I do not know what his role exactly is.""""That is the difference between you and me. I just take it as it comes..""""That is why some people say it sucks and other people say it is great. I would not have minded if they had just done away with all the Sherlock Holmes characters and pasted something new on it. For the resemblance is tenuous at best.""""But otherwise I think that the movie is entertaining. A lot of special effects, weird settings, gadgets and gunfights. And it never slows down."" ""That is true. Granted, Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law make the most of their characters, but that the story just goes all over the place and is so ridiculous that the movie turns out to be plain silly. The specials effect and the miraculous savings make the movie even more odd ball. It is just showy with no depth at all. It has nothing to offer but eye candy. I have not connection to any of the characters as there is just nothing to connect to. They are just empty shells.""""A shallow movie?"" Henry laughed.""Rambo has more depth than this. Even the league of extraordinary gentlemen has more depth.""""That doesn't make it a bad movie, I would say.""""No.. but it certainly does not make it last. It is a movie that has some impact now but it will quickly fade from memory, because there is nothing in it to make it memorable. To make it last.""""Suits me fine. An evenings entertainment is all I need.""""I am sorry to hear that.""""It makes life more easy to live, baby,"" Henry grinned.""What did you just call me?""""Uhmm.""""Just keep on uhmming..""www.meritcoba.com",,Anonymous,Mystery
Sherlock:  Scintillating Sequel,"Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law – They just seem to go well together like Ben & Jerry, like peanut butter and jelly, like . . . . . Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, respectively.Once again, we find the two friends, Holmes and Watson, attempting to outwit Sherlock's archenemy, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). During John Watson's bachelor party, Holmes saves the life of Moriarty's intended victim, a fortune-telling gypsy, Madame Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace). She joins forces with Holmes, his brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry), and Watson in their wild escapades across Europe, as they pursue Moriarty.(Seeing Rapace in this role, it was hard to remember that she was Lisbeth Salander in the 2009 Swedish film trilogy, starting with ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."")This is director Guy Ritchie's second Sherlock adventure. Despite the violence, I liked the sequel more than his original 2009 ""Sherlock Holmes."" Special effects, in this 2011 comedic action/adventure, were spectacular. The starring pair of unintentional buffoons made me laugh. Plot development was a bit SLOW here and there, but the well-timed antics and wisecracks were STEADY.In a convoluted and unrelated way, I agree with Sherlock's line: ""Slow and steady wins the race.""",,Anonymous,Mystery
some of the same flaws as the first but still entertaining,"With much time having passed since their last daring adventure, capricious bobby Holmes and fickle Dr. Watson reunite to celebrate Watson's long-awaited marriage, but the betrothal quickly becomes a secondary concern when a formidable adversary--the maniacally brilliant Professor Moriarty--unleashes a devious, elaborate scheme that spells trouble for all those who oppose him. Slow going at first, and like its predecessor bogged down by a convoluted plot, but eventually kicks into gear with really tense action scenes, nifty special effects, witty humor, ingenious twists, and of course the joy of seeing lead actors Downey and Law play their parts to a tee. ***",,Anonymous,Mystery
It is perfect!,"Firstly I started to watch this film but I did not watch it. I was bored. Then, my body said that you must watch Sherlock Holmes and it is great movie. So, I started to watch again.When the film was ended, I was shocked. The film exceeded my expectations.Afterwards I watch Sherlock Holmes 1.And I understood that Sherlock Holmes every times is famous thanks to his intelligence not his fighting ability. From the beginning to end, there were excellent acting. Especially, the last part of this movie was perfect. The scenarist produces wonders.Every detail is thought that this film is based on details. It has not got a lot of action. I laughed most of scenes. I will suggest to my friends every time. And I added to it the first five of my top 25 lists. I will watch it again and again .It was great! You should watch it certainly if you do not watch.",,Anonymous,Mystery
