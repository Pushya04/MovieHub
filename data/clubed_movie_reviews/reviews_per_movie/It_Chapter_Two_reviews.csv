"Call me ""old fashioned,"" but CGI monster overkill does nothing for me","I really, realllly wanted to like this film. As a huge fan of the original mini-series (and EVERYTHING Tim Curry), I knew I'd have a challenge going into both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 with an open mind. I had to separate. I didn't have as high of expectations as I did for Chapter 1 as Part 2 of the mini series was much weaker than the Part 1 anyway as well as Stephen King's It (Book).The actors were great. Even the first few jump scares were decent, and then it just became overkill. And not scary whatsoever. All of the CGI monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment. I grew up watching 80s/90s horror (AND LOVING IT). The baddies were REAL and TERRIFYING. For example, Mrs. Massey, the bloated bathtub corpse in The Shining. That was a real, completely horrifying image that has stayed with me 30 years after I First saw the movie. I don't understand the obsession with CGI when there's no need for it.Sadly, this movie was just a drawn out bore.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Flawed yet semi-satisfying,"I was originally hesitant to see director Andy Muschietti's rendition of Stephen King's beloved book ""It"" back in 2017, but after hearing splendid reviews from fans and critics; I took a chance and came out pleasantly surprised. Since then, I agree with why that is now considered by many to be a modern Horror classic.Now our favorite Losers club are back to face Pennywise again in ""It: Chapter Two"". Adding up all of that and that this is my second most anticipated mainstream film of the year, does it live up to the hype? Well, somewhat. It's an imperfect but solid sequel.In spite of a three hour runtime it kept my attention for the entire ride. Like ""Chapter One""; it's wonderfully shot (with effective use of sepia tone colors) and the editing and scene transitions are eye popping. Many of the dialogue and scares are cleverly written (a scene at a restaurant is a highlight).In spite of an often unsettling plot, there is plenty of levity to be found here. It unfortunately suffers from inappropriate timing with many of the jokes, causing the film to play like a dark comedy. Half of the frightening and dramatic moments are finished by gags and one-liners. There is one scary sequence that really works until it's ruined by a joke straight out of a Deadpool film.The pacing is troubling at times; since some of the opening introductions are rushed, while certain flashbacks to the younger versions of the Losers Club could've been shorter. This makes the narrative not feel as fresh or as fulfilled compared to the first film.It's most accomplished at being an emotionally fulfilling journey for the Losers club. This is sharpened by the adult actors being dead ringers for the kids from the original; including the main highlight Bill Hader- an instant classic as Richie, as he combines the best of his talent from ""Saturday Night Live"" with intense urgency to best serve the idea of ""What would Richie from It be like if he grew up?""If you're looking for a good cinematic start for this Halloween season, and something to bring you back all the feels from Chapter One from September 2017; Chapter Two is a somewhat messy but nicely done job.Grade- B",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""It Chapter Two"": Too Long for Too Little","In 1913, Henry Ford introduced the assembly line to the Ford Motor Company. He made a ton of money and was hailed as a leading innovator. Now just a hundred years later, director Andy Musciehtti brings that same assembly line principle to It Chapter Two as he serves up his scary products in the exact fashion as the one before.This sequel to the highest-grossing horror movie of all time (unadjusted) takes place 27 years later in the same town of Derry, Maine. The rambunctious kids are all adults now and have gone on their separate paths to some form of success. Unfortunately, the good fortune for each is put to an end by the return of Pennywise, who seeks more victims for his twisted games. Being the only ones that have stopped the evil force, the adults must come together again to put an end to this bloody mess.Director Andy Muschietti returns behind the camera after the record-breaking success he earned from 2017's ""It"". For the second time around, Muschietti goes even bigger and bolder than before, both in terms of the horror set pieces and the length.When it comes to giving audiences what they came to see, Muschietti delivers on adding even more blood, gore, and creepiness. Pennywise's indescribable powers get even more creative as his prey are stalked and slaughtered with unnerving brutality.The biggest fault that plagued the previous film was its recycling of cheap jump scares that were meant to artificially hold your attention. That same problem is even more glaring in the sequel as any scary moments are just startling moments where something pops out at the screen. The more they happen, the more predictable and boring they are to watch.A runtime is never indicative of quality by itself, every movie should earn its length through skill and craftsmanship. And at 170 minutes, ""It Chapter Two"" falls way short of earning its record-breaking runtime. Instead of the horror being a slow burn, it's more of a slow churn as the recycled jump scares quickly lose their minuscule luster and make this already long film feel even longer.Screenwriter Gary Dauberman takes up the impossible task of adapting Stephen King, a challenge that has killed the careers of countless adapters before him.Dauberman tries his best to break away from the ridiculousness within King's novel, but his efforts end up backfiring on him and make the film even more awkward as some elements are left in and some left out. The story wants you to take it pretty seriously, but keeping in the weird elements make that almost an impossible task.Muschietti didn't do much to justify the excessive length, but Dauberman should shoulder more of the blame with his uneven pacing. The film starts great with the together and playing off each other with a fun and brisk pace. Then, against all logic, Dauberman has them split up for ninety minutes, severely slowing things to a crawl and forcing the jump scares to keep you awake.The highest regards should go to casting director Rich Delia as he has brilliantly put together a group of adult actors that uncannily look like their younger counterparts. Unfortunately, good looks are the only quality some actors possess here.James McAvoy does fine as Bill. The most evident acting trait he shows off is his struggle to hide his Scottish accent with a less than convincing New England one.Having a rocky 2019, to say the least, Jessica Chastain follows up the bomb that was ""Dark Phoenix"" with another subpar performance. She doesn't shine as brightly as Sophia Lillis' younger Beverly despite being the more acclaimed actress with a lot more screen time.The standout performances come from the two Bills in the cast, Hader and Skarsgård. Hader plays adult Richie and fairs the best in the cast at toeing the line between drama and comedy.Skarsgård as Pennywise is a sight to see but unfortunately doesn't get seen for long stretches. Between him and Heath Ledger's Joker, future performances for clowns now have an insanely high bar to reach.With over five hours of material between two films, the ""It"" series has come to a less than satisfying close with ""It Chapter Two"". There are some things to admire Muschietti and co. for doing or trying to do. But for every great Bill Skarsgård moment (which is all of them), there were just as many moments of wasted potential due to unoriginal filmmaking. Overall, between its highs and lows, ""It Chapter Two"" makes for a semi-enjoyable time. Just make sure to bring a seat cushion.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't float quite as brilliantly,"Stephen King's novel is a masterpiece, didn't properly appreciate it on first read but with King's style being much more familiar to me (whereas it was a bit of a shock at first) it still stands as a genuinely scary, nostalgic, at times very funny and very powerful book and one of his best. The 1990 mini-series is an uneven one, with a great first half and disappointing second half with the ending and IT's true form having notoriously poor reputations for good reasons. Absolutely loved the first 'IT' film from 2017 and consider it better than the mini-series personally.'IT Chapter 2?' Not so much. Actually did find a lot to like about it, with a lot of what was great about the first film still here, and for me it is better than has been said. The mixed reception is more than understandable but it is not as terrible as the more negative reviews say in my view. Chapter 1 is the better film, but the second film is better than the second half of the mini-series on the whole and again it is a more than admirable and brave attempt at adapting an extremely difficult and near-unfilmable book.While there is a good deal to recommend, there are some glaring problems. There are problems with the pacing here. Especially in the middle act, where it meanders due to being too flashback heavy. Some flashbacks being more interesting than others, with Ben's and Richie's being quite unnerving, Eddie's (the too long adult encounter not much better) was neither scary or memorable. The special effects are more variable this time round and suffer too from overuse. IT's true form comes off worst and is as bad, am not kidding here, as that in the mini-series which is notoriously universally panned.The defeat of IT is beyond dumb and really undermines a final act that actually started off quite powerfully despite also being a bit too drawn out. Henry Bowers is also extremely underwritten, and both has little presence when having barely any screen time and quite badly overacted. Lets not get started on his very rushed, too easy and quite stupid defeat.However, as was said before there is a lot to like. The production values mostly are terrific, not just the lighting but also the beautifully realised Derry setting, taut editing and cinematography that's both stunning and unnerving. Epileptics be warned though, there is a scene towards the end of the middle act that is heavy in strobe lighting effects. The music is haunting without being over-scored, ever since the first film it has been impossible to hear ""Oranges and Lemons"" in the same way again and that opinion has not changed. Andy Muschietti directs with suspense, potent realism, confidence and affection, while the writing (which is also remarkably true to King's style) has a great balance of hilarious comedy, touching drama and affectionate nostalgia. Richie getting the best lines.Much has been said about the film being too long, am mixed on this consensus personally. The book is huge and both the child and adult time-lines need a quite long length to do it justice, having said that the middle act definitely could have done with a trim. The story is not just a horror story, but also blends humour (mostly from Ritchie), emotion and a 'Stand By Like' like nostalgia. There are memorable moments here, the Mrs Kersh encounter, the Fortune Cookie scene and the very freaky beginning (am amazed they managed to film this scene) being standouts. There is one improvement here over the previous film, Mike is much more interesting here which was necessary as this time as an adult he is something as the glue of the group.Cannot fault the performances. All the adults are very well cast, with Bill Hader absolutely killing it as Richie, and the children are great again especially Finn Woolfhard and Sophia Lillis (the standouts in the first too). Bill Skarsgaard is again the stuff of nightmares as Pennywise, filling giant clown shoes with aplomb and putting his own spin on it. If asked who is better between Skarsgaard and the unforgettable Tim Curry, mainly because of more familiarity Curry gets the edge but they are both must sees in their own way.Summarising, not brilliant and uneven but enjoyed it on the most part. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not your average horror movie,"Very early on in 'It Chapter Two' there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book, but messing up the ending. Anyone who is familiar with the 'It' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.The film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours. The thing is though I can't see it having the same impact if it were much shorter. There was a lot of layers to fit in. This isn't your average ""fast-food"" horror like the 'Conjuring' universe films. This is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror. The first half of the film especially. A long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters, showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again. Then in the second half of the film (and yes I'm talking about almost an entire 90 minutes) the film kicks into hyper-drive with non-stop, in your face horror - and it is a sight to behold.The cast were again all perfectly selected. Bill Hader in particular steals the show. He is given some great one-liners to work with, much the same as Finn Wolfhard was, and he nails every one of them. There is also a great Stephen King cameo. This isn't just a case of blink and you'll miss him, he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue. I wasn't sure whether 'It Chapter Two' would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves, but it certainly did. I had a great time with this movie and I think any lover of the genre will as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Was this a comedy or a scary movie???,Why they tried to add so much humor is beyond me. It ruined the entire movie.Now the guy that plays Pennywise did a great job.

A frightening yet touching story of forgotten friendship and lost opportunities.,"The sequel to the 2017 box office success 'It' starts exactly where it left off. Almost no explanatory flashbacks to the situations the Losers Club got themselves into, fighting the terrifying Pennywise. Only difference in 'It Chapter Two' - they're all grown up and ready to end It, once and for all.27 years ago, a fear-indulging creature tried to feast on every teenager alive in small town Derry. A group of friends, defeated the being (disguised as a clown) and moved on with their lives. Or so we think.. After a brutal killing one evening, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) decides to call every single one of his old friends, begging them to come back to their hometown. Barely remembering the events of almost three decades ago, they catch up over dinner and drinks and memories start to flow back. Sooner than they'd expect, It strikes again and the returning members of the Losers Club feel betrayed by Mike, luring them in knowing well enough they'd have to fight their common enemy once again. Mike did a whole lot of research to figure out It's origin and also knows how to defeat this being. But our group of friends has to stick together to successfully finish this fight against evil.Andy Muschietti is back to direct the second chapter to the well known Stephen King novel. It seems like he grew up, just like the Losers Club did. The jokes matured, as did certain subjects within the story (domestic abuse, sexual orientation..). Another impressive note is Benjamin Wallfisch's score. Simply eerie and unsettling. While I thought his score for 'It' was a bit bland and boring to listen to without the visuals, he decides to go bigger and bolder in this film and it really pays off.The movie has a lot of inventive sequences, which sometimes will blow your mind in how well constructed they are. A few of them are re-used from the previous chapter, but in a different and more terrifying way. The production design is next level perfect. While I thought 'It' relied heavier on jump scares, Chapter Two uses them less. There are still quite a few of them that actually work, but they don't seem as forced as the ones that came before. Whenever a new CGI-monster comes along, you simply ask yourself who designed these creatures. Some are straight up nightmare fuel.For fans of the younger cast, don't worry, they are still present through the use of flashbacks. But the focus is all on the adult versions this time. The true standout is by far Bill Hader, who plays grown up Richie - an alcoholic stand up comedian with a secret he can't seem to express to the outside world. His acting and comedic timing breaks some of the horror-tension, but never in a way it becomes annoying. He's genuinely enjoyable to watch and has an emotional arc to feel for. Other surprisingly great performances come from James Ransone (grown up Eddie) and Jessica Chastain (adult Beverly). James McAvoy (adult Bill) isn't bad, but it seems like he's playing one of his personalities from Split/Glass, with his accent being a bit too thick and an over-the-top lisp. While Mustafa, Jay Ryan (Ben) and Andy Bean (Stanley) just didn't get enough screen time to be rememberable. Bill Skarsgard is back as Pennywise, and while I thought he was brilliant in 'It', I kept wondering how much CGI they used to put him in this film. It became quite distracting, especially in the second half.It Chapter Two is the better half of the story, which explores the very interesting origin of this evolving menacing force and shows the devastating consequences of its wrongdoings towards a group of children. It not only shows that it's okay to be a loser or someone that doesn't entirely fit in to today's society, it makes us think of what we are capable of by just believing in ourselves.

Not as good as the first chapter...,"In comparison to the first chapter of this remake, then the 2019 ""It: Chapter Two"" was just a massive step back in the wrong direction.Why? Well, first of all, Pennywise wasn't scary at all. In fact, it was progressively getting more and more difficult to take him serious as an embodiment of evil as the movie progressed, because he was just too goofy. And whereas he was genuinely disturbing in the first chapter, the clown was just loosing it in chapter two.And running at close to three hours, ""It: Chapter Two"" was just too long, and too much of a drag to sit through, especially when so much of the contents just felt like it was there to fill in the movie and add to the play time of the movie. There were so many things that could easily have been trimmed away without the storyline suffering.The CGI was good, and definitely carried the movie a long way. But some of the CGI such as the long-limbed old woman chasing Beverly was just too comical and didn't really feel like it fit into the movie.It was nice that they actually had Stephen King himself in the movie for a short cameo.They had a good selection of casted actors and actresses to perform in the movie as the adult versions of the children that Pennywise stalked and fought. It was really nice to see James McAvoy in the movie.All in all, this wasn't really a fulfilling conclusion of the first chapter, and I was left with a feeling of 'was that really it?' when the movie ended. The movie was not as intense and interesting as the 2017 ""It: Chapter One"" movie was.I am rating ""It: Chapter Two"" six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Struggling with this review...,"It was a cool, confident 80's-style throwback, whose strong visuals and rare timbre made it a standout among the lame high-concept, overly dark excuses for terror we normally get. My enjoyment led to reading the novel, and I'm glad I did. Not only because it's great, but because I think I would be emotionally lost by Chapter Two otherwise. While it certainly hasn't lost any of the boldness of the first film, much of the actual storytelling skill and tonal control has been lost under an effort to shove 6+ hrs of story into 3. What we're left with is ultimately not a very ""good"" movie, but one with enough sincerity and fantastic individual moments that it's sloppiness can almost be overlooked.
We find The Losers all grown up, returning to Derry when their clown-friend begins wreaking havoc again. Despite perfect physical casting, the chemistry among these grown up performers comes nowhere near the endearing heights of the younger cast. When the kids return, it serves as a cheap but effective reminder of why we love these characters. The gentle naivete and fear of a young outcast teen proves to be paramount to the success of the horror, so this sequel seems to choose to either move away from scares altogether, or it falters.
Instead its strengths lie in individual scenes and unique themes. The Losers must relive their traumatic pasts, which not only provides the best 45 minutes of the movie, but beautifully and tenderly speaks to the effect childhood has on identity and engrained fear. It's a brave movie, even if kind of a ""bad"" one, which is a combo I prefer to safe (boring) ""good"" movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
My Review,"I love IT Chapter Two!! I understand what some people are saying is wrong with this movie and I too have some problems with the movie, but this movie is still amazing. The casting choice is the best I've ever seen, especially with Bill Hader as Richie, Finn Wolfhard in the first movie was the highlight for Chapter One and this time Bill Hader is the highlight for Chapter Two. The final confrontation is amazing, I was not disappointed with it at all, the giant spider from the original TV miniseries as a huge disappointment but the monster for this film is AMAZING. Going to be honest, I am interested to see if there will ever be an IT Chapter Three movie, if there ever will be one, I hope is an origin movie for Pennywise and maybe we can get a scene with the Turtle fighting IT.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I think some maybe even most people are treating this as if it were a straight up sequel when they really shouldn't.,"Although Stephen King's IT novel is more of back and forth from adult to kid and back and forth from adult to kid and so on, IT : Chapter 2 should be looked at like it's the 2nd half of one big story, which is exactly what it is rather than a sequel. It's really not a sequel. Just like the 2nd half or ""adult half"" of the 1990 TV Miniseries/movie is not a sequel, it's just the 2nd half of one big story/movie. Let's face it, unless they're the Godfather Part 2, Aliens, Terminator 2 : Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, The Empire Strikes Back, and maybe a couple of other big time hit sequels, the sequel almost always gets hated on, critiqued to death, disregarded as ""unoriginal"", ""same old same old"", ""not very creative"", treated like the ""intruder"", etc etc....it's the same for 90% of remakes..but people need to realize and understand that IT : Chapter 2 is not a sequel and that IT : Chapter 1 and IT : Chapter aren't remakes to the 1990 TV minseries/movie either.Secondly, almost every negative review on Rotten Tomatoes or YouTube or on the Internet somewhere (and I'm pretty sure they'll make their way onto here sooner or later as well) have complaints about the runtime of 2 hours and 49 minutes and that it's ""too long"" and blah blah blah. I don't see how you can make this whole story put to film not be at least 5+ hours long (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 combined)..at the VERY least. The novel is over 1,100 pages long ! 1,138 pages to be exact. ""IT"" should have been a 10-15 1 hour episode series on Netflix to be done properly, to be honest..but if you go the cinema route with it (and they did, obviously), between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, it has to be, at the very least, 5 hours or so if the Director or Writers want to be even remotely faithful to King's novel and make fans of King and the novel at least somewhat satisfied. And you also have 7 protagonists..SEVEN..6 of which are main protagonists. That's A LOT character developing and character story arcs that have to be told and take place unless you want a lazily and poorly directed and written film with terrible story telling and bad or no/next to no character development.This film delivers great character development and great character and story arcs for all of the main protagonists/characters of the film. This film is really entertaining overall. There are pacing issues but those really seem minor when you step back and look at this film as a whole. This film was really good on it's own and holds up very well on it's own. Yes, it relied on Chapter 1 some, obviously, because Chapter 1 is part of the overall story (Again, it's NOT a sequel. I'm really talking about how well Chapter 2 is made when saying ""it's really good on it's own) but when you put Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 together and make it one big story/film like it should be, it's AWESOME. Pennywise is also at his most serious and gruesome in this one. This one doesn't cut away just as someone or a helpless kid is about to get bitten or eaten until after you see and hear plenty enough, if you know what I mean. More gore in this one. It definitely earns every bit of it's R rating. Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, Bill Skarsgard, and James Mcavoy are excellent, especially Hader and Skarsgard. Nobody was bad though..everyone was, at least, good. The CGI was also much better in this one..of course it would be though because it had a much bigger budget to work with than Chapter 1 did.My biggest con..and it's the same as my biggest con for Chapter 1. Too many ill timed funny jokes. 2 or 3 jokes when it's the right time for them are great and it works. It lightens things up even if just for a few seconds and during the RIGHT times. And this film has a few well timed funny moments as well, don't get me wrong. But the funny/comedy/jokes at the wrong times, especially in a horror movie, just suck, to put it simply. It ruins scenes especially scenes that are supposed to be or should be horrifying and terrifying and scary and making you nervous and tense and scared and such. And unfortunately, this film has those ill timed/placed jokes as well.Overall though, this film is great..especially when you look at as whole with Chapter 1.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Less was definitely more in the first chapter and although some of the scares were good the CGI made it somewhat comical and a let down.

"It was fair, it just lacked true horror.","I made the decision to watch the first part just prior to seeing this second chapter, as for me it's one film. I'm glad I did, it's a direct continuation.I think the ups and downs of the first film apply here. On the plus side it looks wonderful, it's slick, well produced, overall it was visually appealing. Bill Skarsgård makes a wonderful Pennywise, he's terrifying and captivating, I loved how he moved and spoke. Very well acted, I especially loved James McAvoy, clever casting.On the downside, it's the scariest, most messed to book I've ever read, that horror didn't translate well, I felt like I was watching an adventure thriller for teens at times, it had lots going on, lots of thrills, but horror? No. It was a bit formulaic, each character hot their respective item, and each was terrorised one by one, it needed more surprises, more shocks.I preferred the first part, but I think they did a good job here, I hope it's released with both chapters linked.

"A great movie, that could have been even better...","IT Chapter 1 was, in my opinion, a fantastic movie, not because of the scares (despite not having many), but because of the characters. The kids in that movie were just flawless, they worked so well off each other. I didn't think the grown-up versions wouldn't even come close to the chemistry that their younger counterparts had, and I wasn't wrong. Despite having a brilliant cast as the older versions, they just didn't have that same spark. Now this can be because they haven't seen each other in 27 years, most of them are estranged, and are living very different lives. Of course they wouldn't be the same as they were as children, but I felt this dragged it down a little. But despite this, every actor played their role perfectly, with the highlights being Bill Hader as Richie Tozier and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak. These two were flawless as the older versions of their characters. The other actors, were also very good, but you would expect the likes of James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain to give great performances. And like the previous movie, Bill Skarsgård nails it as Pennywise. You can tell he inherited his family's trend of playing psychotic characters, because he is so good here, he is almost too good. The character of Henry Bowers was pointless, and added nothing to the film, he could have just been cut out completely.The movie has tons of pros and cons, with ""some"" of the direction, cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting being the main highlights of the film. It is a stunning looking movie, from the lighting to the camera angles. But there are also tons of bad things about the movie, that stopped it from becoming better.One thing is that, it over uses CGI. While in some scenes, they clearly used practical effects, and make-up, because some of the creature designs are remarkable, its just a shame that some of the scenes that could have been terrifying, were filled with unnecessary CGI, especially at the end. Another problem I had with the movie, is its pacing. The movie seems to cut and dash between scenes, despite the movie being ridiculously long, like seriously, this movie is almost as long as Avengers: Endgame, that isn't normal for a horror film. The film drags in places, yet, I cant think of what scenes they could have cut out, because the scenes shown, were needed, but at the same time, while I was watching, I felt like they had cut tons of the film out. Some scenes were too quick, and felt rushed.But my biggest complaint was that it tried to put TOO much comedy in there. The first chapter was funny at times, but the comedy was well done, here there are some terrifying and thrilling scenes, and they are bogged down with quick one-liners. It ruined those scenes. Why the director did this is a mystery.IT Chapter 2 is a good film, it has some great moments, but also some bad ones. The scenes with the younger versions were the best scenes, and some of the creepy eerie moments, where Pennywise was tormenting children, were all perfect. But the film suffers from the typical shove CGI here, shove CGI there, and it really brings it down, as well as the pacing. But despite that, I still enjoyed it.7.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Does It live up to its high expectations?,"It Chapter 2 is a good movie that manages to keep you entertained through it's nearly 3 hour run time. This really tries to be a sequel in every way with a bigger is better approach and at points some of its attempts to frighten you can be quite predictable at times, however the film to me is scarier then the first as there is more variation in Pennywises attempts to frighten. The cast for this movie is one of its strongest points James mcavoy, (Bill), Jessica Chastain, (Beverly), Bill Hader, (Richie) alongside Bill Skarsgard, (Pennywise), all giving some very excellent performances. I was very satisfied with the way this movie played out and was delighted by the performances, definitely a horror worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thus movie is a disgrace...,"...it is a disgrace because it is a gross betrayal of the original book. IT - the book - is a psychological thriller about friendship, about relationships, it is about the deep fears we have as kids and which grow with us until we are adults; it is about how we learn fighting and ultimately defeating these fears.
IT - the movie, this movie - is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and CGI with the sole purpose of jump-scaring the audience. There is no narrative, no storytelling, nothing more than a random - and awfully long - sequence of third league horror vignettes.
Shame on this movie!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
is this a joke?,"I actually enjoyed the first one, even though it was a mainstream film pg13 style. But the second part was like another movie and another style. It didnt even try to be scary, just stupid, redicolous and funny like an hot shots movie...and than it was super long on top. What a huge fail with a awesome cast.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good enough I guess,"Look, It Chapter Two is probably not going to blow your mind but it's not going to disappoint you either. There is a lot of hype for this movie and the trailers and everything made it seem such as the movie would be a lot better than it actually was, I assume that's the whole point of promotion, but considering that the first movie fully met my expectations I would have expected something a little better (I'll explain).
Pros
The acting is great and the casting is flawless. All the actors are a perfect match to their children predecessors and they approach their parts with respect towards the characters we all met and loved as kids. It has some very good moments with creepy jumpscares and wacky characters and achieves to balance between comedy and horror. As an ending to the whole it 'franchise' it's what you would expect without any unpleasant surprises and it's going to leave you satisfied and kind of nostalgic.
Cons
I personally didn't like the backstory that wad given to 'It' and they way they suggested would be right to defeat it, although I haven't read the book and I don't know if that kind of material was included in the original story. 3 hours was too long for this movie and it made me a little tired towards the end. I also didn't love the cgi, I have the feeling the the previous movie had used better effects.
Conclusion
'It Chapter Two' is a solid conlclusion to the story and it has the thrills to excite horror movie enthusiasts. The cast has chemistry which makes the movie even better and if you loved the first movie then it's worth your time but don't expect to get the same feeling with the original.

Not as bad as I expected,"One thing I can assure is that ""IT Chapter 2"" is not a mediocre horror movie. It starts off really promising but only to an extent the movie could keep its promise.
In 2 hours and 49 minutes, IT could have shown us a lot better things rather than focusing on flashbacks and many unnecessary things.
Expected a lot of moments with pennywise which turned me down, but his screen presence plays a huge impact in the movie, nailed every scene in which he was present. Especially some death scenes were really touching.
The climax was emotionless like as if the film was pretending to make audiences happy. Its chapter 2 wasn't as great as the prequel, but definitely a good sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you're scared of CGI and don't want to get invested in the main characters, this is just for you..","Well, this was a waste..
This movie is just a long run of jumpscares (all the f'ing time), not at all scary CGI monsters and reusing of the same jokes and ""scares"". I don't think the director has used a single practical effect in this picture.There is no tension or character-investing in this movie, and the director manages to make the cast (who works with What they have been giving) look terrible in their acting. It is not scary, just very, very annoying and does not live up to either the book, the mini-tv series or part 1 of the reboot from 2017 (even though it also was an CGI orgy).If you like a horror movie, where you don't need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout, but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost 3 hours - You will love this..

Was it worth it?,"To the guys at the top, that's an easy answer. Yes.To the general public. Probably.To the Stephen King fan. No.Obviously covering an over 1000 page adaption is going to run into problems having just 6 hours to do so. But even at that, there was plenty of wasted time (especially in Episode 2) that could have been cut for more of the novels material. Just little things like explaining why it's an eye that comes out off Richies fortune cookie or a dead baby bird out Mikes. There's just so much that could have been changed and made no difference to the time. I mean, how much more would it have taken to show Beverley seeing that the doorbell said ""Marsh"" at first, then it change to ""Kersh"". The end ""fight scene"" was ALWAYS going to be a nightmare to put in front of an audience as it's easier in the book when you can let your imagination do the work and I think that's why there's the running joke all out through the movie about Bill's books having bad endings. The twist at the end was kinda cool and I actually hoped that they'd do it this way rather than the book as it's heartbreaking to see them forgetting who each other is all over again.All in all it is a fine movie but there's no scares whatsoever and it just seems like some different shape of the actual ""IT"" is tearing towards the camera shaking their heads in a weird way (think the alley scene in ""Jacob's Ladder"").Worth it for a one, maybe two time watch and overall for the series together:Chapter One - 8

Tim Curry in a clown costume is more terrifying than any CGI monster,"I personally didn't enjoy IT 2017 so I didn't have much hope for part 2 but I was expecting them to at least tone down the CGI instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy CGI effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more Stephen King books are going to get remakes and it won't be long before we get an all CGI Maximum Overdrive movie remake.There are more scenes with Pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with CGI and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it's climax the makers of this ""Horror Movie"" think by simply making Pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream CGI and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before ""Terrifying""The only and I do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it's not the actors fault this movie was a big let down.I recommend watching the original IT mini series if you haven't already seen it Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the 90s have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie Tim Curry will always be Pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like Judy Garland will always be Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ there performance makes the movie so memorable and it can't be re-created no matter how much CGI you use.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

It chapter 2: ITS,"When you have a book that's longer than 12 rolls of toilet paper, and a mini-Series that couldn't handle the adult portion of the story, as well as a director who is known for stating ""the stuff with the kids is just more interesting."" ""It: Chapter 2"" was always bound to find itself in a deeper hole, that said it's still extremely entertaining! While not as scary or tight as it's predecessor, what the sequel does give us is great direction from Andy Muschietti and some well rounded actors up for the challenge, Bill Skarsgard continues to shine in his horrifying role, while Bill Hader and James Ransone stand out from the crowd with some hilarious, yet beautiful performances. MacAvoy, Chastain, Mustafa, and Ryan all do well in their respective roles, it however feels like the writing gave them very little to do, which is a shame because these are great performances. In the end ""It: Chapter 2"" would have benefited from a few script re-writes, some more scary scenes, a much shorter run time. But I think with a story as long as ""It"" is the filmmakers did their best job, and in turn delivered a campy but hilarious horror romp that should please some, but may leave others agitated.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun, yet disappointing.","This movie is somewhat of a bland and substance-less
Movie with aspects that fall short. It: chapter two is the second half of its succesful predecessor and story.
Based on Stephen kings best selling novel, it does not stay true to its roots of horror. This movie relies heavily on jumpscares and never truly makes us feel afraid and anxious as the first one did. It was a fun experience and a enjoyable movie, but a disappointing let down since it is a step back from the first movie. The atmosphere is off and not fearful, and the movie feels as if it was made for pre-schoolers, and maybe then, it would not enduce as much fear as the first one. The absolute most disappointing part is the build up to the return of pennywise the clown. It's anti-climactic feeling of powerlessness that pennywise carries is saddening. It: chapter one portrays pennywise as the devil, the monster, the all powerful clown, and it: chapter two portrays him as a lacklustre man in clown make-up trying to get revenge on the losers' club, even though he show's his cosmic power.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
CGI everything ruined this.,"I wish directors and producers would seriously stop with the hardcore usage of CGI. It works great in some films (Avengers/Marvel) but for horror movies, this completely kills the shock value. That's where movies like John Carpenter's The Thing still shines today. This could've been a great movie with some great scares. However the CGI just suffocates the entire film like a wet blanket.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pennywise isn't freakin' kidding.,"It: Chapter 2 was almost everything I wanted it to be. Almost.The sequel feels like a direct continuation of the first part, only slightly amped up with more scares and intensity. There were some let-downs however, so I'll start with those:-Yes, it's long, but it didn't really feel like it until they started wrapping things up at the end.
-There was also too much use of CGI, albeit there being some really awesome, scenes with it (like, for example, a brilliant reference to a certain John Carpenter classic... ""Trick r' Treat"" anyone?).
-More scares indeed, but some felt either too forced or predictable.
-There was a bit too much profanity, which isn't something I'd normally criticize, but much of it felt too unnecessary.
-As far as I could tell, there weren't any, or as many, ""subtle scares"" as the first one.Aside from these nit-picks, the movie does not disappoint. It dives more into the emotional attachment the characters have to each other, and to It. Unlike the classic 90's version, it also explains more of It's origins. Not only does it follow the first part well, it also uses plot elements and themes in the book, and twists it into something new. So it's so much like the book, yet, it's not, and in a satisfying manner. And while a few scares may be a tad flat, it's still quite intense. And yet, like the first part as well, manages to maintain a balance of horror and comedy. It's more brutal than the first, and just about as fun. It was relieving to find the way they ended it all in the movie was handled VERY well, considering how strange and cerebral it was in the book (don't look into the light!!!).And if you heard, or read, any rumors about it possibly being the ""bloodiest film of all time,"" don't get your hopes up. It does have its moments, but it's nowhere near ""Evil Dead"" or ""Dead Alive."" Or even ""A Nightmare on Elm Street.""""It"" started well, and ended well.

It's alright,"I had such high hopes for this one after how much I LOVED Chapter 1 - watching it probably a dozen times by now, and after seeing the previews for Chapter 2. I am honestly incredibly disappointed in this one. The acting was spot on, and the performances believable, but it just felt too disjointed, jumping from story to story, from present to the kids memories, and it also lost a lot of the things that made chapter 1 awesome. For example, a LOT more CGI in this one instead of practical effects which made for wonky looking monsters (especially the 'remembered' ones, like the Leper). Second, not enough Bill Skarsgaard doing what he did best, which are Pennywise' creepy movements and mannerisms; they changed it all to CGI-morphing into various sci-fi monsters :( And to be honest, none of the monsters even really scared me like last time. That's not to say it was ALLL bad though... I'd say it was somehow even funnier than the first, and as such, I'd classify it more as a decent sci-fi comedy than a 'horror'. There are some cool little Easter eggs to be found as well, like the Stephen King cameo, etc. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not what I was anxiously waiting for.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Solid performances, a fitting end.","I went into this movie very scared that I would be disappointed, but overall, thankfully, I wasn't. I would say that this films strongest aspect was the excellent choice in cast. Actors were outstanding, and did an excellent job in mirroring their child counterparts. The comedic exchange of dialogue between these characters had me laughing pretty hard throughout the entire film, which ironically also causes issues with this film.I wouldn't say that this film is particularly scary. For the most part, it relies on a repetitive use of very predictable jump-scares and disgust to try and scare its audience. There isn't a lot of suspense or build-up to these scares either, they just kinda throw it at you. I actually probably laughed at them more than I cowered from them, which brings me to another issue.This film has some pretty heavy tone issues. There is a lot of comedy in this film, and there are times when said comedy definitely ruins what could have been a decent scare. Not to say that this is a bad thing, but it kept me in a state of comfort. When I watch a horror movie, I want to be horrified. However, this films use of comedy was much more effective than its use of horror.The next thing is that the pacing could have been done much better. The film definitely did not need to be as long as it was, as many scenes just go on for way too long. There are several scenes that could have been much shorter. You could probably comfortably fit this version of the story into 2 hours.In short, despite a few issues, I'm satisfied with this movie. Though they can't very well fit the entirety of Kings novel into one movie, I think that what we have here does the book justice. I wouldn't call it a horror movie, and despite that, I still enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT CHAPTER TWO SPOILER FREE REVIEW 🎈,"IT CHAPTER TWO, SPOILER FREE REVIEW.
I'll start with the positive. IT is basically Goonies for horror fans. Pure nostalgia. Wanting that last adventure with your friends before you're too old. (God that's depressing) Anyway, my biggest fear for this movie was that it would fail purely because let's face it in the book and the original mini series, the switch over to the kids from the adults is pretty boring. So I'm super happy to announce I needn't have worried, this switch over was seamless , it was cast perfectly to the point they looked like the kids had made a wish on Zoltar to be big, and I actually enjoyed this more than part one. The chemistry between the cast was spot on and I it felt like watching real friends. I was totally immersed in the story from start to finish, I didn't find myself zoning out for any of the run time.
Look out for the cameos and the nods to all your favourite 80's horror.
Ok now for the bad, same criticism as I had for the first one, TOO HEAVILY RELIANT ON CGI!! I thought there was missed opportunities for scares that were ruined by the heavy heavy CGI. Skarsgard has perfect control of Pennywise but when the CGI kicks in it becomes cartoonish. I don't wanna spoil it so I'll just bullet point the dodgy.
1. CGI
2. The first 15 minutes felt like a totally different film, that's not to say it wasn't good, just different. (And yes I've read the book)
3. CGI

"The second half is worthy, well-cast and mostly faithful adaptation of the book","For most of the people out there who will watch it for the scares, there are plenty of them abound. The talked-about homophobic scene is quite good a starter. But what I found the most satisfying in the scares territory were The Ritual of Chud, and The Walking Tours of each of the Losers. Both are the longest among the scares, and the filmmakers did an amazing job of presenting them from book to big screen, albeit somewhat different. I personally thought they were hard to adapt. Like the Paul Bunyan scene but most especially the Ritual of Chud.Apart from the scares, the movie will make people laugh out loud as well. Bill Hader and James Ransone are quite the comic relief. And the appearance of Stephen King is spot-on and funny too.There are those who complain that the movie is overlong and not as scary as they expected it to be, but I can say that most people who read It and those who did not but appreciate the first movie as the package it was will be satisfied.Because it's not just the scares that make us follow the story. It is the characters themselves. The coming of age. The nostalgia. The old times. The friends who come along and stay. The friends who come along but leave. The unconditional love. The promises whether honored or not. The power of belief. The guilt. The personal fears we want to overcome. The strength and weakness of memory. How most of the times the bad things we want to forget stick with us longer than the good things we want to remember. It evokes something powerful in us that makes us the humane people we are. We identify ourselves in each of the Losers. And that is one very good side It shared with us. It makes us remember. It makes us hope.And the score by Benjamin Wallfisch made It all the more powerful and the well-cast characters they were.It is not a perfect movie. There are scenes that don't work as intended.

"Overall, the best ending for this story.","Something seen few from far between. A genuine finale that does not hint or poke fun at a possible continuation due to success at the box office. Andy Muschietti has delivered what he promised: an ending to a pop culture phenomenon that was beautifully crafted and brilliantly terrifying.
It Chapter Two was my most anticipated film this year and actually has been since September 7th, 2017 right after It ended on the note of revealing that it was only the first chapter and there would be more. And more is exactly what we get here with the final chapter. More scares, more character development, more scarring scenes, more comedy from Richie, and yes, definitely more Pennywise.
Bill Skarsgärd takes your breath away quite literally with his chilling performance of the disturbing dancing clown. Every moment that he is on screen, he draws you into the movie even more than you already were. It's as if you are being lured in like all the other kids-his victims-were. Mind-blowing. Skarsgärd gave it his all, and he was backed-up by the superb actors that played the grown-up losers. I mean, James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, and freakin Bill Hader as Richie Tozier-what do you expect? Not a sub-par performance out them, that's for sure.
The brilliant dark tone and amazing cinematography that brought the horrifying story to life in 2017 carries on directly into the final chapter which made the connection between the two films seamless. 27 years is a huge jump forward but that didn't phase Muschietti. He was determined and clearly ready to deliver a finale that was so worthy to be an adaptation of the timeless novel that the author, the king of horror himself, made a Stan Lee-style cameo in it.
If all the performances, cinematography, clowns, and cameos didn't impress enough, the countless scenes of truly impressive and terrifying large-scale stunts (most of which involve Pennywise and his fear-provoking tactics) will leave you awe-struck. And don't worry, there are so many of these moments in this absolute behemoth of a motion picture.
With a runtime of 2 hours and 49 minutes, you might be hesitant to go watch it and have to hold it during that last act after gulping down a large beverage. But, fear not, this is a cinematic event to witness in the theatre with hundreds of other movie-goers so you can laugh and scream together; just as it was meant to be:)

Disappointing,"I was very excited to see this film, have been since 2017, when I saw the first one. Unfortunately, this one was a huge mess.I love the way the first IT didn't want to be JUST a horror movie, but rather took time to build up a story, emotional connection. That is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays. HOWEVER, this was completely thrown out the window in the second one. Considering how incredibly long this movie is, 90% of it was just buildup for jumpscares, jumpscares themselves and weird CGI.The worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on, jumping all over the place. And most of it was just for shock value, nothing important to the story.What I did love was the casting, it was absolutely brilliant, especially Eddie.I guess this is once again a classic case of - bigger budget does not mean better movie, as well as more CGI does not mean better movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sometimes i felt that the movie dragged on bit from time to time, but other than that, it was great",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Solid Follow-Up, Even if it Falls a Little Short","Back in 2017, the majority of audiences praised the fact that such a great Stephen King adaptation had been made in It. The television mini-series from 1990 was a very corny version of the story and it went without saying that it deserved a better treatment. Now, the second instalment of that great first film has hit theatres, and like the mini-series, the second portion of the story just isn't as interesting as the first. It: Chapter 2 does warrant a viewing though, especially if you liked the first movie because although it's not exactly great like its predecessor, there's a lot to like here.Picking up 27 years after the events of the first movie, Pennywise (the clown) has returned to terrorize the town of Derry once again. Reuniting as they promised each other they would, this cast of characters come together to face him one last time. Through various side plots that each character find themselves on, this film may feel slightly long for some viewers at a beefy 169 minutes, but I found that the events unfolding and the performances surrounding them was enough to keep me interested.Even if you find this film boring at times, it goes without saying that this is once again a stellar cast. Just as they brilliantly cast the kids in the first film, everyone here is on the top of their game. From Bill Hader stealing the show on multiple occasions to the star power of Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy leaping off the screen, there is an endless slew of great character moments. Where this film slightly fell apart for me was in the fact that this movie relies heavily on the past.Almost seeming to be afraid of letting the past go, this movie flashes back and forth from past and present, showing moments from their childhoods that coincides with current situations. It worked simply due to the fact that the cast of both films is great, but it really did feel like it unnecessarily made the movie longer than it needed to be. With that said, I feel that will be the complaint for most people, but I actually didn't feel the length of this movie. That might have been because I was just in the mood to watch it, but I digress.In the end, It: Chapter 2 has a great dramatic backbone to it and these performers are giving their all, but the sense of terror and tension is lost a little here in favour of the former. Still, I'm a sucker for a good drama and this film definitely delivers that tenfold. Both of these films feel like they have a sense of finality at the end of them, which is why they both work on their own. The fact that this movie constantly switches between past and present actually makes it easier to watch for those who missed the first movie, which is something I always love. While it's not going to be remembered as a great film on its own, I believe these two movies will work as a great double feature. It's absolutely worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
3 hours of nonsense,"This is one of those movies that's built up to be the greatest film to hit the theater in a generation. I remember when the trailer came out--people began to rave about how good this film would be. Well this film sucked. Monumental waste of three hours. It was painful to watch. For lots of reasons. Jessica Chastain mailed it in. Bill Hader echoing F-bombs every other word. Ransome is a guy you want to punch. The only scene I enjoyed in the film was the scene with the old woman-and even that was ruined because the entire scene played out in the trailer. Worst, the movie wasn't even scary. CGI trickery. It was more like a Tim Burton film. And one other thing-the silly, over-the-top attempts at humor greatly diminished the film. For a film positing itself as the scariest adaptation of a King novel, the audience spent far too much time snickering at lame jokes. I want my money-and my three hours--back.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Far too long for its own good,"I have always been an advocate for long films. If I see that a film has a 3 hour run-time, I am usually thrilled. That is because I believe a truly great story needs time to develop characters and commit the viewer to the experience. It Chapter Two is a prime example of a film that boasts a long run-time without using it properly, and it becomes a real drag. Many times the stunning visuals and costume design in combination with a gut-wrenching performance by Bill Skarsgard would have me at the edge of my seat, only to slowly sit me back as all momentum slowly burned out. It also dawned on me that the horror if IT is best viewed through the lens of a child protagonist. Some moments with a full adult squad just felt disingenuous.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too much CGI,"I actually quite enjoyed this movie and I enjoy it as a two parter. I think the problem with this is the same as the 1990 adaption, the 2nd part is weaker than the first.By no means is that a swipe at the acting or atmosphere of the movie, Bill Hader is tremendous as he always is, James McAvoy is awesome as Bill, Jessica Chastain is brilliant as are the others.But what I find tiresome about this movie is the overuse of CGI, say what you want about the 1990 version but at least it was over reliant on cg. I felt for example Mrs Kersh was a lot scarier in the 1990 version because it was all practical. I'm not completely against CGI but when it is overused it just feels cheap.I like this movie obviously I prefer chapter one but overall a good two parter.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

How did they get back up the well?,"Think about how hard getting down the well was in the first film then realise that this time they had no rope.

Horrible,For anyone who believes that this movie was scary or even a decent movie clearly has no taste in films. From the script right down to the acting it was horrid.

IT: CHAPTER TWO... IT's pointless,"When my friends and I saw that the prior film was the first portion of a two-part story we were captivated to continue the journey, just with a different cinema experience after an awful one. Most of my friends returned for the sequel and we had another annoying cinema experience.*SMALL RANT*
If you want to text or have your phone out during your time at the cinema, don't come. Think about the people surrounding you for a change as we have come to the cinema to have a pleasurable experience and not worry about whose messaging you or not.Anyway It: Chapter Two.
So, let's see how it is...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSITIVES!
There is no question that the adult casting for these characters was spot on! There is an array of talent assembled here for this project and everyone does their best job at establishing these characters as adults with their performances and, especially, looks. Most of the actors shared satisfactory chemistry with each other, with the dinner scene being the best example of that interaction. I'm a massive fan of Bill Hader so he was defiantly the standout for me. A lot of audiences were worried about his acting ability going in, and critics seem to be impressed with his performance. I had faith in Hader from the start since I'm a big fan of the HBO series Barry. The film itself has wonderful cinematography which continues that unnerving atmosphere that Muschietti establish in the prior film. And the sets and locations are all well designed with a lot of practical elements that were greatly appreciated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MIXED!
While it's enjoyable to revisit this enticing narrative, the actual plot of the film has a more action/adventure movie flavour to it without a great deal of action taking place. This makes the film seem less like a genuine horror film and more like an event. And the design of Pennywise the Clown I'm still varied on, since I'm under the impression that Pennywise is a form IT takes to lure its victims. Doesn't change the fact that it's still an impressive and eerie design.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEGATIVES!
This script feels awfully vacant with a lot of filler and slow pacing. The film isn't scary. It has mostly jump scares and not enough of that uncanny sensation that the prior film included. The second act is so rinse and repeat, with the flashbacks and scares, that it becomes tremendously predictable. There are setups with no significant pay off, so much so that they could be erased from the film. And there are components of the script that could've been better explained and/or adapted. And the climax of the third act is so incredibly tacky that it feels like an ending from Goosebumps with a cheesy message of togetherness and overpowering a tormenter. Lastly, with the script, is character. While we have the prior film to understand what these characters WERE like, there's no strong depiction of how these characters are as adults. There are some things that are settled, but not enough. The film just jumps straight in without a significant or defined setup. Moments and components of the first film, that I didn't agree with, are here as well and that's in the editing. Segments from the trailers were so powerful that I couldn't wait to see them on the big screen, but they're ruined when the editors would distort the image or sound. With the child actors, they had to be digitally de-aged and had to sound younger with ADR. It was incredibly distracting if you were aware of these elements going in. The visual effects were a step up from the CGI of the first, but still weren't completely solid. And the overall enjoyment of the film was weird since I was laughing and enjoying other workings, but the horror elements just weren't around enough to enjoy that genre.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the end, It: Chapter Two wasn't on the same level as the prior film, which has gone down in my enjoyment and rewatchability. This film is going to go down a lot faster with the script that this sequel offered. So unbalanced and vacant with its narrative and character. Perhaps in a double-feature event, audiences would feel differently, but I'm unsure of that impression.",,Anonymous,Horror
".. but doctor, I am Pennywise.","I said in my review of Chapter one, that though I really liked that film, one of my concerns was that this was the easy half of the story to tell. Though I didn't like Chapter 2 as much, I did feel it mostly avoided the potential pitfalls and was an OK conclusion.27 years after the children of Derry forced Pennywise (Bill Skarsgaard) into an early hibernation, Mikey (Isaiah Mustafa) the only one of the gang to have stayed in town, recalls his friends to honour the oath they swore, should Pennywise remerge. With the town in their past, their memories of their horrific battle have magically dissipated, but as they return, the recollections and the horror come back.I feel like this might be another review where I say that a film was alright, and then just list a series of my problems with it. So I'll try and be clearer.... The film is fine. Perfectly acceptable. Performances are solid, the story is decent enough and some of the pitfalls of the more outlandish (or perhaps offworld-ish) areas of the plot are dealt with as well as they could be. It is, again, reasonably funny - in fact there are more laughs than screams.That, perhaps, is one of the principle problems though. Again, it's not particularly scary, especially when Pennywise is inhabiting something else and not present in his clown form. There's a lot of CGI creations some of whom are more successful than others. Whilst on the subject of CGI, in some of the flashback scenes, they used software to make some of the young actors more closely resemble themselves from a few years back, this occasionally looks awful and gives poor Jeremy Ray Taylor in particular a plastic face. I don't feel like the adults had the same chemistry that the children had as a group either, despite the big names amongst them.These failings, along with the lengthy running time, mean I'm probably not going to revisit ""It"" very often, but I do feel this is as strong a version of the story as you are every likely to get on screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Perfect Addition To The First,"This takes all the things we love about the first- humor, scary factor, characters- and seems to amplify it. It isn't as witty as the first and seems to rely more on excessive cursing for the comedy, but makes up for it plenty with the plot. There is much more gore and jump scares in this one than the first- and I found it to be slightly less scary- most ""scary"" scenes were shrouded with comedy. Aside from that, the true beauty of this film is the character development- we learn much more about the characters, their secrets, hidden fears, their pasts, what became of them, etc. and it does a good job of executing the character arcs. Most of all, the ending is absolutely beautiful, and the way they wrapped up the story and the characters was done very well. The ending monologue is a tear jerker. I'd say that aside from a few flaws, it was slightly stronger than the first.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Far From Mediocre,"The movie wasn't incredible, but it wasn't bad. I genuinely enjoyed the movie and actually found myself laughing hysterically. Some people may view this as a weakness in the film, but I feel like it actually kills you into a sense of comfort and complacency that makes the scares land better. I didn't jump at all in the first movie, but I jumped two and a half times in this one. I generally don't go for jump scares, bu I feel like these actually had something to offer. They were more than SUDDEN LOUD NOISE MAKES YOU FEEL ABRUPT INCREASES IN ADRENALINE. I liked it.The only real critique I have is that Pennywise didn't feel like as much of a threat this time around. He messed with them a little, but he was largely absent. When he did show up, their mother of finally doing him in was... odd. I won't say it was ineffective, but it was an odd approach. I will grant that the first movie was supposed to be fear while the second was self-exploration and coming to grips with yourself, but I still feel that a movie titled ""It"", and that is supposed to be a monster movie, should have more monster.Also Henry. That was either a waste of a character or an unnecessary addition. Though, in fairness, he did cause one of the funniest scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Substandard follow-up that doesn't have a lot to like,"Returning to their home-town, the now-adult group of friends finds they've been gathered to fulfill the childhood promise that the killer clown Pennywise has returned and is on the loose in the town, forcing them to put aside their past traumas to defeat the malevolent being once and for all.This was a woefully underwhelming and overblown effort. Among its many flaws is the most obvious issue in that there's just no reason for the running time to last this long at all. So much of this one could've been cut down or outright removed, from the introduction of the gang one-by-one to see where their lives are like now that goes into plenty of detail that could've been accomplished easier, to the incidents in the asylum tormenting the residents inside or just the seemingly endless scenes depicting the escaped inmate under the clown's influence. That these are done in conjunction with utterly boring flashbacks and storytelling that shows how they used to be as kids that just go on forever, serve no purpose to the storyline at all and just seem to focus on seemingly random incidents that just plain dull to get through. It highlights the fact that the main clown does absolutely nothing here with so little screen-time as we're focusing on the kids' flashbacks interacting with the clown or building the romance angle instead of in modern times. The other factor to lower this one are the entirely overblown scare attempts that fall completely flat. The CGI here manages to undo so much of the attempts that the scenes of the food coming to life in the Chinese restaurant is laughably inept with the black pool looking like a deformed blob-like mess that's incredibly cheesy looking and makes no sense in the storyline how that works, much less comes off like any other expected outcome from the very start. Likewise, flashbacks to show the kids interacting with Pennywise, featuring the confrontation in the apartment, the statue coming to life in the park or the appearance from the sewer grate are all laughably bad and underwhelming with how crude they are. It's pretty disheartening to see so much wasted time in a film this long feature so little chances for something to happen and then showcase such underwhelming and laughably bad work when they do appear, really undermining this one and making for a troublesome effort. There are only a few select aspects that work here. Despite generally being underwhelming, the encounter with the kid in the hall-of-mirrors at the carnival stands out as a wholly enjoyable and solid enough effort that works off the darkness of the setting, the overall creepiness of the concept in general and stellar practical effects that are usually missing from these other scenes. As well, the spirit of unity and brotherhood that they display in the finale when they band together to take on the true form of the creature in the underground sewer lair of Pennywise which is not only a great idea to see play out but has some energetic albeit comically over-the-top action that at least puts some life into things. Combined with the creepiness of the main clown and the ability to kill off kids with graphic results, these are all that work for this one.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, underage smoking and continuous violence against children.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
James Ransone steals every scene.,All the adult cast are cast perfectly but for me James Ransone stole every scene he was in.

Almost...,"Should have had more Pennywise. He's the ""E"" ticket of the movie. Somewhat disjointed flow. Too much relying on jump scares as opposed to building tension. This is a lazy film trick used as a crutch used in most every modern day horror movie. If they cut 30-40 minutes from the almost 3 hour running time and tightened the narrative it would have been a 10. It's longer than The Godfather. There is a tad bit of meandering in the second act of the movie. That could have been easily cut. The final act seemed very rushed. Like they realized the movie was going to be over 3 hours and they just pulled the plug. I may enjoy it more the more I see it but I have a few reservations.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Barely Manages To Float,"The best thing about It: Chapter One wasn't Pennywise but The Losers Club. It was their natural chemistry, strong dynamic, bonding & rapport that made us invest in the story. And then, the finely executed horror bits & wicked act from Bill Skarsgård uplifted the film further. It was funny, fresh & frightening, and paved a solid platform for It: Chapter Two which unfortunately is unable to deliver the smart, sophisticated & satisfying experience its predecessor offered in spades.Directed by Andy Muschietti, the sequel follows Stephen King's novel more closely yet features an overlong & bloated premise whose runtime is strongly felt. The first act is interesting, plus The Loser Club reunion has the same vibe that their younger selves did. But once the board is set, things only head downhill as Muschietti loses his grasp on our attention, is unable to utilise the resources properly this time, and ends up delivering a rather inferior & underwhelming product.Clocking at 169 mins, what makes the ride difficult is its inconsistent pace. Also, the horror aspects are dumbed down, for most of the scares fall flat or seem childish & silly in comparison to last entry. Add to that, the final showdown does not live up to the hype either. The only aspect that retains its sharpness is its humour, mainly coz of Bill Hader who, like his younger counterpart, impresses the most. Bill Skarsgård does all he can to portray the demented & fiendish side of Pennywise but it isn't enough this time.On an overall scale, It: Chapter Two fails to make the most of the strong foundation of the first film, and is an occasionally thrilling & intermittently entertaining follow-up that never unlocks its full potential. Falling short in many things that its predecessor excelled at, it is a disappointing mess that lacks imagination in its scares, creativity in its approach & sincerity in its craftsmanship. Where Chapter One was brought to life with heart, passion & honesty which in turn made it soar, Chapter Two is simply dull, meandering & barely manages to float. What a shame!",,Anonymous,Horror

"IT Chapter One is Pennywise's Film, this is a film about the Losers","This is less of a horror film and more of a character driven film. This is about the characters and with a perfect cast featuring a stand out (and an arguably oscar-worthy performance by the brilliant Bill Hader) It Chapter Two provides an interesting and thoughtful story that suffers from some non-traditional pacing issues. This movie is long at 2 hours and 50 minutes, but there is a whole hour missing to this film and with IT being one of my favorite novels, the pacing issues aren't because it is slow or too quick, but rather it certainly feels like there is a lot missing (for example, without providing spoilers, a specific character has much more to do, but instead he is introduced and does a couple things much later on and there is a lot more to his arch that I assume was already filmed).This isn't a scary movie and it isn't supposed to be a scary movie. This is a film about the characters and that is the film's biggest strength. Now we need the 4 hour cut of this film that director Andy Muschetti said existed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A solid follow-up to the original that continues the streak of excellent adaptations of King's work,"IT Chapter Two is the sequel to the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel of the same name. Starring Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Isaiah Mustafa, and Bill Skarsgård, it is a solid follow-up to the original that continues the streak of excellent adaptations of King's work.Twenty-seven years after the events of Chapter One, the Loser's Club have all grown up and left the town of Derry, Maine, with the sole exception of Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), who chose to remain as the town librarian. One night, Mike realises to his horror that IT has returned and has resumed feeding on scared children. Before IT can claim more victims, Mike calls up his childhood friends one by one to reunite them and fulfill the vow they took when they were younger to destroy IT permanently.Much like its predecessor, IT Chapter Two relies on scaring the audience through building up a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and inner torment within the main characters, rather than with typical jumpscares. In spite of that, this film was considerably more drama heavy with less horror elements, likely due to the previous film featuring children a great deal more and the protagonists now being mature adults. The grown-up Loser's Club cast in this film each do a fantastic job mirroring their child counterparts. All of them bring their own uniqueness to their characters, with Bill Hader standing out the most as the grown up Richie, who injects some much needed comic relief into some of the film's more dramatic moments. However, once again, it is Bill Skarsgård as IT, in particularly his clown form Pennywise, who is truly terrifying as a supernatural force to be reckoned with. Despite the 170 minute runtime, the film is never boring and is brilliantly paced and edited thanks to the creative direction of Andy Muschietti. This really does feels like the conclusion to what could be considered the ultimate Stephen King adaptation, complete with all of the usual tropes and even some surprising references to his other work. With that said, IT Chapter Two is certainly worth watching, provided Chapter One has been viewed first of course.I rate it 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really Impressive,"I really liked and enjoyed the prequel but when this second part was announced knew it would be better.I think this is more than a horror movie or at least more than the typical horror movie, the form to make a concept for all protagonist was amazing exploring their deep fears and feelings making sad, epic, romantic and terror moments giving each character their respective moment to shine.The horror parts probably don't scare the all watchers but have a good visuals and did a good job in the terror camp overall, the movie works great with another categorys too making some emotionals parts with a strong impact.I really loved this film, one of the best recent movies of this type in my opinion and why not of all time too",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
How could they get it so wrong?! Gutted.,"Anyone who's read the book will find this an abomination. Anyone expecting a horror film, it isn't. I enjoyed the first, it had suspense, Pennywise had his dark, crazy moments, just the way he would stare for a second or 2 had a creepy factor. This has nothing, NOTHING. When a supposed horror film has the people laughing at 90% of what's going on, they've done it massively wrong. They tried to make IT a comedy!. I know a lot who haven't seen it yet will find that hard to believe, but it's true. There are so many ""comedy"" 1 liners thrown in at times when a normal person just wouldn't react that way, it's unbelievable. The CGI is terrible, real bad and they use it for 95% of everything going on. It doesn't follow its own certain rules that it sets down in parts. Many, MANY of the things wrong with this film I won't say due to spoilers.
SPOILER FREE about the end. If you thought it couldn't get anymore ridiculous than what you know from previous, well...you'll see.
The acting was decent, that's the 1 star.

Not as good as Chapter 1,"It cheaper 2 is long..very long, somethings just aren't right with it.

If that is the case why is he pandering on and on with the losers club? The biggest problem I had with it was the CGI it's everywhere, whatever happened to some make up or prosthetics I just find it so lazy in hollywood these days. It's not a bad film nor is it great it's a good sequel very rarely you find a sequel better than the first and I'm afraid this is another to add to the first of films that aren't as great as the first.

This didn't need to exist,"""Omg the cast is just so perfect"" isn't grounds to call this a good movie. The casting is indeed spot on and most of the actors (adults and kids alike) are great, but not even the best actors in the world can save an uncompelling story such as this one.Most of the 2hr 50min runtime is the EXACT same movie as the first chapter, except this time the jump scares come even cheaper. It gets old very quickly. Trim it about...hmm...an hour and a half and then we may have something.The most frustrating thing about It: Chapter Two is the way it so carelessly handles both the origins of Pennywise (including the way to actually defeating him) and the deeper themes and challenges of these characters. There was so much potential for emotional depth in this story, instead that was traded for the same sort of anthology type structure of the first film that, as stated before, overly relied on cheap scares.

Pennywise's terror overshadowed by blood and gore,"IT Chapter 2 - The seven survivors from Pennywise's 1989 mayhem have partly forgotten their ordeal and lead their own lives. Only Mike continues to live in Derry and remembers everything. 27 years thence, Mike calls up the other six to return to Derry as they promised in their childhood, as Pennywise has now made his appearance again and struck devastation.He is terrifying to start with and every encounter of his appearance is startling. Bill Skarsgard continues his impressive and flawless delivery of the role of the tormentor posing greater danger and infusing uninhibited fear among his challengers this time. It's a fight to the finish as the protagonists deal with their individual fears, recounting the childhood events and promise to stick together to banish Pennywise for good.This is the final installment of Stephen King's novel, thus holding out an unprecedented frenzy and expectation. Chapter 2 unfortunately turns into a repetitive storytelling by replaying scenes from the first part and showcasing Pennywise's encounters with each of his challengers in a quirky way. Its elicits some shrieks and squeals for sure, but enhances its dalliance with an unnecessary overdose of blood and gore. The climax is too long to endure actually, undermining the thrill and fear elements. With a running time of 170 minutes, IT Chapter 2 does get a bit monotonous, stretching our patience. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy are impressive, but no match to play foil to Skarsgard's Pennywise menace. Watch it you must if you are a fan of the horror genre, or Stephen King or if you've experienced the first part.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"9/10, if you consider this as not a horror but a fantasy movie","The Guys (and girl) back at it again! After 27 years had passed, the evil entity that is a metaphor for humanities' fears and negative emotions/thoughts/feelings is back to haunt them again by utilizing chilling illusions backed by great VFX to remind them of their childhood pains and fears. Great storytelling, as each of the protagonists experience the return of the demon by their own unique way, where each is pushed emotionally to the brink of madness, but at the same time, helps them to find and gain strength to unite and move forward in order to kick the devil's clown ass back to oblivion, but this time, it'll be once and for all (without another 27, 54, 81, or 108 years of waiting to return). I love the added childhood flashbacks which, to me, give the first movie more color than it does to the last one while also giving us one important message: not all frightening childhood is bad in the long run as it can also bind people together with unbreakable bonds even after separated for nearly 3 decades, and a little loss of memory of a particular event and place. There is one more important message in the final moments of the film which I'm not gonna mention here, I urge you to go watch it by yourself because the ending is very beautiful, comparable to the last year's 'Blade Runner 2049'. Don't listen to the critic too much for you will find it's beauty that they will never discover.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT was Fantastic,"When the Stephen King's 'IT' remake came out in 2017, it had much to live up to, - just given the way King's films are potrayed, it hd to live up to the thirll like his other flms have done, while remaining true to it's origins as well as book portions - which it did - I gave IT 8/10 previously.Casting -The kids in chapter one were stellar - and the casting director was spot in with the choices that he made to select the high school kids to face the crazed clown.This film was no different. not only did the casting director pick five adults who portrayed the resemblance of the young kids very well, but also casted 5 'adult' characters that complemented each other on screen very well.It literally felt like they were the same kids 27 years ago growing up in the small town of Berry - I don't think there has been a film to depict such a great resemblance in all the movies i have seen with a continuous story attached to it.The fight back -The 27 year return to the small town felt like a smoothe transition for the viewers and I at least felt that these kids who had seemingly 'defeated' Pennywise before could do it again. i felt every fear that these grown adults now were facing to face the crazed clown.The 'token' segments even gave us more inside stories to what happened when they were kids adding even more depth the film's story and built up the ultimate showdown of why these kids must defeat the pennywise - who'm they have been fearing this whole time.-The film really thought of everything to add to, to make the smoothe transition towards the final battle between the now older kids. Everything just meshed so perfectly together.The only downfall I would say is how the kids from Berry had figured out how to defeat him - no spoilers here , but at first I felt with what the writers came up with , was a tad bit dull - but then you have to actually think about the given message in the film, as to why it worked , and why it hadn't worked before.The messages might seem clear to some , and not clear to others - but I am not spoiling it just for the fact I would want you to get that satisfaction of figuring it out yourself - within that given message the defeat of the clown makes sense , and although , the final battle scene could have had a few minor tweaks here and there, it ultimately wasn't too bad, it still worked.#DurationThe length of the film is nearly 3 hours and although some might be complaining about that - it honestly needed to be. The film flowed so perfectly and kept me intrigued for the entire time - It had to be that long because there was so much they needed to add, and they added the right segment to conclude the IT series. The writing was superb and excellentRating: 9/10 - It had everything you could ask for - the adults were just as funny as the kids were / the chemistry was there all the same / the resemblances to the younger versions were spot on / there was actually some jump off moments, although predictable on some occasions, it still was brilliantly done.I also did watch this in IMAX so it added some extra fright with the sound fx and music, but oh by gawd , i paid full price for this film, and honestly i would have paid double (maybe... thats a lot of money for a film - would definitely pay it for both films together)Really enjoyed the film and its a definite buy when it comes out.Watch the first one on Netflix because you honestly have to get the origin story and then go watch this ASAP , you wont be disappointed.-",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was......ok,"It was a ok movie overall, but was way too long though. After previews expect to spend 3 HOURS in the theater. If the story would have been better, 3 hours would have been ok, but the story was just so so. Also there was too much CGI and too little Pennywise. The best part of IT is the clown, and there was too little of him imo.But as long as you go in knowing this is a 3 hour movie, has too much CGI and too litle Pennywise, then you will probably think its a ok/good movie as well.I do hope the movie does well though because I would love to see a third installment, but next time, have more Pennywise!!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good horror movie better comedy,"It chapter 2 picked up where one left off. After defeating pennywise in the sewers and banishing him for a long 27 years when the losers club makes there blood oath and swear to come back if pennywise was to ever return. 27 years later pennywise comes back, he is back to his ways again (killing people again in other words). I believe it was a really good movie and it told a good theme that friendship is really important. I would rate this movie a 3.5/5 because the scary scenes were not as frighting as they were anticipated to be. Don't get me wrong I would recommend this movie for anyone 17 and up. It was a fantastic movie and it had really good humor to it. I thought the cast was brilliantly put together. One character that I liked in the book and the movies was Richie, because of his witty humor and he knew his morals when it came down to running or staying and helping, but it was hard for him because he was scared, scared that his ""secret"" would come out. But i thought Bill Hater did a fantastic job with the character. In this movie the characters looked almost identical to there past one. I thought the director's veiw of this movie was incredible and spot on because it followed the book amazingly and was executed the movie effectively and efficiently.

"Less horror, more human.","I find it really odd that the parts I found most compelling in this film were the scenes where there were little to no horror elements. When it was just the adults confronting their figurative demons and interacting with each other, I was entertained. That may also have something to do with the fact that horror just isn't my favourite genre. With that being said, Richie's token scene may have been my favourite in the film, and the expansion of his character was done quite nicely. Hats off to Andy Muschietti (sp?).

Perfectly timed Jumpscares. A proper storyline from Stephen Kings idea of IT.Chapter 2 felt more like a Comedy and not a Horror Movie.

Same as the first part but not the same,"I saw the original made for TV (1990) movie which was considered at that time one of the best horror movies ever made. Considering the incredible success of the 2016 remake; it is obvious the material was really good and terrifying. Putting kids in danger always is.
I never read the IT book; but I understand that chapter two is basically within the same book.
Chapter 2; gather after 27 years the original ""Loosers Club"" when the only member staying in town realizes Pennywise is still alive.It is not the same threatening kids than adults; so Muscetti uses lots of flashbacks with the original kids; but as we already know who survives there is no much to be scare there. So to compensate that, the movie takes the characters apart;. creates a few horror scenes for each character and then join them together in the final act in the big confrontation.I cannot deny that I had several jumps on my seat; after the first two hours the movie becomes repetitive as the horror scenes and there is still another 50 minutes to go.In terms of acting; Bill Skarsgard perfectly fill up Tim Curry shoes and sometimes is ever more terrifying.As the adults; Bill Hader and James Ransone are the ones who really shine mostly because they are the comic relief. Chastain is completely lost here; her character is less written than the younger one. Mc Avoid is better but his characters is also underwritten. The rest is just standard fare.In brief; if you see the first one you probably will want to see the second; but it is not really as good or terrifying",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

That made Pennywise seem so weak compared to the book's ending. And worst of all he didn't even look scary he look the villain at the end of Wreck it Ralph.

I initially thought Bill Hader would play his part to comedic and be out of place but I thought he was one of the best performers. Although this was a film for the adults, the kids didn't get much screen time and what scenes they did get felt more like a nostalgia trip than flashbacks. The film definitely lacks what made the first film so good because of this.The film itself it a bit of a let down after the intensity of part one but they only had the source material to work with so they can't be blamed for not living up to the previous film.The ending sucks, but we all knew that!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Decent, Not as Good as the First","It's widely agreed upon that no matter what version, the first half of It is better than the second. It's been 27 years since the Loser's Club defeated Pennywise, and everyone's favorite demon clown has returned for more. The kids, now adults in their 40s, get back together to defeat the monster one more time. However, they've all lost their memory, except for Mike, and most of the movie is spent on them going through Derry trying to regain them by collecting items from their pasts. It's not bad content, per se, it just feels like filler and takes way too long. The movie's runtime is 2 hours, 44 minutes. That's excessive for a movie like this.However, it's balanced out by absolutely fantastic performances. Bill Skarsgard returns as Pennywise, and he's perfect. He doesn't talk as much this time around, but he nails all the gestures and mannerisms of being a creepy clown. He's just as good as last time. The other person who garnered a lot of attention is Bill Hader as Richie. Deservedly so, as he does exactly what he should, act like grown-up Richie. The rest of the adults, including Jessica Chastain as Beverly and James McAvoy as Bill, also do their part, and we do see the kids we knew all grown up. Since we get this microcosm of their lives, there's a lot of emotion put into it with how they cope with their memories and facing their fears through a completely different, more grown up lens.There's still more to dislike, unfortunately. The scares were way too predictable. After the first few, you can easily do a ""3, 2, 1, jumpscare"" countdown in your head. Plus, there are way too many jumpscares. Henry didn't need to be in this at all. I know he's important in the book, but hey, Lord of the Rings worked without Tom Bombadil, so this could work without Henry. All he does it eat up runtime. All in all, It: Chapter 2 doesn't come near the heights of the first movie, but it wasn't expected to. It's a decent film, but it's not going to be one of the most remembered horror movies of all time like the first one.By the way, there is reportedly interest in making a cut of It that intertwines scenes from both movies into one massive, 5-hour movie. That would be awesome.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy movie but a disappointing ending,"Going to see it I was pretty excited, I enjoyed the first movie and was eager to see how the story ended. The movie itself was not bad, Pennywise was just as creepy as always, completely owning every scene he was in, the grown ups did a great job at portraying the adult versions of the kids, and I really enjoyed watching everything unfold. I just for some reason felt like the ending sort of fell on it's face. as the movie reached the climax, I felt sort of let down by how it was all playing out, the creepiness of the movie seemed to be replaced with a more humorous vibe. I would definitely recommend seeing it, it was really fun to see all the new things they came up with to scare us.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
King's realm,"This recent incarnation of It is not scary, but I still love both films regardless. They feel really true to the 80s/90s adaptations of King, which are indefinitely flawed and stray from the origin stories, as well, and arguably they are not very scary, either...There is a massive preference for humour over scares in the second instalment, which I actually think is a wise move.
It starts off uncomfortable and dark with the homophobic attack from the book and you think It has also come of age and that the film will be more adult in theme, but as soon as the Losers are back together you also feel like you're in the company of friends again. It becomes, like the first film, a story of friendship and overcoming personal demons rather than a horror story.I was worried the adult cast would ruin the warm feelings I had for the Losers, because the kids were so great. I would only question Mike's portrayal which is unhinged and considering he plays the pivotal role in the book as the narrator, he comes across like he's just lost his mind in this film and he's the least likeable or noticeable character... The book gives the black guy the ONLY voice for once by making him the narrator and that is completely diminished in this film, which I do have a problem with.
Derry is a rotten and prejudiced place, regardless of whether the clown has an influence over that or is to blame for that (I don't believe It is the cause, I think King was commenting on the evil in humanity and the clown just takes advantage of the fear we create in our own communities) and it's important to keep that at the forefront. It is always going to be relevant.It feels like the same kind of production as Christine and Thinner and Dreamcatcher and Stand By Me and Creepshow and the original Pet Sematary. And the King cameo helps this film feel like it's a nostalgic, warm and familiar place to be, too. We are back in Maine and back in King's bizarre and surreal realm where let's face it, even if It was a perfect adaptation of the book, everyone would still exit the cinema with similar questions!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Preferred the first movie! 4/10,"Review:
Well, that's 3 hours of my life that I won't be getting back! I was really disappointed with this film because the plot is all over the place, and the whole back and forth in time thing, made the movie drag. The horrific Pennywise scenes were a bit random, and I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters like I did in the first film. On the plus side, there are some ""jump out of your seat"" moments, which were pretty scary, but you don't get to appreciate the attention to detail because it's mostly shot with a dark palette. I did enjoy the first movie, which is why I was so disappointed with this sequel, and I personally don't know why it's nearly 3 hours long. Anyway, in 2016 Derry, Maine, Don Hagarty witnesses his boyfriend Adrian Mellon being murdered by Pennywise after a gang of homophobic teenagers beat them up and throw Adrian off a bridge while leaving the annual Derry carnival. Overhearing a police scanner, Mike Hanlon (Isiah Mustafa) discovers It has returned and calls his childhood friends, Bill (James McAvoy), Eddie (James Ransone), Richie (Bill Hader), Ben (Jay Ryan), Stanley (Andy Bean), and Beverly (Jessica Chastain), back to Derry to honour the promise they made in 1989, to kill It if it came back. While the others travel to Derry with only hazy memories and a sense of dread, Stan slashes his wrists in the bathtub soon after getting the call. The Losers meet for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where Mike refreshes their memories, while they are tormented by hallucinations and learn of Stan's death. Richie and Eddie decide to leave until Beverly reveals that ever since she was exposed to Its Deadlights, she has been experiencing visions of their deaths should they fail to leave town without fulfilling their promise. Mike takes Bill to his library abode and shows him, via a drug-induced vision, that they can stop It for good. After the others agree to perform the ritual, Mike explains that the ritual requires seven personal items from there past to be sacrificed. Henry Bowers, who survived being pushed into the well at the Neibolt house and was arrested for murdering his father in 1989, escapes from a mental institution with help from It. Meanwhile, in the Losers old clubhouse, Mike advises the others to find their artefacts by retracing their steps following their falling out after first entering the Neibolt house. Beverly finds Ben's love letter at her old home, still believing Bill wrote it and encounters It posing as Mrs. Kersh. Ben recalls his childhood encounter with It at high school before realising his artefact is the yearbook page Beverly signed which he kept in his wallet. Both Richie and Eddie recall their own personal encounters with It while retrieving their artefacts, a game token from an abandoned arcade, and an inhaler. Pennywise taunts Richie about his sexuality, leading to him deciding to leave again and reconsidering again after recalling Stan's bar mitzvah, before menacing Eddie in the guise of the Leper, but flees when Eddie standing up to It causes the being to shrink in size. Bill finds his childhood bicycle and recovers the paper boat from the storm drain where Georgie was killed. The group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers, and they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth ages ago. The ritual appears to work in trapping the Deadlights in the sealing jar, but they escape after It emerges from the jar in a giant spider-like form. Will the Losers finally kill It with there new ammunition? You have to watch the 3-hour epic movie to find out! Although they used established actors in this movie, and they gave each of the characters some depth, I didn't feel the emotion that I did in the first film. Also, the storyline didn't seem to flow properly because it looked like various sketches pieced together. In terms of a horror film, it didn't have the same shock value as the first film, and for a movie in this genre with a 15 rating, I don't know what type of audience this was made for. With that aside, it still made a profit so I wouldn't be surprised to see a third movie in this franchise. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Andy Muschietti, who also brought you Mama and It. With only 3 major releases, he has done a good job, in terms of box office takings, and now that he's working with established actors, the only way is up for this newcomer. With 9 movies in development, which include Dracul, Time Machine, Attack on Titan, The Howling, Robotech, and DC's, The Flash, which is due to be released in 2022, he's obviously become a bankable director that studios are willing to take a risk with.Budget: $79million

Unnecessary Closure,"As one of the massive fans of the first IT movie in the now IT series, hearing that viewers would have the opportunity to re enter the town of Derry, Maine in an IT Chapter 2 directed again by Andres Muschietti was very exciting. Watching The Losers take on Pennywise on the big screen yet again was a sight and a good continuation of the first film, however aspects of the plot regarding the character development, the overly lengthy run time of the film and predictability were what left me wondering if the continuation was really necessary at all.
When people start going missing yet again in Derry Maine, the Losers Club who have long been separated living own lives as now adults reunite 27 years later in their home town to fulfill their pact and finally put an end to Pennywise and the terrorism that comes with him. Obstacles encountered along the way bring the group closer together and throughout the film many flashbacks of moments from their childhood appear as each character regains their memory of the events that took place all those years ago.
As a viewer, getting to know the characters as adults, many resemblances of their childhood come forward in the way each one of them is leading their new life. While I do acknowledge that the casting in this movie was phenomenal, capturing each character accurately from child to adult, the way in which the script was written left me wondering what exactly happened to some of the characters and their behavior from their past to now present self. Characters such as Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain) and Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) were the two in who I believed differed most from their childhood nature due to the constant amount of flashbacks. Seeing the way both these characters interacted side by side with their childhood personas were what made me realize just how different their behavior became. While there is room for many different interpretations as to why they have changed, after seeing the first IT movie many times it seemed odd how the writers had Ben characterized as being almost entirely different from his childhood self and Beverly losing the inner strength she seemed to have as a child in her adulthood, the flashbacks are what assisted with the doubt and contributed to a bit of confusion when it came to the characters development.
While the amount of flashbacks throughout the film gives the viewer a good sense of nostalgia and also proves necessary with some aspects of the plot, it was a few scenes such as those along with other scenes from the present that created an unnecessarily long length of the film in which I believe could have been cut down shorter and still have been equally if not more successful. What I believe director Andres Muschietti failed to realize when creating this film is that many scenes that made the cut shouldn't have as many had little contribution to the main plot of the film. Scenes that proved essential also left me having a larger sense of predictability than I was expecting and left me knowing too often when things such as jump scares or key events in the storyline would occur.
IT Chapter 2 representing the second half of the famous Stephen King novel IT, proved to be an interesting take on what happens next for the Losers Club. As an IT fan I do have to say that I enjoyed the film as a sense of closure it gave to the first however there were many more parts of the film where I was left a bit disappointed in which I was not expecting. To fans of the IT series who have not yet seen the second chapter of the film I would recommend to go watch it as it did have incredible cinematography and a great cast. Many laughs came from the film as well as some tugged heartstrings and while it did have its flaws it was also a good wrap up to its first film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointing,I was a big fan of the first movie which I felt focused more on pennywise which the best part of the movie. The second movie focused more on the losers club. The cast itself was the most redeeming quality of the movie but overall the movie left a lot to be desired. I felt myself anticipating the movie to end,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could've been better.,"The first one was way better than this sequel, even tho it was the same case with the originals back in the 90's. The length of more than two and a half hours was something I really enjoyed and the movie was not boring at all, but I expected way more. The CGI creatures were awful, I don't know if they were meant to be scary or funny to be honest, they reminded me of the Evil Dead style of horror. The Pennywise clown sequence were he finally transforms into the spider was also mediocre, I expected something more, more inovation in his looks and behavior. Overall 6/10 is the best I can give.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

In the second part of the film, one of the Losers Club, calls them back to Derry to end Pennywise, once and for all.

Good follow up for the most part. With issues,"IT chapter two is pretty good for the most part and a great follow up to chapter one. All of the casting is amazing with a stand out from Bill Hader as Richie. Well, Jessica Chastain, James Macavoy and everyone else is also all great as the adult losers in the movie. Bill Skarsgard is once again great and entertaining as heck as Pennywise and all the returning young cast from the first one are good during the flashback sequences. Andres Musuchietti once again like with the first movie does a great job directing and the cinematography is also great with a unique look added to the film. Even the humor is really funny and some of Pennywise's forms are coolly taken directly from the book which I am a huge fan of the book. Issues with the film are with the some of the story choices they can feel very rushed, or sloppy with the pacing feeling off at times. The movie also is missing that unique heart the first movie had of the kids standing up against evil by themselves, it isn't really there anymore though the film has pieces of it. Also it isn't as scary as chapter one but instead a little more shocking and disturbing, or as well put together overall as the first one. The final act can feel really silly at times though being still very book accurate. Overall It Chapter two is a good conclusion to chapter one finishing off Kings book. It sadly isn't as great as the first but still very likable being very book accurate and with a great director, cast. If your a huge fan of the book like myself you really will enjoy it and its book accuracy. I can't wait for the directors cut to see what they left out on top of this nearly 3-hour movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It Was Good but Writing Was Off a Bit.,"This movie was good but the writing seemed labored, the jokes didn't work and there really wasn't a sense of 'togetherness' to The Losers. And for belaboring of 'endings not being good' it doesn't deliver one that is better than the novel. I checked to see if 'It 2' had different writers from the first and it did... and one of them was Stephen King. The running joke in the movie about endings was, no doubt, aimed at him.It's scares really weren't as good as the first movie, either. Like I said, it was still good but if you're expecting a big crescendo this movie falls short. And not to give anything away but if the big ending rewrite 'solution' was the real solution why didn't The Losers just do it from the beginning? I really preferred the novel and mini-series version where The Losers just have at it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""It Chapter Two"" is a satisfying conclusion to a great horror film.","""It Chapter Two"" may not deliver as many scares as it's predecessor but still nails delivering the source material to the big screen, along with the help from a pitch-perfect cast.In this horror sequel, twenty-seven years after their encounter with Pennywise the Dancing Clown, the Losers Club reconnect in Derry after receiving devastating news.I'll come right out and say that the real MVP in this film is Bill Hader. Hader is superb in his role offering viewers enough of a comedic performance as much as a dramatic one. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy are great, and Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is just as terrifying the second time around. ""It Chapter Two"" does feel long at some points, running close to three hours, the film needed to have its pacing arranged. Other than that, I enjoyed this sequel almost as much as Chapter One.

Much better than expected,"I am in no means a fan of modern horror movies and not really a fan of horror in general, if ghosts or the paranormal are involved I check out or don't even check in. There are exceptions, an obvious one being The Shining.I had seen and read a general dislike to this movie upon release but I have seen the original, and the recent remake of the first part so inevitably I was going to watch this. To my surprise I actually quite enjoyed it and I would normally be a prime contender to berate at the first opportunity. I thought it was good fun, though maybe that is not the soundbite you want from a 'scary' movie.I'm not sure I've ever been affected by jump scares, I just don't react to them, for me there was only one in this movie and it was obviously on it's way (ballon, bed, asylum), but nonetheless it was some of the imagery I enjoyed, that skit being one. The old lady I thought was fantastic.It's against the norm for me but I thought the humour was actually funny, I've definitely seen supposed comedies with much fewer laughs, I didn't feel this detracted from the 'horror' as 'horror' films don't really exist anymore. I was along for the ride and that's no small feat for me and this genre.The most horrifying scene is probably the opening scene, beyond that I generally liked most of the cast so it was somewhat irreverent to me how their journey's progressed as mentioned, I was onboard for the ride.It's a long movie but I felt it moved along at a decent pace, I can understand some of the criticisms, this could have had a much darker tone though I watched the original IT for the first time only a short time before the release of the first part of the remake, I can only really remember the second half of the original being ridiculous any way. I barely remember the first part of the remake ....but in this ....that old lady, that's going to stay with me for a while.Overall I think if you go into this with an open mind it's generally quite enjoyable, a bit silly and a bit sick. I think I will leave it there reiterating my words above 'good fun'.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A mixed bag,"Those looking for horror chills, may not quite find what they're looking for, as this film is largely about the journey, rather than the destination.

Those wanting to see epic horror and Pennywise, might be a little disappointed. Worth watching, with expectations in check. Still, quite enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quick thoughts,"The movie was great maybe not as much as the first one, and it was not even close to being as deep and real as the first one.The cgi was great, but at times a bit overused.
Some of the grown up characters didn't feel like the same characters as in the first (Ben and Beverly), and some felt too underdeveloped from the first one (Richie).But somehow, between all the jumpscares, i enjoyed every second of It. While it could have been shorter and it could have been more story driven, the jumpscares were fun, and much scarier than the first one.Will you like it? maybe. It depends on if you want to watch a movie thats entertaining from a technical view with great cgi and wacky jumpscares or if you want a deep heartfelt sequel that tells the story in the most optimal way.Personally I'm just happy to have these great characters in a new story, especially Pennywise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Horror movie screwing up your mind,"Before watching ""It chapter two"" , I have predicted that this movie's going to be really disturbing like the previous one and I guess my prediction is correct. The monsters or ghosts are weird. I get dumbfounded and highly motivated after watching it.My mental condition went up and down when I watched this because all the casts did freaking awesome job. They played with our minds.. There are a lot of scenes that will make you realize that your mind is the scariest. If you only wait for never ending jumping scare scenes, you'd better looked for other movies as this movie is super different with the others.

I can't wait to re-watch the original and compare them again.The bad: it is 3 hours, and it feels like it. The pacing sometimes feels off and the plot got a bit muddied because of it. There's also so much strobe effect, my head started to hurt which brought me out of the film.It had some tone issues. Its a bad sign when you're in a full theater and 1 out of 5 jokes get a chuckle when the rest are met with silence. There were also too many unnecessary jump scares and unnecessary gore, which compared to chapter 1, made the horror fall flat. After the success of chapter 1, it was hard for chapter 2 to not let some people down.I would love to watch the 90s one, then chapters 1 and 2, and compare them both to the book.

Key flaw to what could have been much better,"I didn't hate this movie, and even kind of liked it. Side Note: I had never read the book but I can tell you the opening scene was based on a true incident that happened in Bangor Maine where Stephen King lives and where I grew up. I remember it quite well when it happened.The key flaw to this movie is it relies too heavily on the audience transferring their understanding of the bond built in the first movie to the people playing the adult version of the kids in this movie. In most sequels your okay that they spend less time bond building because those relationships were already established in the prior flick. But these are adult actors who look only mildly like their child counterparts, and you don't really feel the connection that the movie presumes you do. To even further illustrate my point, a lot of the background to the relationships in this story is told in flashbacks to the kids.So the actors are together for a scene in the first of the movie, and the only time they are all back together again is during the final battle. It just dulls your investment in the characters and thus the overall movie entirely.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Some of the jumpscares were predictable but the others we not and they were amazing!

"closes the story of the Losers Club satisfyingly, although the execution is often sloppy and messy","Sometimes good, sometimes not, often engaging, often not, It Chapter Two closes the story of the Losers Club satisfyingly, although the execution is often sloppy and messy.It Chapter Two follows the Losers Club, bound by blood pact, as they seek to destroy It once and for all. Returning to Derry, they are made to confront a vengeful evil while relieving past fears and traumas that did not go away in adulthood. As an ensemble, the cast have balanced roles without one dominating the presence, unlike the original where Bill's guilt is emphasized. However, because of different character arcs, the thematic message becomes muddied. The character arcs deal with the same fears, guilt and repressed feelings from the original, although additional perspectives were added.Mike is underused and should have been the emotional center, notwithstanding the need to definitely close a chapter in the ensemble's life centered around Derry and It, and by also being the character that remained in Derry. The reveal he withheld information from the group that the American natives died fighting It felt shoehorned and his reasoning contrived. Bill's guilt is explored deeper when it is revealed his reluctance to join his younger brother Georgie was intentional and not because of sickness. Richie is revealed to be a closet gay who developed feelings for Eddie since. Homosexuality is a theme hammered violently in the opening scene when a gay couple was brutally attacked after which followed It's first reappearance, although the film doesn't overtly project a pro-LGBT stance. Stan's suicide does not help the Losers Club and the letters sent by him explaining his reason is unnecessary. Beverly continues to experience sexual and family abuse through her husband, but this is glossed over and her prominence as the lone female is not as strong from the original. Ben remains insecure with his feelings with Beverly. Their resolution is lovely, as Beverly realizes Ben wrote the poem she kept safe.Overall the film is convoluted and has a repetitive story, although the latter can be forgiven because childhood trauma don't necessarily go away in adulthood. While the film has multitudes of messages, it gets bogged down because it does too many things at once. Despite its epic length, the conclusion is well earned because the characters have fully grown from their trauma. Although the pacing can be slow, especially during the first hour, the narrative hastens when the ensemble begins the quest to find totems of their pasts and It's appearance becomes more frequent.Speaking of It, Bill Skarsgard is absolutely fantastic and the film's true highlight. The scene were he gave It emotional range during the baseball game is phenomenal. Skarsgard is terrifying, although the CGI feels overdone during the final battle. Part of his awesome performance is embodying the non-human personality which director Andy Muschietti characterized It to differentiate him from Tim Curry. The rest of the cast is good and no one in particular is bad. Bill Hader steals the show by balancing comedy with inner sadness. A lacking element here present from the original is Derry's creepiness. Almost every citizen in Derry from the original had sinister, hidden motives or bad intentions making the Losers Club stood out. Compared to the original Chapter Two looks more beautiful direction wise. The cinematography and production designed are improved, despite portraying the same setting. Many of the visual and practical effects are great. The horror is strong and score is more engaging.It Chapter Two has many qualities riding for it but also weaknesses from the script, ultimately coming up short to the original.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One-Line Review: It - Chapter Two (3 Stars),"The second chapter of IT is not even half as scary as the first one, and instead gives out a prolonged rehash of the first one with the addition of a mythical origin story of Pennywise and useless CGI all of which made me want to walk out of the theatre, the assumed saving grace of comedy not helping either. TN.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Satisfying Final Act,"As a massive fan of the first chapter, I counted down the days until I get to feast my eyes on the closing segment of the saga. And while CHAPTER 2 certainly delivers on ramping up the production (more blood, brutal kills, intricate set pieces) a compelling aspect of the first part was sorely missing.What made CHAPTER ONE absolutely bone-chilling was that the terror wasn't confined to Pennywise alone, but by other residents of this mysterious town who are hellbent on terrorizing these poor kids. From the adults to the parents to the bullies, fear was at every turn, and the killer clown was more than happy to exploit this.And while it does occasionally touch upon this in this second half (the brutal hate crime, the bullied little girl with the birthmark) that element seems to be discarded altogether, giving the viewer less chance to feel absolute dread for the new batch of victims in this go around.Of course, they are not the focus of the story. With the grown-up Losers Club returning to Derry with all their baggage in hand, the horror seems surface-level, at times even comical and groan-inducing. You don't really get the teeth of the terror, as in-your-face as the brutality may be.What does translate is the tremendous chemistry between the actors much like the cast of its' predecessor. There is a fair amount of levity (albeit misplaced at times) that equals the first chapter and a genuine sense of camaraderie between the actors. The highs are high and the lows are heartbreaking.Shortcomings aside, its still a fitting end to a saga that deals with some heavy topics coupled with effective scares and even a dose of heart. It's not even a question of ""is it worth watching?"" If you've seen the first one, the answer simply is ""yes"".",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Welcome Back To Derry,"It's strange to say that the dramatic parts of a horror film landed better than the horror parts, but that's It: Chapter Two's biggest issue - the horror just isn't scary. They sure think the horror scenes are scary. They come fast and furious with a ton of aggressive sound effects and CGI, desperately trying to prove to us that they're scary, but they're not.This film opens with a hate crime against a gay couple that strikes the wrong note right off the bat. This scene actually is brutal and scary, because it's one of the few scenes that isn't loaded to the brim with computer effects and it feels like something that would really happen in a messed up town like Derry. Even when Pennywise the clown shows up towards the end of that scene, most of his effects at least appear practical.Starting off like this gave me false hope that, maybe, this film would be stronger and scarier than the first. The next 30 minutes are equally strong with the audience catching up with the Loser's Club in present day. The transitions between each character's new life are beautifully handled and incredibly cinematic.Once everyone gathers back in Derry, it becomes a slightly dull series of predictable funhouse horror scenes as each character must return to a place of trauma before meeting back up to fight Pennywise. Blessedly, the final showdown, while drenched with the CGI I've spent so much time complaining about, is stronger than the finales of either the novel or the original TV miniseries.It Chapter Two is the very definition of a mixed bag. There's a lot to love, a lot to shrug at, and a lot to hate, but it manages to be entertaining enough and frequently moving enough to look past a lot of the film's flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the original movie,"First of all, when I first watched the teaser of the movie, I really liked it and I was so hyped about that movie because it was so scary. The plot of the sequel was very interesting, mysterious and kinda different than the first movie. The storyline was well-written and well-explained, even though it wasn't similar to the previous movie. The characters were exactly the same, however they were way more well-developed and really likeable. The filming location of the movie was the same as before, just a small town in America. Sadly, the casting wasn't the same as before, however I really enjoyed the adult versions of the OG characters and their acting was really good. In my opinion, it wasn't as scary as the original movie, however there were some creepy scenes (especially, the apartment scene with Beverly). The killcount of the movie was very bloody, however most kills were done off-screen. The opening scene was definitely unpredictable, very intense and it definitely caught me off guard. The ending scene was kinda predictable, however the 3rd act wasn't as good as the previous movie. I have to admit, it was a kinda emotional movie and there were too many emotionally intense scenes during the film. Gladly, there were many flashback scenes and we could see the young versions of the characters again! Overall, ""It Chapter Two"" was a nice sequel, kinda creepy, intense and I would probably recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, I hope they're gonna make a 3rd movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent but a little long,"I enjoyed my time watching ""It: Chapter 2"" even if it was too long of a movie overall. I didn't check my watch, I wasn't uncomfortable sitting in my seat, but there were scenes I think they could've cut from the movie without effecting the outcome.
Although all the scary scenes were pretty tame, violent but tame, I was surprised watching how many others jumped out of the corner of my eye.
The real treat of the film is Bill Skarsgard (I'm sure I butchered that spelling) as Pennywise but that also is my gripe, not enough of him. If ""It"" wasn't a single story Bill would be well on his way to be a new Freddy, Jason, Micheal Myers in a franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better and Worse than the First IT,"The biggest problem I had with the first IT was the lack of story. I felt that movie was lots of great scenes, but without much story. The story this time around is much clearer. It just goes off the rails in the final act.
I thought they did a great job with the casting, especially the adult version of Eddie. The actor completely nailed the performance. He even looks like the younger actor all grown up.
If you read the 1,100+ page novel, you know that the movie is very different from the book - as it should be, as the book was a huge letdown. At least for me. Thankfully there are no giant space turtles here.
I loved the humor in the story. Others have complained that there was too much, but I thought it worked.
Overall, the CGI ending is a bit over the top, but if you enjoyed the first one, you should like this one, too.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Beep Beep, It Franchise","After reading the sprawling book several years ago I went through a bit of a ""adaptation watch"" and have seen the original Tim Curry epic, the first Skarsgard rendition and now this. Acting more as a meandering sequel to the first film than a straight up adaptation, It 2: The Ittening fails to match the chemistry of the original ensemble, and makes some deliriously silly tonal and narrative decisions mainly to accommodate a rambling sequence of inconsistent jump scares. Parts of it do work though, Bill Hader is surprisingly effective and the choice to cast the fantastic (but underrated) James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak was a fantastic one. The cameos/heavy handed King references betray an unearned swagger.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I loved the Bill Hader/James McAvoy moments...,"I liked the second half of this film a lot more than the first. Not that its totally garbage, there are still good scenes and moments...but the characters have forgotten whats happened and have to spend time re-learning things we already know, and because of that it felt a bit long. And the only really character who is really built upon is Richie. And Bill Hader really shines and mostly steals the show. The whole cast is good and James McAvoy has a particulary heartbreaking scene where he's begging Pennywise to take him instead, but I think you feel more for Richie in this movie. And so I really liked those aspects of the film.Another negative, is that I didnt find it that particulary scary. The CGI was a bit overused and looked pretty fake at times. Again Bill, is really great in this role and I wished they just relied more on him and his talent because he can be genuinely creepy.But I still didnt hate the film. I didnt find the first one that scary either but really enjoyed the kids and how it felt like a coming of age story, and again...I liked the cast and I loved the concepts of them standing up to their fears and letting go. Thats where all the interesting stuff is.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining but average.,"Being the second chapter of a movie that set the bar high, it's not bad, however, despite having an excellent new cast with very good performances, it doesn't beat the first part. It has an entertaining script to follow, with a evolution that considers new events not shown in the first part, which seems good to me, since it enriches and complements the whole story very well. The script also contains a slight amount of humor to cushion the tension of its scenes and there are a couple of very good cameos, one more relevant than the other.Pennywise and his mind games are still terrifying for their random and accelerated movements. There are more sequences with visual effects, but they aren't necessarily better. I think the bigger the clown transformation, the less creepy it was.Another bad point, it's too long a movie. The third act especially, could have been shorter. That is a clear flaw in the final edition.Despite all that, it's still a good movie. If you are one of the masochists who love jump scares, this movie is highly recommended to watch at night, with the lights off and at full volume.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Minor details never were a problem, at least for me, not even in the first part.If I must see this as a horror movie, something is DEFINITELY not right in the manufacturing.

So IT: CHAPTER 2................is fine.,"IT Chapter 2 (Non-Spoiler Review)So IT Chapter 2 is...........fine.Now I'm going to be real with you. I knew from the moment they announced Chapter 2 that it was not going to be better than Chapter 1. Here's the thing, sequels can be hard to make and its always awesome to see them be better than the movie that came before them, but unfortunately 9 times out of 10 when it comes to horror movies, the sequels don't hold up to be better. The main reason on why I think this especially for IT (and this is just my opinion): too much background information on the entity of Pennywise/killers. When it comes to something like Pennywise in horror movies I personally find it better to leave the imagination behind the mystery of what ""IT"" is. That's honestly why I think ""The Shape"" in the Halloween franchise still holds up till this day, because even though yes Michael Myers the person has a background, he is still shown as an entity of evil to not know what he is thinking so it leaves room for imagination. I believe they did a good job with Pennywise by the end of the first chapter by leaving a mystery behind what he actually is, but enough to know what his goal is.I wasn't a huge fan of most of the CGI parts, because it just felt too unreal to me personally and some of it looked pretty bad. Unfortunately this movie did not scare me in the slightest, but the saving grace of the movie that I really like is the way it was delivered for certain tension based scenes and the characters. I care for all the characters and I can appreciate this movie for being a character driven kind of movie for all them dealing with the trauma they have went through growing up leading towards going back to their hometown after 27 years.VERDICT: Overall this movie is fine for what it is. I can tell it was made with a lot of heart for the franchise. Not better than IT Chapter 1.

Perfect conclusion.,"It Chapter Two(based on the second half of Stephen King's novel) continues with the story of the Losers Club, 27 years after the events of It(2017). After facing off against the horrifying clown, Pennywise(Bill Skarsgard), Beverly(Jessica Chastain), Bill(James McAvoy), Richie(Bill Hader), Ben(Jay Ryan) & the rest of the Losers Club, have all grown up & left Derry. Then a shattering phone call, brings them all back to Derry.It Chapter Two is an excellent film. Director Andy Muschietti has retained all the ingredients that made It(2017), an absolute delight to watch. The horror set pieces have been perfectly blended with hilarious one-liners. There are one or two perfectly executed jump scares. The climactic set piece is awe-inspiring. However, if I had to choose, I'd say I liked It(2017) a tad bit better than this movie. The highlight of this franchise is that you care about every single main character. The younger cast's adult replacements are just as flawless & are a perfect match to their younger counterparts. Jessica Chastain is spectacular as Beverly Marsh. James McAvoy is outstanding as Bill Denbrough. Bill Hader is mind-blowing as Richie Tozier. Isiah Mustafa is great as Mike Hanlon. Jay Ryan is brilliant as Ben Hanscom. James Ransone is awe-inspiring as Eddie Kaspbrak. Andy Bean is good as Stanley Uris. Chastain, McAvoy, Hader, Mustafa, Ryan, Ransone & Bean share this natural camaraderie, that was also shared by the actors who played the younger versions of their characters in It(2017). Bill Skarsgard is the star of the show as Pennywise. Skarsgard once again gives his all, in his unforgettable performance as Pennywise. Jaeden Martell, Wyatt Oleff, Jack Dylan Grazer, Finn Wolfhard, Sophia Lillis, Chosen Jacobs & Jeremy Ray Taylor are amazing as the young versions of Bill Denbrough, Stanley Uris, Eddie Kaspbrak, Richie Tozier, Beverly Marsh, Mike Hanlon & Ben Hanscom, respectively. Teach Grant & Nicholas Hamilton are awesome as Henry Bowers & Young Henry Bowers, respectively. It Chapter Two is a must watch for fans of It(2017) & fans of Stephen King's source material.

A Step Down From the First But Enjoyable to Watch,"IT Chapter 2 Review:Defeated by members of the Losers' Club, Pennywise returns 27 years later to terrorize of Derry once again. Now adults, the childhood friends have long since gone their separate ways. But when people start disappearing, Mike Hanlon calls the others home for one final stand. Damaged by scars from the past, the united Losers must conquer their deepest fears to destroy the shape-shifting Pennywise. I thought the first installment of this movie series was pretty good. It captured a good tone, had a compelling story, and interesting character dynamics. I don't know many people who were fans of the first that wasn't excited for the sequel. Chapter 2 was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Unlike most people, I had a hard time figuring out my thoughts on the movie. The first time I didn't really like it all that much. I thought it was mediocre. Then I saw it again a week later and I think I liked it. Then the next day I debated again and made pros and cons. In the end I think this is an enjoyable movie. The kids story is more interesting but I think this story is interesting as well. However the almost 3 hour runtime is about an hour way too long. So much unnecessary scenes were added. One aspect being flashbacks with the kids. They were mostly unnecessary. When the adults explore Derry alone, they encounter different places where they have a specific memory. I think that was a good idea because those were kind of more key elements. The big problem with the flashbacks was the CGI and voice editing. Since the kids have grown up a little more, their faces look a little different and some of their voices have changed. The CGI was just horrible to look at. Their faces were just filled with what I can only describe as over emotion. Sophia Lillis had the least amount of work done so she was pretty good. Their voices were even more high pitch than in the first and sometimes the audio was just sped up and overwhelming to hear. There was basically no emotion in the voices. Not their fault but more the editors. The acting was fine. Bill Hader had to be my favorite. He provided many funny jokes and actually put emotion towards his character. There's a character arc for him that's supposed to be a big deal but it wasn't too much of a big deal, at least how it came off. When it's first introduced the way it's presented felt off to me. Anyway I liked him the most. Personally I wanted Amy Adams to play adult Beverly but I thought Jessica Chastain did a pretty good job. And if Adams did play her she may have not gotten the opportunity to play her role in Sharp Objects with the best acting from her I've ever seen. Chastain had probably the most interesting character and she just made the most sense throughout the movie logically. Bill Skarsgård was good as Pennywise, I don't think as good as the first, but again is a great antagonist. I thought he showed up a little too much in this since the first actually didn't have him appear much, but that's just me. The rest of the actors were just fine. Nothing too great. Onto my biggest issues for the movie. Along with the first, this had an over reliance on CGI throughout. This more than the first. Everything was CGI'd and it just looked so fake where it was funny to look at. The end was just horrible with that. At least with the first they tried using makeup for some things. This was just all CGI. Speaking of it looking funny, I honestly think this is a horror-comedy. Every five minutes there was at least something funny said that made everyone laugh, this happens mostly with Bill Hader and James Ransone. Maybe if they took about half the jokes away I wouldn't think that but honestly this is a pretty funny movie at times. Nothing felt scary to me. There were only three jump scares that got me the second time I watched it. There's a little too many jump scares but I think it somewhat makes up for the horror aspect, though I personally don't like those. There are two things that I wish they would've changed to the plot. One involves Henry Bowers. He returns but honestly his character had no purpose. It did bring tension at times. Also I just didn't like the end. I think it was dumb and just funny to me. Based on how it ends, I'm wondering if the first movie could've just ended the whole thing if they continued using their method just a little longer. In the movie Bill is a writer and they keep bringing up one of his stories with a terrible ending. I personally believe that's kind of foreshadowing the end of the movie. Because I don't like leaving things on a bunch of cons here are some aspects I enjoyed. Benjamin Wallfisch's score is pretty good for a horror movie. I liked the first score and I think this one is just as good. The very very end of the movie I think was a really good way to end it. It's about the characters and it's just a good way to end it all. Also when all of the Losers' Club was together either having fun or just not panicking a whole lot about their situations, those were the strongest scenes. IT Chapter 2 isn't a bad movie in my opinion. It's just a step down from the first. Many people are divided and I understand why. Even though I find flaws throughout I do find myself enjoying the movie.My Grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not bad but... nobody mentions the horroble horrible ending?,"Actually the film is not bad at all. Some typical horror moments, good casting and acting. But the movie is a tat long. Still for most part it does justice to Stephen King's novel. And that's an accomplishment on its own.
I don't mind when movies are changing parts of a book. And sometimes it works better for a movie to adjust the storyline. Same goes with this movie. But what really really bothers me is the ending. Don't worry, no spoilers, but this is the dumbest ending I've seen in a decade. It's so simplistic and unconvincing, it's almost the ending of a child's movie. My wife called it 'Typical Hollywood dumbness' and it's a shame as It deserved better.
Bill Skarsgård actually did a better job as Pennywise than in the first movie and some scenes are certainly gruweling. But it never becomes scarrier, or more visual stunning than any of the other Hollywood horror movies of this century. Making it just an average movie.

IT is a mess :(,"Boy is IT Chapter 2 messy. I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't thrilled with this movie. It's far too long. It's almost 3 hours, and it feels longer. The pacing is brutal in the first half, and by the time you get to the third act, you just feel too exhausted to feel completely invested. Where the first movie worked for me as it's own self contained movie, Chapter 2 is definitely a companion piece that expects you to watch it immediately after the last movie. Which makes sense as they made it clear that Chapter 1 was just taking the kids portion of the book, and then Chapter 2 would be about them grown up. I will say this movie delivered on good casting of the adult counterparts, because everyone genuinely does a good job. Bill Hader is easily the best part of the film, he had some of the funniest gags I've seen this year. However that leads me to my next issue, it's way too comedic. For being a horror film, its not scary. The humor overtakes any tension it wants me to feel when it's dropped right in the middle of a scare. The first one did this too, but I didn't feel it was as obnoxious as this. Especially when most of your scares are pop outs and loud noises. There were scenes I just tuned out because the tone was so all over the place that, I just didn't know what to feel. A guy in our theatre fell asleep and was snoring so loud, we all just laughed because... yeah, it was kinda boring at times! All my problems pretty much trace back to the book and why it's damn near impossible to adapt and make great. It's a mess of a book. While Bill Skarsgard is chilling to watch as Pennywise, and the coming of age story works well in places, it just all doesn't flow well together here as it did last time. I will commend both movies for trying to mainstream the material, and for REALLY trying. Both films have engaging performances, and some really nice cinematography, but I just don't feel as eager to watch Ch 2 as much on repeat viewings. The ending was the equivalent of Lord of the Rings where it takes that much time and investment out of you, to the point where the ending overstays it's welcome. It Ch 2 isn't the worst movie I've seen this year, but it was disappointing. 5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointing and boring,"I have always been a big fan of the 80's mini series of IT. Yes it may seem cheesy and dated nowadays, but there was a great sense of eeriness and realism.The part 1 remake was very good in my eyes! It was updated, fresh and focused a lot on the characters and their relationships. Fabulous! Maybe a tad too much cheap CGI, but not overkill.Part 2, has just seemed to lose it's way. The opening was actually quite good...and dark which is what i was hoping for (i won't mention what happens in case you decide to watch it) But then as the film progressed i felt like i was watching a comedy? a comedy with cheap jump scares and absolutely no character focus or development. I genuinely did not care about any of the adult characters, at all. For some reason Muschietti seems to be more focused on (really bad) CGI jump scares than the authenticity or the development of the characters. At least in Tommy Lee Wallace's original starring Tim Curry, props and costumes were used rather than this cheap, non scary effects. When a film is filled with CGI it loses it's realism and i lose interest. It's like, they couldn't be bothered to make the effort to scare it's audience and a lack of effort really shows in this film.I will usually see a film through to the end but i has to turn this off. I was so bored and after 2 hours of bad effects and boring characters, i didn't want to waste any more of my time.Disappointed and gutted as there was mass potential to be scary.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"It Chapter 2 makes for a good second half, even if its too long","You know why something like the Boogey-Man and Dracula are scary for children and not so much for children? It's about perspective. When your younger, because you don't have that understanding of the world, something like monsters seems plausible and hiding in the dark. The older we get, the more we realize that there's nothing dangerous in the dark except for our imagination. By the time we hit our twenties, it seems that the monsters have disappeared in favor of real life fears like criminals, work, and even of ourselves. The Boogey-Man isn't going to have the same effect on a thirty-year old.In a way, the monster of It, Pennywise the Clown, is a representation of the childhood Boogey-Man; it makes itself into whatever children find scary, it hides in the dark and it only follows children (but it is willing to eat adults). Plus, taking the form of a clown is the best way for it to lure children into it's trap. I think this is why a lot of adults do have genuine fears of clowns. As a follow-up to the It movie of 2017, It: Chapter 2 brings the Losers club back to Derry to face Pennywise again.Instead of the late 1980s, the story moves forward to the present day where a gay man missing (no thanks to Pennywise) and the only Losers Club member Mike (played by Isaiah Mustafa) who remained in Derry, discovers that they didn't kill the clown. So he makes the call to the rest of the losers to come back and finish the job. This consists of writer Bill (Played by James McAvoy), fashion designer Beverly (played by Jessica Chastain), now skinny architect Ben (played by Jay Ryan), risk analyst Eddie (played by James Ransone) and standup comedian Richie (played by Bill Hader. The only holdout is Stanley (played by Andy Bean) who commits suicide after getting the phone call.Everyone meets up in a restaurant where Mike reveals that as the town Liberian, he's done the research to figure out how to kill Pennywise. Part of it involves them collecting items from their past, thus splitting them up to explore Derry once more. As they each go to their old stomping grounds, each has an encounter with Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgård). It's here their confronted with new fears, along with the possibility that Pennywise just may be too powerful.The original It was a fantastic horror movie that I still highly recommend. Does It: Chapter 2 serve as a good companion piece? It does, though it's not as good as the original. A lot of the first movie was the fact that the main characters will children (all of them acted very well) and that we feared for them a lot more. It's not that I don't fear for them as adults, it's just not as interesting. I'll say it still works as all the actors playing the adult counterparts are really good. Of course the knockout is still Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise who remains just as scary.As far as the story goes, it's also good. I've read the book It, and I was okay with it being split into two movies. It does allow the characters to explore their old hometown without it seeming like a rehash. They make it clear from the beginning that the losers forgot about Pennywise and their childhoods (likely a supernatural cause by the clown). It leads into a good encounter with the clown in his true form...that I wished would have been designed better. Without spoiling the look, though it's different, it's heavily reminiscent of the final creature from the miniseries. I think they could have gone further.If the film has any major faults, it's with the running time. At nearly three hours, it definitely feels a lot longer then it needs to be. A lot of scenes will drag on really for no reason then to extend it. Along with that, the pacing can feel off (the first film had this problem too) when trying to combine the comedy and the humor. It's not bad, but it can also feel repetitive in spots where they encounter monsters they've seen before.I'll give this seven Georgie boats out of ten. Despite its long running time, I was still satisfied with the end result and how this connects with the first movie. I'll be curious if they make a super edit of both movies together. It goes without saying that you need to watch the original before watching this. Otherwise, it's safe to float to the theaters.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great climax to modern horror,"Where to start. The problem I find with many horror films these days is that they either lack character depth, the story line and plot isn't that gripping or the special effects are lacking. However I feel that 'It: Chapter 2' does not have those problems. Firstly it fills in many blanks left from the first film through the second chapter. It also has a more adult feel to it but still hold on to the child like horror and scares from the first film. Many modern day horrors leave the feeling of 'well it was ok but it was wasn't scary enough or was not realistic enough' however I believe this film quashes all those perceptions of other horror films. In my opinion it is what avengers: endgame was to super hero movies, the best in its genre",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Death By CGI...,"In Director Andy Muschietti's IT CHAPTER TWO, it's 27 years after the events of the first film, and the kids have all grown up and moved on with their individual lives. Unfortunately, we know that a certain creepy circus performer has returned, causing a sudden population drop in Derry, Maine.First, the positive aspects of the movie:#1- The adult ""Losers Club"" members are fairly well-aligned with their younger incarnations.#2- Pennywise, still played by Bill Skarsgard, remains scary and menacing. The Fun House scene is particularly effective.#3- The first part of the film gathers the characters together in a mysterious, ominous way.Now, for the more negative aspects:#1- After a big buildup, the LC spends a lot of time apart, rather than reconnecting with each other. One of the first movie's strengths was the relationship between the kids as a group. This is almost abolished in part two.#2- Although Pennywise is spooky, there's just too much CGI to make things believable. While the first part had its share, it just didn't seem as noticeable. Perhaps because its cartoonish nature fit in better with kids. As adults, a computer-generated, naked granny, and a lumbering Paul Bunyan statue just don't feel that frightening.#3- The humor takes away from the horror. Like other modern horror films, everyone's always joking during times when they should simply be having a cardiac arrest due to terror. While this happened in part one, it corresponded a little better with the expected behavior of young teens.Overall, another sequel that misses the magic of its predecessor...",,Anonymous,Horror

Andy Muschietti's direction is great and the music by Benjamin Wallfisch is fantastic. However, what brings it down and makes it slightly disappointing is that it isn't that scary.

IT was a worthy sequel,"The Horror in this movie is untraditional so that, for one, is going to turn a lot of people off. I didn't read the book so I can't compare, but I can tell it came off of the book's page because of how the events were transpiring in the movie.
For a NEARLY 3 hour movie, I never felt bored, pacing never dragged, though in the final act things did kick into high gear, but we didn't lose any info while it was happening. As for all the effects I genuinely jumped more than a few times (Dolby Cinema), though I found Pennywise more horrific in the first one.
The only main thing I can complain about is letting the characters have their own adult lives, we saw them AS adults but they revert back to their childlike mentalities. I just wish we learned more about THEIR lives, so they could've added character, the movie mostly drew off of flashbacks.
Other than that, dialogue, acting, were above average, script is the only thing that was ok. But of course the cast elevated it.Really an 8/10 but I'm evening out the rating.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Also the film tends to borrow from other films like The Thing.The movie is really long and you will feel it. The ending, like the original, sucks I'm convinced nobody knows how to end this thing.

Complete Failure,"First of all, I've read the novel and liked it a lot- not one of my favorites (not even my favorite King novel) but I really enjoyed it. So when the first It (chapter 1, i guess) came out I was fairly pleased at how it was structured and executed. While I thought it could have been much better, and it relied a little heavily on the jump scares and had some cheesy effects, I liked this version of Pennywise and felt that, above all, the TONE was right. Well after seeing part 2 my low expectations have been confirmed and surpassed.My guess is that Cary Joji Fukanaga's involvement was crucial to the success of the first film. Much like with True Detective's decline between seasons 1+2, Fukanaga proved to be the one who really gave the show it's brilliance. Here, with It Chapter 2, Fukanaga is gone and this loser Gary Dauberman (eye roll) has taken on the writing duties alone- as in no supervision! He sucks, just look at his credits. Muchietti is terrible too obviously, because how could he misfire this bad with such a big project! All he had to do was stick to the blueprint laid out by the first film. Instead, Dauberman and Muchietti make this a bad comedy based on some idiot adults we don't know or care about. Nothing against Hader and Ransome, but they were used horribly in this.

Disappointed on the whole.,"To save hassle I'll jump right in:
Negatives: it's too long, I felt there was certain scenes which served no relevance and were there purely the lengthen the film. Could easily shave 30 mins off it.
The plot was flimsy, we got no explanation into Pennywise, why he did what he did and so on. Certain scenes also happened then were never linked back to. Bill and Bev kiss midway (no spoiler) and it's never once mentioned or anything. What was the point in that whole scene. This happened multiple times.
The likability and relatability of these characters wasn't the same as the first film with the kids. Ultimately wasn't that arsed if any of them died. And if it wasn't for Eddie and Richie this would have been very very stale.Positives: Eddie and Richie. Brilliant acting from both, especially Bill Hader. I quite enjoyed the small injection of comedy into this film, worked quite well.
The jump scares aren't too constant, something some horror films love to do.
Several emotions are done well. Funny, Scary, Intense, sadness and so on.Ultimately, the plot let's it down. I could get on board with the length of the film it it all served some sort of relevance, but it didn't. I noticed a few in the cinema got a bit bored midway.
The first film is much better, but it's not all bad don't get me wrong. If you've seen the first you may as well watch this. Just don't have huge expectations.

"A solid horror film, but also a mild disappointment after the first chapter.","I suppose it would be giving It Chapter Two too much credit to say that the magic sort of fading in this instalment reflects how adult life is less emotional/meaningful/magical than childhood.Because yes, the endearing and thoroughly likeable kids from the first movie have grown up, and they're still likeable, but for whatever reason it just isn't quite the same. Pennywise doesn't really up his standards, and he more or less goes through the same motions he did in the first one, and now that he's targeting adults, he's just not as menacing as he was when he was terrorising the same people as kids.Granted, I didn't find the first one hugely scary, and found it more satisfying as a Stand By Me-style coming of age film, but it was a bit more creepy the first time around because it was fresher and more surprising.
And with the cast being adults now (apart from some flashbacks), the nostalgia and whimsy and much of the emotion from the first has vanished (again- potentially a metaphor for the fact that growing up kinda sucks).So after all those complaints... why still give it a positive score?
Well, the acting was all around quite good, the scary sequences were still fun (though really not frightening), it was really funny in parts, there were a couple of neat cameos, and despite being almost three hours, it moved along pretty nicely, and apart from some points in a somewhat repetitive second act, didn't really feel its length.If you liked the first you'll like this one too, just probably not quite as much.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Watch the MiniSeries,"Simply put it's too long, and even then does not have enough time to do justice to the story. Long horror films can, and do work - The Shining being a great example, with plenty of time devoted to character and creating an unsettling atmosphere. Here though with so many characters, and so much backstory, everything gets abbreviated down into a short flashback, followed by a series of jumpscares. Now this might just work for a regular 90 minutes, but for something almost twice that length it just becomes tediously repetitive. Then with the film concentrating on the scares there is even less time for the very capable cast to do something with the flimsy material. In a good horror there should be a quite tension, broken only by the gasp or well placed chuckle, to break the tendiont. Today there was more an air of boredom.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""A fitting dark horror sequel with a heavy dose of powerful visuals!""","The year 2017's horror flick ""It"", which was a box office hit, had rewritten and upstaged the genre of horror films. For me, the film also managed to create an emotional bond with it mainly due to the smart & innocent child protagonists and the interesting way in which they defeat Pennywise, the evil clown.The story of the film begins with Pennywise striking back into the town of Derry, 27 years after the events of the first film. The group of kids, now adults who live in different cities regroup and get set to kill the clown. Will they be able to successfully kill him? The answer is shown rather impressively in the movie.This film has a more psychological touch to it with several sinister and spine-chilling scenes when compared to the more lucid screenplay in the earlier film. During the course of the film, at times we are shown the flashbacks of the protagonists wherein they encounter some of their disturbing childhood memories escaping from Pennywise.The screenplay is quite engaging but the movie feels a bit longer at the ending. During some instances you might feel bored, more when each of the protagonists try their own approach to kill the clown. The film also has some comedy dialogues which somewhat brings down the horror factor.The director has ensured quite well in ensuring that each of the adult cast members have similarity to their younger counterparts. Especially the casting of James Ransone as Eddie is spot on! The dark cinematography and visual effects are really powerful and effective in bringing out some stimulating moments. The background music is exceptional and gives you absolute chills & thrills!Overall, this film is a fitting sequel to the 2017 blockbuster and is a must watch if you are a connoisseur of psychological horror flicks!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A good followup to the first one,"First of all, the adult cast was outstanding playing the older versions of the kids. Yes, some of them may not look like them physically but they still knocked their parts out of the water. For me there wasn't a weak actor in this film but the two that stood out the most out to me was Bill Hader, who plays adult Richie, and James Ransone, who plays adult Eddie, because these two characters already were standouts in the first movie and they helped cement that status with what they did with their characters in this film. Bill Skarsgard once again was great as Pennywise and still doesn't help with mine or anybody's fear of clowns. Now, this film is two-hours and forty-nine-minutes long with credits and two-hours and forty-five-minutes without credits and I'm going, to be honest with you at certain points you start to feel that time. There were some scenes that went on far too long that I think they could have cut down and also certain scenes that could have just been left out entirely. Apparently, this film was originally four-hours long and you can kind of see where they had to cut certain things out. But I will say that there are points in this film where you feel like a fly on the wall in this film and the time just flies by. I think that in this film they used more CGI compared to the first one and honestly it doesn't look that great. This isn't a spoiler cause the kid actors have said this in interviews but they had to de-age the kids in this film so they matched what they looked like during the first film and you don't really notice it. Although I will say that in one scene a character doesn't sound the same and it's pretty obvious. But for the rest of the CGI, it just wasn't the greatest. In the end, this film is a good follow-up to the first film with stellar performances and a great story.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Way, Way, Way Too Long","I enjoyed chapter 1 - didn't find it scary, but it was a fun, entertaining blast. Chapter 2 is, let's be clear, far too long. At two hours fifty minutes, it could easily lose an hour's running time with little difficulty - a generic 'getting the gang back together' riff being one of the chief offenders. It drags so much, that by the time the final hour or so rolls around, I was just tired. It's a pretty diverting final hour, but it too is needlessly extended. With the talent around this movie, there's an interesting and potentially frightening take on childhood trauma and memory buried somewhere; but that movie is buried beneath the acres pointlessness.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't even watch it,"This movie didn't need to be 3 hours long, my god jeez. I have better things to do and in the movie theater I had to pee to pee the whole time. It didn't help that this movie is garbage. I am genuinely confused on what the this movie's narrative was. It tried to be scary but the ""comedy"" made it look cheesy. Even the story line was uninteresting. Pennywise is objectively not scary, i'm so sorry. This movie is a cash grab, I don't even know why I saw the first one or this one. STOP MAKING THEM. I will tell this to the author's & director's face, this story is awful. My boyfriend liked it but he doesn't have much taste now does he.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT continues... to an end.,"This movie picks up right where Chapter One ended. Knowing some important plot points in the book, I'm satisfied to see some of the scenes in the movie. There are some changes made for this adaptation but nothing too far fetched. I'll admit, it can be a little boring but I'm just here to watch these characters fulfill their journey as they explore the presence of Pennywise and how to defeat IT.Yes, while Chapter One has all the scares, expect this film for the lore. It does have its humor and intense sequences just like the first film but it doesn't rely too much of the scares. Also, all the adult Losers are really good with their performances. I'm also glad to see the kid Losers play their part as well, as you'll also see some of the encounters with Pennywise you haven't seen before.One nitpick I have is how goofy Pennywise can look when he's trying to scare the audience. I think he's a little more intimidating in the kid part from Chapter One but not much for this one.Overall, I do enjoy this film. I went to the early premiere at my local theater at 5:00 pm and had a great night with my mom. If you enjoyed the first movie and are invested with the Losers, then don't hesitate to watch this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a mess...,"I don't know where to begin. It: Chapter 2 is just a blur of non-sensical stuff happening all over. I didn't feel for any of the characters and there are so many jump scares it's just boring. The mixing with past and present is also bad, confusing and makes no sense.The acting are mixed, with James McAvoy being the worst of the bunch with terrible non-believable studer. Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan and James Ransone does solid performance (as well as ALL the child actors from the flashbacks) but this doesn't save the movie. Bill Hader is a funny guy and good actor but has no chance with the many terrible and out of place lines he's being dealt.The top side is that it's obviously high budget and well shot, but that's about it. The 1st chapter is by far the best, and if I want to watch a better IT-movie I'll watch the 1990 version any day of the week.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Both Awesome and Underwhelming At The Same Time,"This was without a doubt one of the years most anticipated horror movies for most people, including myself, a life-long lover of Stephen King and definitely a fan of the 2017's ""It"". While I did enjoy this, I'm not gonna lie, ""It: Chapter 2"" wasn't the movie I wanted it to be.I want to emphasize the hits of this movie before the misses, because they're quite strong. The first, a very sure hit, is the acting, pretty much all of the performances are mildly perfect - it was amazing to watch such a stellar cast working together (and also alone & apart, for at least half of the screen time...). Hader, McAvoy, Ransone, and, of course, Skarsgard are the absolute highlights. While the acting is top-notch, the character treatment is questionable. Specifically the treatment of Pennywise - there was less of him here than in the 1st part, and it also felt like he's much more ...unimportant. I think there was unused potential to give Bill more screen time to shine. Give him more substance. The next hit of ""It: Chapter 2"" is cinematography and FX. Sure, a lot of people (way too many actually) complain about the extensive use of cgi, but, in my humble opinion, it's the highest tier stuff, masterfully made and blended in with some practical FX and a truly crafty, imaginative cinematography. Another popular complaint is the pacing, here I beg to differ. It was not the pacing that bugged me, I felt like it went by at an even speed and there are quite a lot of shorter movies that have felt longer than this. What bugged me is what I consider this movies biggest miss - the script, the story. For me it seemed like the filmmakers aspired to put more in this than would actually work. ""It: Chapter 2"" made me confident in that the best way to adapt this novel is tv-series - 20 episodes, easily. The result of this script was a disjointed, choppy movie with a lot of scenes that felt unfinished and scenes that felt unnecessary or just plain confused. The most underwhelming moment (arguably) is the ending, or the climax. I don't usually give any spoilers, so I can only say that it was actually kinda lame. It's ironic that Stephen King often gets criticised for his endings & so does Bill's character (who's a writer) - Indeed the endings of both ""It"" and ""It: Chapter 2"" could be their weakest spots. Oh, and a nice bonus was a lengthy (for cameo standards) Stephen Kings cameo, the first cameo in a movie based on his writings since 1996's ""Thinner"".Thankfully, I liked the movie a lot more than I didn't, if that makes sense. The ingredients were there, the promise, the potential, the hype, but something didn't quite click and the result was an awesome romp of ups and downs, but awesome is what matters. I'd like to think that there was a true effort and love put into making this. My rating: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Beep Beep chapter 2!,"No movie will ever recreate what a book does. No movie will ever include everything that is in the book. What it will do is make changes and only add what they deem is important.As much as my childhood nostalgia makes me like the 1990 version of IT, I can still admit it wasn't that good, it was too watered down. But Pennywise was great. I still find him creepy. IT chapter 1 came around and is better. At least in terms of the story it told. More from the book was included and that is always welcome. Even the changes were good and the comedic lines and personalities of the Losers gave it its own flavor. Skarsgard made Pennywise his own and did a great job. Overuse of CGI is what ruined the horror/creepy factor in certain scenes of Chapter 1 and there was certainly no exception for chapter 2.Chapter 2 had great buildups that fell flat because of CGI. They tried to recreate what they did in Chapter 1 with the characters as kids, especially Eddie. It felt forced and a little too much comedy for a horror film. Many people dislike the length of the film and think they spent too much time on getting the viewer reacquainted with each character. I disagree, being a fan of the book, I was engulfed with their stories.Overall IT Chapter 2 is alright and it's a movie I will see again in the future eventually. Pennywise makes more appearances which is good but it is not better than Chapter 1. You can thank the extra comedy and overuse of CGI for that.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It Continues,"It Chapter Two, the follow up to It, picks up where the original left off. The kids have all grown up and the demon clown is back to terrorize them. Or has it?Chapter Two suffers from a bit of an identity problem. It's one part Poltergeist, legitimately tense and mind bending horror, and one part... Ghostbusters. Maybe it was just the theater I was in, but there were a surprising number of laughs in this movie. It also can't decide if it should focus on the adults or on the flashbacks with the kids.The flashbacks also directly lead into the films other main issue. The pacing is all off. The beginning and end or spot on but the middle definitely drags and I started to feel the 169 minute runtime of the movie.It's not all bad though. The performances are spot on, everyone fits their roles with no real outliers. That said, there are a couple that go above and beyond. James McAvoy and Bill Skarsgard are exceptional but everyone ends up being upstaged by Bill Hader who absolutely runs away with this one.Performances aside, the visuals are stunning. Penny wise is all about weird and twisted displays, so the visual effects have to be exceptional or the whole thing would fall apart and fortunately they deliver in every scene.In the end, it's a good, fun movie. It's far from flawless but it's got plenty of honest fun and strong emotions with legitimate tension to satisfy. Absolutely worth being seen on the big screen and will warrant future views as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Moving (If Overlong) Sequel,"Every 27 years, the town of Derry is cursed by an evil clown who terrorizes anyone he can get his claws on. 27 years prior, a group of kids called The Loser's Club thought they defeated him, but he's back again and they must all gather back at their hometown to destroy him once and for all.Like any reunion film, there's a pang of bittersweet sadness in the air. The filmmakers of It: Chapter Two use this to create a very moving story of friendship and the bonds we make as children. Unfortunately, in between scenes of genuine emotion and character interaction, there are horrible instances of CGI horror that inspire more laughs than screams. Decapitated heads turn into spiders (a la The Thing, but more laughable) and old women turn into giant Looney Toon characters with pendulous drooping breasts while we're supposed to pretend this is in any way frightening when, more often than not, it looks like something out of a lousy 90's computer game.Thankfully, It: Chapter Two is loaded with strong performances from an excellent cast who are given the nearly impossible task of selling a lot of the cheesy effects from their reactions alone. In that sense, the film is a rousing success as the actors manage to ground the insanity around them into something tangible and real. It's to their credit that the film wrings any iota of emotion out of the story. SNL's Bill Hader might be the MVP here as the wise-cracking Ritchie who's holding onto a big secret. He's appropriately amusing when needed and heartbreaking when you least expect it. Also excellent is James Ransone as the grown up Eddie who captures some of the nervous and manic qualities of his younger counterpart to an uncanny level.It: Chapter Two won't be the scariest film you've ever seen (or even the scariest film of the year for that matter), but the strong performances and solid emotional core will tug at your heartstrings a little more than you might initially expect.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"What should've been an excellent follow up to a tremendous first installment, devolves into a dragging mess of tones and miserable cgi with few redeeming factors.","6.4/10 I absolutely adored the first film adaptation in 2017 and I'll be honest in saying the original tv movie adaptation was average at best imo. I was extremely excited for this chapter 2 film since the first came out with high hopes especially when the cast was revealed for the adult losers club. Now that I finally saw this new addition, i have to say I thought this was pretty ridiculous and an utter let down. While it has its decent moments revolving around some charming characters of the adult losers club, and a few interesting Pennywise scares, i found this to be bizarrely scattered, and at times dull. Story wise it's straightforward and very cliche with unbelievably stupid jump scares sprinkled into every 10 min with seriously some of the most laughable cgi you can imagine. Some of the concepts they thought up had to be attempts at comedy. There were some comedic elements in the first film but not during the scares as much. The tone is constantly clashing between extravagant scares and dumb jokes to where it is not coherent as a film. The cast saves this film and gives you a reason to care especially Bill Hader and James McAvoy. I felt Bill Skarsgard was underutilized massively in this and replaced with these mostly terrible cgi jumpscares. While the conclusion does have the same emotional connection as the first and the same high stakes, i couldn't help but feel like it was a missed opportunity overall. Maybe if we finally get that supercut there will be added scenes to rectify some of chapter 2's disappointment. Until then I'll stick with the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Visually pleasing and super stylish, but also bloated and narratively dull.","Horror is not a genre I typically enjoy. I love a good horror film as much as the next person, but I find them to be very few and far between; the overall standard within the genre pretty low thanks to countless lazy efforts looking for cheap thrills and easy scares. The 2017 cinematic remake of the first half of the 1990 TV miniseries on the other hand, was a stylish, confident and tension building creep-fest, director Andy Muschietti crafting a string of striking and eerie set-pieces that found the perfect balance between frights and levity. Part two largely swaps the kids from the first instalment for their adult versions, bringing them back to the disturbing town of Derry 27 years after they thought the defeated the menacing Pennywise the Clown. Although the flair is still there, Muschietti can't create anything as memorable as last time out; the spine-tingling sequences this time more predictable and, thanks to an unnecessary extra 30 minutes of runtime, spread way to thin. Pennywise is a fascinating creature of nightmares - Bill Skarsgård's rubbery face, sad-creepy inflection, faded orange quiff and an almost imperceptible drool a superb combination to ensure his place in the pantheon of iconic horror monsters (right alongside Tim Curry's bubblier and bigger-eyed 1990 version). Muschietti secured an impressive cast too: James McAvoy as the leader of the pack, Jessica Chastain as the emotionally damaged heroine and Bill Hader and James Ransone as a quibbling pair of best buds who are always good for a laugh. Yet there's a spark missing from the adult group compared to their teenager selves; that recognisable chemistry of adolescents with their lives ahead of them a big part of why the first outing was so entertaining, whereas the beaten-down 40-something versions are less fun to hang out with. A sequel that gets bogged down in narrative filler and hokey backstory, It Chapter 2 still delivers just enough visually exciting sequences and nerve-jangling frights to cap off this two-parter nicely.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't get me wrong as an horror genre fan this is not scary at all, but it certainly is a much more entertaining watch than the first helping.
It reminded me of a darker version of The goonies and that is by no means a bad thing. The humour was good as this was much needed at the long running time.
As in the original IT films I think at nearly three hours long it was far to long in length.

It's Just Bound to Go Pop,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A well crafted supernatural thriller that pales to its original source, but still is a fine sequel to its predecessor.JIM'S REVIEW: Does It: Chapter Two have the ""It Factor"", that indescribable ""je ne sais quoi"" allure that its predecessor was able to capture so vividly with moviegoers two years ago? Yes and no.This supernatural horror sequel is again resurrected by director Andy Muschietti and many of his same crew of artisans in hopes to recreate that same bad magic. For the majority of the film, It succeeds in capturing the scary action and establishing a link with the now grown-up cast of characters so convincingly that the audience immediately relates to them and their deadly peril. While It: Chapter Two, more than not, generate the fear factor, this chapter slowly build its scenes of suspense and spends far too much screen time on exposition and subplots that do little to advance the storytelling. The film seems bloated with uneven CGI effects this time around and its formulaic set pieces almost outstays its welcome due to the movie's avid fixation with the gore factor. Less would have been more.The second chapter of the Loser's Club opens twenty seven years later with a particularly grisly and gratitious hate crime that signals the return of the infamous Pennywise the Dancing Clown. This prologue lingers in one's mind with a bad aftertaste of remorse even though it serves as the catalyst for the new cast of actors to reassemble back at Derry, Maine to fight evil forces. But unlike the first film, this and other moments have a mean-spirited glee that the first film avoided. The extreme violence of this killing hangs over the movie like a shroud of discontentment before the new cast of actors is reassembled and moviegoers can settle in for the fright-fest. Fortunately, the cast and Stephen Kings's essential story overcome this initial dread.Mr. Muschietti skillfully directs his film and turns up the horrifying action. He stages his set pieces with flair and expertly casts his movie with older actors that inhabit their parts with masterful interpretations of their former younger selves. Each actor has an episode that shows off their character's phobia as they battle with their own demons. This more mature ensemble includes: James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, Isaiah Mustafa, Andy Bean, James Ransome and Bill Hader. All are fine, with Mr. Hader and Ms. Chastain excelling in their roles.But without Bill Skarsgård as their evil nemesis, the film simply would not be as effective. HIs vocal delivery, physical movements, and iconic make-up as Pennywise ratchets up the tension and delivers the scares. Providing ample support (in flashbacks) are the original young actors from the first film and their presence is crucial to the film's success.Gary Dauberman's screenplay is very faithful to Stephen King's novel to a fault. (However, some judicious editing of numerous sub-plots could have improved and streamlined the movie much further.) The adaptation creates recognizable set-ups that have a sense of familiarity (the overuse of well-worn horror film staples that are all too obvious like a spooky fun-house with its hall of mirrors, a creepy mansion, the dark wet sewers, etc.). But partaking of these troves is half of the fun and Mr. Dauberman's penchant to fully develop his characters and their unique quirks heightens the frightening action on display. Too bad, he didn't eliminate the unnecessary multiple storylines that complicate matters or connect some secondary characters more astutely.Yet when plot and characters are rendered with a focus on childhood traumas and the dramatic life-or-death scenario is in place as they are in this imaginative installment, the effect is all the more impressive and relevant, even if the material itself has now become a standard horror package of stock characters caught in stereotypical surroundings. (Special mention to cinematographer Checco Varese and editor Jason Ballentine for their contributions for creating the unease. Benjamin Wallfisch's music score builds the foreboding atmosphere very well.)It: Chapter Two brings a memorable end to Stephen King's tome. While this final chapter is not as scary as its first part, Mr. Muschietti and his able cast provide an apt conclusion to this classic opus of terror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Better than the 1990 version, not quite as good as the 2017 one","'It: Chapter Two' is the sequel to 'It' from only two years ago, but this is now the prophesized ""27 years later"", with Pennywise (Skarsgard) back to wreak havoc on Derry. The seven teens from 'It' come home as adults to fulfill their oath of stopping Pennywise. This time, they're: Bev (Chastain), Bill (McAvoy), Richie (Hader), Ben (Ryan), Mike (Mustafa), Eddie (Ransone) & Stanley (Bean). Don't worry - there's plenty of flashbacks so you can recall who's who.Thankfully, there's some humour, thanks to Hader and Ransone, but the others seem to kind of coast through - no one's bad in this, but no one stands out either. Unfortunately, for a film based around his psycho-killer-clown, Pennywise has very little screen time until the final 30min and you kind of forget what his motivation is. Being released so close to the first one, not sure we need so many prompts/reminders. That's the main problem with the film - it's almost an hour too long at 2 hours 50 minutes.The second act where they have to each get a totem could've been done in a 10min montage, not a 45min drawn-out mini-mission for each character. There's a few good CGI bits, some jumps, some gross moments, but nothing truly terrifying. Still, wouldn't want to be watching this is I was under 12. Considering how tongue-in-cheek the film is with it's references to Stephen King and crappy endings, I'm not sure if the ridiculous ending is supposed to be meta, or is just poor.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"My God, the director loves strobe lights","The first one is better, but this beats the OG 90s version.The good: Great acting, some real good scares, and an overall terrifying vibe. The casting could not be more spot on. There were parts that I found myself looking away for and parts my jaw dropped out of fear and horror. I can't wait to rewatch the original and compare them.The bad: it is 3 hours, and it feels like it. The pacing sometimes feels off and the plot got a bit muddied because of it. There's also so much strobe effect, my head started to hurt which brought me out of the film.It had some tone issues. Its a bad sign when you're in a full theater and 1 out of 5 jokes get a chuckle when the rest are met with silence. There were also too many unnecessary jump scares and unnecessary gore, which compared to chapter 1, made the horror fall flat.After the success of chapter 1, it was hard for chapter 2 to not let some people down. I would love to watch the 90s one, then chapters 1 and 2, and compare them both to the book. I have the feeling out of them all, I'll still feel that chapter 2 is the weekest.Either way, the series is strong and will forever be a classic and loved by many, including me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Watch the original,"I really wanted to like this but.... I didn't! The original may be a bit dated but it's still vastly better to my mind.

It's not Terrible or amazing. It's just okay,"It Chapter two wasn't great and wasn't terrible either. It felt long and the plot moves very slow. Some scenes were awkward and their were some great moments. My favorite was the cast, Pennywise, and a special guest star appearance Stephen King himself.Pennywise creates chaos as he eats and murders adults and children. I do however find the narrative story feeling messy and all over the place. Their is too much they are trying to focus on. You feel like you don't care about some of the characters. The ritual was a huge waste of time. Pennywise final form feels like a joke. The battle was sort of weak and messy. The losers gang felt like they are the new Marvel Avengers.The movie is great to watch once. After awhile you might forget about it as the years go by. It Chapter one was a better movie. You have felt the scares and emotions from Pennywise and Losers gang, but the second one you might lose interest too. I almost felt asleep during this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Small changes to the storyline are acceptable, you'll see. It's not really a 10 movie, probably 7-8, but I'm going 10 to offset the haters.

B Movie With A Actors,"Not good. Too many cheap jump scares. Bad CGI. Poor acting and worse directing. All around disappointing follow up to the first It, which was great.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not perfect but still great in many ways, except writing","Right off the bat I'll say that some of the comic relief was off-place and terrible. Very few jokes landed. Most of the movie was dead air, reminiscing and ""preparing"" but really - nothing happened. This movie should've been an hour shorter. The script featured a whole lot of mess that we could've gone without. And the ending was cheesy and preachy. Also, was it really appropriate to have a guy dramatically cry for his just-died friend yet another guy and a girl decide to make out 2 seconds later just because 3 hours wasn't enough for you to space things out a bit? That was a baffling choice. If my friend just died dramatically and another friend was crumbling in tears the last thing on my mind would be making out in front of him with some chick who can't decide who she likes.BUT - all that doesn't mean the music, the occasionally hilarious yet still good CGI, the acting, the emotional moments weren't great, because they were. I appreciated all of this a lot. Bill Hader made me shed a tear! He was that good. Bill Something - the man who plays the clown - obviously way too young for this role when he's playing against people in their 40s and 50s. Even with an old man wig he was still too youthful. Not to say he didn't do a fantastic Pennywise again - he did. Just... his youthful face was less of an issue when he was scaring younger kids. Now he's scaring people over twice his age and even with the makeup you can tell he's much younger.It's so flawed yet so strong in many ways. Confused in it's writing - much like this review. But they both made their points. Definitely still a really fantastic movie, even with it's problems it's far beyond what else is there to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I LOVE IT... IT!,"I rarely make a review! But by the reactions of some critics, I felt I should do!First of all, the direction of the film is masterfully done, because it is not easy to convey all the drama of trauma caused to the boys for them as adults. Second, creating the image of who the IT creature is and how it maintains its existence is even harder, and the director did both exceptionally well!The performance of the children and adults are flawless. All of the second act was very well elaborated by being faithful to the book with the flashbacks! The effects are great and effective and I thought they were necessary to build the most complex scenes. Pennywise is amazing and much more scary and violent. It has some very heavy scenes, some good scares and many chair-holding scenes.The film is also very funny and with this, relieves a little weight leaving the film more balanced. I understand that some complain about the time but for me, I did not see the time pass. The end manages to raise a lot of emotions and then the perfect climax.I am sure that Stephen King is very proud to see one of his best works honored this way! I thought it was as good as the first, and putting together both movies we got a masterpiece of horror!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
too long but still worth seeing,"So close after part one already a next step into the story. But people said it's better then part one but clocking in at 3 hours I was wondering if it could deliver.It (no pun intended) did here and there. Some scenes were too long, especially when we have throwbacks to explain stuff. That's okay if yoy haven't seen the first one but not needed if you have seen it. Some humor thrown in here and there surely adds towards the rating of It chapter Two.But still, it's a horror. And it's in that region that it's better than the first one. Full of jump moments and some really well done effects. Even so good that you started to forget Pennywise himself. But when he comes in he surely brings in the horror. The end is a bit the same of sigh the forst one, same house, same things to destroy him.Is it all that good, not all. Nope, what the hell with the killing of the child in the beginning.

Pervasive filthy language is a put-off but otherwise an interesting sequel.,"I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. It is disheartening that script writers choose to add so much filthy language, not just occasionally but all the way through the movie. It is at best a distraction, at worst ruins the viewing experience for many people. It is unnecessary and just represents lazy writing.I watched the first movie, ""It"", almost two years ago. It was set in 1989 and the kids were generally around 13 during filming. They used the same kids for this movie, filmed two years later, so they were generally around 15-ish.In this story it is 27 years later, 2016, and Pennywise has made his appearance again. The kids are all grown up now, all 40-ish, and scattered around the country, mostly not keeping in touch. Until Mike, who still lives in Derry (fictional Maine town), contacts them and tells each they must return. They had made a pact back in 1989, if Pennywise indeed did show up again the only way to eradicate him would be the participation of all of them.I actually enjoyed the dual time period and the dual sets of actors. At appropriate times the story switches to 1989, at other times to 2016 and is done in an interesting way. Rather than dwell on the horror that the movie includes, and there is lots of it, I mostly focused on the relationships between the old pals and at times the townspeople, comparing what was going on among them in 1989 vs 2016. Even Stephen King himself has a role, as a shopkeeper of old items, one of the grown boys finds his old bike there and buys it.Yes it is long at almost 3 hours, but except for the pervasive and unnecessary filthy language, I enjoyed the movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Small gripes aside, there's enough to love about It: Chapter Two to satisfy anyone's inner cynic.","N an earlier post, I wrote about how only two films that were released in theaters during the summer pleased me. They're Toy Story 4 and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Well, Avengers: Endgame played in theaters during the summer too, but I don't consider it to be a very good film. There were also several other summer movies that I kind of like. So, when it comes to new Hollywood films, it wasn't a good summer or a bad summer. It was an average summer. I mean, one can't expect an excellent new film to be released every week. Who would have the time to go to a theater every week? This isn't realistic. Well, anyway, after the summer movie season came to an end, Hollywood quickly released several enjoyable films that make the summer movie season pale in comparison to this autumn movie season. I haven't seen every film that has been released in the autumn yet, but I can say that Terminator: Dark Fate, Zombieland: Double Tap, Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil, and Abominable are worth seeing. Most are so good that they can be seen more than once. I'd also like to see 21 Bridges, Charlie's Angels, Frozen 2, and Jojo Rabbit. Joker is a film that I think isn't worth seeing more than once. It's not a bad film. For a modern film, it's good, but the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired. I mean, it's no Apocalypse Now (1979). That's for sure. There are a few moments of brilliance in Joker, but, for the most part, it's a rather dull film, and I'm not judging it based on its message or content. The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is good, but not extraordinary. The cinematography doesn't look very good. Most of the scenes in the film aren't interesting. And the direction, though certainly better than average for modern times, isn't very good either. What did surprise me is how much I enjoyed seeing It Chapter Two and Doctor Sleep. I don't think that these films are very good, but they're better than I expected them to be. In It Chapter Two, the director, Andy Muschietti, showed more of his artistic side, as he did in his fine horror film Mama (2013). It Chapter Two is more atmospheric, better shot, and features better acting than It (2017). And it doesn't rely as much on silly jump scares. All of this added together made it a more enjoyable film for an adult like me. But the film still suffers from the fact that, like It, it was made to appeal to as large an audience of modern moviegoers as possible. Doctor Sleep is another well shot and atmospheric film that was directed by Mike Flanagan, who directed the fine horror film Oculus (2013). As a film, Doctor Sleep is kind of enjoyable. The novel by Stephen King is, in my opinion, bloated and rather dull. Still, the film isn't much better because there's nothing about it that stands out. The acting is fine, but not great. The story is fine, but not very interesting. The cinematography is good, but not in any way truly appealing. The music isn't memorable. Some of the scenes are good, but most of the scenes are just passable. By the way, one of the horror films that I really enjoyed seeing lately is Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh (1995). It's better than I expected it to be. The first film, Candyman (1992), is, in my opinion, fantastic when it comes to its artistry. It's easily one of the best horror films of the 1990s. When I was thinking about it, I thought that it must be the best of the 1990s, but then I remembered that Scream (1996) was released in the 1990s too. Scream is overall a slightly better film than Candyman. With Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh, the filmmakers at least attempted to make a good film, and in some ways they succeeded. It's obviously inferior to Candyman, but the acting, the cinematography, and the direction still make it worth seeing. And, finally, I'm almost done with my Marvel Cinematic Universe marathon, which I began in May of this year, when I watched Iron Man (2008) again. From then on, I've been watching every MCU film in order, and I'm still not quite finished. Of course, it hasn't been an obsession with me because I haven't been watching the films one after the other all in one sitting. I've seen many other films in this time period too. In this way, I've now seen every MCU film at least twice, and I don't consider this to be a bad thing because MCU films are good. There still hasn't been a single bad MCU film. Quite impressive. The years 2018 and 2019 are particularly memorable in the history of the MCU because Marvel released four fantastic films one after the other. They're Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man And The Wasp, and Captain Marvel. When I watched these films again on home video I noticed how well made they are. The acting is good. The stories are interesting. The music is fitting. The entertainment factor is high. The special effects are excellent. Need I say more? I can say that by the time Phase Three began in the MCU, Marvel truly found its groove.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Does it float or sink?,"Since the 70s, there's been great Stephen King adaptations (Shawshank, Green Mile, The Shining, Misery and Carrie), there's quite a few mediocre (Cujo, Children of the Corn, Pet Cemetery) and quite a few that are just rubbish (The risible Maximum Overdrive, Dreamcatcher, Dark Tower etc).
King's not to blame for the variable quality of course, not every director is Stanley Kubrick.So where does It: Part 2 rank?I enjoyed the first film for what it was, despite some silly moments and excessive jump scares. I appreciated director Andy Muschietti's style for the film and looked forward to seeing where the second film would go.
Unfortunately this anticipated follow up is quite frankly, more of the same.
Despite strong performances from all the cast (In particular Bill Hader) and some well executed set pieces, the genuinely creepy moments are dwarfed by CGI jump scares, but I have to admit, I jumped back in my chair several times. Cheap or not, those damn boo moments work.However I still miss the era of films like The Shining, where slow tension and atmospheric chills were more important than cheap boo scares.
Not a bad film by any stretch, it's leagues above the frankly crap TV miniseries (Apart from a bonkers Tim Curry as Pennywise, the 90s version is pretty forgettable).
A solid addition to the genre (With a fun cameo from a genre master), but it's not exactly going to dethrone the great Stephen King adaptations.
But goddammit, I jumped back in my seat three times. And my partner loved it.

The adult cast works well but it's the younger selves that steal the show. I'll certainly watch this again when released on DVD, perhaps a second viewing may earn a more generous rating. But I won't be paying the price of cinema admission again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Actors carry a slow but entertaining film,Wasn't a big fan of the end but thought that the back and forth between Richie and Eddie was fantastic and the rest of the cast just had such strong chemistry,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not like part 1 but then it's not supposed to be,"Awesome part 2, all those complaining about this not being the same as part 1 it's not supposed to be, first of all it's based 27 years later and we have to take a look at their story lines and IT came into their lives. Still absolutely love seeing Stephen King in the movie as he always makes a cameo appearance. So my rating is that this movie was bloody awesome",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too much CGI,"You know the ""IT Mini Series"" from the 90s?
Absolutely no CGI, and Its a Masterpiece.The New Version of IT Chapter 1 and 2 have the same big issue. Everything is not terrifying due to CGI Effects all over the Time.
Pennywise maybe had only 4 Scenes in Real, and the rest is a CGI Animation.
Ok it is a Creepy Clown, but not a Clown as you remember Clowns.
This Clown looks like a Middle Age Harlequin Knock off, and not like a Clown you could see in Circus.
And this makes the Movie also less terrifying.In the 90s mini Series, ""IT"" was so horrible due to the Fact that he looked like a Clown! He looked like Beepo the Clown in my Hometown Circus and that makes it so horrible. If you would meet a Clown like IT in the Remake, do you would think it is a funny Clown? NOOO You wouldnt.It Chapter 2 has a great Cast. A well written Storyline and of course, some Jokes!
But it is not a single Moment a good Horror Movie.
It is a Horror Movie for sure, but good? No. The CGI and the Costume Design from Pennywise ruins the whole Remake.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The perfect sequel,"I don't usually leave reviews but I had to say this was nearly 3 hours long, it didn't feel like it what a ride and a perfect sequel to finish it all. The film is well casted, fantastic acting. Sometimes they make sequels and they're just garbage but this was worth the watch I loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Near a masterpiece,"IT is good, not great the original was not great also yet, IT Chapter 1 2017 exceeded my expectation
As the original IT with Tim Carry is kind of a masterpiece apart from the ending LOL.IT Chapter 2 should of focused more on Pennywise and it Shifted from Billy which is the main character.Started to quickly for me as Chapter 2 needed more character development prior!!!The relationship with the kids was all Billy due to his Brother,CHAPTER 2 seemed to miss that.
Still exceptional for what it is worth!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
So disappointed!!,"This movie lets itself down so much,, way too much CGI and no backround or acting at all ,, I enjoyed chapter 1 but this movie has ruined the whole saga for me. If you want to watch ""IT"", stick to the original TV movie. Terrible!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting, but much too long","This is a decent film, but it would be better had 45-60 minutes of its run time been left on the cutting-room floor. All in all, it's alright. I won't be recommending it to others, though.",,Anonymous,Horror
"""You lied, and I died.""","While not as good as the first film, this is a solid sequel, and conclusion to the ""It"" story. The first time I saw this film I was a bit disappointed, not living up to the highs of the first one, but after a second viewing I enjoyed it far more.Just like the first film casting here is impeccable, every actor portrayed their teenage counterparts so well. Cinematography, score, acting, cgi everything in this film is well done.What drags it down for me is the pacing, and runtime. At 2 hours and 49 minutes you'd think more would happen. It's slow what makes that runtime feel even longer. It's why when thinking about revisiting ""It: Chapter Two"" I always second guess myself because of how slow and time consuming it feels.Nonetheless this is a solid sequel with more disturbing imagery, gore, and scares but for me the first is the better of the two.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It: Chapter 2 Review,"It: Chapter 2 is one of if not the most entertaining film I have seen this year. There are so many laugh out loud moments in this film and that's both good and bad. Compared to the 2017 film, Chapter 2 is not great on a technical level but it's far superior on an entertainment level. Here are the negatives. The film does overstay its welcome. The runtime is 2 hours and 45 minutes long and you definitely start to feel that.There are certain elements that could have been removed from the film and it would have been better. The ending of the film is not that good either. It does a rapid tone shift after the climax which just feels off putting to what we just encountered. The visual effects are pretty bad. There are many different forms of It shown through the film and they all look pretty fake. It gets distracting when the form of It in the climax looks fake which causes that scene to lose any tension that was built up. My final issue is that the film once again decides to rely much more heavily on jump scares than actual concepts. The 2017 film had scary moments that were built up and didn't come off as jumpscares but every attempt at being scary in this film was a jumpscare. Here are the positives. I feel that this film is an example of perfect casting. Each adult actor mirrors their child counterpart almost perfectly. Their acting is really good also. Bill Skarsgard, James McAvoy, and especially Bill Hader are standouts from the film. Bill Hader steals every scene he is in. He's incredibly funny and is the best part of this film. The film is incredibly funny. There are many jokes or sequences in the film that are just drop dead hilarious. I feel that some of the funny scenes were intentional while others were not but I will give director Andy Muschietti props for making this film semi self aware. There a bunch of really cool and unique transition shots and the cinematography was pretty good. Overall, It: Chapter 2 may not be as scary as the 2017 film but it's vastly more entertaining thanks to a likeable cast and hilarious sequences. I give It: Chapter 2 a 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It Chapter2 - The evil clown returns.,"Fantasy horror based on the Stephen King novel.Its 27 years later and the evil clown has returned to Derry.The 'losers' are now adults, they have long since gone their separate ways except for one character who calls the others up to return and fight the evil clown. The first hour introduces the adult characters, they assemble in Derry and face their fears in order to defeat the evil. Frequent flash-backs provide the backstory.I'm not a fan of horror but I liked it more than I thought I would and more than the first movie mainly due to the humour. There are some jump-scares moments and genuinely scary scenes. Almost 3hrs long, though it didn't feel that long.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing and with bad taste,"Terrible decisions in this screen adaptation from such an interesting book. The whole idea of IT is a reflection on what fear means and how this is a very complex feeling. In this movies they make it look as something stupid and with lack of actual human reactions. They made ""fear"" for ""fear"".
I understand that a book and a movie are different ways to tell stories and to perceive them. But this movie just added things over and over again, which made the plot poor and unplanned. We couldn't see any real character development and that made me do not understand their decisions. And when you do not understand the decisions of this characters, you can't relate to them, and without this the movie is just 3 hours that feels like a huge waste of time.So disappointing.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Almost 3 hours of horror and allegory: challenging and entertaining.,"""For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you... I've missed you!"" Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard)It Chapter Two, set in quaint and vulnerable Derry, Maine, is one crowded horror film. And that's saying something as it is the sequel to the already revered It by Stephen King. It has enough horror tropes such as jump scares, surprises, and toothy, reptilian monsters to keep the almost three hours humming.However, enough is enough. After twenty-seven years from their introduction to the scary Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the Losers Club must return to face the horrific clown, and they hope, destroy It. Fortunately screenwriter Gary Dauberman and director Andy Muschietti include enough allegorical heft to keep this horror rampage from being just a visually hot mess.That the club must individually shed its fears and weaknesses to defeat the clown is both a strength and a weakness: strong because allegorically we all have to do this purging to be mentally healthy, and weak because isolating the club members weakens understanding of their development relative to each other and their consuming past. In other words, they are better at self-reflection facing each other, and therefore their past, than going it alone.Only too obvious is the film's attempt to show how some memories, not always favored ones, linger for decades, powerful enough to draw the initial gang back to end the reign of the ghoulish clown. At various times a magnificent seven of them crowd the screen with their long-suffering hang ups such as cowardice and guilt, all in need of purgation.King's Carrie and Pet Sematary, two of my favs, are careful to keep the protagonists to a minimum whereas It Chapter Two weighs It down with minimal but provocative leitmotifs, e.g., Beverly's (Jessica Chastain) abusive father or Bill's (James McAvoy) relationship with his deceased brother. Any one of these concepts could be fleshed out at the expense of more trifling ones.As in many action films, even with super heroes, the now commonplace theme of being who you are with courage gets overused as it does here. Compounding the sense of having seen it before are numerous monstrous visions, with sharp teeth and tentacled arms and legs for just a few of the stock monsters. Granted these are all manifestations of Pennywise's ability to shape shift and the writers to locate character flaws in the characters.It Chapter Two may suffer from trying too much, but, hey, that's better than not at all. For Steven King devotees, this is nectar; for the rest, this is a long fun-house ride with allegory supplying the fuel. Of course, IT reminds that keeping and nurturing friendships is the surest way to send out the clowns.",,Anonymous,Horror
Chapter 1 deserved a better chapter 2,"I watch a lot of horror movies, which makes me almost immune to jumpscares. I didnt watch its trailers to keep everything a surprise. There were some great and creepy concepts and scenes in it that i loved, but almost %60-70 of the other times, i felt like this movie is 3 hours just to be 3 hours. The ending on paper might be good but when i watched it on the screen i felt it was a bit disney channel-ish. I personally enjoyed the acting very much.
I never read the book cover to cover, but i can say is that some ideas and concepts might be awesome while you are reading in a book but might be underwhelming on the screen. All i can say is i was never really scared or didnt hear anyone else being scared in the theatre. Would wait for a digital/DVD release. Hope this is helpful.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pennywise is not scary anymore,"I had high expectations with this movie but, ultimately the reviews and ratings were right. It is not as good as the first IT. The scares were not scary for me and came of as unintentionally funny. Various scenes in the movie felt lazily written, especially the fare scene in the beginning. The climax was also unsatisfactory. The movie is unnecessarily long. The acting is good. The main 6 leads played their part well, their behavior resembled their younger counterparts. The CGI is good but overused. The direction is average. The score is ok, editing decent. If the story was good, I would have given it an eight.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Jump out of your seat scary, but long","This was one of the longest movies I've been to. But for the most part kept you interested.

I did not see the first one, but I really liked the story line of the past and the present.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Plot is Not Strong,"I can't really enjoy this movie. The plot is not so strong for me. There's no clear reason of all the scary moments happened in the movie. It's just like a collection of horible imaginations appear in the casts mind.I actually waited and hoped to see the history of that clown. At least, how it appears in clown figure. But I don't get it till the end if the movie.And the ending of the movie, I think it's too easy. And again, there's no any make sense reason why IT ends by that way.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a Ride,"At the end of the day, this is a story about friendship standing through the test of time and of course Pennywise.For me - it has all the elements of a great movie. Wonderful cast, the young cast and their adult counterparts shine all throughout. Special shout out to Bill Hader and James Ransone - those two were a treat to see exchange banter. Great screenplay and direction - I loved that Andy M. focused on the Losers. I didn't care much for the domestic drama involving the respective spouses of Bill and Bev in the mini series.A good blend of horror and comedy. Much like the first one I enjoyed this combo.Emotional - I can't help it but my eyes were moist during the last bit.I was eagerly waiting for this sequel and it did not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
