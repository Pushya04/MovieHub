"War, What is it Good For...","Colonel Kurtz has disappeared within the jungle, with his troupe of fighting fiends ready to rumble, you've been tasked to take him out, but first you have to search and scout, along a river where the residents are disgruntled (to put it mildly). Lots of bloodshed, bullets, ballistics then flow, there's napalm too that conjures up a glow, many lives are lost and taken, in this hell where you're forsaken, but don't ask why - because nobody, really, knows.Still a spectacular piece of filmmaking that demonstrates on many levels the destruction, physical and mental that armed conflict causes, and yet we perpetually fail to learn from past events.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Take the long ride to perdition.,"There are films we watch because they are good, even though they are painful for us. This is a film I saw one time. At that time I thought to myself, this is enough. It was painful to make that journey down the river, wondering what was around every corner. Then we meet the products of our own id impulses, as we are the enemy, our souls have been brought down to this. At the end of the river is the man who came before us, and we see the uselessness of the journey. It is the Heart of Darkness. There are death masters like Robert Duvall. There are those who can only hope to survive, but the war is the master. The Doors music as the napalm settles gently on the treetops and across the ground, sweeps us up gently. Meanwhile it is consuming the flesh of the Vietnamese people, as well as an occasional American soldier. The ancient Romans could not envision peace without war. We and much of the world seem to have embraced those tenets put forth some two thousand years ago. This film gets into the marrow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Coppola conveyed the drama and spectacle of this truly outstanding film,"After the success of the first two 'Godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively, Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam, which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975 The plot was loosely based on the book 'Heart of Darkness,' a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz, a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the nativesCoppola retains much of this, including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtz's headquarters and his final words, ""The horror the horror""In the film, Sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into Cambodia, and eliminate, with ""extreme prejudice,"" a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities On his journey up the river to the renegade's camp he experiences the demoralization of the US forces, high on dope or drunk with powerAlthough, as a result of cuts forced on Coppola, the film was accused of incoherence when first released, it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of Vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound""Apocalypse Now"" was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored As a result, the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now Redux ought to be treated separately here,"As I stated above, I think that the 2000 version of the film ought to be treated separately. The Redux is not just a longer version. It contains two new and important scenes, and one of them, the ""french"" episode, adds a whole new touch to a classic movie, WITHOUT breaking the atmosphere or disturbing the overall picture. I remember as I saw the Redux for the first time, that my whole understanding of the war in Vietnam changed, and how I had to go to the library and get an update on a few things. Also it is interesting that Coppola chose the year 2000 for the longer Redux. My guess is that he feels that the movie is as important today as it was back in 1979. He even went to the trouble of making an excellent piece of art even better, in order to actually make all the old fans see the new stuff, and to present a whole new generation with a very controversial and strong comment on one of the most bloody wars in recorded history. The movie is thought-provoking indeed, but also it has a visually very beautifully composed screenplay. Capturing the madness and chaos of war the storyline is also filled with more or less obvious metaphors and philosophical or existential riddles. A friend of mine called it ""the most philosophical of all movies"" - perhaps an overstatement - in my opinion it is just a very good film about war and the politics of war. But I can see that there is plenty for everyone here. What I'm saying is that it's one of those movies that you are likely to hear distinctly different opinions about, and you are most probably going to think again and again about it. I've seen the Redux 5, 6 or 7 times, and it is always a puzzling experience. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"In my opinion, Coppola's best work","My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious.This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers.Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Redux: still brilliant - but now with new strengths and weaknesses,"In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz. Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy. Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad. Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny. However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.That Redux was going to be anything less than brilliant was never in doubt: it was never going to be so different from the original that it would destroy or significantly damage the reputation or impact that the film has. What was in question to my mind was whether or not Coppola should have just left well enough alone.  I have seen the documentary about the making of the original film, wherein Coppola derides many of his scenes and decides to cut them out of his movie even as he finishes shooting them - the plantation scene being one of the key ones that he felt just didn't work.  It was for this reason that I was interested to see what the additions and rejigging of scenes had done to the film.The strengths of Redux is that Apocalypse Now was never about the straight story, it was more about the journey Willard undertakes rather than a build up to a traditional conclusion - while the ending is big, it is no more or less important that anything that has gone before it.  So for that reason it is a good thing that, simply put, there is now more of the journey to be enjoyed!  `49 minutes of new material' my dvd cover screams at me; combine this with the movement of scenes and certainly it does have the feel of a different (albeit familiar) film rather than just a bit of spit and polish with some new CGI effects (yes ET, I'm looking at you).  However this increased material also brings with it the problems that not all the material compliments the film in terms of total quality.None of the added scenes or sequential movements are bad or even average, they are all interesting, but some just don't seem to really fit.  The plantation scene has some great dialogue (that strikes a real chord so recently post-Iraq) and it makes it's points but it just didn't seem to fit. I can see what Coppola was trying to do and, if you watch Hearts Of Darkness, you can see that it frustrates him that it doesn't work, but he got it right first time, it doesn't fit despite it's standalone merits. Likewise the playboy bunny scene intrigued me as I tried to get more from the bunny's semi-speech about being made to do things and the theme of objectification, but again it didn't totally work and seemed out of place.Despite these two major scenes not totally fitting, they are still interesting and, if you came for the journey, then that is what matters and they present themselves as a flawed part of that journey - but a part of that journey nonetheless.  Some of the smaller additions actually contribute a lot more to the film.  Little moments in the boat show Willard to be more relaxed as a man than the original did - and this greatly benefits my understanding and appreciation of his character.  How he interacts with the rest of the crew is also improved.  Other minor additions to existing scenes serve to enhance them, but improvement in some areas is difficult when it comes to this film.I won't go into details on cast, performances and the themes of the film as I have already done that in my other review.  Suffice to say that, if you loved Apocalypse Now then Redux will likely both enhance your enjoyment and slightly irritate you at the same time.  The film easily stands up to the longer running time - as another user said, I could easily give the five hour version a stab (well, maybe once!) as the journey is the all.  The additions may not be without flaw, but then that's why they were higher on the editing hierarchy than the rest of the stuff!  However they add interest and minutes to the journey - both of which are good things.Overall, it is very difficult to take `one of the best films ever madeT ' and make it better - and Coppola hasn't done that here, but he hasn't damaged it either.  It isn't a brand new film and it doesn't mess around with the original so much that it could be called a different film - so I won't compare the two as to which is `better'.  Suffice to say that, while I don't totally agree that you `can't have too much of a good thing', certainly an extra 49 minutes is gratefully received where it doesn't damage or cheapen but only seeks to enhance and support.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Surreal Journey Into Darkness,"Apocalypse Now is an interesting film, not because it is supposedly an anti-war film, but because it is surreal and shows an interesting journey into madness.Martin Sheen gives us an insight into his character here and we see the senselessness of the whole situation and how easy it is to lose yourself in certain situations.We follow his journey and the various events that befall him and a small group of soldiers in a patrol boat traveling deep into the jungle. On their way, really bizarre things happen.Along the way, we also see Robert Duvall in the role of a completely insane officer, whose episodic role has a profound impact on the film.The film should essentially be anti-war, but it didn't strike me as such, but simply as a film about the fate of various people who found themselves in unusual situations.Their whole mission doesn't really make sense, and in the end they accomplished nothing, but that's the point. Everything was really in vain.The direction is excellent, the music is perfectly integrated into the film and matches the tone of the film.For me, this is a film about the loss of reason and the journey to madness. If civilization completely collapses, and somewhere it has already collapsed a long time ago, this is roughly what we can expect, madness and insanity.I watched three versions of the film and I liked the Redux version the best.An interesting and brutal journey into madness and darkness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Crumbles under its own weight,"I have nothing but respect for Francis Ford Coppola. He is deservedly one of the greatest directors of all time and his style of film-making is pretty much inimitable. Yet I can't really say I enjoyed this movie. At least not the Redux version I saw.First the good parts. It's a damn beautiful film. The mood, as they slowly drift up the Vietnamese river, keeps building and building and you can smell the heat and wetness in the air, feel the sweat dripping down your back, hear the hollow echoing screaming around you. The script was heavily inspired by the classic novella Heart of Darkness and that's exactly the mood and atmosphere they achieved.The acting is also topnotch, with one glaring exception, and I've never seen Charlie Sheen do a more convincing role than here. You can almost see the cracks in their souls as the heaviness of the war settles around them as they are pulled from combat and send to face almost certain deaths as they hunt their elusive quarry.It's a well-made film. Everything from camera-work to sets to directing works, and works so well, but the fact remains that's it's just too long. At least the Redux version. You can only stretch the atmosphere and suspense for so long until you start to look at the clock. That's partly the purpose and to this film's credit, any other film would have crumbled way sooner, but crumble it does, eventually.I also have problems with Marlon Brando's performance. Apparently the man showed up hugely overweight, completely unprepared and pretty much being as unprofessional as you can be. And it shows. The final third of the film throws the suspense straight out of the window and pretty much the only question left is ""Brando, what happened, man?""I can see why people love this film. It's a haunting take on war, has amazing atmosphere, vivid imagery, memorable characters and as a whole there are very few movies like it. Personally I lost interest after the halfway point, but that's just me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
My All Time Favourite Movie,"I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw itThis leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound , editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted , and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the borderHow about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director , I said "" was "" in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head , but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen , but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes , so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states "" This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam "" he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of AmericaIt's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party , or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novelMy all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Good.but a bit overhyped,Some excellent performances. And a decent cast of actors. With Brandos Gravitas hard to dislike. Sometimes the soundtrack can be physically off putting. But occasionally the music treats you with Valkyries and The Stones which is enjoyable. I would probably argue it is Horror before it is a war movie as the brutality and graphic depictions can be pretty grim. Similar vibes to Event Horizon on that front. Thought it was quite hard to understand the dialogue as it was loud and manic quite often making deciphering sentences difficult at times. But to be fair the dialogue is only marginally important. The story is also not overly important. Understanding the main plot is a must for most films. But watching the characters personal decents into their own madness and imagining the conditions which lead to horrendous circumstances becoming the accepted norm is where I feel the flms main objective lies and it does this reasonably well. I gave the movie a 7 as I was reasonably entertained and enjoyed it in spells. I did find it a little disjointed and unsettling at times and that's not really my idea of enjoyable viewing. But as its a well loved Movie. I can understand that this sort of artistic direction appeals to a large audience. Ticked off the Bucket Watch List.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I must be missing something...,"Now, it would appear by judging the user and critic reviews that my opinion is in the minority. Nonetheless, I cannot for the life of me understand the extremely high ratings for this film. The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon and Good Morning Vietnam all much more enjoyable. The cinematography of Apocalypse Now is very good at times, the opening scene being arguably my favourite part of the film as the music is perfect. However throughout the whole film I just felt an extreme lack of consistency with the storyline, too much confusion and jolting between themes. Whilst some of the action scenes were brilliant, I just felt a real lack of connection to the purpose. Now I won't spoil the ending but let's just say I really could not make heads or tail of the decisions made, all logic was out of the window. I am never usually critical of a film and this must be the highest rated picture that I really do not get on well with, for some reason I just expected a lot more and was very disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"You love it, or you hate it....","As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,""middle of the road"" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. ""Why would you like a film that's so confusing?"" ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted ""standards"" of death and destruction (Am I the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have 'standards' for death and destruction????), so they send the ""Conformity Police"" out to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intent of the movie, and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have 'grown' itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the best and most important movies ever,"This movie changed the art of film making, telling a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke. The film uses music not as a score laid in later, but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers, radios etc. Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration, taking scenes and characters, and putting them into entirely different surroundings. That is a tricky and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune, and films him so that you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding, and it works beautifully. This movie belongs in the top ten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"the horror, the horror...","So just how insane is 'Apocalypse Now'?  Well, let's say that it is the kind of film that makes you want to bang your head against the wall.  The beginning has no credits or titles; nothing.  The whole film seems like it's taking place on a different world, and as the story moves on, sanity itself is shed.  There was a French plantation scene that got cut out, and an alternate ending that would have had a massive battle scene outside Kurtz's compound.'Apocalypse Now' is not a realistic film in the sense that the presentation of the Vietnam War is far from correct: helicopters going in BEFORE the napalm strikes, a USO show in the jungle at night, and the final bridge all lit-up like a Christmas tree.  (for more realistic 'Nam War movies, try 'The Deer Hunter' or 'Platoon')But what 'Apocalypse Now' lacks in historical accuracy, it makes up in artistic and dramatic scripting.  Some of the best photography and lighting ever can be found here.The film also raises some severe philosophical issues, and gives us entirely new ones.  When the movie begins, the war is raging around us.  It is chaotic and nerve-racking, yet still rational.  When we finally get to Kurtz's base, the action has died down, but rational thinking has long since been vanquished to the point of total lunacy.  This shows us the truth about men of war in times of war and peace.  The voyage down the river has a sense of time travel (a sense that would have been much more apparent had the French Plantation scene remained.)  And when you get to the end, keep in mind the old phrase: The King is dead...  Long live the king.Is Kurtz insane?  Or are we not yet ready to understand him?  These questions and more are up to you as 'Apocalypse Now has no easy answers.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
In my top five favorite films ever made,"Apocalypse Now is not only my personal favorite work by Francis Ford Coppolla, it's also one of the great visions ever put onto cinema. It makes what was horrific, strange, and ironically exciting and mysterious about the Vietnam War into this mad tale of obsession, death, loss, and the dark side of humanity. While the stories behind the production of the film made it notorious and rather risky back in 1979, it works on its own terms and represents not just Coppola's genius but others in the Zoetrope team as well. It also paints a sometimes lurid, ultra-violent, bleak and curious view of what war does to people, both in the lower ranks, the big-guns, and those who go too far ""up the river"".Many have also been perplexed by Marlon Brando's performance in the film, but it's actually one of his very best turns on screen, albeit improvised and close to running off the rails. His few moments on screen (even in the somewhat unnecessary scene plopped into the Redux version) there's enough conviction in what he's saying- and what perhaps isn't said- that makes the trip down the river worthwhile on an intellectual and poetic level. And making up the bulk of the film are delirious turns by Robert Duvall (a Oscar nominated turn he should've won), Martin Sheen as the Captain with almost too much to ponder in an ever increasing state of everything but him being insane; character actors like Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne have some of the best work they've ever done. And it goes without saying that Dennis Hopper comes close to stealing any scene he's in, for better or worse, with the most to say in rambling, yet coherent words.Every time I watch this film (and mostly the original version which is what first drew me in completely as opposed to the very good if muddled Redux version) I am astounded with how operatic everything is, and how the variations on the madness and chaos of Vietnam is put together. Of course one can give adulation to Coppola for this as he completed it without totally going off the deep end or possibly dying, and his talents are pulled to their richest peaks here as a storyteller and director of actors. But it can't be said enough how much I can't get enough of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which has in part come close to perfect for this kind of epic film. The music is perfectly eerie and insidious, with the Doors song used for one of my favorite iconic scenes in the movies (both of them). Walter Murch's editing- which apparently was what saved the film from being a four-hour disaster- makes the action move when it needs to and for individual shots to get their due. And even the production design is remarkable and, to the extent it goes to, original in its partial translation of both Conrad's fiction and the unfortunate realities of life on the river.If you haven't seen it yet, in short, get off your ass and get a copy; it might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema ever to come out of that all-too-brief American new-wave of the 1970's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Copolla's Apocalypse,"Warning! Spoilers Ahead! This movie seems like the high-water mark for Francis Ford Copolla; nothing he has made since has been as favorably reviewed in the eyes of most critics. This is the third Copolla movie I've seen, and, while I admire Copolla's ambition, the film does not compare to his two classic Godfather movies. Simply put, the acting is not as excellent, and there are too many extraneous scenes.The movie is most definitely NOT a straight Vietnam war movie, or even a straight war movie, period. There is little attempt at realism here. It is, simply, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" set in the Vietnam War. Kurtz, as he was in the novel, is an idealistic white man who is the best of the best in his own civilization but, when exposed to the other-worldliness of a non-Western tropical society beset with colonial exploitation and the white man's savagery while trying to ""tame"" this landscape, he himself becomes the most demonic of the savages. Conrad's protagonist in the framework story, Marlowe, is reinvented as an out-of-it army officer assigned to kill the savage Kurtz. While he moves toward's Kurtz's lair in the heart of the jungle, he encounters the madness of Vietnam, including the Americans' disregard for human life, a battle without a commanding officer, and crazed GIs, bereft of the veneer of civilization, assaulting a USO show featuring Playboy bunnies. The results are ultimately uneven, and this may be due in large part to the difficulties of adapting Conrad's novel to the screen, especially when set in the context of the Vietnam War.Conrad's novel was meant to highlight the horrors of white cruelty towards Africans in the Belgian Congo in their pursuit for ivory and rubber wealth. The Vietnam War is a bit more ambiguous with regards to similar colonial ambitions. Historians today still debate the reasons for the Americans entering Vietnam, but it seems a bit of a stretch to compare Vietnam with the blatant colonialism Conrad was describing. Copolla made a rather odd choice by selecting Vietnam as a proxy for the savagery of Belgian colonial rule, and this made his adaptation all the more difficult. Secondly, Copolla also had difficulty translating Conrad's symbols in a visual format. The savage whites are shown as helicopter pilots who spray bullets and fluorescent napalm on helpless victims below. It all seems like too much for the senses to take in. The massacre on the riverboat seems too quick and abrupt, and does not flow smoothly with the theme of savagery Copolla apparently had in mind.Copolla, unfortunately, did not have the perfect cast of actors he had in ""The Godfather."" Martin Sheen is very good as the Marlowe character, but, as he is the ""narrator"" of the story, his participation is mostly subdued. Marlon Brando has deteriorated greatly since his role as Don Corleone. His delivery is monotone and stiff, and his acting utterly lethargic. He clearly seems to be going through the motions as the Kurtz character. The actors on Marlowe's boat do well, but do not compare to the ""Godfather"" cast.In all, this was a highly ambitious and worthy film, but the difficulty of placing this vision on screen makes it flawed. The best scene is in the ""redux"" version, where Martin Sheen faces the last vestiges of desperate colonialism on a French rubber plantation. That alone is a classic movie scene, and much closer to Conrad's work than most of the film's frantic, chaotic scenes. I recommend ""Apocalypse Now,"" but do not expect a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Headache,"Well, the film is good, but it is complex and deep in a strange way. The majority of the film's events feel as if they were random.

At the end of the film, here I began to feel the events. The cinematography is good, and the camera angles are perfect. Greetings to Coppola. The emotions in the film involve you in the story and its madness. The colors were wonderful. Many colors were used, and each occasion has a specific color.

Director Francis Ford Coppola used his reputation after the two Godfather movies, and risked it all for this movie. You can tell he left it all on the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Truly a Masterpiece,"Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth.Saving Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but its message is dull and while its very entertaining, it doesn't make you think about anything. AN is the best movie I ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, starting from war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither, the french lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false. But a great movie, and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he isn't, nobody holds the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its outer beauty, amazing scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied. But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary.Both Copolla and Moore tackle similar issues, but while Copolla presents matters from an outside , objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... It is really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war, the Iraq war, the second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, and not the other one ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Lives Up To Its Title,"From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the:The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. Coppola though makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film. The writing was of course amazing too. It brought you write into the middle of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm.The acting was bone-chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded, out of whack colonel. When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. Like the movie he was freakish. To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal. It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies, among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming. Also Duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché. Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both love.I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best. There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A masterpiece of Madness,"This film is completely brilliant. The first half of the film has more violence and a lot more fun to the film but I'm the second half, the true physiological torment of Vietnam is shown. When they enter Kurtz's camp, the mood of the film completely changes from mildly disturbing and a bit mad, to incredibly disturbing and complete madness. The cinematography, writing, acting, direction and sound are incredible from one of the best films of the 20th century. I highly recommend you to watch this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The REDUX version,"'This is the end' sings Jim Morrison as choppers criss-cross the screen. No, Jim, it's just the beginning. The beginning of a 202-minute, drug-fuelled Vietnam war epic that follows a group of US soldiers upriver, deep into enemy territory, where they witness madness, come to realise the futility of their conflict, and are reminded of the heart of darkness that beats in all men. And like their mission, it's extremely hard going at times.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this wild '70s classic starts off brilliantly, with war weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) being sent on a covert mission to assassinate renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), whose behaviour and methods are proving an embarrassment to the US army. An early set-piece—an air attack on a Vietcong village to the strains of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries—is hugely impressive, boding well for the rest of the film. The genius continues with Robert Duvall's unforgettable performance as bonkers Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, while a jungle encounter with a tiger, and a visit by some Playboy playmates to boost moral only add to the fun.Unfortunately, once the group of soldiers arrive at a French plantation, Apocalypse Now Redux becomes as bloated and unintelligible as its out-of-shape, mumbling star Brando: the action slows down to a snail's pace, and the vast amount of narcotics consumed by cast and crew becomes more than evident, the film turning into a dull psychedelic haze of drug-fuelled weirdness. Dennis Hopper, as a crazed photo journalist, is particularly spaced out, acting like he's single-handedly snorted the entire cocaine supply of the Philippines. This half of the film, as Hopper might say, is a real drag, man.If I ever decide to watch Apocalypse Now again, which I think is unlikely, I'll be sure to watch the original theatrical version. Many think it is better; even if that isn't the case, it's definitely shorter.7.5/10 for everything that happens before the plantation scene; 2.5/10 for the rest. So that's an average of 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Napalm,"""Apocalypse Now"" stars Martin Sheen as U. S. intelligence officer Capt. Willard who's assigned to travel to Cambodia during the Vietnam War to terminate the demented Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz is in the midst of attempting unapproved and bloody operations in the deepest jungles lead by local tribesmen and U. S. soldiers. Willard is joined by staff members Chief (Albert Tucker), Chef (Frederic Forrest), Clean (a very young Laurence Fishburne) and Lance (Sam Bottoms). Willard teams up with loopy Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his helicopter brigade and some Playboy bunnies for entertainment purposes and a French family stubbornly not wanting to leave the premises. This leads up to an epic battle against the sadistic Kurtz.After finally seeing the redux version of ""Apocalypse Now"", I can admit that it exceeded everything the shorter version of this classic film has to offer. The AFI has ranked it as one of the top film in movie history and I have no reason to argue that analogy in any way possible. It was truly an amazing masterpiece film and I am just so greatly honoured to witness one of the greatest films ever made.If anyone was expecting a feel-good movie, well what the hell were you smoking? There's no feel-good elements to this film. This is the threshold to hell. The weak at heart is not invited to this party. I'm not trying to be mean, but if you can't take the brutal grimness of this movie, then it's really not for you to see. There are some comical elements, but not intended for chuckling, but for a much darker tone. Martin Sheen truly delivers as Capt. Willard a hired assassin sent on a dangerous mission to track down and kill one of his own kind named Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando who was his demented best), who has now gone on the brink of dementia has developed an operation set up the deepest darkest jungles in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. One thing I don't understand is why couldn't the Army just simply sent him home via Section 8? I mean lots of Vietnam vets fell too dementia during these harsh moments. Robert Duvall as a tough, but eccentric Lt. Col. Kilgore who enjoys the aroma of Napalm in the morning. Every scene that Duvall is in he just steals every scene he's in.It was very smart of Sheen to take this role, if anything, by the end of this movie, his character should have been rewarded a Silver Star or a Purple Heart or something. I mean he's aboard in a vulnerable navy boat as he crosses the jungle as he eerily gets closer to Kurtz and his insane demesne and as he draws near, I fear that Willard might be on the brink of the dark side himself. With the conditions they're up against, anyone can go bonkers Kurtz, Willard, Kilgore, anyone. You really can't rest on your laurels and say ""what will be will be.""By expanding the film to an extra 49 minutes, I don't know what the story would be without the French plantation in Cambodia. I think it would be lost in the shuffle that we see these people argue over issues like politics as they exchange brandy and cigars maybe it's a ploy for Willard to have his last chance in preserving his sanity.I had a chance to see it on my outdoor theatre. Just the whirling sounds of the helicopters and the explosions of the bombs sound so close to you that it could almost blow up right into your faces. This film is the perfect war movie with great acting, lots of intense scenes and a film that truly won't insult your intelligence. You're more crazier than Kurtz if you choose to neglect this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the greatest films ever made,"The original ""Apocalypse Now"" is an awe-inspiring masterpiece and is my all-time favorite film. Memorable scenes abound, starting with the mind-blowing opening with Willard (Martin Sheen) having a mental breakdown in his sweltering Saigon hotel room to the tune of The Doors' ""The End.""Speaking of Sheen, people overlook the fact that he expertly carries the film. His haunting commentary is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare-adventure.I could go on and on about the noteworthy scenes, but I'll resist, except to comment on Col. Kurtz: Was he really insane or actually a bold genius? General Corman informs Willard: ""He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" And, yet, Kurtz was accomplishing what the US military couldn't or wouldn't do because of political complications and niceties. I bring this up because, as I've aged, I've come to see that I'M Kurtz in some ways -- operating ""out there"" beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.The script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film whilst the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with 'K,' which is no accident:Lt. COL. KILGORE (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it, i.e. Glorifies it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war.COL. KURTZ (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's living horror and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned -- even crazy -- after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out. His consolation is that Willard will tell his son the truth.The ""Redux"" version was put together by Coppola and released in 2001 with the addition of 49 minutes of material that he originally cut, not to mention placing Clean's surfing scene later in the story.Coppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film (2 hours, 33 minutes) since the extra footage of ""Redux"" tends to drag the film down with 1 or 2 scenes being dubiously scripted, e.g. The theft of Kilgore's surf board. Not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and ""Redux"" illustrates this. Thus the new footage of ""Redux"" should've arguably been relegated to the ""deleted scenes"" section.That said, I've warmed up to ""Redux"" and feel it's a worthy version of the film, but only if you've watched the Theatrical Cut and want more. ""Redux"" successfully fleshes out the characters and gives them more dimension, especially Willard and Kurtz. Plus the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple of TIME magazine articles illustrates beyond any shadow of doubt that he wasn't insane and that the brass simply slandered him as crazy in order to justify the assassination of a decorated American officer.Coppola's preferred cut of the film is the ""Final Cut,"" released in 2019, which runs a half hour longer than the Theatrical Cut. In other words, it trims the fat off of ""Redux."" There's also a ""First Assembly"" version, a bootleg, that runs 4 hours, 49 minutes.The film was shot in the Philippines.GRADE: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Never get out of the boat unless you are going all the way.,"There must be something inherent in man, something from long ago, that sits deep within us; a scary thing, frightening to those who would choose - or who are forced to - gaze at it.In making this movie, Coppola must have seen this thing that is not always visible. And if he did not see it in its entirety then in what must surely be a cliché by now, he saw enough of it to allow the heart of its darkness to pulse throughout this film.And just as Coppola was changed by his experience in the jungle, so too his most mysterious character. Something happened to Colonel Kurtz. Something he saw fractured his mind, the diamond bullet shattering his perceptions into a single struggle that he himself, deep within his heart, knew he was unable to comes to terms with. And this is the crux of this movie, that this journey into darkness can promise a truth so clear that it blinds you, a truth so powerful that is keeps a hold of you and does not let you go and traps you into staying exactly, exactly where you are.For the critics of this film, I wonder if they would ever admit to the existence of the dark place within. Admitting it, will they discover empathy? Art - and the film maker's craft is certainly that - surely requires the observer to join forces with the artist so as to see and to experience the world from the perspective of whatever the artist has discovered. Coppola, following the path of his own film making, ensures that his central character Captain Willard, journeying deep into the jungle, deep into his heart, has his own chance to discover the horrific artistry of the Colonel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Apocalypse Now,"I have seen Apocalypse Now so many times over the decades, with various different cuts that Francis Coppola has released. I even once went over parts of the Grand Canyon on a helicopter with Wagner's The Ride of the Valkyries blaring out. It was like experiencing a moment of the movie.Co written by John Milius, one of the most right wing guys in Hollywood. Apocalypse Now is not really anti war, it sat too much on the fence with the Vietnamese being cannon fodder. The Vietnam War had only ended a few years before the film started production. Major film studios were in no mood to be too overtly critical about the war. That will happen in the 1980s with Oliver Stone.Coppola uses Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness as a metaphorical journey. A war that started off with good intentions by the Americans. Help the Vietnamese and save them from communism. You have Colonel Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) gung ho performance that involves Napalm and surfing. It then ends with Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) a once brilliant soldier literally gone mad.Coppola said of the movie's production ""My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam."" A typhoon had destroyed the film set in the Philippines. Martin Sheen was encouraged to get drunk for his opening scenes and promptly had a near fatal heart attack. An overweight Marlon Brando turned up on the film set without reading the script. It led Coppola to shoot Brando with light and shadows to hide his girth.Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) a Special Ops officer is sent on a secret mission into Cambodia to kill Colonel Kurtz who has gone rogue. He has set up his own military unit with a local tribe using savage methods.Willard goes up river in a small navy patrol boat to Cambodia. A journey where they meet oddballs, a party of Playboy Playmates entertaining the troops, a trip to a French plantation (Special Editions), a journey that becomes increasingly dark, dangerous and nightmarish. Willard particularly does not care much for the crew of the patrol boat.Apocalypse Now is an audacious dazzling epic that becomes a journey into madness. I dread to think how much of the Philippine jungle was firebombed during the making of the film.Coppola was at the height of his powers after his success with the two Godfather films. There is wonderful craftsmanship on display. Also wilful disregard for animal life with the slaughter of the water buffalo in the climax. Sorry Francis, your excuse about that scene is lame.There are supporting roles from Harrison Ford playing Colonel George Lucas to Dennis Hopper playing a wacky journalist in Kurtz's compound. Even Scott Glen has a small non vocal appearance and Laurence Fishburne was only 14 years old when he played one of the crewmen of the patrol boat.The heart of the movie is Sheen. He looks young and innocent but is also suffering from his own traumas and cynicism before he embarks on his mission.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This was a valued rug,"Francis Ford Coppola, once the most praised and powerful director in Hollywood, entered the Southeast Asian jungle to make a movie. Armed with Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", a small army of technicians, and a 15 million dollar budget, he emerged ten months later with thousands of hours of footage, two nearly dead actors and a nervous breakdown.The cause of all this personal trauma was ""Apocalypse Now"", a film in which Martin Sheen is sent up a river and into the jungles of Vietnam to find Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a Special Forces officer who has gone insane.Conrad's message was that savagery and apathy can wipe out the fragile gains of civilization within a single generation. A thin line stands between civilization and total collapse. Inject a little bit of barbarism, a little bit of chaos, and everything falls apart. Coppola's film tries to build on this, and states that America's inability to relinquish the trappings of civilization (ie- to get out of the boat), ensured its defeat. We lost because we weren't, as a nation, prepared to commit genocide. We committed horrors, but we weren't prepared to go all the way.The biggest problem with ""Apocalypse Now"" is that it was written by John Milius, the pro-war, gun toting ultra conservative whom the Coen Brother's based their character Walter Sobchak (from ""The Big Lebowski"") on. At the end of Milius' script, Kurtz and Willard team up to fight America. They represent the warrior savage, free from hypocrisy but lost in the darkness.Coppola, of course, found Milius' script largely silly. He removed Milius' violent ending and went in search of something more powerful. For some grand statement on war and human nature. But he found none. How could he? You can't paddle down a straight line for 10 months and then suddenly expect to reach a new destination.Throughout the film, ""Apocalypse Now"" tells us one thing, but shows us something else. The Colonel Kilgores of the picture actually fight the war, whilst the powerful warrior God, Col Kurtz, does little beside chopping the limbs off natives or hiding in the shadows. Milius' script saw Kurtz as the hero. A wise and seasoned rebel warrior who sticks his fingers up to the hypocritical veneer of civilization, but Coppola seems unwilling to go down that route.Coppola's ""redux"" cut of the film, though badly paced, is more interesting. It adds a French plantation scene which attempts to contrast the French period of colonial rule with America's war in Vietnam. The problem with this is that US involvement in Vietnam and the Colonial mindset of nineteenth century Europe, as seen in ""Heart of Darkness"", are completely different. American policy wasn't inspired by colonial aims but by ideological ones. The American experience in Vietnam was the opposite of Conrad's colonial experience. No wonder Coppola couldn't find a suitable ending. There isn't one.Late in the film, Kurtz accuses his country of hypocrisy. They are unwilling to fully embrace the darkness. If he were given a small army of savages, he says, then the war would be over tomorrow. The implication is that the Vietnamese were nothing more than barbaric savages who should be dealt with, not civility, but primal brutality.Worse yet, Coppola's ""war"" is one of gorgeous cinematography and exciting spectacle. When a Vietnamese village is raided, it feels more like the Death Star trench run than a savage massacre. Killgore himself is a figure of fun rather than the monster he should be. Milius' script painted a much darker character (hence kill and gore).Still, ""Apocalypse Now"" may contain no truths about Vietnam or war in general, but it is a film absolutely dripping with passion. Like ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"", ""Apocalypse Now"" is very much a Werner Herzog film. Herzog was a mad artist who wanted to lift a boat over a mountain. Why lift the boat over the mountain? No reason. He simply wanted to do it in the name of art!Same thing with Coppola. He wanted to do ""somthing"" great. He went into the jungle, went insane and came out with a couple thousand hours of mad footage. What is the merit of this footage? The merit is in surviving the journey. In making it down the river and back out again.And so what we have is a film about its creators. A film about the madness of the white man. The madness of the director. The madness of the crew. Ironically, the film's madness is all a result of indulgence. The indulgence of a staggering budget, studio leeway, accessible drugs, limitless resources and a giant ego. It's the shallowest kind of insanity. The insanity of unlimited power and a lack of boundaries.8/10 - ""Apocalypse Now"" ultimately amounts to nothing more than a series of memorable set-pieces. These set pieces don't enrich one another or gel in any way. It's an incomplete film, and even Coppola admits that he didn't quite know what he was doing or tying to say. The film goes up the river but doesn't know why.Far more interesting is ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"", a documentary shot in tandem with the film. As a study in ego-maniacal madness it's far more powerful than Coppola's film. Narrated by Coppola's wife, it's also very intimate and perceptive. It's also interesting to see how much Coppola relied on Brando's improvisational skills, hoping desperately that the great actor would whip up some kind of climax out of thin air. Brando, of course, was just in it for the huge pay cheque.Though a failure, this film is worth multiple viewings.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Incredible Adaption of Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"" -- Possibly Coppola's Masterpiece","Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Green Berets"" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The ""Apocalypse Now!"" project, the production and resulting film, is ""Heart of Darkness"" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve. This is the plight of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"" (Mistah Kurtz, he dead) of 1925. Although neither a straight telling of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience, ""Apocalypse Now!"" stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. ""Apocalypse"" is not just about the ""horrors"" of war per se, like ""Platoon"" and ""The Deer Hunter"", but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experienced.The bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance), aboard a US military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerners would ever tread. His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a career army Special Forces Division officer who was the darling of the US Military until he went AWOL and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out, something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity. Sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public none the wiser.The movie is rather episodic. The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as Sheen and his crew meet different self-contained ""aspects"" of the war at the ground level. American audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film-making before, with the possible exception of ""The Deer Hunter"" which was released in the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is an helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from Wagner's ""The Ring"" when he bombards helpless villages. His line ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies.Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing. The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film. Not even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery. Brando's Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within.Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. According to the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness"", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama, and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at ""his"" village. After the viewing, Coppola had his ending, and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making. Love it or hate it, no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene.This film is not for all tastes just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle, which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family picture. However, if the viewer can understand its larger point, there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now!. If you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism, better stick with John Wayne. But if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been, even beyond ""the evils of war"" rhetoric, ""Apocalypse Now"" will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before, and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Beautiful cinematography,"During the Vietnam war, a soldier is sent on a mission to assassinate a renegade commander that has established himself as a god among the local tribes.The directing of Francis Coppola is genius with beautiful cinematography. Martin Sheen was an excellent choice for the lead. The editing is very well done that one can feel the tension rising during the progress of the film while they go up the river searching for the renegade, every sound and music complement that tension rising, but when they reach their destination, that final part is a let down, for I was expecting to see the madness and monstrosity of that renegade so talked about throughout the movie, but Marlon Brando's performance for that role was weak and a bad choice, and it seems above all a flaw in the script about the characterization of his persona.About the Redux version, it was nothing more than a deceitful marketing strategy, because the almost 1 hour of new scenes add nothing worthwhile to the story, they cut the flow of the rising tension and ultimately make it a worse movie.Original: 7/10Redux: 5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I remember the last time I watched it I thought about whether this really was more psychological than war, and I guess I can say the psychological element in this movie fades in and out throughout the movie.Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is brilliant, almost as good as Don Corleone in The Godfather, also directed by Francis Coppola who directed this movie! I can also say the same for Robert Duvall, who really brought some charisma about his character (Kilgore).
The score is really different to the standard score you'll see in plenty of movies, and this score actually made itself a factor of my inner debate about whether this was really a psychological movie. The only score from another movie I could at least try and liken it to is Blade Runner (1982), mainly for the use of a similar sounding instrument, that's it! Blade Runner's score sounded more Sci Fi, this doesn't, in fact I dont really know what it sounds like..
The cinematography is stunning and beautiful. There are some moments in this movie that are written into history for the best cinematography of its time, and it makes me realise that even then back when Hollywood had left the golden age, filmmakers and cinematographers still has an almost perfect vision for the look of their movies!
Finally, my favourite part of the movie is the scene in which we join Kilgore on his helicopter assault on a Vietnamese village, while listening to ""Ride of The Valkyries"". I love all the practical effects used in this scene and it makes me appreciate this film much more for how ambitious the production was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Original is still the best and here is why ...,"I am hypnotised by this incredible film. To date, I have seen the original version, the 'redux' cut, the so-called 'final' cut, and a crummy but just about watchable bootleg of the workprint.If you find this film as engrossing as I do, you will find much to enjoy in all versions, and you will want to see them. However, I return to the original version as definitive. Why? Because I think the additional footage unbalances the film. Kurtz is forgotten for the lengthy middle section, so that when he and Willard meet, the sequence from there on feels too brief.The first time I saw the film, the sequence structured around The Doors' 'The End' felt as if it were happening in slow motion, I didn't know what to expect, but also because the tighter narrative ratchets the tension up to an incredible crescendo.There is no question that Brando is one of the stars of the original; in the final cut his presence feels more like a cameo, an afterthought!I still enjoy the (as I say, so-called) 'Final Cut' and would recommend it, with the caveat I have given above. 'Redux' would be my second choice, since you may as well have all excised footage. The Redux version is more like 'Apocalypse Now; The Mini-series' and for me works better than the latest hybrid.The workprint makes for fascinating viewing for the obsessed, like me, for instance, though all versions I have seen are in dismal quality (however, exposure to pirate videos during my younger days has given me the power to decipher garbled video). It would be neat if Coppola would take a leaf out of Ridley's book and assemble a definitive box set which includes the workprint. On the other hand, it's fun to have a phantom version out there, and he likely doesnt want to legitimise a patently incomplete cut, even for the sake of film study.The workprint, as you have probably heard elsewhere, is escessively lengthy not because of numerous extras scenes, but because (for the most part) scenes run on longer (the helicopter attack (scored to Tomita's 'Venus', from The Planets Suite, in part!) must be three quarters of an hour alone).But there are numerous intriguing bits and pieces. Very out of character with the finished film, Willard jokes around with the PBR Streetgang crew, long takes betraying an obviously stationary boat, riffing on Nixon's 'I am not a crook!' Which, apart from displaying an incongrously jocular characterisation, doesn't fit chronologically, since Chef Hicks later reads a newspaper report about the arrest of Charles Manson in the released film(s), which places the onscreen events as taking place in 1970.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Spectacular and fascinating movie  about  a journey leading to horror,"The picture talks about the captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who tells the story , he is assigned for a special mission : Kill Kurtz (Marlon Brando) , American general highly decorated who the army officers (Harrison Ford , G.D. Spradlin) believe has gone murderer and nut . Willard joins to misfit crew (Albert Hall , Sam Bottons , Frederic Forest, Larry Fishburne) make a risked and dangerous journey up river towards Cambodia . They'll find a mad marine captain (Robert Duval) fond of surf , playboy bunnies and French military and a civil group (Christian Marquand and Aurore Clement) living lonely on a plantation since Dien Bien Phu defeat (1954) . The travel is dangerously developed until the fateful meeting with Kurtz .Its a stunning and absorbing story that is based on Joseph Conrad novel : ¨the heart of the darkness¨ . The travel is narrated as a surrealist odyssey leading to the dreadful and horrible final but when the protagonists find General Kurtz the scenarios are darkest and gloomiest . Martin Sheen had a heart attack during the filming and some shots of Willard's back are of doubles , including Sheen's brother Joe Estevez who was flown out specially . The storyline by John Milius tackles issues of ethics and morality and the horror war . In 2001 was realized a ¨redux¨ , a new reediting adding footage , the episode of the playmates and the French people encounters , where there are a lot of nudism and is a bit boring but is pretty dialog and little action . This new edition is today considered to be the official version . Originally scheduled to be shot over six weeks , ended up taking 16 months . The movie in spite of the passed time is still powerful and astounding . Colorful cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is spellbound and breathtaking , he won an Oscar , a very well deserved Academy Award . Carmine Coppola musical score and time songs are atmospheric and exceptional . The picture was perfectly directed by Francis Ford Coppola , pacing with great sensitivity and artistic ambition . Rating: Above average . Awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A cult classic about the madness of cults,"'Apocalypse Now' lays the common phrase 'war is hell' to bare. Vietnam was a war fought on dubious grounds. Birthed during an era of hawkish US foreign policy that wrought destruction to mainly fill the pockets of corporate arms manufacturers and further indebt the U.S. government to private banking interests. It was a dark chapter that has since metastasized into worse things.
The use of pop music in this film as an artistic mode is brilliant, it clearly conveys the normalization of killing as a recreational activity - the banality of evil.The movie reveals the idea that the Vietcong (VC) were created by the US as an elusive guerilla militant group - designed to be 'impossible to detect' for the very reason that they may persist indefinitely, for as long as the ruse was necessary - the casus belli (cause for war). The VC was a placeholder to create an excuse for the incredibly lucrative private sale of firearms, bombs, Agent Orange defoliant 'rainbow herbicides', missiles, military vehicles, and so forth. It enabled the creation of ensnaring government debt to private lenders, also.
The bottom-line purpose was to create a persistent U.S. military presence in these Southeast Asian regions, which also enabled the opportune seizing of valuable natural resources.The movie ultimately is anti-war in its premise. At various points paradoxical aspects of the war are revealed, the cult of 'Apocalypse Now' headed by the 'insane' Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) parallels the cult that was sent to destroy his - the U.S. Army itself, and those it was answerable to. Cap. Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) is the only properly trained soldier in his crew, he provides the point of view (POV); the sane looking glass by which the audience see the disaster that is the Vietnam war unfold before them.There is no point of moral authority in 'The Big Heat'; only chaos, only terror. This is where the film performs strongest, its screenplay is like a bad (artistic) trip on acid, with a political angle. Vietnam, for those years, was an adolescent soldier's playground, permissible by none other than the cult of the U.S. war machine.As Black Sabbath puts it; ""Generals gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses.""8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Superlative,"APOCALYPSE NOW is a masterpiece whether you see the truncated earlier version or the more recent, extended version. The direction is superb, the screenplay excellent with its ironical and occasionally over the top depiction of the uselessness of war and of the degradation of moral values. Duvall is memorable as the colonel who loves to wake up to the smell of napalm; Martin Sheen has his best role ever by a mile; Brando is an enigmatic larger than life metaphysic that appears to have won the minds of the enemy but lost his own; the photography is exquisite; and the sequence with the French family in a colonial setting is an absolute treasure. But there is much more to enjoy, from the much repeated helicopter sounds at the beginning of the movie to the vagaries of fighting a war you do not care for. I will always go back to this movie, watch it with pleasure and learn something new from it. A fabulous film that deserves 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Then was better,"Coppola couldn't leave well enough alone. Redux adds an embarrassing scene where the Suzy-Q Playboy Bunnies sell their bodies for chopper fuel. There is also a long, boring episode at a French plantation where Sheen ends up sacking a Frenchwoman with an accent so thick that nary a word from her is comprehensible. Other scenes have also been expanded, making the film as bloated as Brando. However, the spectacular imagery remains intact, along with the soundtrack of classic 1960s songs and, in that rousing attack on the village, Wagner. Rather than improving the film, this overindulgent director's cut cancels out some of the positive qualities of the 1979 version, reducing the rating from 8 to 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the most strongest and psychological movies ever!,"I saw this movie in the late hour on TV. I decided to watch him because that was announced on TV as one of the best movies ever - I absolute agree with that! On the firs look this movie was hard and confusing. On the first half of the film I was thinking about to stop watching because I was tired of it, but I keep going forward because of publicity and the status of this movie. After three hours of watching this film and when it was finished I just have losing my breath about this truly masterpiece. I've realized how incredible this movie is - one of the most fascinating movies I saw in my life. I'm started to thinking about this film all night.If I had to choose what movie I'll give a 10 stars once in my life I ill choose this. There's many reasons for that and I think that Apocalypse Now is outstanding in several aspects. There's no need to talk about acting, scenes, dialogues,camera etc. - everything is perfect. It's already spoken that. What can I say more? I don't know why some people dislike this movie. I think that is not for everywone, especially teenages boys. Apocalypse Now isn't just a movie, it's experience. Something that may changes your point of thinking at some stuff, for example war or meaning of life etc. What can I say more? I think nothing. If you didn't see this movie, you have loose a incredible experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Dictionary Definition of Overrated,"I saw this film once per decade in my first thirty years on Earth, and I've decided I don't need or want to see it again. It's a good film, and interesting from start to finish, but for me its I first saw this movie as a kid, and I was impressed (if rather confused). I had no idea it was supposed to be the best film ever, so it never occurred to me that anyone might think that.Next time I saw the film I was in my teens, and I'd read Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness - thus, I was less impressed. By this point I was a little more into movies, so I'd seen more critically acclaimed classics too - another contributing factor to the film's diminishment in my eyes.The last time I saw it was in my mid-to-late twenties, and I was honestly disappointed. When I next had the chance to watch the movie, a year or so ago, I passed.Fans of Coppola and lovers of this movie will be ready by now to condemn me as a moron or philistine, but I truly believe this to be an overrated Hollywood mess.It fails as an adaptation because of all the extraneous business: it's no longer about a man's journey to find Kurtz, it's about a seething mass of American national obsessions over Vietnam, war, race and imperialism.Also, unlike Conrad's spare, to-the-point writings, the film deals almost exclusively in hyperbole. There are quiet moments, but they ring false in amidst the craziness.As other reviews have pointed out, it's not really a war movie. However, its hard to see it as such since every scene is more or less obsessing over Vietnam.Other reviews have also pointed out that it's not meant to be realistic, but I question that perception. It looks to me as if it *is* intended to be realistic in many ways - and the fact that it isn't is another of the film's failings in my eyes.The racism of the film is also uncomfortable to me. Where Conrad's novel embodied the racism of its era (in which a white European did indeed have trouble viewing black Africans as human), this comparatively recent film embodies modern American racism by treating its nonwhite extras like so many cattle (no reference intended).None of them have personalities or recognisable aims and objectives - they're seen only as faceless savages, as dangerous enemies, a mindless force which can be harnesses either by clever Communists or manipulative madmen.The key performances are more interesting than actually good. Sheen isn't outstanding, certainly not at his best, and Fishburne is way underused. The big disappointment, however, is Marlon Brando. After such a long journey, so many death and traumas, its awful to realise that their objective is this old tubby loon who waddles around mumbling and being worshipped by unconvincing ""savages"".I've never been a fan of Brando, who for me is like an older, fatter Al Pacino. He knows no restraint, and while many film lovers rate him all his performances seem pretty much the same to me... in that these are actors whose personalities get in the way of their acting. They always seem like themselves, whether its appropriate or not.It's probably fair to point out that I'm not a Coppola fan, either. The phrase I used as a header here was originally something I said about The Godfather. Coppola's movies always come across bombastic and self-important, self-consciously ""big"" movies with heavy themes.I do understand the film, and I appreciate that it has many moments of inspired cinematography and several truly amazing scenes. But for me, it never connects emotionally.Too many characters and situations ring false. The structure is too messy, the use of pop music grates on my nerves, the plot-holes are increasingly apparent with every viewing, and to top it off I find the idea that this is adaptation of Conrad rather absurd. In many ways it's less true to the source than West Side Story is to Romeo and Juliet.It's not a bad film, as such, but a deeply flawed film... and, from a personal point of view, sententious and unnecessary.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Harrowing,"I am not completely sure whether to say this is Francis Ford Coppola's best work or not but it is up there with his best.

The music is superb, the script is wonderful, I especially loved Robert Duvall's ""I love the smell of napalm first thing in the morning"", the story is always compelling and the film is brilliantly directed by Coppola. Apocalypse Now is long, but it is never boring.The acting is excellent, Marlon Brando especially is unforgettable, and Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper adeptly support him.

Sheen Shines In This Unique Classic,"Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.I still think Martin Sheen got ""dissed"" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout. It's one of the best narrations, if not THE best, I have ever heard in a movie. His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie.The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes, ones I have never forgotten, such as......Sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes on and on with strange scenes.That's not to say I enjoyed everything. No, there are a few very unpleasant scenes, such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (can't watch that anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheen's young stoned-out crew, and the crew is a little too goofy at times. Then, there is the huge amount of profanity, led by way too many f-words.So, there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this One thing for sure: it is a film you WILL remember!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypsenothing happensNow.,"* Just to get it out of the way: I viewed the Redux version of this film, and that MAY be the cause of some of my negative statements. I cannot say for certain either way.If you've ever been a member of a message board and you've read the thread about the last movie you watched, you'll know that 99% of the replies have one word or less beside the official score. For a long time, I wondered how that could be. I used to think, ""Don't these people have any more of an opinion other than 'good' or 'bad' or 'average'? They just wasted their lives watching a movie; couldn't they say more than just a score?"" It took me a few months to figure the entire situation out, but when I did, it made perfect sense. Most movieseven good moviesare so predictable and unoriginaleven if they're enjoyablepeople still lack any real, definitive feelings about them. They see a movie on a Friday night and by Saturday night they forgot they even watched it. As a writer myself, I know first-hand there is nothing worse than an indifferent audience, but it seems that sums up most of the American population. Why? Because of films like Apocalypse Now.Apocalypse Now opens up with a semi-interesting beginning. It misleads the viewer into thinking that it actually has some physiological depth, then completely drops all depth into the gutter by the 10-minute mark and never picks it up again. Despite what you were lead to believe, there is no plot here. Or let me rephrase that: there is a plot, but it drops it after the 20-minute mark and never picks it up again until the final 30 minutes. Everything between those two points is exactly what you expect for a clichéd war drama . . .Talking. It almost amuses me that an ""epic"" movie can have the flattest characters in cinema history, but the screenwriters always have them talk and talk as if they're actually interesting to listen to. In Apocalypse Now's case, the characters are ALL walking stereotypical war clichés with legs andunfortunately tongues. They're all simply nothing but dumb animals created to carry the pointless dialogue out. They talk so much it's downright nauseating. What are they talking about? I forgot, and I just finished the film 10 minutes ago. Their dialogue is all predictable copy/paste war dialogue; I do remember that much. Naked girls, guns, cliché monologues about life/deathall the stuff you've heard thousands of times. I was never a soldier in the Vietnam War, but I can pretty much assure you the real soldiers talked about more than these unimaginative movies give them credit for.Besides talking, what do you get in Apocalypse Now? Well, there are only two main action scenes in the entire movie, so you can cross balls-to-the-wall war action off your list of expectations. No, this nearly 4-hour long film focuses on shots of boats going down the river with soldiers talking, and not much else. There is no emotional experience here. There is no ""horror"", as the tagline proclaims. The most ""horror"" you get is a bunch of PG-rated war scenes and some eerie music as the soldiers move through fog. If the director had focused on the true horror of realistic war, I wouldn't have to be sarcastic when I say: How terrifying! Instead, however, the director focuses things we've seen before. Hundreds of times. He focuses on the copy/paste Hollywood-style war, not the truly gritty, dirty war. He doesn't rub your nose in the true horror of war; he pats you on the back and gives you generic conversation scenes.My point here: Apocalypse Now is one of the most boring movies even filmed. It's also safe and predictable, adding nothing whatsoever to the overdone war genre. It doesn't leave you thinking, ""My God, this is terrible!"" It leaves you thinking, ""My God, I could have done the laundry with that wasted time . . .""And that's all. That's all there is to say about this nearly 4-hour long movie. The entire synopsis of every major event from open to close could literally be told in two sentences of text. Sometimes you have to sit back and realize that most award-winning, critically acclaimed, ""classic"" films are nothing but hollow shells. They boast great acting and cinematography, but they have no story. No soul. No moral. No thrill. No point . . .This is why I blame films like Apocalypse Now for the indifference people have toward movies. These films are supposedly the best of the best, but at the same time they're completely forgettable to anyone who doesn't try their hardest to find pleasure in boredom in hopes of becoming an all-powerful FILM BUFF on some cheesy website. There is nothing wrong with being intellectual. There is something wrong with being pretentious and internally forcing yourself to love a film just because the critics do. And those are the only people who could give Apocalypse Now a perfect score. Or even a mildly positive score.0/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now Redux is the definitive film of the Vietnam War.,"This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the ""war is hell"" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the final segment of the journey with Brando, which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness, to be rather boring. I finally got around to seeing Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws have been taken care of. Redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance now seems full and complete, perhaps rather less mysterious, but much more profound. Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled. It's great to spot a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. If you've never seen this film, skip the original and head straight for Redux. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Redux was necessary to tell entire story,"I believe most if not all the extra scenes Coppola added were needed in Apocalypse Now Redux. Each scene I believe tells an important truth about life, death, and the horrors of war. The playboy camp is important, and it does not interfere with the the main story. The engine of the boat is broken, so they have to stop for a while to fix it. At that point, Willard makes the decision to trade fuel for sex. This is not out of Willard's character, because he seems rather charitable throughout most of the story. The scene between Lance and Chef with the girls is important because the viewer becomes those characters, and the scene itself is a game in which the girls are saying something important about exploitation, yet their naked bodies distract the viewer from this important enlightenment, just like Lance and Chef are oblivious to the same fact.The french plantation is also important because it helps give the view of the Vietnam war from the perspective of a neutral party not involved in the war. The scene with Willard and the french woman was implored to somewhat help Willard find out who he really is on the inside. Which also explains why he's nice and brutal at the same time.The Scene where Kurtz is reading Time magazine to Willard is meant to show the fallacy of propaganda. Despite the terrible outcome of the Vietnam War, the paper media was rather hesitant to show that. It is also parallel to today's ongoing war in Iraq, where there is a conflict between what is actually happening, and what is being told to the people what is happening.Over all, Apocalypse Now is a story about how and why we lost the War. It is also a story about going down the river of life, and stopping at the horrors and happiness along the way. The entire movie is a metaphor and the movie itself it filled to the brim with philosophical lessons about life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A little overrated, but pretty good----7/10","I started watching Apocalypse Now with all the acclaim it has received over the years in the back of my mind. I learned a long time ago with 2001: A Space Odyssey that just because a movie is regarded as a classic doesn't mean i will like it at all. I sat down to watch the Redux (it was the only version i could get but i'm sure the overall film is the same) and fortunately, Apocalypse Now is better than 2001, but it is not a great movie.The film stars Martin Sheen as an Army captain who is sent into deep into the jungles of Vietnam to take down a decorated general (Marlon Brando) who went mad and barricaded himself. He rides on a boat with a squad of desensitized soldiers down a river. Along for the ride is a barely legal youngster (Laurence Fishburne), a would-be chef (Frederick Forrest) and a stern driver (Albert Hall). Everybody in the cast does a great job, and the ride down the river is eerily calm with random spurts of violence which makes for a mostly exciting movie. There is also a great supporting role by Robert Duvall as a hard-ass commander who is a overzealous fan of surfing.The movie really slows down, however, when the squad comes across a French family living in a nice house in the middle of the jungle. It really doesn't do much for the story and it seems to get forgotten in the later parts of the movie. Also, the ending is slow and just strange. I heard there was originally supposed to be a huge battle, which i would have preferred.For movie fans, Apocalypse Now is a must-see, because most people like it a lot, but for some it is a pretty good war movie that's worth a look.---7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Possibly the most ambitious film ever made...,"Francis Coppola's descent into madness back in the late 1970's was all about APOCALYPSE NOW, one of the most incredible pieces of art ever placed on the screen.  It is violent, beautiful, ugly, and damn dark at times.  As a war film, APOCALYPSE NOW does not move me anywhere near the way PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did.  Those two pictures deal with war in a more combative, realistic way.  You grow and bond with the troupes in those flicks.  Here, you are engulfed in complete madness, something that seems apart from actual war.  It is more of a morality play into the soul and our ""hearts of darkness"" than a war film.Do I think Coppola made a mistake trying to base a story about the Vietnam War on Joseph Conrad's fictional ""Heart of Darkness""?  Sure, and I think he feels that way too.  Vietnam and the U.S involvement in the war has nothing to do with what Coppola was trying to do.  He once said ""My film IS Vietnam,"" referring to APOCALYPSE, but is it really? Not at all.  What results is unbelievably hard to assess except to say it is sheer brilliance. It transcends the horrors of war and seemed more of a personal film with Martin Sheen representing each of us as a complex human being on an impossible mission.  It is like traveling to Hell and back, many scars obtained, many feelings drowned out.Everyone who knows a dime about movies, knows the battle itself it was to make this ambitious film.  So many images burn into memory: nepalm explosions to the tune of the Door's ""The End""; Wagner blaring from speakers placed on some U.S. helicopters about to blow up a Vietnamese village; a soldier surfing to the Stone's ""Satisfaction""; the final ritualistic slaughter we witness during the film's dreary ending.  This is all fantasy. The war is nowhere to be found in these and multiple other sequences. Vietnam is merely a backdrop to display a truly insane trip up a river where one clearly defined character (Sheen as Willard) meets a fuzzy character (Brando as Kurtz) and no real resolutions are found.  It is the trip that does it for us.Wondrously eerie sights, sounds, and experiences pulsate throughout APOCALYPSE NOW and the first three quarters of the film are perfect.  Under the conditions Coppola and crew were working under, it is no wonder they had no ending.  Brando truly ruins what Sheen, in what is probably the most underrated performance of the 70's as ""Willard"", had done to the point of arrival at Kurtz' compound.  What the hell is Brando talking about?  At least Sheen comes through at the end giving us a hint as to what the journey meant to him.This film ranks way high on my list because of the mystery of it all and the absolute audacity with which Coppola paints his descent into madness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Excellent and boring at the same time,"Excellent movie, in a way top-quality sociology textbook is excellent. Acting 10/10, directing 10/10, all technical aspects are top quality, dialogues, monologues, layering of the story and depth of the message this movie brings... and at the same time, it is painfully boring to watch that I fell asleep five or six times and then I was snapping out and rewinding and watching further, and the only thing that forced me to endure till the end is its reputation of one of the greatest movies of all time. The film may be excellent in many aspects but it failed in one very important thing - to hold viewers' attention for over three hours. If it was a bit shorter or if it was made as a mini-series for example, maybe I would enjoy it more, but this way I give it 10/10 for quality and 2/10 for interestingness.

Jarring and to be endured rather than enjoyed,"This movie is considered ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"" and selected for preservation and it is not a ""bad"" film, rather an overambitious, creepy, self-indulgent and slow-moving one.I saw it the first time as a young woman and I was totally unimpressed, so much that I had no idea who the actor playing Willard was, his acting being so unimpressive. For me it was a muddled story of a bunch of unpleasant soldiers in a very hostile location. Brando was a mumbling cipher and I exited the cinema thinking I'd rather watched something else.I had recently the chance of watch the Redux and my opinion didn't change much, except now I know Martin Sheen plays Willard, but he definitely looks spaced out and his performance is flat, probably because he was fighting alcoholism and bad health and his heart wasn't in it (literally and figuratively). I also could barely recognise a teenage, pimply Fishburne doing - I guess - his best as an overexcitable gunner's mate for which I had zero sympathy since he exterminates a bunch of civilians. The other main characters, all seemed overstressed and freaking out, understandably given the circumstances.Some of the sequences are indeed impressive, such as the helicopter attack, with or without the Valkyrie soundtrack, even if I found more interesting other minor moments, such as the boat passing by sinister plane wreckages along the course of the disastrous journey. On the whole though, the film is very slow, with overlong, useless sequences like the initial one with Willard doing weird stuff and punching a mirror, lots of staring in silence at the creepy jungle, etc...The soundtrack is suitably disturbing, so as to make the experience thoroughly unpleasant... and Brando.. well, my opinion did not change a bit.. he was a bloated, overrated, mumbling, fat man who should have given up acting years earlier and his pseudo-philosophical gibberish was intolerable.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

He teaches us that in order for civilzied human beings to survive an onslaught of barbarians, you have to immerse yourself...defeat your own humanity. And then, when you have defeated the barbarian, you look around...and you are not human any more. In essence, the barbarian wins by forcing this sacrifice on civilized warriors. I left the theater in amazement that such a topic was even thought of for cinematic art. I got it just about everyone else missed it. And I felt contempt for those around me in the leaving crowd who were complaining they were disappointed in the film. They completely missed the point. Now, civilized people are faced again with a decision against barbarians who saw peoples heads off on TV. Will we immerse ourselves and our humanity to do what we must to survive...or will we surrender to the alternative if we don't? Is a surrender to barbarians as bad as becoming one of them? I think everyone should review ""Apocalypse Now"" once again because we are about to find out.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

This film captured the DESPERATION more than any other!!,"I was there. No, not on the Mung River, but I did venture into the highlands from time to time, where things were quite savage. The Mung and the Montangiards allied themselves with the US out of sheer hatred for Charlie and the NVA, not because they loved us so much. I spent most of my time in the 4th Inf. Div. I remember a point at which all of declared ""we're dead already, so what can hurt us?"" In Vietnam, not AA, one learned the true meaning of ""one day at a time"". A ""wake up"" was a victory. One night, several of us whose time grew short gathered at about 5 PM on a hot, dry season day for cold beer and some smoked weed. A new-be came in and someone tossed him a beer (normally, we would have chased him out - ""new-bes to themselves""). He took a pull and then said, ""technically, we're still on duty. What if they catch us?"" A buddy of mine, drunk and stoned already, replied, ""What're they gonna do? Send us to Vietnam?"" That wrapped it all up for me. As Morrison's song ""The End"" said, ""desperately in need of some stranger's hand, in this DESPERATE land"". It was indeed, my readers, the ""worst place in the world"". Once there, nothing procedural could tough one at all - only a bullet, mortars or mines. Enough written!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Fighting Insanity with Insanity,"This comment is for the original cut, Not the Redux version.The myth of the ""Good War"" still persists, that there can be nobility in the horrendous acts committed in the service of Right. Francis Coppola took upon himself the task of exploring and refuting this notion, and found entry into this harrowing terrain by way of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness.""In the novel, commercial interests drive the British empire into the depths of the African jungle, and just as deeply into Britian's own severely corrupted soul. The ambitions of a ""civilized"" people have supplanted all notions of decency, Christianity, humanity. In the novel the inescapable corrupting force is the savage ivory trade. The African natives have been reduced to dispensable pawns, fortunate to receive even the most brutal treatment from their colonial masters. This horrendous industry supports a contentedly oblivious Empire. In the film it's the Vietnam war that inexorably disfigures all its participants. And for the great director, the irresistible flame of destruction is his film. Coppola's river of decent became Time, as a projected 15 week shoot in the jungle sprawled to more than 250 grueling days. Repeatedly prolonged by an ongoing brutal guerrilla war, severe monsoon weather, and the near fatal heart attack of Martin Sheen, the shoot evolved into a treacherous marathon, pushing everyone involved beyond their limits.In the film the character of Kurtz functions as the ideal civilized fighting man: educated, decorated, refined, virile, charismatic, brilliant, formidable. In the novel and perhaps more importantly, Kurtz is an artist; ""essentially a great musician,"" a journalist, a skilled painter, and ""a universal genius."" Coppola, too, is something of a universal genius; a larger than life character of enormous talents and capacities. Though we are ostensibly given access to his personal beliefs through the narrations of Capt. Willard, I suspect that Francis more deeply identifies with Kurtz. After all, Coppola had in fact become a renegade demigod leading a ragged army in the jungle, defying all authority, ruthlessly executing his own brand of creativity.Studio execs like to consider themselves Highly Principled Creatives. But, in the face of Francis' truly uninhibited, honest excesses they proved themselves to be timid sheep by cutting his budget. They had been complicit in creating the monstrous ego of Coppola and had profited hugely with his ""Godfather"" franchise. But they lost their nerve when they saw what was reflected in the bizarre mirror that Francis was assembling in that Philippine jungle. There were more than a few Studio execs that wanted the director terminated with extreme prejudice. This is perhaps the film's most salient point; that the Enterprise can only be corrupt because its Sponsors are corrupt. And more so, the Sponsors are further corrupted by the Enterprise. Vicious cycle. In the film the home office honchos wanted Col. Kurtz dead because his actions were revealing to them the folly of their own ways. Proof of their depravity is their need to have a great American soldier assassinated. As for Coppola, the Studio was embarrassed by the accurate picture he was painting of their industry; bloated, self-serving, and unprincipled.Francis commented at the film's Cannes preview that its production was so overwhelming that ""(it) is not about Vietnam, it IS Vietnam."" The herculean effort is evident in every frame. Not an instant passes without a heightening sense of ominous doom. Each klik up the Mekong into Cambodia is a slowly tightening tourniquet on the throat, breath barely moving over dry lips. The aerial battle scenes are absolutely the most grandly choreographed tableaux of grace and destruction ever put to film; an utterly Grotesque Opera. Everything is over-sized, disproportionate, absurd. And most disorienting of all is Brando, himself.Col. Kurtz (kurtz is German for short) is ill, weakened, compromised, but Brando's creation manages to tower above all else. He seems to be very gently rocking in a wind; a massive ancient sequoia listing to and fro on the verge of a mighty, awesome collapse. Brando/Kurtz is doubly mesmerizing because we only glimpse him in deep shadows and stark profiles. Accounts of the shoot explain that Brando arrived on location at nearly 300 pounds and felt very self conscious of his size, so Francis devised the high contrast lighting to conceal and appease the star. It's a fortuitous concession because it only magnifies his intense psychological presence. It's as though Kurtz is played by the spectre of Brando.War has long been a compelling topic for films. The visual spectacle and pyrotechnics serve the film medium well. The eternal theme of good versus evil is elegantly displayed against a backdrop of chaos and mayhem. The poignant interplay of suffering and sacrifice, the glory of selfless duty to a country that has our best interest at heart. What 'Apocalypse Now"" attempts is the complete negation of these values. These outdated ideals are so hollow, so feeble compared to what the tender human mind experiences under the influences of war. There is nothing good in war. There is nothing good as a result of war. Even when participation becomes necessary, there is nothing to be gained from war but loss. And what is most lost is our sanity, our humanity. Kurtz's ""Horror"" is not of what he has witnessed in country, but in the hypocrisy of Society and the behavior of the ""Civilized"".(Important Note: Redux is valuable as an example of how important good editing is. It contains additional scenes that help flesh out the history of Vietnam and the conflict, and attempts to make more human the star characters, but succeeds only in disrupting the rhythm and flow of the original masterpiece. The specifics of the Vietnam war are irrelevant to the larger theme of ""War's"" madness, and feels like a detour. Making Capt. Willard more personable only undercuts the tension that builds along his ""journey"" up the river. See the original cut first.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"The Horror, The Horror...","Colonel Kurtz: ""The horror, the horror"".Sums the film up perfectly. A pretty disturbing journey into war, madness and the dark side of the human soul, Apocalypse, Now managed to unsettle me several times. At one point, I resented the main character and more or less everyone on the boat. Later on, I felt repulsed and sympathetic for their eventual fates, particularly Chef (who is the character I didn't really resent at any point). The film really succeeds in drawing the viewer into this horrific journey, and the mind of Kurtz himself. The echoing between Kurtz and Willard was very well done, to the extent I wouldn't have been surprised if Willard took Kurtz place (which didn't happen, which makes a lot of sense really).

Brando ruins a superb movie,"This film could have been one of the best films ever made but Brando ruins it and is largely responsible for the weak ending. The film is a superbly photographed, surrealistic and dream-like odyssey of Captain Willard. Martin Sheen is outstanding. The bizarre, weird, horrible and morbidly funny intertwine themselves so skillfully that you almost feel like you are there. One of the quotes always remembered about this movie is ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"". But when Duval says ""Charlie can't surf!"" That does it for me. When Willard gets to where Kurtz is it feels like one of those extremely bad dreams where you have been on a long search and you are dog tired and scared to death.But when we get to Kurtz he seems inadequate and not even close to what you are led to expect. The last words he utters are ""The horror....The horror"". The horror is Brando's weak personna and lacklustre performance. The ending is less than satisfactory even with Kurtz ""terminated with extreme prejudice.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Atmospheric yet aimless,"I watched the Redux version of this film, which has a notoriously bloated runtime and a lack of pacing. This is apparent from the start of the film as banal scenes drag on without much of a sense of importance. The film only picks up as we encounter a disaffected colonel who is only interested in surfing, an iconic scene that shows off all the rogue personalities involved. This motley crew of incompetent, apathetic and impulsive soldiers head off on an ill defined path to wreak havoc and expose the futility of the American war effort. This thematic concern wears itself thin and becomes totally devoid of substance as soon as Kurtz is discovered. Despite its dark and symbolic content, the film appears to have nothing to offer beyond that point, meandering about with no resolution.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

He's suppposed to be menacing and esoteric but just comes across as the shambling, alzheimers-suffering, semi-delerious idiot that he then was in real life.You don't care about any of the characters, not even Martin Sheen's.

Great interpretation of a good book to deliver points on the nature of war,"In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz.  Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy.  Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad.  Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny.  However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.It is a film everyone knows, and a `making of' story that is familiar to everyone on some level.  The problems with the military, with destroyed sets right down to Keitel walking off set to be replaced by Martin Sheen who then had a near complete breakdown during filming.  However the story itself is what keeps this so popular.  The original book is set in Victorian times and is similar only in the concept of travelling up a river and confronting something dark and changed in the shape of Kurtz.  The modern day spin on it makes it even more interesting as it looks at the madness that comes with power within war.The journey itself is at times comic and at other times brutal.  The overall feeling is one of soldiers not knowing why they are fighting or who they are fighting.  The feeling of confusion and fear is inherent in the film and is very well delivered.  Willard's journey never fails to grip and is interesting on whatever level you watch it  whether it be for the famous set pieces or for the underlying themes.The performances are excellent.  Sheen has never been better and now seems so distant from his character that he is a different person.  While some of the emotion on screen was real, he does a great job as our guide through the journey.  The best performance comes from a surprising source Brando. Despite the fact that he was difficult, horribly over weight and hadn't learnt his lines, his eerie performance is still haunting.  His mumbling and reasoning in the shadows show that he may be touched by madness but, in the context of war, he is also touched by cold logical reasoning.  Likewise Dennis Hopper fits in well despite his stoned demeanour.  The support cast include some names as Albert Hall, Harrison Ford, Forrest and a young Larry Fishburne.Overall this will remain a classic on many levels.  The film itself is great and full of spectacle, the story of the making itself is interesting, the performances are wonderful despite everything and the fact that it has other themes makes it even better.  As an war movie it is great simply because it isn't about the war it IS war  in the words of Coppola `it isn't about Vietnam, it is Vietnam, it's how the Americans were in Vietnam.  We were in the jungle, we had too much money, too much equipment and, little by little, we went insane'.  Classic film on so many levels.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An incredible masterpiece,"If you haven't watched this masterpiece yet, you missed one of the deepest experiences that a movie could provide. This movie is about war, about politics, about the beauty and the horror, about the human nature in itself. Many have written extensively about it, so I will rather comment on one certain issue:The Redux version:Whilst there exist almost only negative comments about it, I think it is even better then the original. The Redux version has been released many years after the original and contains 49 minutes of new footage (taken from the original materials). Coppola explained, he felt the necessity of making this version. Mainly for the fact, that the original version was cut in an atmosphere of extreme pressure and desperation (read about the making if you don't know why). They cut the huge amounts of material to some simple format, leaving out scene after scene in the desperate attempt to make sense of something that could not make one certain sense. The Redux version was meant to give the original some of the hectically cut out footage back.The new scenes contain nothing that would change the story or meaning of the old movie, instead they either continue the story parts in more details or open up completely new scenes. There is the continuation of the famous Playmate scene for example, showing the perversion and insanity that briefly shines through in the original when the soldiers are heading for the playmate stage. The logical continuation takes place when Captain Willard and company meet the playmates stranded further up the river, being delivered to their goodwill.Then there are some small additions, like a really intense close up of Marlon Brando, whose acting in this movie is legendary! You will hardly find anything to criticize about these small additions, you could perhaps argue about the changes in background music, but this is mainly a question of individual taste, since the spirit of the music did hardly change. Its still a psychedelic mix of synthesizer sounds and music by the doors.Now other things, like the rather infamous scene on the French plantation, leave more room for debates. This scene, which was completely left out from the original, opens up a new story part, taking place on a French plantation. In my opinion, this scene added much to the movie's atmosphere, fitting perfectly into its beautiful psychedelic style. Also it was making even clearer that this movie is not simply about war: ""There are two of you, don't you see ? One that kills and one that loves."" This is exactly general Kurtz's dilemma: being caught in a world of insane double morality, looking for a way to find a ""true"" way of acting, Kurtz finally decides to break out by choosing his role as murder, by abandoning the role of jurisdiction in his (a)moral world. At the same time this sentence points to an even deeper conflict inside human nature or the world itsself: The existence of unimaginable horror and beauty next to each other. The desperate situation everyone faces who gets to see both.Overall, the new scenes do not contain anything that would really change the old movie (whilst there was hardly anything removed from it), whilst in my opinion they add much to it. The movie is longer, it has an even more epic character and becomes an even more breath taking psychedelic trip trough the dark corners of human nature and morality. If you really hate the Redux version, ask yourself why exactly. I think it is pure perfection, as long as you don't judge it simply for the fact that it is a changed version of one of the best movies ever made. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
a brilliant tale of a US army captain being sent to kill a legendary Green Berret colonel.,"Francis Ford Coppolla is a genius,a brilliant mind that should never stop working on movies like this.This is an absolute blinder of a film.Just yesterday i was looking for some good movies to watch until i rediscovered one of the best ever made...Apocalypse Now.It is the most gut-wrenching movie that i have seen.It is a very disturbing piece of ART.The story of a Captain who was secretly assigned to a mission to assassinate a legendary Green Berret colonel Walter E. Kurtz who has gone insane due to the horrors of the war and set himself up as God among a local tribe.This movie truly explains the horrors of war at it's worst.IF anyone out there is looking for a mind-blowing war film,see Apocalypse Now first....then move on to Saving Private Ryan,Platoon etc.As for the acting,it was magnificent.Martin Sheen (Willard) gave an absolute gem of a performance.As for Marlon Brando(Kurtz),what can be said of him.....he is flawless.Though he played a small role,it was highly important and brilliant.All in all....if u miss this movie,u missed something exceptional.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Madness.,"Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has, killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?Any movie that can start out with The Doors' ""The End"" is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. I can't think of anything better for it to be set to, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam, the ultimate destination of which is murder. Through it's use of music and score alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here.An overall great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. I just don't like Fishburne, ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the entire film, as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf. Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take away anything though, it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey, the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact, that's the entire point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz' to go completely mad.A big war movie lover, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I've said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War....so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless...even if after having most recently view AN I think it's a tad better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given. As a fellow reviewer has previously stated, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Wild chaos,"Apocalypse Now is a strange anomaly in the history of cinema. It's a complete disaster of a film, that ran into every catastrophe and hurdle imaginable, and failed on almost every level (just ask Francis Ford Coppola himself). And yet, it's also one of the best films ever made.Apocalypse Now's wild chaos stands in complete contrast with Coppola's three previous films - The Godfather parts 1 and 2, and The Conversation, all of which were precise, complete and, especially the first one, practically flawless. Apocalypse Now, on the other hand, is filled with flaws; it's messy, inconsistent, at times incoherent, and large parts of it appear (and often are) completely improvised. This is, of course, the one film on which Coppola, having financed most of it himself, had complete creative control. It's the film that brought the age of the auteur to its logical end, and it's also the beginning of the end for that period; one year later the auteur was finally killed by Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate. But while Heaven's Gate is a pompous, pretentious, self-indulgent mess, out of the chaos of Apocalypse Now emerged one of the strongest creations in cinema history.No description of Apocalypse Now can really capture what it's about; it can be said to be a film about the Vietnam war, or a loose adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but it's far beyond either one. It's an exploration of the human psyche when it's taken to the most extreme situations of stress and violence - the Vietnam war is used as the setting for that. But, as can be seen in the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"", the production itself qualifies as well. Both Coppola and the cast explored the full range of human emotions on the film, and that's what makes it more powerful and more timeless than war films like Platoon and The Deer Hunter. Apocalypse Now is the human condition. As Coppola himself said - it's not about the Vietnam war, it IS the Vietnam war. Every failing the film had during production only helps create the chaos and distress that make it so unforgettable and such a landmark in cinema history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The most perfect version and superb on IMAX! A must-buy for fans!,"I don't rate a movie as a 10 but this is the closest I've come to doing that.As someone who has watched the original, the redux and the 6 hour workprint versions, I can tell you this is the most perfect version of this classic.
Firstly with Dolby atmos and 4K,it looks and sounds spectacular on IMAX save for the first 10 minutes for technical reasons,I'm told.
This version is shorter than the redux but longer than the original at 183 minutes. But importantly, this is the most cohesive and watcher-friendly version.It is not just that some scenes were added but importantly a lot of small changes made to a lot of scenes which makes the narrative smoother and a very pleasing descent into the madness towards the end.
This version makes the entire role of Bob Duvall so so clear and perfect;Brando is given exactly the right amount of scenes and the unnecessary scene with the playboy playmates included in the redux is axed which is perfect for the movie.The french plantation scene is included but edited and added to make it so much more coherent with the story. Some scenes at the last bridge on the river are also edited to show the madness but not drag the movie down.

No. You really have to prepare yourself for this.

Not your typical Vietnam War movie...,"Now, believe it or not, but I have actually never seen the 1979 movie ""Apocalypse Now"" before now in 2023. Yeah, I know, a mistake on my account. But I just never gotten around to sitting down to watch it. Of course I was familiar with the movie, but the movie's cover just never really appealed to me enough to make me give it a go.But as I had the chance to sit down and watch the movie here in 2023, of course I did so. And I have been curious to see if the movie is as good as I have been told.Writers John Milius and Francis Ford Coppola put together an entertaining script and storyline for the movie. And I have to say that I was adequately and genuinely entertained by the movie. Well, right up to the point where Captain Willard (played by Martin Sheen) got to the camp in Cambodia where Colonel Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) was waiting. The movie sort of lost its momentum there and changed direction quite dramatically, and not in a sense that appealed much to me.Something that really impressed me about the movie was the cast ensemble, because they had a lot of amazing talents on the cast list, with the likes of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishbourne, Dennis Hopper, Scott Glenn, Harrison Ford and others.""Apocalypse Now"" looked and felt like a Vietnam War movie, although quite a different approach to making such a movie from director Francis Ford Coppola. But it was definitely an interesting take on the subject, and it made for a watchable and enjoyable movie.The downside to this 1979 movie was the length. Running at nearly 180 minutes, it was a tad too long in my opinion, and could have benefitted from either a trim or more added action.My rating of ""Apocalypse Now"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Sheen is something to behold and it wasn't until I witnessed this film I understood the emotion he could convey on screen. You could say Hopper, Duvall and Brando have almost cameo like rolls... and you'd be wrong. They were used to their potential and you have to disregard the fact that their screen time was limited. This film is a brilliant spectacle. Hardly ever does a person examine life on the scale of life and after seeing Apocalypse Now, you will never be able to see war on the scale of war. It is made up of actions much more insignificant. Coppola saw it, Sheen acted it, I felt it.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The horror, The horror","We have to wait until there is only a quarter of the running time left before Marlon Brando comes on as Colonel Kurtz. But it's worth the wait to see him give a fabulous performance as a decorated US Army Colonel who has gone over the hill and off the deep end.Until that time we watch Martin Sheen as an intelligence officer given an assassination assignment to terminate Brando. Brando as a soldier did his job well, too well maybe. Now he's set himself up with an army of Montagnard tribespeople as some kind of potentate deep in the jungle across into Cambodia where Americans aren't supposed to be in any event.Francis Ford Coppola gave this film almost a surreal quality, it gets more surreal as the PT boat aka swift boat journeys up river to the Kurtz compound. It starts with the real war enough, but even that is a Sam Peckinpah like violence ballet with Robert Duvall replete with western cavalry hat leading a raid on a Viet Cong stronghold at the river mouth with the strains of Wagner's dance of the Valkyries. Duvall loves his aroma of napalm in the morning.I liked the river journey when Sheen sets out on that PT boat with the ever present mist over the river. It has Hitchcock like suspense, you never know what they will encounter and neither do they. You also see what war has done to the crew in that kind of atmosphere never knowing when they might meet death with an enemy who doesn't operate in the traditional ways of war.I was lucky enough to see the Redux version with the sequence of Christian Marquand and his plantation. It was cut for length in the original film, but it's worth seeing now. All of those countries used to be called French Indo-China, still remember it on Atlas maps when I was a lad. He's got his manor house there and it's home to him and nobody is going to push him out. An attitude similar to people who followed Ian Smith in Northern Rhodesia when the rest of Africa was shaking off colonialism. I'm glad the scenes have been restored.Brando is only in briefly, but his performance as the cracker doodle, but perceptive Kurtz is something to see. Also note that Scott Glenn previously sent on Sheen's mission and freelance reporter Dennis Hopper have become Brando acolytes and also standout in their cameos.Apocalypse Now is not the best Vietnam War film. My own preference is Casualties Of War. But it's definitely worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

One of the best war films ever made.,"I watched the Redux version several years ago and, while I loved certain parts of it, it dragged for me in some other scenes and I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would. Since I hadn't seen the theatrical version prior to this Hall, I was curious as to how well I would respond to it. I expected for it to be an easier watch than the Redux version, but what I wasn't expecting was for it to trump my own expectations. To get it out of the way, yes, the animal cruelty scenes (the water buffalo being killed and the rough handling of the dog) are hard to watch and indefensible, but other than that, this film is truly excellent and is quite possibly the best representation of a descent into madness I've ever seen. I've seen many critics argue that the journey to Kurtz's compound is a metaphorical descent into madness and that was what stood out the most to me while watching this film. The first stop with Lt. Col. Kilgore shows the first stage of this descent. On the surface, it's a fairly conventional raid scene (albeit one which is technically outstanding), but that Kilgore orders some soldiers to surf during the raid and expresses his gratitude towards a Vietnamese soldier who fought in spite of being seriously wounded adds an undercurrent of surrealism to to that sequence. The second stop where hundreds of soldiers watch a Playboy show at a supply depot shows the next stage of this descent. Many soldiers in that scene yell sexual remarks at the women and try to rush the stage, showing more of their unhinged behavior. The third main stop at a remote U. S. army outpost expands on this descent. Several soldiers seem desperate to get into their boat in an attempt to return home and the other soldiers in the outpost seem to have no idea who their commanding officer is. There doesn't seem to be much order in that outpost and the whole scene maintains a hellish atmosphere. And, of course, Kurtz's compound is the final stage of this descent. I love how his monologues in that scene feel simultaneously avant-garde and narrative-driven at the same time. Though Kurtz appears to be talking about great insights in his speeches, half of what he says doesn't make any sense. Topped with how his face is either partially or entirely obscured in darkness throughout those scenes makes them some of the best movie monologues I've ever seen. Topped with some excellent cinematography and some outstanding soundtrack choices (Ride of the Valkyries and The End), this film is definitely a top 10 war film for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A cold, questioning, twisted ,incomprehensible masterpiece.","The Vietnam war genre has become proliferated throughout the cinematic world. The repertoire of Vietnam films is vast. Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon. Yet Apocalypse Now is not only the best Vietnam film, it is the best war film I have ever seen and ranks as one of the most mesmerising films ever created.Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's superb novella: 'Heart of Darkness'; Coppola's adaptation is both reasonably faithful and demandingly original. In a way, this is a reinvented and rethought version of Conrad's book. Coppola is subtle with his particular references to the book.Coppola's daring direction and chilling music makes this film an experience to say the least. You experience the horrors of the Vietnam War as the alpha-male group of soldiers trudge up this river famously described as a snake uncoiled in Conrad's novella. Apocalpse Now is also one of my favourite beginnings of a film. The chilling blend of REM and the jungle's exploding in flames was the best possible way to open the film.I would love to say what exactly this film is about in a deeper manner but its just too difficult. It raises issues about the morals of the war, the treatment of soldiers and the government's view of the soldiers.Apocalypse Now is an astonishing war film.

Redux?,"Contrary to Martin Zimmermann above I would actually believe the Redux version very much adds to the development of the characters and the film as such ... there are as far as I remember three scenes added to the original. The first add (the mugging of the surfboard) shows some of the characters (Lance but also Kilgore) as the kids they actually are, plus the humor adds to the shock of the upcoming disturbing scenes ... The second scene (the tête-à-tête with the bunnies/hookers) is quite surreal and reminds me a bit of ""Catch 22"" ... it also explains why Chief Phillips is so bullheaded in frisking the Sampan (release of tension) ... The third added scene (the visit of the french plantation) is somewhat more difficult ... on one hand the dialog is highly valuable (seems like nobody is willing to learn from the mistakes of others) on the other hand the plot is not very credible ... personally, I would have put the scene at the very end of the movie, where the impact would gain more gravitas: once Willard takes a shower the dirt seems to be washed away, however the stains remain though invisible ....",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Forever!,"When you think about a perfect film what comes to mind as far as what ingredients go into a perfect film? For me. Its atmosphere, pacing, and storytelling flow all set in an immersive environment.Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now has all those ingredients and then some. The premise is a streamlined and refined version of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, set during the Vietnam War instead of the Congo but all the key nuances and elements make it over with radiance.Depending on which cut you watch you're looking at running times pushing and exceeding 3 hours but no matter which version you watch, none of them feel long. Pacing and flow is brilliant and should be what every aspiring filmmaker and editor studies. Acting is spot on with every character and their motivations credible and believable. From Martin Sheen to Dennis Hopper, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando...every actor gives it their best. Martin Sheen even had a heart attack during production. The score is minimalist but solid. I do really enjoy the unused David Shire score and hope that someday Coppola releases a cut with Shire's Moog-enriched score in place. Hell, someday I will insert it in myself.But what really works with Apocalypse Now is how it captures the war, the inhumanity of man and wraps it together with a big bow of irony. Is it all about one man's decent into insanity and, if so, who is really losing it? All of this is beautifully laid out in breathtaking cinematography unlike no other.Yes, regardless of which version you watch, Apocalypse Now is a perfect film.

"An excellent, dark, chilling classic","It's not a surprise this film is considered one of the best of all time. Right from the start it's compelling, pulling you right in, and as the story paces along it turns exhilarating.Right from the start the haunting, chilling atmosphere is built and never faults.

Those iconic opening words - ""Sh-t. Saigon."" - really stay with you, not like I've ever really experienced before.But the main point of brilliance is that fantastic scene where the napalm strike is called onto the beach. Not once with a film have I felt so excited and entertained, the whole sequence was heart-stopping. That alone was enough to give the whole film a ten-out-of-ten.But the excitement didn't stop there. As the story progresses, as we see more, more interest develops. The scenes with the calendar models and the soldiers meeting are compelling, giving us more of an insight of the characters. It's really more than JUST a war film.It goes without saying that Marlon Brando's performance was simply superb, as with all of his performances. But there isn't a single bad actor in the whole film.

"An ugly, uncompromisingly brilliant look inside of mankind and the war within themselves...","Apocalypse Now (1979, 2001)Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Albert Hall, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford.Twenty-five years ago, Francis Ford Coppola had created a ground-breaking masterpiece. It was called 'Apocalypse Now'. It was based on the novel Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, which was written in the late 1800's. It obviously wasn't about the Vietnam War, but instead was about a man named Kurtz in the jungles of Cambodia. Now that was a great example of film-making. Three years ago, they released an extended version called 'Apocalypse Now: Redux'.Captain Benjamin Willard is a man just waiting and urging for a mission. He is assigned one: To terminate (...with extreme prejudice) Kurtz, a former Colonel who is a leader of a tribe in a Cambodian jungle. Willard travels with a group of soldiers: Chef, Chief, Lance, and Clean. He meets surf-crazed Lt. Col. Kilgore, who leads the military during an island attack. When Willard arrives on Kurtz's island, he finds that Kurtz has set up his own army. While learning about why Kurtz despises the war, Willard drifts further and further from reality.'Apocalypse Now: Redux' gives us a version of the original with more detail. I thought that the original was outstanding, but adding almost an hour (49 minutes to be exact) of more footage made the film drag a bit.The acting is very good, especially from Sheen and Duvall. Brando gives a good performance. This wasn't his best performance (Last Tango in Paris and The Godfather come to mind),but it was very chilling. Other familiar faces include a very young Laurence Fishburne (18 years old!), Dennis Hopper, a younger Harrison Ford, and a cameo by R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) as a helicopter pilot. Duvall and Hopper give good comic relief. Coppola's direction is very good. Probably his best.The picture on 'Redux' is restored and looks better than ever. At times, I don't really consider it a war film because it doesn't focus on the Vietnam War. My favorite is the original, but watching 'Redux' was interesting. Fans of the original won't be disappointed by the film, even though we get no special features on the DVD but a trailer.'Redux' only has a few scenes added in. But they are long scenes. They don't really add much to the story, and don't have much meaning. However, it is good that they made a new version, to remind us of how good the original version was twenty-two years before.'Apocalypse Now' was one of the best films made about war. It is more like an anti-war film. It is like a personal journey to hell. It shows the power of a man, and how it effects others. It is one of the most unusual, brilliant, and yet bizarre films that I have ever seen. 'Redux' gives us a better look through Willard's adventure to keep his sanity.

WTF a Vietnam Movie based on an 1899 book,"In my opinion, most fans don't realize that this ""Vietnam War"" movie was conceptually based on an 1899 book called Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. The book depicts the ivory trade in Africa and is set in the Belgian Congo. The story follows a sailor traveling upriver to find an ivory trader named Kurtz, who is ill and being worshiped by the natives. To me, it seems like the writers added the Vietnam War theme to make it more marketable.Many reviews, in my view, are shallow-they treat this chaotic movie like it's some kind of profound documentary on Vietnam. Critics praise it as a ""masterpiece,"" but to me, it feels more like a disjointed, overhyped spectacle. Rather than offering real insight, I think it glorifies immature, reckless behavior, almost like it was made for people who equate chaos and destruction with power or strength.After the success of The Godfather, the next step seemed to be cashing in on another hit. What could be better than a movie packed with war, gratuitous violence, explosions, playboy bunnies, and rock and roll? To me, it feels like a fantasy tailor-made for audiences who want to believe this kind of behavior is cool or heroic.The production, in my opinion, was just as chaotic. On the set in the Philippines, the crew rented helicopters from a corrupt government, blew up anything they could, and even filmed the real killing of a water buffalo for shock value. To me, this choice was unnecessary and exploitative. While some argue the film is an anti-war statement, I find it hard to believe when so much gratuitous violence was used just to make it.As you can tell, I didn't like this movie. To me, it felt like a shallow excuse to show destruction and violence while pretending to be profound. The characters, in my view, acted like emotional teenagers with no depth, and the story seemed to revel in chaos. I think this movie appeals to the base immaturity of some viewers who want to believe this style of behavior is powerful or admirable, but to me, it's nothing more than a chaotic and empty fantasy.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Excellent tribute to Conrad...,"This film was incredibly well done, and the similarities to Conrad's Heart of Darkness were amazing, creating a similar message in the end. The first scene is everything: the cinematography was perfect, and The End by the Doors as the soundtrack worked eerily well. Lighting throughout the movie, especially surrounding the mysterious Kurtz (although it was needed) also worked well to establish the mood.Throughout the movie, we are encouraged to see that Kurtz' inhumanity likely stems from being put in a situation where he answers to (essentially) no one, where there are no rules, and where morals he thought he once had fell apart. Maybe, it is more the absence of ""civilization"" that leads to the ""civilization"" that encourages inhumane treatment. It is human nature that is at fault, not any individual or group. The encouragement of American society for Kurtz to act in this way also definitely had an effect on him, but this is also human nature in a way. Human nature includes the elite's love for power and their ability to send others off to do the dirty work as well as the quality of obedience in those ""others"". All of these are human biases, and it seems like only the people who have a great deal of self-awareness/control would be able to overcome them. Coppola's genius in Apocalypse Now encourages us to recognize that we all have darkness inside of us, but it is our ability to overcome this madness, even in the face of no authority or laws OR in the face of authority that is evidently incorrect, that is what matters. This movie, like Conrad's masterpiece, also raises the following questions: When to ""shield"" the truth? Who should do so? Does anyone have the right to do so? Should the public have full access to all knowledge? It makes sense to think that the general public is sometimes not in the position to make a good judgement call and that emotions would cloud our judgement. But this mindset is also dangerous for the people who ultimately make the call, as it places them on a pedestal that could then cloud their judgement. Hard question that we need to ask ourselves...There are also apparent differences between Apocalypse Now and Heart of Darkness. For example, in Heart of Darkness, the British Empire stands firm, with Conrad seeming to respect the British Empire endlessly. With such a positive view of the motherland, the implications in Heart of Darkness in terms of England seem to be that all is not yet lost and there is some hope for mankind after all. The film is entirely different; after watching it and learning of the Vietnam war, few people would dare to advocate for the US as a solution to any problem today. This then leads us to the opposite conclusion: that America has absolutely no right to put itself on a pedestal that creates 'good' in the world. And of course, in today's view, this idea is much more realistic and applicable. I appreciate that Coppola urges his audience to recognize that America is not some heaven and also to look back on history and our mistakes. This movie was very well done, with aspects like sound and editing coming together to create a masterpiece, and raises difficult questions that we must ask ourselves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Into the mind of madness.,"""Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable plugged straight into Kurtz"" that piece of dialogue from Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, sets the psychedelic tone for what is widely considered Francis Ford Coppola's most ambitious project. Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's novela Heart of Darkness, 'Apocalypse Now' tells the tale of decorated soldier Walter E Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, and the frightening journey of his assassin Captain Willard. Kurtz, who has abandoned his military obligation, has recruited an army of tribal locals deep in the heart of a war ravaged Cambodian jungle. He has in every sense of the word, gone insane. Just like Willard, we know very little of his enemy Colonel Kurtz, and as he descends further towards the Colonels compound, the more he learns about him, and most importantly, himself. As the two men collide, Kurtz's rants and confessions portray a ghost of somebody lost in time and space, reeling with pain and profound hurt, as we hear tales of a renegades life that put Willard's assumed past into some sort of moral perspective. Does Willard have the guts and instinct to carry out the responsibility placed upon him? One of the reason's why 'Apocalypse now' has a lasting legacy over other Vietnam war films is not only due to its cast, but it's director Francis Ford Coppola and his desire and will to defy modern convention and deliver one of motion pictures most analyzed and lorded movies from a near flawless and revolutionary period of cinema. To say Coppola had reached the peak of his creative and artistic powers would be a mere under statement, and to acknowledge the depth and underlying detail he has outlined can not only illustrate the brilliance of his film making psyche, but position the audience in the same chaotic realm as its cast and crew. We see the fanatic struggle of Captain Willard and we see the madness of Colonel Kurtz. The other essential character is the jungle itself, just like an actor, it transforms and evolves many times through out the movie. We first see it as a harmless estuary slowly bend into a tunnel toward hell. We also see a far more primitive tug of war between Willard and the jungle, a war that can only be won and lost in his own mind. 'Apocalypse now' is not a horror movie, but it is so much more frightening. The mark of a great film is it's power to defy categorization, and Coppola's 1979 masterpiece does just that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Stunning,"Last year at school, everyone was talking about this movie and everyone was saying how good it was so I had to see it. My friend burnt me it and I hated it, I thought it was boring. I was some what disenchanted after watching it expecting a really action packed movie. The first hour didn't disappoint but after that it was boring. I was only 15 then and I never really got over what a let down it was.So, for English I picked this film as a related text. This time I knew what to expect and this time I was really impressed and touched by the film. I think it had something with me being an age older. This time I actually listened to what they said and it made the story much more fascinating and bearable to watch, in fact it even moved quickly.The storyline of this film is very simple. Based on on the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who has lost all hope in humanity is given the unenviable mission of traveling up the Nang river in order to bring the wayward Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) under control. As the film progresses the viewer is confronted with numerous scenes raging from insanity to chaos, which not only shock, but make you reflect and sometimes even disturb you. An example is when they come to an outpost, the soldiers jump in the water screaming to be taken away from their perspective of hell. Another scene, is when Lance puts war paint on. When questioned about it he says ""they're everywhere"", which is ludicrous when you think about it, because he is not in the jungle and could easy been picked off in the boat.Some of the films concepts are hard to be grasped and I wont go into them here. Suffice to say, it is better left for you to find out yourself. Apocalypse Now is sometimes said to be an inaccurate film about Vietnam and that films like Platoon are more accurate. That is not true though. The film accurately shows Vietnam, as a place literally gone mad. A war without any purpose other than the evil motivations of politics and the army. It is hard for the characters and the viewer to find hope in this film, because in Vietnam, there was none for the soldiers. This film is beautiful it really shows what the human mind is capable of, and if you can understand it, you will be changed forever by this powerful and moving film.Simply STUNNING",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A marvelous bit of surrealist movie-making...,"This film is arguably one of the most important cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Based on the book ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad this movie is a provocative display of the Vietnam War and the surreal, yet utterly human experiences of its combatants. In the story, Lieutenant Willard (Martin Sheen) travels down a river to seek and assassinate the crazed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has isolated himself from U.S. forces in a remote outpost. As Willard gets closer and closer to his prey though, he finds himself idolizing and obsessing over the invisible, god-like figure of Kurtz rather than preparing to kill him.What sets this movie apart from other war movies is not its ""hell no, we won't go,"" theme that appears in films such as Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket,"" nor its ""no guts, no glory"" theme that appears in movies such as ""Patton."" Instead, it is its dreamlike portrayal of war as an experience which brings out our most savage, yet undeniably, our most natural tendencies. Everything from the soundtrack, to the screenplay, to the acting furthers the notion that every person who spends time in a war begins to understand the most basic of human desires, and learns to eliminate their consciences. And this, evidently, is ""the horror"" that Willard refers to throughout the film.The sweeping scenes of the blazing jungle, and the incessant whir of helicopter blades, are mere supplements to the brilliant performances of Brando, Sheen, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, and Dennis Hopper among others. This movie in itself is a dangerous odyssey, for it takes more than a clever film critic to truly understand its importance. The message is hidden deep in the jungle and takes a keen eye to divulge and appreciate. This is a movie about escape from civility, ""the end of our elaborate plan,"" and a descent into chaos and madness, the only question is, are you ready for the Apocalypse?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""A snail on the edge of a straight razor...""","Francis Ford Coppola's vision of Vietnam, seeing the eccentricities inherent in the horrors of war and also the indescribable visual beauty running parallel with all the ugliness. Martin Sheen plays an Army Captain who's been traumatized by his first tour of duty in Saigon; but, left without a family and haunted by memories of the jungles, he is almost anxious to accept a new mission: track down and kill a renegade Green Beret Colonel, a poetic martinet who has apparently lost his mind and is hiding out in the ""heart of darkness"". Elephantine production quickly gets out of hand, and Sheen seems to struggle with his wobbly, mushy character (he's rudderless throughout, acting mostly with his wide eyes). The locations and the rock music selections are impeccable, stamping the film with a distinctive (and artistic) mark, but Coppola loses his identity somewhere along this unseemly journey. ""Apocalypse Now"" has the look of genius, yet it could be a picture directed by any number of brazen auteurs. Some incredible supporting performances--including by Marlon Brando, as well as Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Dennis Hopper (who just evaporates) and Frederic Forrest--give the proceedings some muscle, but it's a wayward and occasionally woebegone picture, a war film that throws its punches in the dark like a blindfolded boxer. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Excellent Vietnam War film,"The film's opening scene alone is worth the price of the DVD - the haunting image of helicopters flying low over a jungle that is suddenly engulfed by an explosion of napalm is not easily forgotten, but Coppola's real genius lies in the the overlaying of a soundtrack that immediately evokes the time and place of these events - The Door's The End (surely the epitome of 60's psychedelia) providing a drugged-up anaesthetic to the violence of the images on the screen.Based on Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now follows an American soldier travelling upriver into the depths of a Vietnamese tribal culture which seems to become more and more savage. Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a confidential mission by the US army to eliminate Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz, once one of the finest officers the army had seen, has apparently lost all sense of reality and has gathered his own private Vietnamese army deep in the jungle.Early in Willard's mission we witness one of film's most powerful scenes; an attack by US helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village. We see the simple way of life in the village as the helicopters appear on the horizon, with their on-board loudspeakers blasting out Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. Robert Duvall's psychopathic US officer gives remorseless orders to gun down the women and blow up the bridges. This scene is starkly real yet magnificent to watch, and leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. Few films have portrayed the chaos and randomness of war so clearly or so shockingly.As Willard progresses further up the river the film becomes more and more surreal and foreboding, and we begin to realise that Kurtz has experienced something which has led to his 'madness'. This all becomes apparent in the philosophical, spaced-out ending in which Willard finally finds Kurtz's jungle sanctuary.Apocalypse Now should not be seen as an overview of the Vietnam War; it is instead a film about one man's journey into darkness, and about the people he meets and the events he witnesses on the way. There are no heroes in this film – just ordinary (and not so ordinary) people trying to survive the best way they can. It recognises that each soldier is different and that each has a story: one young soldier is shown dying while a letter from his mother is read aloud, another soldier screams hysterically as he forced to get off a helicopter and go into war, while Robert Duvall's character famously describes his love of 'the smell of napalm in the morning'. While the viewer is left in no doubt as to the horrors of war, Coppola does not set out to create a sentimental account of 'war being hell'.While immersed in the breathtaking sound and visuals I have to pinch myself to remember that this film was made in the 70s. It is still as technically spectacular as any film I have ever seen. Ignore the hype surrounding the gimmick of 3D; the realness of the visuals in Apocalypse Now has a far stronger effect. The film is one of the most important and pioneering in history; without it the modern war film would be very different.It seems a pity that every film more than a few months old is confined to the small screen. Is cinema not the ultimate way to view a film? Imagine only being able to read books or listen to songs released in 2011. There are dozens of forgotten films screaming out for a re-release, from Once Upon a Time in the West to Blade Runner. The magic of acting legends and veteran directors should be seen the way it was meant to be seen. Do not miss the re-release of Apocalypse Now for the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Wonderful Vietnam Film,"This is probably the most famous anti-war movie of all times. It's in the IMDb top50, but definitely not in my top50. However, I still thought it was a good film. Especially Robert Duvall (Kilgore) succeeds in displaying the insanity of war as he treats combat like a painting, plays classic music to the horrendous scenes and has his guys surfing at the same time. Excellent portrayal. He was the much better Coppola reunion in this movie and the Golden Globe and BAFTA wins were absolutely deserving. And when there is no visual horror...horror (e.g. A severed head or the death of the character played by the very young Laurence Fishburne), we hear people talking about it, for example Kurtz' story on severed children's arms.The redux version of the movie runs for considerably over 3 hours, about 200 minutes, and I would lie if I said there was not a single moment when it dragged. It did, occasionally, for example when they meet the French guys. I could have done without that part. The cast is pretty spectacular. Apart from everybody I already mentioned, there's also Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Frederic Forrest in this movie, all 3 Academy Award nominees themselves. It's an interesting take on soldiers' lives during this difficult time. But apart from all the brutal battle scenes and (during one scene) the unsuccessful longing for leadership, we also see a bunch of playboy bunnies giving the troops some pleasure with their mere presence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A ridiculously overrated film,"It's a pity to see a director put so much time and effort into a film and come back with something so awful.  This film is pretentious, chaotic, self-indulgent and ridiculously overrated.  The first half has its moments, even though Robert Duvall's character is a cartoon, but once Dennis Hopper and Marlon Brando show up and start chewing the scenery as if it's all you can eat at the diner and they've been on a three-day fast, the movie dies. The last twenty minutes or so look as if they were filmed by a three-year-old playing with his father's movie camera.  I'm sorry to be so harsh, but this was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had watching a film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Insanity is Not a Theme,"I really don't think the movie has much to do with insanity as it has to do with the fact that war is simply not civil. If it is fought in a non-committal way, it is a waste of time and victory cannot be sought. Those who would fight it brutally might be considered insane, but they are actually rational.The Darkness or ""Horror"" is not insanity, but a realism by Col Kurtz of what is required to win war: Total commitment by the US to wage total warfare resulting in total annihilation (recall his penciled notes in red ink, ""Drop the bomb. Kill them all"").When Coppola commented that the movie IS Vietnam, I think this is at least one point he was making: the futility of fighting a dedicated enemy with limited means. Recall Kurtz's comments of what he could accomplish with 10 divisions of troops of the likes that cut off the arms of innoculated children. He was referring to the brutality AND will required to win war. In contrast to his and Willard's will to accomplish their missions, there is ample evidence of those who are trying to escape Vietnam: Lance and LTC Kilgore's surfing obsession during supposed combat, the troops swimming in the river trying to escape the bridge outpost, the lack of officers present and in control, the high ranking general living a pampered existence in his comfortable airstream trailer, and Lance's escaping thru dropping acid.Those that advocate total war to seek victory (like Kurtz, and implicitly Captain Willard) are probably correct, but made out to be insane. This is not unlike previous history, when Gen MacArthur advocated invading Manchuria and bombing across the Yalu river, essentially fighting Red China and using nuclear weapons. Truman, Marshall, and Bradley agreed that the Korea conflict had to be limited, and MacArthur removed as the UN forces Commander. The same principle was applied in Vietnam, where limited war was micro-managed by Secretary MacNamara and the pentagon. Uncontrolled escalation by the Army could lead to conflict with China and the USSR. Loose cannons such as Col Kurtz were dangerous and could not be tolerated in the officer corps.I still wonder if the reason to eliminate Kurtz were his views, or his actions ?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
'Hearts of Darkness' flipped,"Whether you're viewing the original version of Coppola's Apocalypse Now', or the Redux version (which restored an hour of deleted footage from the 1979 release), there are certain things you remember:  the mad colonel shrouded in shadow (Marlon Brando in perhaps his last great movie role); the showy performances of the actors travelling through Vietnam (Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, and especially, Martin Sheen as Willard  who replaced Harvey Keitel in the role and probably did it much better than he would have done); and the music  not only Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, but also one of the most effective uses of a single song (in this case, The End', by The Doors, which is just perfect).There are other images, too, of the war-torn province, the soldiers coming to terms with the ripping open of their souls  this is a war movie, pure and simple, yet there is much more going on here than is instantly apparent. Much better than Platoon' or The Deer Hunter', perhaps because it takes more risks and ultimately has a more lasting point to make?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A rare film to have aged extremely well,Having never seen it before went to the 40th anniversary screening in imax last night and what an experience despite its length I was totally consumed for the majority of the film and despite normally struggling to watch older films due to the special effects and poor image quality the quality of the film surpassed any issues. I was almost st the point of giving it a 10 but I was waivering slightly the last half hour and with brando's introduction. Maybe this would have been different with the original cut as the extended cut was just that little bit to long for me. Other than that a sublime piece of film making.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
My Favorite Movie of All Time,"My stepdad was an MP in Vietnam, and his comment after watching this was, ""This wasn't Vietnam... it was somebody's nightmare."" My mother's take was that it was ""the most satanic movie ever made"". The problem with most movie reviewers and critics is that they evaluate every movie based on the same criteria, which only benefits cinema majors. My stepdad's evaluation was based on how closely it portrayed his experience in Vietnam, and that wasn't really the premise of this movie. Vietnam is only used as a setting here for a re-telling of ""Heart of Darkness"" to make it relatable to modern audiences; anyone with no familiarity with the Conrad novel will completely miss that and dismiss this as a psychotic maligning of the Vietnam War.
This movie was a personal turning point for me. What it excelled at was making me question much of what I'd been taught and shown in my life and my perspectives on things. Willard's line sums it up: ""The more I saw of lies, the more I hated them."" I came to admire how he abandons any notions of being any more or better than what he is. The real grit of this narrative is how you may not agree with his or Kurtz's methods or understandings or morality, but you can clearly understand how they could arrive at them. So based on the criteria of ""movies that made me think"", I give it 10 stars. If I were to rate it based on historical accuracy, I'd have to bump that down to 3; at least it depicts the Vietnam leadership as buffoons, which by all accounts they were. If I were to rate it on memorable scenes and quotable lines, again a 10. Casting and acting I'd give a 10. It did a fantastic job of taking a war movie beyond mere battle scenes and into the larger issues of morality and judgment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Avoid the ""Redux"" version at all costs","It includes added footage that absolutely wreaks havoc with the original story line and, more crucially, character development. That said, the original (which I saw in 1979 in what was then a rare widescreen cinema,) is still the best Vietnam movie of all time. I've always considered the trip up river, and the way events get more and more surreal and insane the further up the river they go, as a metaphor for the the entire American experience in Southeast Asia. Every performance is a gem -- it's especially cool to see a very young Lawrence Fishburne in his debut role. Coppola was never this good again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Version vs. Version,"I have to admit, the first and only six times I saw the original version of this film (not ""Redux""), I fell asleep during the film. I was convinced that the original film was made catastrophically unwatchable by the muddled and misguided editing. Several of my friends were angry to the respect that I could actually fall asleep to the ""best film ever"", in their opinion. As a result, I was relieved when I found out that there was going to be a release of a new version to theatres, a ""director's cut"", if you will. I purposely waited until it was released on DVD to watch it, and turned the English subtitles on, and I was glad, because I remember lots of the dialog being lost in the original mix (as I think it is also in this as well), but I feel the subtitles help you get through it. You see, I am the kind of person who likes director's cuts, uncensored versions, restored with new footage films, and even letterbox versions, basically the best way a film is intended. There are some exceptions to the rules, like when different editing processes are used, such as ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", which I still think was a mistake that George Lucas didn't correct some of the very noticeable errors in digital vs. analog editing and prints (i.e. he really should have either re-filmed the original Jabba-the-Hut & Han Solo conversation, instead of a digital re-creation and insertion/replacement of an analog filming of someone different {Jabba}, or just kept the scene cut indefinitely), or when studios take control of films and try to make their own edit and commercial cuts, which is almost always monstrous, just as I've heard with Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"". To summarize, it is possible for someone who has issues with this original film to like the ""Redux"" version, if it is for the reasons as I stated, because I feel that ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" actually is a better film than the original ""Apocalypse Now"". Yes, I am bold enough to say it. I am positive that this will offend people who think the original cut is the ""best film ever"", and I know it is even probable they won't like -this- version, but I don't care about that, just like I didn't rate this version 5-stars, or even think of it as the ""best film ever"". This film clearly travels the waters between pure evil and insane genius. This is the only version worth watching. 8/10",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Heart of Darkness,"If you're looking for a masterpiece, read the short novel this is based upon: Joseph Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_. The film is merely OK in comparison.I like the idea of translating Conrad's anti-imperialism from the Congo of 100 years ago to Vietnam in the '60s. The Idea is relevant, once we look through the alibi, the self-serving excuses, and the supposed idealism of the US taking up a former French colony after they cut and ran from the independence fighters there.But the film's ponderous ambition tends to become bombastic at times, rather than the bottomless ambiguity of Conrad's novella.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now (1979) Best war film or exaggeration?,"Francis Ford Coppola is a director much loved by the public, mainly because of The Godfather. Shortly after releasing the two cinema classics, Coppola released Apocalypse Now, which for many is the best war film in history. It's a really cool and interesting film with many beautiful scenes. However, I couldn't connect that much with the narrative and characters. Even so, I admit that it is very interesting to see the characters going crazy in many moments. Some dialogues are perfect and really thought-provoking. The details that caught my attention the most were the visuals, because the story didn't manage to capture me as much as I wanted. In short, Apocalypse Now is a good film, with some very interesting scenes, but it didn't manage to fully capture me from start to finish. In my view, it is not the best war film in history and is far from that position.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the Greatest!,"There's really no other way to say it except that this was a spectacular movie. Everything about it was just so perfect...the acting, cinematography, music/scores, directing, and action sequences just to name a few. I mean film doesn't get much better than this and the fact that this escaped with only a couple Oscars completely baffles me. Some classic quotes were also spewed throughout the duration and it really makes you think about a lot of things. Robert Duvall was probably my favorite character even though he was only in it for a smidge. I couldn't believe Laurence Fishburne was only 14 when he was in this, he looked a lot older. Martin Sheen was spectacular and believe it or not I think he did a better job than Harvey Keitel would've in this role (even though I'm one of his major fans), so when he dropped out I don't consider that to be a tragedy by any means. Marlon Brando is just Marlon Brando and despite all the problems he gave everyone before and during shooting I still really liked him in this role. As for Dennis Hopper, well he was very comical. This is hands down a classic and an absolute must-see!Final Recommendation:Movies : Man I wish I could've seen this on the screen.DVD Purchase : I have ""Redux"" and it was a good investment, though the added scenes are kind of slow moving they still add a lot to the story.Rental : We all got to get started somewhere.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Oi, e, va! That was one heck of a movie to get through!","I really didn't think it was possible to get through Apocalypse Now, over three and a half hours! Well, unfortunately, my sister gave me the Director's Cut to watch, so it was a bit of an ambush of a film. But still, now that I can take a breath, I can honestly say that was one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. Definitely one of a kind, to be honest, I didn't realize also that Marlon Brando really only has a cameo in the film, but it was so memorable that I can see why he is praised when it comes to this movie.It's about a captain played by Sheen, he is sent to Vietnam to capture and kill Captain William played by Brando. William has made himself into a God of a Vietnam tribe and you can tell by his appearance, he's been through Hell. But that's exactly what Sheen has also been through just trying to get to William, through the bloody jungles of Vietnam, he has seen the most horrific images and watch his friends/troop get killed off one by one.Truly an epic motion picture, I can see why this movie is praised. It's so incredibly haunting and disturbing, the soundtrack really does add so much. The sets are incredible but very scary to look at. Sheen and Brando are just amazing in this film, but it's great to see the ""new"" faces of the time, including Harrison Ford and Lawerence Fishbourne, not to mention we have Dennis Hopper and one of the most amazing directors of our time, Francis Ford Coppola.Although, I'm not sure if I could make it through this movie again, for the simple sake of my sanity, I really can't see how this movie could be anyone's favorite to be honest. It's so friggin' depressing! But I will never ever ever doubt what an incredibly moving and disturbing picture it was to watch. I'm going to have nightmares these next few nights!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Excellent Psychological War Film,"This is the most ""emotional"" film I have ever watched. I do not mean in the sense that it made me cry for hours, but I meant that it had so much substance to it. The film follows Captain Benjamin Willard as he is sent up a river into Cambodia during the Vietnam war to assassinate a Colonel (who has gone insane). From the very opening scene (which shows a jungle being immersed in napalm) to the very last moment, you are completely engrossed. This film has elements of comedy, violence, gore, and (in the redux version) some nudity. Needless to say, this film has had good reviews and is a very famous war film. It must be said, however, that this film is not for the squeamish. It is not over the top in gore (like the Kill Bill movies) but it does have some very graphic violence in it. This said, I enjoyed the movie very much but don't expect to make any plans on the day you watch it (the redux version is 3 hrs and 20 min long or something like that).I have seen both the original and the redux and thought that both were excellent. People with shorter attention spans probably shouldn't watch the redux version. Nor should they really watch the original either, most of the beauty of the movie will fly over their heads like a 747.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Atmospheric and unforgettably brilliant war film,"Here's that offbeat Vietnam Coppola masterpiece, with the whop whop whopping sound of choppers cutting the air. Unlike a few Vietnam films, this one is plot driven, and I must say, the story is an original. It's the journey there that makes the film, as well as the fantastic performances, all round, notably Sheen and wildcat Frederick Forrest, although of course it's Duvall as the gung ho Lieutenant, spouting that film's famous line, who steals their thunder, before a couple of bombings happen behind him, where he hardly flinches. Is this guy invincible or what? It's the most memorable part of the film. Sheen plays a Colonel, who's been to Vietnam and back, where he's back in Vietnam, positioned at Saigon. He's summoned on a mission, to find an outstanding Colonel, Kurtz (Brando, giving us an enigmatic character in an unbelievably masterful piece of acting) and terminate (kill) him. Sheen must travel up the river, of course, through the likelihoods of attacks. It's the first Vietnam film I've seen, that features soldier surfing. Did they really do this? It seems surreal, but as a Vietnam pic, it's very real. Hopper, a bloody unappreciated actor, so much so, it's criminal, is unforgettably brilliant as Brando's master and protector who gives us that wonderful monologue, while talking to a caged Sheen, where it's fates being decided. The script is top notch. If ever getting a chance, read itr, it's brilliant. Sheen's tired, wearied voice so much suits the role, from which Harvey Keitel, was originally cast, but just wasn't delivering the goods. Even great actors have their flaws, as even I was dropped from a short movie once. The playboy bunnies that came to visit the troops, via helicopter of course (check out one of Frederick Forest's requests) is beautifully shot. As for the Redux I prefer the original, as it did stall the story, as with the French family, the movie didn't benefit from it all, as this bit, didn't maintain interest, and wasn't warranted. We as an audience, didn't really need to be informed about this. As for gore, it's very restrained, only occasional, but there is that sick, and little disturbing scene near the end, involving a goat being sliced up. Forever a Vietnam masterpiece, AN is an ambitious and larger than life Vietnam film, crafted by a masterful director, whose got unforgettable performances out of his actors, in a brilliant choice of casting. But AN is brilliant, in about everything. What's also unforgettable is the state of that shrimp, before Willard treks off on his mission, to terminate a man, who's mind has flipped one too many switches.

In order to really appreciate it i would highly recommend reading Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as this is the novel the film is based on.The film has depth and the more times you watch it the more you pick up on. Martin Sheen plays a diamond role as the narrator. What makes it such a clever role is that we are never sure whether the narrator is trustworthy or not, or does he become affected by whats happening around him? A question that is difficult or impossible to answer, you really have to trust your own instincts whilst watching this one. As for the slightly unreal war simulations, the simple answer is that they are of no consequence. The real point of the film is the focus on Marlon Brando's character and 'The horror' that is when one looks into the abyss of nothingness. The nothingness that is life when you try to become your own God, the ultimate question that arises is of course; is there a difference between a good or bad God? If you become that God then there is none but yourself to judge you.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Haunting imagery,"""This is the way the fucking world ends.""America trying to come to terms with having lost the Vietnam war and a bit of its soul in the process, Francis Ford Coppola's vision for the experience is mapped onto Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but also feels like a surreal nightmare journey into Dante's nine circles of hell, accompanied by film noir like narration. You may also get the feeling of Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo (1982) here, both in the harrowing voyage and the maniacal way the film was made amidst all sorts of trials and tribulations.From the beginning we're hit with beautiful, discordant, disturbing imagery: announcements over loudspeakers to locals that ""we are your friends"" while women and children lay dead on the ground with ""death cards"" callously tossed on their bodies, so that ""Charlie will know who did this."" A prayer being offered with devastation in the background and a cow being airlifted by a helicopter. An American officer offering a wounded North Vietnamese soldier some water until he's distracted by one of the soldiers who's arrived being a well-known surfer. The cinematography and the general feeling of absolute madness is the film's greatest strengths.I can't say that I saw this as the best films of all time, however, or even one of the best war films either. For one thing, the discombobulated state of the American military is slathered on far too thick to be realistic. In fairness, to be dreamlike and surreal was a conscious choice, and the film is more poetry than prose, but I thought it went too far in its journey up the river. We get surfing during a bombing, a strip show, playboy bunnies, water skiing on the river, and a soldier on acid with a puppy in his jacket ffs. We come across an outpost whose commanding officer was killed, and now its soldiers scurry about as if they're in an insane asylum, completely directionless, like a lost tribe. We get ditzy playmates who allow the soldiers to take turns with them without a care in the world; as with the French woman at the plantation, the women in this film exist to bare their big boobs, in case the viewer wants some sex to go along with the violence. We get another leaderless outpost, shrouded in a surreal haze, firing into the night. And then of course we get the rogue colonel, with his bizarre cult like following in the jungle.Another issue is perspective and the treatment of the Vietnamese by the film. We hear how intelligent they are a couple times, but we almost never see them as people, or their perspective. You could excuse some of that as this being an American film coping with the terrible decisions of its leaders that led to a prolonged war and massive number of casualties, but when it's coupled with a Heart of Darkness story line and the native people are shown as primitives, worshipping the rogue officer as if he's a god, it's too much. This officer tells a story of the Vietcong cutting off the arms of their own children who've received a Western polio vaccine; they go through a ritualized killing of a water buffalo (and beware, a real animal was butchered); they bow down like the natives in King Kong to the man who kills their deity. While the film has Heart of Darkness as its template, I'm not sure it really understood or communicated the message from that work.Along those lines, I'm not sure it's quite as antiwar as its reputation. There is a fair degree of macho posturing in Robert Duvall's character, who seems nearly insane, but also struts around unphased in his cowboy hat as shells explode nearby, after his helicopters have done their thing to the soaring music of Wagner. Similarly, while we may recoil from Kurtz (even if Brando's performance was too sleepy) he's far from condemned - in fact, it's as if he's achieved some higher plane of enlightenment through embracing the necessity of cruelty in war. The ""crazy"" officer is the only one who's good at his job. If only we had more discipline in our leadership and in our soldiers, the film seems to say, we could have won the war. This sentiment, ""you can win if it you want to,"" is expressed in that interminable scene at the French plantation, where a version of history is doled out in a heavy-handed way, and by Kurtz when he says ""We need fewer men, and better; if they were committed, this war could be won with a fourth of our present force.""This nightmarish fever dream of the American experience in Vietnam all leads up to a rather anticlimactic ending, which was a letdown for a 202 minute film (I saw the Redux version). I'm not even sure mapping the American experience in Vietnam to Heart of Darkness was the best decision, but regardless, there is a certain lack of cohesion in what should have been a simple story. However, I have to say, the film made me think an awful lot about what it was trying accomplish, the visuals are astonishing, and through its imagery it captures a sense of the insanity of war.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A Phenomenal Achievement. Coppola Outdoes Himself!,"In high school, I had to read Heart of Darkness. Although it was a good book, I did not understand any of it so my teacher had to explain everything. It was a harder read than a Shakespeare play. Apocalypse Now is a loose adaptation that surpasses the book. A few years after Coppola does the best movies ever--The Godfather Part 1 & 2--he directs arguably the best war movie ever made. Apocalypse Now is inferior to The Godfather movies, but is a much better piece of film. This was ten times harder to do than Coppola's other flicks.I think Schindler's List is the best movie ever made about war. But it is not a straight-up war movie like this. As a straight-up war movie, this is the best. Saving Private Ryan is pretty close. But Apocalypse Now has a different kind of approach. Spielberg tried to make Saving Private Ryan to look like actual footage. Coppola tried to make Apocalypse Now look real too, but make the look more revolutionary and usable in every kind of film. Another thing that sets this apart is the weirdness that Coppola incorporates, used from the story. Martin Sheen (in an underrated performance) plays a soldier who seeks out Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando. Along the way, he encounters many odd tribes and rituals. When he gets to Kurtz's kingdom, the weirdness reaches an all-time high and the result of his stay changes him forever. Coppola creates some odd tribes that is genius for movies. The general filming with stuff like cinematography is revolutionary and mind-blowing. Coppola never did better than this and very few directors have done better than this.Apocalypse Now is a story about how war can change people and does the best job in showing how and why.4/4",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Cinematic Art,"Apocalypse Now is a movie bordering on a masterpiece, created using a canvas even the most legendary painter would be envious of. The striking elements of the film are the exceptional usage of colour, the clever manipulation of lighting and the start contrast of each and every frame. Marvel at the picture postcard presentation of the jungles of Vietnam, before suddenly all hell breaks lose and it becomes a torrent of machine gun fire and blood. Apocalypse Now aims for the gut and skewers the viewer, assaulting the senses with a masterful display of cinematography, lighting and direction. Unlike so many ""Hollywood"" productions of today, ""Now"" is a labour of love, each frame expertly crafted by a man at the very pinnacle of his film-making career. Very few films would be right at home next to a Monet or a Van Gogh, yet this is one of the few exceptions, displaying some of the most beautiful photography ever seen on the silver screen.While the look may impress, ""Now"" is rendered complete by its phenomenally powerful story, based on Joseph Conrad's novel ""Heart of Darkness"". The full horror of war is explored to the depths, with the absurdities of war emphasised by the central plot of eliminating the enemy, not the Vietcong rebels, but an American Colonel with delusions of grandeur. The movie takes many unexpected twists and turns, always flirting with the bizarre and surreal, and always coming off as a fresh and invigorating slice of life behind enemy lines. Martin Sheen is superb as Captain Willard, a man who knows no other world, who lives and breathes war. Brando is suitably chilling as Kurtz, the object of his mission, and Dennis Hopper, as a hippy photojournalist, gives a typically neurotic turn, converted by Kurtz's seemingly infinite words of wisdom.

Even 26 years on, its impact is spellbinding and its message is timely. Coppola, as a filmmaker, should be applauded for having the courage to make a movie about the truth and not a fabricated Hollywood tale where the true horrors and inhumanities of war are neatly swept under the carpet.

The Horror... The Horror,"""Apocalypse Now"" is truly one of the best and most mesmerizing films I have ever witnessed! No matter what cut of the movie you watch, it's an absolute cinematic masterpiece that will stay with you and get under your skin in the greatest possible way. This Classic 1979 film from Francis Ford Coppola tells the story (also being a modern retelling of the classic novel ""Heart of Darkness"") of Captain Willard, played by the legend Martin Sheen, that is sent to the jungle to a decorated Military colonial Kurtz that has gone insane during the Vietnam War. Everything is perfectly paced, characters are amazing, and it's one hell of a journey to the very end! Don't miss this one for sure! In my top 5 movies. 10/10 perfect!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Greatest Film Ever Made About Vietnam,"I feel that I have gazed into the abyss, and that the abyss has gazed into me, for I have experienced Apocalypse Now. Sheer unremitting madness is what it is about, and madness is the form that it takes for much of its runtime. Coppola has taken the classic Heart of Darkness, crossed it with Herzog's Aguirre, The Wrath of God, and set it against the madness of the Vietnam War to produce a film that is darker, more disturbing, and perhaps more profound as any I have ever seen. Watching this, you will see the face of true horror, and you will be changed.For any who do not know the story, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) must travel far upriver into Cambodia to confront and eliminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlin Brando) a once ideal soldier who has gone rogue and is presumed to be completely insane. And on his journey he will see more darkness than he could have imagined, and discover that the truth is far worse than any had believed.Since this is a movie review, I suppose I should comment on the acting, production values, etc. They are excellent. The sets and jungle locations are gorgeous. The battle scenes, especially the airborne assault, are among the best Hollywood has ever produced, with massive scale, incredible camera work, and pyrotechnics that would be the envy of Michal Bey. And the cinematography has lent much of the film an otherworldly feel, like the most horrifying acid trip possible.The acting is likewise excellent. Sheen's performance as the haggard, mentally exhausted, and increasingly disturbed Captain Willard has changed my entire opinion of him as an actor. His haunting narration sets the tone for the entire film, and his eyes speak volumes in every scene. They tell the story of a man who thought he had seen it all, only to discover that he was horribly wrong. And Brando, despite having relatively little time on screen, is truly unforgettable. He is the very essence of a man who is profoundly unwell, and utterly detached from sanity.And that is what Apocalypse Now is all about, the retreat from any semblance of sanity. On the journey upriver, we are confronted with madness of every form and color. There is the blood-lust and near suicidal bravado of Kilgore (Robert Duval) who lives and breathes war, and simply does not give a damn about his personal safety. It takes someone more than a bit off to go surfing as enemy bullets are ripping overhead or to remark that napalm ""smells like victory."" There's the utter detachment of Dennis Hopper's photojournalist, who seems to float along in a state of perpetual high, mistaking the madness of others for true wisdom. And the sheer idiocy of Lance, who drops acid in the midst NVA invested territory, and who yells 'Look guys, purple haze"" as he envelopes his own boat in thick clouds of colored smoke, never mind that they're on an uncharted stretch of river deep in Cambodia.And there's the more generalized kind of madness that pervaded the whole war. The madness of forcibly moving entire populations in the hope that they would be grateful to us for protecting them. The madness of rebuilding a bridge every day and defending it against attack every night, just so the generals can say the road is open, casualties be damned! Or the madness of sending high strung, inexperienced, dope smoking kids on a sensitive dangerous mission. Other than Willard and possibly the skipper, no-one on that boat had any business being in a war zone.But all of this pales in comparison to the sheer insanity of Colonel Kurtz. He is a man who has decided that not only do the ends justify the means, but that only the most horrifying means will achieve those ends. He has absorbed every ounce of the madness he's encountered, he has fully embraced that madness, and he has been transformed into a fount of madness, spewing forth pure horror and infecting everything it touches. The truly scary thing is that even half dead; rarely stepping out of his quarters, Kurtz still wields more absolute power than any man ever should. His madness is mistaken for divinity by followers who will commit any act for him. He's like an aged Charles Manson, with an entire tribe of true believers rather than a handful of dropouts.Even scarier is that on one level he's right. By embracing the horrors of war, he and his people have done more damage to the enemy than any comparable force. If we'd had ten divisions of troops as ruthless as his, we could have destroyed the Cong and the NVA, but only at the cost of our souls. And yet in his rare moments of lucidity, Kurt knows and understands that what he has done is completely beyond the pale of decency or civilized humanity. Deep down, he hates what he is doing and what he has become. He no longer fears death but craves it, because it is the only escape from the nightmare he has created. His only wish is others may understand what happened to him and why he became what he did.And I do. I cannot condone, excuse, or forgive any of what he has done, but I understand. And seeing this film for yourself, perhaps you will too. I cannot lie. This movie is dark, frightening, and at times downright depressing. But it is magnificent. If you have the fortitude to gaze into the jaws of insanity, you owe it to yourself to watch Apocalypse Now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The 30 Greatest Films Ever Made, Continued","(part of 30 essays I am writing on the 30 greatest films of all time. They are written in no order) I'm not sure if there could possibly be a more fitting title for this film than ""Apocalypse Now."" The famous opening scene shows a line of trees for about a minute as we hear helicopters chop-chopping in and out of the frame. We begin to hear the first notes to The Doors' ""The End"" and as the first words are spoken the entire forest is hit by napalm and bursts into flame silently. Then it fades on one half of the screen to a shot of Martin Sheen's face, and the helicopters are really the ceiling fan? ""And all the children, are insane! All the children...""The first lines spoken in the film is Sheen narrating ""Saigon. (expleteive). I'm still only in Saigon."" He continues to narrate his life story. How he fought in Vietnam, went home. Couldn't stand being away from the jungle. Only word he said to his wife was yes to a divorce. And now he was back here. Still only in Saigon. ""Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker, and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter."" Sheen, drunk, tears apart his room and cuts himself punching a mirror. Having fun yet? The next morning he is in luck - HQ gives him a top secret mission up the river into Cambodia, to kill a Green Beret colonel who has lost his mind and commands his soldiers to commit atrocities while they worship him as a king. Willard narrates: ""I was going to the worst place in the world and I didn't even know it yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable - plugged straight into Kurtz. It was no accident that I got to be the caretaker of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory - any more than being back in Saigon was an accident. There is no way to tell his story without telling my own. And if his story really is a confession, then so is mine."" Shoot, who wrote the narration? Because those are pretty classic lines. Make a good Sig but it has to be under a hundred characters. Here's something probably under a 100: ""charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in the Indy 500."" He is sent up with Chef (Fredrick Forrest), Mr. Clean (a 14 year old Larry Fishburne), Lance (Sam Bottoms) and Chief (Albert Hall), who are all (except Chief) young and inexperienced soldiers. In the films most famous scene, they are chauffeured to the mouth of their river by Robert Duvall and his air Calvary, who bomb a Vietnamese village to clear the area for surfing. The famous detail is that the helicopters are blasting Wagners ""Ride of the Valkeries"" as they attack the village.From there the film descends, one scene after another, into a world of chaotic insanity and madness. One of the most memorable scenes is when they pass the last American outpost on the river. Soldiers carrying suitcases swim into the river desperately, crying out ""take me home!"" When Willard goes onto the crazily lit bridge (we only see his face every time a flare goes up) he asks a soldier who the commanding officer is. The soldier looks horrified and replies ""Aint you?"" Finally, the film reaches the end of the river. Only a couple of the men are left. Men hang from the trees and skulls decorate the sides of the river. Heads and severed limbs and graffiti (one which says ""Apocalypse Now"") cover the ancient temple. The beret, Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) recites poetry and Willard is disturbed to discover the many parallels between him and Kurtz. Kurtz's biggest admirer is ""The Photojournalist"" played by Dennis Hopper, who says things like ""You don't talk to the Colonel. You listen to him...he's a poet-warrior in the classic sense."" This is a stunning film to watch, and what is more stunning I can see this again and again and again and never get bored of it.Original or Redux? There isn't much difference between the two versions. You might want to see Redux for an interesting new way to look at the film (the scenes have been rearranged into a different order) but I would see the original first, which stays closer to the novel on which the film is based, Conrad's Heart of Darkness.""Arresting a man for murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500""...good line.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Robert Duvall is the highlight of this film,"¨I love the smell of napalm in the morning.¨There is no doubt that Apocalypse Now will be considered by many as one of the best films of all time because it is a very memorable and unique film. It feels surreal at times and has some great performances. It's also hard to define what genre the film belongs to because it doesn't seem to have a structure or a pattern we find in other films. Apocalypse Now is a classic and powerful film, but I really wasn't blown away by it and didn't enjoy it very much. The problem I had with it was that I watched the Redux version which is almost one hour longer than the original, so there were several moments that seemed to drag forever. What I did enjoy about this movie was the first hour which I felt was an absolute masterpiece. Those first sixty minutes were a lot of fun and had the best moments in the movie. Then the next two hours dragged way too much with all the surrealism. I got the point, the soldiers were getting crazy over the minute and the film succeeds tremendously in pointing that out as we see how nonsensical this war really was. The minds of these men seemed to be lost completely and there was chaos reigning all over the place. For me nothing will replace those brilliant first sixty minutes with a performance from Robert Duvall for the ages. He was perfect in those few scenes he was in and I wish the film would've dealt with him instead. The entrance in the helicopters with the classical music and then the surfing in the middle of the war zone was so hilarious; one of the best scenes in film history. I was really feeling good about this movie, until the film went completely in another direction and lost my interest.The movie takes place during the Vietnam War and it begins with a voice over narration of the main character, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), who has recently returned from the United States to continue fighting. He is beginning to lose his mind while he awaits his mission. He says all he wanted to do when he was in the jungle was return home, and once he was home all he wanted was to return to the jungle. War has taken its toll on him. Finally he receives a new mission from Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford) that is highly classified. He has to go down the Nung River all the way to Cambodia and find a former Colonel who has seemed to have lost his mind and gone haywire. He has built an army of his own and is killing off several Viet Cong officials without taking orders from anyone. Colonel Lucas wants Captain Willard to locate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and kill him. Willard is sent on his mission along with a Navy patrol boat to escort him. Chief Phillips (Albert Hall), Chef Hicks (Frederic Forrest), Lance Johnson (Sam Bottoms) a known surfer, and Clean Miller (Laurence Fishburne) are Captain Willard's only companions on this classified mission. In order to begin their course down the river they first have to infiltrate a Viet Cong outpost so Lt. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his cavalry help them do so. As Captain Willard and his men begin their descent through the river they come across several bases (friendly and enemy) and the further down we go the more chaotic and wild things begin to get.The descent through the Nung River was probably my least favorite part of the film. I enjoyed much more the scenes with Lt. Kilgore and his men that helped them begin their mission. Duvall as Lt. Kilgore steals the movie and he is brilliant in every scene. He is more concerned with surfing than he is with the actual War. It's as if he is living in an alternate reality. This is just a small glimpse of what we are going to see further on in the movie as we encounter different outposts that seem to get weirder every time. Everything is escalating up to the very end and seems to get more and more chaotic thus making the title, Apocalypse Now, very appropriate. This isn't your typical war movie, people are losing their minds and the film becomes more and more surreal and harder to fit into one specific genre. Francis Ford Coppola was at the top of his game during the 70's with The Godfather films and you can see how brilliantly directed the scenes were. The cinematography and lighting was excellent. The reason I don't give this film a higher grade despite admitting it is a memorable and unique movie is because I really wasn't entertained that much with it. It would be hard to watch it again, unless I could just see that first hour with Robert Duvall. The all star cast makes it a little easier to watch: Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Harrison Ford, and Laurence Fishburne.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Wow,"This is the film all other war movies must contend with. What it doesn't provide on the comedic scale (it provides understated scenes at best), it does provide in sardonic visual commentary treats, like Francis Ford Coppola's appearance as a TV journalist directing scenes (as if for a reflexively ambitious Coppola movie).Kurtz, Marlon Brando's character taken from the original story of his namesake (Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness), is alone the tour de force in this film. Without Brando, there is no forte allegro to this masterpiece, just as without the protagonist, Captain Willard, there is no hypnotic narrative.But it's the commentary that is so stinging in this film. Far from rallying for peace, the film reveals the underbelly of how the world works, and why Vietnam is ""unwinnable"" at its core, as well as providing stunning understated hints as to why.For dramatic sweep, musical and cinematographic vision, and method acting at its finest in probably the last real method acting masterpiece, this move alone justifies the digitization of classic films, but then again, Sunset Boulevard or M already does that. Okay, so as far as 1970s films go, AN is in the top 10 films in a decade that made the top 80 out of a hundred or so timeless classics that give more than they take from (or in some cases, kill in) the viewer.This happens to be the only film with my express permission (including the film, The Doors), to use hit tracks from the Doors official catalog.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Stay On The Boat,"Tortuous anti-war epic that ultimately disappoints despite the fantastic cinematography and superb overall production. The performances by Robert Duvall (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) and Marlon Brando, meant to be highlights, only reduce the picture's gritty realism and lose the viewer's interest with overly dramatized performances and, with Brando, at times unintelligible dialogue.What saves the film, and makes it great, is the narrated journey of Captain Willard up the Mekong and into the dark reaches of Indo-China. Martin Sheen gives a tremendous performance as the super-serious unofficial operative Willard whose mission is to seek out the mutinous Colonel Kurtz (Brando), creator of a dysfunctional Shangri-La deep in the jungle. Plenty of action and more than one bizarre sojourn (particularly in the less edited Redux version) greet Willard and his riverboat crew of war movie personalities--wonderfully performed by all including a very young Laurence Fishburne as the gunner's mate, ""Mr. Clean.""Together they traverse through all the ironies and confusing realities of warfare and keep you on the edge of your seat. Once on land, however, the movie bogs down into a badly scripted climax between Willard and Kurtz.Definitely worth watching only give yourself enough time to appreciate the pacing and by all means, don't worry if you never see the end!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The most boring film I've ever seen,"After seeing the high rating I decided to take a look at this film, for the first hour and forty minutes I was bored to tears. After that point it looked like there might have been some slight hope things were going to pick up, but that was only for ten minutes then it went back to the boring drab and dullness until the end of the film.There's not a lot I can say as hardly anything interesting or worth watching is in this film, just seemed like the same thing happening over and over again just with different camera angles until they finally got to the island. Even then it doesn't live up to the expectations of what the characters in the film have been trying to imply all along.There was nothing insane about this film or the guy on the island, there was maybe a few minutes of very mild gore, nothing scary, no horror and no craziness.. just dull dull dull.I would find the beeping noise of a reversing truck more exciting than this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An astonishing film that aptivates the horrors of war,"I've only seen the Redux version of the film, which is 49 minutes longer than the theatrical release.

That was the only scene where I was bored.Other then that I was fully engaged on the story.
The cinematography alone is something to marvel at. Every frame looks astounding and well captured.This is truly one of Francis Ford Coppola's greatest films. I would even dare to say that it challenges ""The Godfather"" for the top spot.""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the greatest war films ever made.

Such a great adaptation of Heart of Darkness,"It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz.(I don't say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary, ""Hearts of Darkness,"" I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: ""Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. They sent it up with room service."" It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating. A good example of is Hopper's indulgence into aphoristic madness, generously installing lines written by T.S. Eliot and Rudyard Kipling into his stony monologues: ""I mean, the man's a geniussometimes he'll walk right by you without even saying a word, and sometimes he'll grab you by the collar and say ""did you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'if you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs"" and then ""I mean he's a wise man, he's a great man; I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas"" (The first one's Kipling, the second one's Eliot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
""" You Need to assassinate   this man as he is winning  a war, we promised we wouldn't win ""","Americans have always won wars which involved great patriotism. World War I and II were global and fought in conjunction with our allies and were eventually brought to successful conclusions. After that, American wars were not successful as the goals and their ultimate purposes were hazy at best. The Viet-Nam war was a case in point. As the film ""Apocalypse Now"" tells it, a 'special opts' soldier, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is selected to travel up-country in Viet-Nam to assassinate or as they put it, 'terminate' the command of Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he is doing something which the pentagon officials have promised the politicians they would not do. This determined American individual is winning the war and doing it with such field tactics and savage methods which in their mind boarder on the criminal. Williard is torn between admiration for his target and conviction for his mission. Along the way, the Captain sees just how insane the Viet-Nam war really is. One commander he meets Lt. Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall) borders on sheer lunacy with statements such as "" I love the smell of Napalm in the morning."" Another individual he meets is a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) so impressed with Kurtz' ability to win the war, believes him to be not only mystical, but divine. The story is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's book 'Heart of Darkness' where the hero is sent not to kill him, but to save him. However in this adaptation Willard the assassin, who mimicking robot-like soldiers will follow orders regardless how insane those orders are. The great cast includes Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford and Scott Glenn as Lieutenant Colby make this film one of the truly memorable pictures of our time. Winning so many awards, its difficult to tell which aspect of the movie helped make this story a Classic. ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Final Cut is better!,"I have just watched ""Apocalypse Now Final Cut"" (2hrs 50mn of it) after having watched the original release more than 40 years ago. I must say I have been totally gripped by this so-called Final Cut, released in 2019.I have read quite a number of the viewer's comments & I do not share the opinion of those who do not like the ""Final cut"". For me, this version is - in spite of its length - better than the original release.The obvious reason is that the screenplay of the film is made more powerful by becoming at last understandable! In the original (1979) ""Theatrical release"" there were so many cuts that the progression of the story was almost impossible to fully understand.A more diffuse reason is that this film is not the tale of a ""hit and run"" military operation: it is a journey into the mind of a man who is fascinated by the study of the mind of the man he is sent to execute; the progressive acquaintance of Willard with the file of Kurtz cannot be rushed without depriving the film of some of its meaning.Similarly, the final events in the Montagnard's base under Kurtz command gain considerably by not being rushed: this makes for a deeper comprehension of the sequence.I understand why several reviewers have been made uneasy by the ""Plantation sequence"". Being French, I too was uneasy at the disagreements openly expressed in the Planter's family and the whining about Dien Bien Phu. But, although it might have been handled better, there is a reason why Coppola has included this sequence in the screenplay:
The itinerary of Kurtz has many similarities with that of a number of French officers in the Expeditionary Force who were totally committed to winning the war, up to the point of emulating the tactics of their Vietminh foe - seeking to intimidate by cold blooded cruelty, but also seeking to win hearts and minds by adopting the mores and mindset of the population of their assigned district.This ""Indochinese syndrome"" is exactly what has seized Kurtz, and one can better understand the order to have him killed when one thinks that several French officers of a similarly misguided extreme devotion to their self-defined duty have rebelled later (in Algeria) against their legitimate government! __ .",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"...this mission does not exist, nor will it ever exist.","Martin Sheen is Captain Benjamin L. Willard, an alcoholic soldier holed up in a sleazy hotel with his hallucinations of the war to keep him company. He receives new orders to find and kill Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has gone AWOL in the Cambodian jungle. Kurtz is a decorated military hero who has excelled in the dirty work that others have failed at or just avoided. The top brass in the military has become fearful of Kurtz because he has gone rogue doing his own thing, and the military fear his past and his potential. He has inspired a breakaway guerrilla militia - and is being idolised like a living deity. Captain Willard and his small team begin the journey to find him, sometimes aided along the way, but quite often hindered just as much too. The road, or in this case, the river, is long, and it is not going to be a smooth journey to fulfil the orders he has been given. Captain Willard and his small team begin the journey to find him, sometimes aided along the way, but quite often hindered just as much too. The road, or in this case, the river, is long, and it is not going to be a smooth journey to fulfil the orders he has been given.Based on Joseph Conrad's boo, ""The Heart of Darkness"", Francis Ford Coppola and John Millius set about converting the original story into one more relevant to recent events for them. Instead of the plot being based in Africa, it is centered on the Vietnam War. Carmine Coppola's eerie and sometimes hypnotic score really compliments the cinematography that Vittorio Storaro brings. The end result is something that some people find challenging while other feel enlightened. Either way the film was a massive success with plenty of awards and recognition - some people still have ""Apocalypse Now"" in their ""Top 10 Films of all-time"" lists, and that's despite the film being over 40 years old now.There are a lot of household Hollywood names acting in this film, some in plain sight and obvious, so not as much - Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, R. Lee Emery, & Robert Duvall. But don't worry too much about the names though, because the film is littered with gritty and authentic performances throughout. The stand out's here though are Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando. Sheen carries the film throughout, not just the face the audience follows but the narrator that moves the story on too. He does really well in transitioning from the broken soldier, to the machine that's just ""doing his job"" without letting emotions interfere. He then goes through various other transitions before seeing the reality of war and being horrified by what he's part of.Much has been made of Brando's performance in this film. Some documentaries and commentaries say unhinged, some say brilliant. Considering he only has a small part in the film, something about his performance stands out and sends shivers down my spine. I'm not sure if it's because we have been part of Willard's journey, obsessively searching for Kurtz, and when we eventually find him after going through so much madness along the way, he's just human after all. But then the longer we spend in his presence, the more we see a character that is out-of-bounds mentally, spiritually, and physically. Considering the small amount of screen time, Brando brings real presence to the screen, and Francis Ford Coppola manages to work with that well by putting him shadowy situations where you can't quite see him and are forced to listen extra carefully to interpret the mumbled dialogue.The could have been... Steve McQueen was Francis Ford Coppola's first choice to play Willard, but he didn't want to leave America for the shooting period - and he was too expensive. Al Pacino was offered the role having worked with the director before, he declined because he feared getting ill like he had done in the Dominican Republic while shooting ""The Godfather Part 2"". Other people that were offered parts, or declined parts include: Harvey Keitel, James Caan, Gene Hackman, Clint Eastwood, Nick Nolte, Tommy Lee Jones, Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford... the list is massive, not just in the acting stakes, but all around, for example - George Lucas was nearly the director. He got the green light for ""Star Wars"" though and decided against this.In many ways this film nearly broke Coppola, and the cast too. But the level of pain experienced feels like it dropped through into the celluloid that audiences got treated to. There have been plenty of stories about the problems that making this film created, and there are some great documentaries of behind the scenes. If I was to call out one it would be ""Heart of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" (1991) by Eleanor Coppola, George Hickenlooper, and Fax Bahr.""Apocalypse Now"" is challenging and at time psychedelic and even painful to endure. It is not something that everybody will enjoy it, but for those who do, there is plenty of room for your own interpretation of what is unfolding. I once read a review of it that likened Willard journey to that which may be experienced if descending Dante's ""Inferno"" and experiencing the different levels of Hell. Each step along the way brings with it more and more horror and depravity, before finally the gates of Hell are opened - or in this case the canoes that guard Kurtz's temple part, so that Willard can go into the heart of darkness. That's kind of my interpretation of what happens at the end too, Willard is reborn when he comes out of the water at the end, he embraces evil as a c hanged man and takes the heart of darkness from Kuntz for himself.If you haven't seen ""Apocalypse Now"", my advice is start with the original version. The ""Redux"" does add more to the film but not all of it is essential in my opinion. It's more something that hardcore fans of the film may want to try out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A superb exploration of both film and literature.,"First of all, I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"", the book that was the literary basis for the movie. With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced ""kids"" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story. The acting I felt was definitely all-around up to par. Marlon Brando's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting. His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film reels you in, and reveals the hollowness of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie. Those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film, because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculptured and best-made films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This is a groundbreaking masterpiece of a movie.,"Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now' is one of the most controversial movies that our world has been privileged to see. I have heard many rumours about what happened on the set of this film, causing many problems, but I believe that does not distract from how good a movie I think it is. But I warn you, Apocalypse' has a very long and confusing story that might make it hard for you to appreciate what Coppola was trying to show. There have been many war movies made by Hollywood, but none are quite like this.Nominated for 8 academy awards, Apocalypse Now tracks the journey of Captain Willard, a US Army intelligence officer sent on a hazardous mission up river in Cambodia to terminate with extreme prejudice' an American renegade, a colonel named Kurtz' who has spun out of control (and out of his mind!), in a remote jungle compound.Apocalypse Now was really well made by Francis Ford Coppola (as director, producer and screenwriter). Coppola had many moments in the film where he wanted to say something and that is what he did. I love the way he shot the war scenes in this film, as they were not only very dramatic, but also very funny as well. I am certain that he was trying to deliberately show the irony of war', a real highlight of the film.Helping Coppola write the film's screenplay were Michael Herr and John Millus. They all did a fantastic job, incorporating the mind-boggling story of Hearts of Darkness', by adventurer Joseph Conrad. It is my view that this story, while being hard story to understand, is important for people to learn about. All the writers did with this story was replace the trip up the Congo Marlow has in the HOD' story, with the river trip thorough Cambodia for Captain Willard and his crew. Some people could criticise this movie's story, saying that Coppola used it for his own convenience. However I think it is good to try and learn about an old story, in a modern kind of way, in a story that has undoubtedly affected our world, for many years now.This movie shows many characters that have gone mad (or indeed are about too end up that way!). Its main star is Willard (Martin Sheen), the captain that is given the unenviable task of trying to find the ex-army colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). While Sheen was good in certain parts of his role, I must say that I found Willard to be a very mysterious character that lacked in dialogue. For me, this made him very hard to like.A lot has been said about the small role taken on by legendary actor Marlon Brando. He might have been paid one million dollars for the performance, but he does show he was the right person for the job. I believe Brando comes across perfectly as this army colonel, gone insane. When Brando says The horror, the horror', it brought back some fond memories of the HOD' story for me. It is also funny to see the Photojournalist (Dennis Hopper), who is a really strange guy, harassing Willard when he finally finds Kurtz at his jungle hideaway. This character is another man that could be considered crazy', as all his actions signal that to me.The other cast members in the film take a lot less of the limelight in the film, as that is how the story wants them to be. But they still do have an impact at certain times of the movie. At the beginning of the film we meet a few officials that give Willard his mission. One of them is a Colonel (a very young Harrison Ford). Then on the boat that is helping take Willard on his mission through the Cambodian river are Chef (Frederic Forrest), Chief (Albert Hall), the boat driver, Lance (Sam Bottoms) who has a disturbing death scenes, and Clean (an almost unrecognisable Laurence Fishburne), whose death is much more dignified than that of the chief.When we see the war zone in Vietnam for the first time, we meet a most unusual personality, Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall). The scene with the Kilgore in it at the earlier stage of the movie, is truly great, as we see the war going on around him (with no shirt on mind you), but what is even more amazing is that he tells his officers around him, it is ok to surf, get out there or fight'. Now in any normal war film, that would be the last thing on anyone's mind, let alone an order from a top ranking official.However, the most disturbing scene in the film happens when the navy boat crew stops, suspicious about the occupants of a Vietnamese boat. The massacre that follows is very hard to watch, but it does show what can happen, when men are trained to fight and kill in war. Willard as Captain shows absolutely no compassion to these people at all.I am not worried if there are people out there that hate this movie, but I hope you at least gave it a chance before feeling that way. I hope that in some way my review has given you an insight into what the film is about. I must reiterate that this film has an historical story attached to it. If you are a fan of literature, I can only recommend you read the Hearts of darkness' story, but be ready for heavy bit of reading. If this movie gets a bit heavy for you, keep reminding yourself what it is trying to show - Captain Willard and his mission, which is to find this brilliant army colonel that has gone completely mad and kill him. This is a brilliantly made film, with a remarkable story, cast and direction. I can only recommend you that you see it.CMRS gives Apocalypse Now': 4.5 (Very Good  Brilliant Film)",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Visual and Audio Masterpiece,"A brilliant piece of film making that shows just one thin fictional slice of that disaster.Most Vietnam Vets I have talked to either loved it or hated it depending on their personal experiences and their IQ.This film is a not a documentary but it captures the total insanity of that war.

"A beast of a film built upon spectacular spectacle and practically seeping with blood, sweat and tears.","'Apocalypse Now (1979)' is a beast of a film. It's an odyssey unlike any other, one that's just as interesting and tumultuous behind-the-scenes as on the screen, and you can almost feel the blood, sweat and tears dripping from every frame, with our protagonist's sanity coming only as close to breaking as Coppola's must have been. The result of the entire ordeal is an experience that's difficult to describe. It has an impact but also lacks a certain something, that intangible connection, that would really make it 'pop', so to speak. It's much easier to appreciate from a technical stand-point than it is from a narrative, as the latter is loose and unfocused while also lacking a real resolution. It may be the lax structure, which doesn't place all that much outward emphasis on character growth or 'plot-points', that leads the ending to feel less like a completion of an arc and more like the fulfilment of an inevitability. Still, there is a compelling exploration of theme occurring here. The way the piece uses its central conflict of Willard and Kurtz, who aren't really at odds but are simply told to be 'enemies', as a way of exploring the wider conflict is subtle but inspired. The story is a very personal one, but moments of Vietnam War examination and commentary seep into the narrative in interesting and unconventional ways. It's these moments that work perhaps the best, with the genuine spectacle combining with the horrors of war to make a comment on the 'validity' of - or Coppola's general feeling towards - the whole situation. When the piece slows down, however, the contemplative tone and harsh, hard-boiled narration can't always keep up with the expectations that have been previously set by vivid montages and brilliant practicality. There is a palpable dread that builds up as we float along the river, though, and eking out the meeting of our hero and his supposed foe is a wise move. When they do meet, their clash is marred slightly by Brando's ill-prepared performance which, while occasionally commanding, is generally not up to par and doesn't meet the admittedly elusive standards set by all the flick's foreshadowing. There's also a sour note when the real slaughter of a water buffalo comes into play, something which Copolla has since tried to downplay. This is an uncomfortable moment that is unfortunately extended and interwoven with a key scene, making for a cringe-inducing finale that honestly plays in pretty poor-taste - even if the contrasting symbolism of the two in-universe events works well. Overall, the film is an engaging and strangely hypnotic one that works when it works but does suffer from slow segments and some areas of discomfort. It is built upon spectacular spectacle and clearly took a lot of time, effort and talent to make. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
pretentious piece of sh.t,"This movie was just plain bad. I have never reviewed a movie here in my four years of browsing the site, but never in my days of watching movies have I been so infuriated by a film. For starters, the movie just doesn't make any sense. There is no logical transition from scene to scene. As I was watching this movie, I found myself actually TRYING to convince myself that it was good, that at some point during this overdone, self-righteous piece of poo, that some semblance of a theme or motif would come into play. No: The movie continues to lead you down the linear path of the story. I now see where Charlie Sheen inheritted his blank stare acting prowess from that he so consistently displays on a weekly basis in his new sitcom. Well, I guess it is the apocalypse NOW because I've read that Two and a Half Men is the top viewed sitcom on network television. And guess what, this is the 36th ranked FREAKING movie on IMDb. I never thought that a single movie could cause me to never want to watch another movie of the same GENRE. THATS how bad this movie was. 3 hours and 20 minutes of my life, wasted So I thought that, although I normally don't review movies here, why not put in another 2 minutes so maybe, just MAYBE, I could have done some good by watching this movie. That good will be if I can manage to convince even one potential viewer to avoid this overdone pretentious Francis Ford Coppola bullshit. So as far as I'm concerned, IMDb and every movie critic out there has lost all credibility.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
What more would you expect from Coppola?,"I'm almost embarrassed that as a big movie fan I had not seen this title sooner so I finally rented it and decided to see what it was all about. I went into it expecting a good film as just about all of Coppola's are but what I found was an incredible experience that takes you straight into the hearts and minds of the actors. I think the two keys to the film's success in the sense of pulling the viewer in is its acting and the cinematography.Firstly, the cinematography is absolutely masterful and shows Coppola's supreme understanding of the camera. The shots which I was most enthralled with were the POV shots from the boat is which as the viewer you would feel like you were on the boat, being pushed through the smoke and humidity. At times I almost felt as if I was on a theme park ride, something like Universal's Jurrasic Park ride, it gave that much of a feeling of putting you in the point of view of the actors and their situations. I also liked his use of rack focus shots where during conversations he would use the technique rather then adding more unnecessary cuts. Really a supreme example of cinematographic mastery.Secondly, the acting was outright incredible, Martin Sheen completely played his roll down to the nuances and was backed up by a seamless cast pinnacling with Marlon Brando. Definitely felt for them to the point where when they greeted someone, I almost nodded my head with them. This could only have happened through the superb acting and cinematographic POV. Definitely one of the great films up there with the Godfathers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"This film was released wide in the USA on August 15th, 1979","This film is one of the most fantastic war films ever made. The nightmarish scenes, that director Francis Ford Coppola created, are some of the best ever filmed. Add in the riveting, freaky soundtrack by Francis and his father Carmine Coppola and it is a drug-induced entry into the darkness of war from there. All of these factors help enhance the brutal situation that Martin Sheen finds himself, in Apocalypse Now (1979). A tired, drunk, American military officer, Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen), stationed in Vietnam, has to go on a mission to kill a highly decorated officer, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has lost his mind and gone rogue. He is in this condition obviously due to effects from the war. Willard is escorted on his mission to Cambodia by a group of wet-behind-the-ears soldiers on a small river boat. They also run into a lunatic helicopter officer, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who loves to surf the Vietnam beaches. Before I go further, I also should mention, that I have seen the original, 147 minute, theatrical version of this film many times, however for this review I watched Coppola's 2001, 202 minute long, Apocalypse Now Redux.The use of slow-motion photography, editing and atmospherically generated imagery is uncanny. The utilization of different colors and the use of audio is brilliant. Willard makes his way down the nightmarish Nung River, to locate Kurtz and runs into a nutty photographer (Dennis Hopper), who also has lost his mind. The natives of the area think of Kurtz as something, much like a god. Willard must then figure out what he should or should not do in deciding Kurtz' fate. There is not a single actor, seen with a flaw, in the film. The film does slow down near the end a little, but it really does not take away from the film's overall, brilliant impact. You must see this film in order to see the greatness of Francis Ford Coppola. You also must remember, that Coppola went through his own personal nightmare, while making this film (see Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991). That nightmare is seen as the mood of the film. That mood reflects off the screen Coppola's feelings, which are mixed in with the plight of the characters, making the film perfectly descriptive of the nightmare of war. You also should read up on what Martin Sheen sacrificed for this role. It truly is a film of epic processes in filmmaking.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"See the ""Redux"" version!","The re-cut version of this famous film (""Apocolypse Now: Redux"", 2001) takes this classic to a new level.  Ten years removed from the near-mythic stories about the film itself and the making of it, as well as from the actual events of Viet Nam (which it is not about, by the way), serves this film enormously. It allows the film itself more room to stand on its own somehow.But more importantly, the added footage (which is quite significant, 49 min. I think) makes the film a much more profound and more eloquent piece of cinema.  The emotional life is filled out, the journey itself is more understandable, and the theme of the film more powerfully explicit than in the original release (which followed the ""action"" more closely).  See this film if for no other reason than to see how small the aspirations of current filmmakers seem to have become.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Best Ford Coppola Film, Maybe even war film","Whenever someone talks about the best Ford Coppola film, most will tell you its the Godfather, and when someone talks about the best war film most will tell you its Saving Private Ryan. While both films, huge in popularity, are undeniably masterpieces, I personally this film surpasses both of them. To a degree its just my personal taste, I like films that are stylistic and more abstract but still engaging, but I think that it definitely needs to be considered one of the best. I know many people consider it as a classic, but according to IMDb user reviews, interstellar is a better film, and saying that is a sin. Interstellar needs to be pushed down, this one being pushed up. What makes Apocalypse Now such an interesting war film is how it handles the war it is in. The book, Heart of Darkness, isn't even set during a war, being a story on insanity. I think setting it in the Vietnam War is great, because not only does it feel familiar to the African Jungles with the natives, but it also focuses more on the psychology effects rather than the physical. I like films like Platoon, Deer Hunter, and Casualties of War, but not only do the feel quite similar in tone, but they feel like the focus on the brutal aspects of Vietnam too much to me. In the war casualties weren't high (for the American side at least) and it wasn't particularly difficult, compared to WW1 or 2. But psychologically, it was damaging, forcing soldiers to kill civilians, de humanize the enemy and eventually themselves. For those reasons that those films fail, both Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and this film are able to ascend the typical Vietnam film, and to me, actually become poignant. I don't want to ruin any particular scene for anyone who might actually want to watch this film (YOU SHOULD) but just know that 1. The performances are all great, especially from Robert duvall, martin sheen and Marlon Brando. The film can get pretty intense, and sometimes a bit difficult to watch. The last 30 minutes or so are insane, and to me great. To me the film isn't a movie with one highlight, and then the rest not being able to top it. I love Saving Private Ryan, but it is a good example of a film where the Beach scene is so good that nothing ever tops it again, making some scenes personally not as powerful. In this film, you think nothing will ever top the Flight of the Valkyrie scene, everything is constantly proving this film doesn't just have one great scene, but is a variety of great scenes folding together with context, and a film that greatly shows the dehumanizing aspects of war. Overall this is definitely a film in my top 5, my personal favorite Coppola and war film. If you haven't seen this film, you are doing yourself a disservice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Awesome portrayal of Vietnam War,"If there was ever a movie that explains the horrors, atrocities, and abuse of power during wars, this is the movie all people should see.

I was hypnotized by the scene of darkness and the nihilism that the movie showed. The direction of Francis Ford Coppola was just incredible, the actors were brilliant. I couldn't imagine what Martin Sheen went through in order to prepare for the role of Lt. Willard and the animalistic approach of surviving and adapting to the situation was breathtakingly stunning. Marlon Brando lived up to his image as an American icon with his portrayal of the maniacal, god fearing Kurtz and Robert Duvall was almost comical, yet surprising incredible as Col. Kilgore.The attitude of the Americans as the superhero was evident in this movie and with the defeat of the ""superhero"" by the ""villians"" the communists, the movie showed that with wars - no one really wins and with only lives lost.

The best movie I've ever seen?,"Well maybe not the best movie I have seen but it's in my Top 10 for sure.

I think calling it only a ""war movie"" is taking away from how great this movie is.  It doesn't just have the simple ""war is hell"" message that many war films have.  It asks more piercing questions about human nature and character.  It is drama, war, action, art, and manages to be entertaining as well as thought provoking.  Even if the ideas don't grab you there are 3 things you cannot deny of this movie. 1)the acting is all top-notch  2)the cinematography is some of the best ever 3)it is well written.

I find this film to be a commentary on the dispute between Conrad-who set a meditation on the void at the heart of European society-in Africa and Achebe who found this an affront for the same reason; the Africa of the story is rather distant and the Africans shadows in the distance. Not only do the Europeans nick the continent off its rightful owners but they don't even give the locals a cameo appearance! This is reflected in the film where Vietnamese people exist to get shot or fall for Kurtz's not so crypto-fascism. By the last third of the film the action is in Willard's head-will he join Kurtz like Colby the first assassin-or do the suits' dirty work. He does neither-killing Kurtz allows Kurtz to expiate his sins and release the locals from their false God at the same time releasing Willard from his dependence on the suits for a ""mission"". By killing Kurtz Willard confronts his heart of darkness gaining the possibility to become older and wiser.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This movie is not from this world,"Were they not the real soldiers? Was it not the real war? Was that not the real horror? Have the people not really gone insane? Was the movie really made on this planet and by some mortal human beings? Was it a video documentary or was it a movie made 5 years after the real war? Yes, to all of the above, but I have never ever seen any movie so close to reality or actually real. It was not a war movie, it was not a drama, it was simply a deeply touching horror drama. I am still wondering what should I make out of this movie, should I feel anything, should I be sorry about anybody – if yes, about who?? American soldiers, Vietnamese, those tribals, each one of these or nobody? Coppola doesn't leave anything obvious and everything is open to your own interpretation – he is at his arrogant best. Man, it takes inhuman guts to make such a movie or even think of doing it. He was fortunate to supported by such a able and gutsy team of editors, script writer, screenplay writers, cinematographer and so many other people. I am really surprised and disappointed that this movie was not awarded academy for Film Editing – it's as ridiculous as it can be. My head still spins from imagining all these people living in those swamps and malaria invested waters for almost 2 years.Talking about the cast, I would rather say that movie and its makers go way beyond the cast. Any other actors may have done equal justice (if not less) to the movie. This may sound highly uncharitable, especially to Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall (I don't mention Brando – he was rather a waste, Coppola may have utilized that money somewhere else – am I speaking out of my shoes?? ). Sheen was awesome awesome and hats off to all his effort, and it was rather wise (or fortunate) not to have Al Pacino in his place, but the movie is not about Captain Willard, Col. Kilgore and Col. Kurtz, it about everything around each of them – it goes way beyond all these people.In the end, ""The End"" will stay as my personal favorite for the most apt movie soundtrack of all times.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Watching this new transfer and cut of Apocalypse at BFI's IMAX was like watching it for the first time;,"It was surprising, shocking, frightening and hypnotic; I was amazed that the film played out completely different to how I remembered it. It really is a masterclass on delivering something esoteric and meaningful and really the quintessential (as it should be) journey into the Heat of Darkness, and yet also still utterly and completely a movie, and not an experiment or a passion piece so awkward as to not be able to enjoy it just as a movie. It strikes a perfect equilibrium and harmony with its message, cultural zeitgeist, its creators (Milius and Coppola), and its inspired material.
Regarding the image, it's mind-blowing, the rich colour-timing pops and yet is seamless, and the quality of the image is used to tremendous effect on those close-ups, where the actors are looking right into you.
Regarding the cut itself I almost knocked half a star off for the plantation scene; a scene that is fine on home video, but on the silver screen breaks the pace; stalling the way on to the ending, it provides commentary to something best left to stings of dialogue and visuals and editing instead of table scenes, and then culminates with a cringe-inducing score while Willard is seduced by the French Woman. A brief dinner scene showing the generational opinions and then the opium scene would have still held the essence instead of feeling completely out of place. There's also a palpable smidge too much of Duvall.
Watching it this time, the sound effects were so ahead of their time, they are perfect, and I've never really heard the score for this movie before, this time I thought it was sumptuous; a mix of dreamlike and grounded, somewhere else; modern and timeless.
There was a pre-filmed QnA afterwards with Soderbergh which was nice to watch, but alerted me to the excellent and enlightening Coppola/Miulius 2008 interview that can now be found on YouTube which made me appreciate the collaboration and humility of the filmmakers even more.
Apocalypse is unique, it's perfect, it's powerful and important in both the human heart and cinema. It's a masterclass and the scope, amount of extras, breadth of sets, intensity of the realism; of it all speaks to a bygone era in a powerful way; the way helicopters land so close to us in a way they never could now without CGI, the destruction that connects us to the destruction of the American machine during Vietnam, it's out of this world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Breath-taking!,"War has been the theme of many of the greatest movies of all times, such as Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"", Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", Stone's ""Platoon"" and Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"". These films  are living examples of Hollywood passion for military conflict, mainly World War II and Vietnam War. It's interesting how we can never ignore this movies, full of battles, shots and explosions.I'm sure it's not easy for the directors to rule such big projects where a numerous cast is involved and millions of dollars are spent. We can't deny these characteristics attract us, once we realise we have seen all the cited movies lots of times.""Apocalypse Now"" is something we just cannot miss at all. Coppola's direction is wonderful and the cast counts on Marlon Brandon, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishbourne, Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford. The plot itself is different from anything we have seen in the genre of films: Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Brando) is a dissident officer who lives somewhere in Asia leading his own army and obeying his own laws. This makes Capt. Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) goes out in a mission to get Kurtz.

With a production shoot that has in itself become legendary, Coppola's flawed masterpiece has been dissected and argued over to within an inch of its magnificent life. People will continue to write about it for ever more it seems, perhaps there might even be the odd new confrontational spin on what resides within? But ultimately it's what the individual takes away from the film that matters, our own interpretations key to the enjoyment of such a disturbing vision of war and violence.Many of the set-pieces, dialogue and characters have long since passed into folklore, and rightly so. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter assault, Kurtz's surreal death camp, the boat people massacre, purple haze, the playmates, Kilgore, and of course the horror, the horror..indeed. The performances match the quality of Storaro's sumptuous Philippines photography, Sheen is fiercely committed and Duvall and Hopper in turn are powerhouse and edgy. While Brando, doing his own bizzaro thing in the last third, brings a little chaos unintentionally in keeping with the madness at the heart of this particular darkness.Personally that last draggy third does stop it from being a complete genius type whole, but everything up to it is so damn good it's arguably churlish to expect perfection? But as near perfection movies go, Apocalypse Now proudly sits with the best of them, sitting there with a harrowed look upon its face. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Redux version is HORRIBLE. stick with the original,"''Apocalypse now'' has two versions. The original, which was out in 1979 and the Redux version from 2001, which extends the whole picture by approximately 49 minutes of cut out footage. So let it make it perfectly clear. I am reviewing the REDUX version and NOT the original, which, in my opinion, is outstanding and MUCH better than this pointless waste of effort. Now. Every technical element from the picture such as sound effects, original soundtracks, camera quality IS actually as decent as from the original, perhaps even better. But this is not actually important, is it now. I mean, you most certainly do not want to watch an extended version of ''Apocalypse Now'' just for a 'smoother' result, now do you. The main point of this new version was to get to see the movie completely uncut, to view the original with all it's cut out footage. And that, dear friends, is an absolute let down. The majority of the new footage is mostly simply pointless and boring to watch. In fact these missing scenes are SO dull, that they actually cast a sort of a shadow on the original movie in this version, thus making the whole 3 hours and 16 minutes of this film look weak and frustrating to sit through. Never have I been so disappointed in an extended version of a great film.NOT Recommended. It's pointless, TOO LONG, and boring. And if you already saw the original, you can just see it once more. It is definitely better than watching this extended version, which, in conclusion, is A WASTE OF OVER 3 HOURS.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Director's cut or director's nightmare?,"Let me first state that I consider ""Apocalypse Now"" in my top 5 best films of all times and the botched, bloated Redux version will not change my opinion. When I first saw the film it was more than just a motion picture, it was a horrifying exploration into the Vietnam war and just like Coppola has stated that it ""was not a film about the Vietnam war, but the Vietnam war"", the picture gripped me more than any before or any after. It is truly a film masterpiece in every respect. Unfortunately the new Redux version is something else. First of all, it incorporates three sequences (the Playboy bunnies in a stranded helicopter, the French plantation and its strange ghost-like characters and the ridiculous scene of Kurtz reading paragraphs from Time magazine to a tied-up Willard), which should have remained in their natural habitat: the cutting-room floor. The rest of the film is a strange mixture of scenes successfully extended to give more insight into the characters, or the excellent dissolve montage at the beginning with the ceiling fan, the stealing of Colonel Kilgore's surfing board, the expansion of Kurtz's dialogue near the end where he comes in and out of shadows, but gone is the tight and to the point editing that turned this river journey from a terrifying and gripping nightmare into a milk run or travelogue more suited for the Discovery or History Channels. They should have followed Willard's advice after the tiger incident: ""don't ever get off the boat again"". One scene in special comes to mind: the one where they open fire on the innocent Vietnamese on the boat that they meet in the river. In the original version this scene came at a moment that the tension in the film was so high that the gunner's reaction was totally motivated and came about as a release to the nervous tension that had everyone in the boat on the edge of insanity. In the new version the killing becomes just a senseless massacre without any motivation at all. And there are many other instances just like it, but hard to pin down from seeing this version only once. Also, the absence of the original ending is a big disappointment. Anyhow, it is sad to see that even with 22 years of hindsight, Coppola still doesn't have the necessary objectivity to manipulate his material again. A prettier, larger package doesn't necessarily make a better film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The horror of war, its beauty on film.","Between 1979 and 1987, three of the most poignant, relevant filmmakers of the time all left their stamp on different aspects of the Vietnam War. Oliver Stone addressed the duality of men in Platoon, Stanley Kubrick showcased breeding insanity versus the will to stay alive in Full Metal Jacket, and Francis Ford Coppola presented a mind-bending insight into war as an illusionary trip. And while my personal favourite among these films changes regularly, one thing I am sure of is that they are all masterpieces, and Apocalypse Now, for this week at least, may be the best of the lot.Martin Sheen is Captain Ben Willard, tasked with the covert mission of venturing deep into the jungles of Cambodia to locate and assassinate Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz, a once-promising soldier, has since abandoned the needs of his country and gone completely insane, setting himself up as a god among a native tribe and ruling with dictatorial brutality.The movie is more road trip than firefight, but I don't mean to sound condescending at all. Most of the film consists of Willard and his small group of soldiers making the trek to Kurtz's stronghold, encountering bizarre characters and scenarios along the way. The most prominent of these is Lieutenant Kilgore (Robert Duvall, rounding up the Godfather reunion), a surfie soldier who'd be terrifying if he weren't so welcoming.It is from this point onwards that Apocalypse Now transcends the standard parameters of a war film and becomes a hallucinogenic cinematic experience. Many scenes convey such unique, unheard-of aspects of war that they leave you wondering whether what you just saw was real, or an alternate perception of reality seen through the eyes of the drug-taking soldiers. Visual bewilderment is on high supply during the set action pieces as well, with their abrupt ending having the effect of taking repeated blows to the head, then having to get back up as quickly as possible.But the otherworldly nature of the film is best reflected in the cinematography and sound. Deep shades of orange, gold and purple engulf almost every moment, and the sparing yet effective use of superimposed imagery compounds the eeriness. As for audio, it is easy to point to the excellent use of Ride of the Valkyries during Kilgore's air raid, but that is just scratching the surface. A haunting half-electronic, half-orchestral score dominates the rest of the film, while extracts of The End (by The Doors, a band that has always had a strange resonance with the Vietnam War) complete a flawless technical display.As Willard and Kurtz meet for the first time, Apocalypse Now goes into thematic overdrive. Most obvious is the old notion that absolute power corrupts absolutely. As the film progresses, we learn that Kurtz's desire to return home diminishes in contrast with his growing godly stature. But the film goes on to raise all sorts of questions regarding vanity and pride in the self, as well as the moral implications of death, and if it can accepted in certain circumstances.Finally, I feel obliged to mention an event towards the end of the movie, without giving away any major plot points. The climax is intercut with the infamous real-life slaughter of a water buffalo, which occurs in a most inhumane manner. Whether Coppola was justified in his actions (by simply filming an event that was going to be carried out by the natives anyway) depends on which sources you choose to believe. From a purely cinematic perspective, though, it compliments the climax in spectacular fashion. But just as concerning is the aftermath. As the characters that continue to live ponder their actions, the ending is ambiguous in the way that we, as the audience, can only imagine how the evils they have seen will torture them long after the film's events have ended. All the while the war rages on.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"Apolcalypse Now Redux, Good to be bored.","All the best scenes in this movie are from the original version, but still I like the Redux version better. That might be because I saw the Redux version first and that might be because I want one of my favorite movies of all time to have some length. But I think the biggest reason is that it isn't the same kind of journey without the Redux material. I prefer to be a bit bored in some minutes and tackle with themes like the french point of war in the war and go deeper on what the soldiers did under the war to give me an ending I like more but especially like the movies more when I think about it, with all this great themes and message this movie tackle along the way.So my theory is this.Sometimes it's good to be bored. You might not look at the Redux material and are entertained but when you finally comes to the finally it's so much more epic and it really feels like they have done everything they could with the material. It almost feel like it's another movie but it have a clear red line and goal which is very important.This is a war masterpiece with outstanding special effects, top notch acting, fantastic camera work and so many great messages about war especially in the Redux version. It have great sound effects and a fantastic red line from start to finish. All around this is the greatest war movie of all time.This is of course my favorite war movie and my 2nd/3 favorite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Ebert was Right!!!,"As a Cinema Studies major, I'm forced to constantly rely on video tapes and DVDs to study movies I have to write about in more detail.  There are HUGE conveniences to these media: the ability to move forward and backwards within the film with ease, the low cost, the lack of a need to get myself a large screen and a projectionist, etc.  I've always been a big lover of watching movies on the big screen for the enhanced size of the image, thus making it easier to catch small nuances in shot composition, and because of the ever increasing awe of modern sound systems.  I don't think films like ""Black Hawk Down"" would work without massive, multidirectional audio.  Well, Apocalypse Now Redux proved something further to me...  film projection makes everything just look better.When I caught the Redux at an Oberlin Film Series screening, I was absolutely FLOORED by the depth and variety of color and light at work in this film.  I'll admit to not particularly liking some of the added scenes. The dialogue in the plantation sequence was VERY heavy-handed and not in the poetic manner of much of the dialogue in other parts of the film.  But the images... I was drawn into the film on the pure power of seeing film as a medium in its most powerful form.  From the opening explosions to the haunting sound of the Doors, to the scene of Martin Sheen rising from the mud, the film was as textured and palpable as a Van Gogh painting.  I've never once had any kind of illegal substance, let alone hallucinogens in my life, but I felt out of body watching this movie.  I was awestruck at the sheer power of a film's imagery.  Watching this film, I fell in love with movies again.  Thank you, Mr. Coppola.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Saigon Sh*t!!,"On first viewing of this film I found the story so awful it was painful to watch. I wanted to forget it; but once seen this film lives on in one's memory. Clearly it is a highly allegorical work as is the novel it is derived from : ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad. It says much about the human condition in general not only within the context of war. Strictly speaking the film charts Willard's path through hell and ultimately to redemption. In reality Martin Sheen, who plays Willard, did practically the same thing. Reputedly smoking and drinking just a shade too much until half way through the filming he suffered a heart attack. Coppola's own path through this jungle of a film was equally harassing (watch ""Hearts of Darkness"" to get a better perspective on the making of the movie) resulting on the shoot taking far longer than originally planned. It's difficult now not to elide fact with fiction when discussing this film. Even before it was released I can remember newspaper headlines asking ""Apocalypse When?"" In the event the film was at last completed with the result that it is probably the most searing war film or any other kind of film you are likely to see. The acting throughout is brilliant from Sheen and Duvall, and fascinatingly quirky from Brando and Hopper. The cinematography is breathtaking and the use of music inspired. I cannot count the number of times I have seen it and it still thrills and enlightens me. A must for any DVD collection. P.S. Don't see the REDUX version.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Robert Duvall had the best performance in the film as Colonel Kilgore. He had a small role but he had a great performance. Now that's a military dude. The story of this film was excellent, a plot for the ages. I liked how Francis Ford Coppola made the characters of the film develop with explosive performances like Lance, The ""Chef"", Clean, and Captain Willard.

One of the Best Films In the History of Cinema,"It is difficult for me to write a comment for ""Apocalypse Now"". The numerous reviews that have been made by prestigious critics and experts about this monumental film since its release, make my comments seem a bit redundant. Nevertheless, I strongly feel obliged to submit some thoughts about this fantastic movie.First of all, I subscribe to the view expressed by many, that ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the best films in the history of cinema. It combines many things: Drama, action, emotions, art, mysticism, scenery, philosophy, are some elements that come in mind when one talks about ""AN"". In fact, there are so many angles that this film can been seen through, that it is nearly impossible to categorize it: Is it a war film? Is it a philosophical one? Is it an art movie? ""AN"" partially fits in lots of categories, and doesn't fully fit in any one of them at the same time...Under the masterful direction of Coppola, ""AN"" recounts the story of Capt. Willard (Sheen), who while serving in Vietnam, is ordered to carry out a rather unconventional mission: He must find and ""terminate"" Col. Kurz (Brando), an erstwhile brilliant officer, who has now gone insane; Kurz has gathered a private ""army"" by locals who worship him like a god, and he has disappeared with them somewhere in Cambodia. Willard begins his journey with a handful of accompanying sailors, and during their voyage they encounter several surreal situations. Moreover, Willard, who is in the border of insanity himself, studies the file of Kurz and starts to deeply admire the man. What will happen when he finally meets him?I wouldn't need here to say anything about the breath-taking performances of Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando, as they are the point of reference for many drama classes. I would only like to add that ALL the performances in ""AN"", are worthy of the film's status.There many things to be said about ""AN"", and as I explained in the beginning, if someone wants to explore further, there are several sources to look at. The only thing I would like to add here before concluding is that this is a film which will never lose its beauty, no matter how many years pass. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A descent into madness...,"Masterful. How do you tell who's sane and who isn't when the troops and the officials are all in the war for the wrong reasons?

They weren't just goofing off in front of the camera, they lived this; and the arduous shoot became a reference point for future troubled productions. The sacrifices were worth it, though; because the end results are nothing short of stunning...I never understood all the hype around Marlon Brando before I saw this. In ""The Godfather"" he didn't seem to be stretching himself; but he blew me away here. He's not alone; as an acclaimed cast and director joined together to make not just the finest Vietnam movie ever made; but a work that is easily one of the best films of all time, in its own right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Amazing,"Growing up in the 90's i haven't experienced many amazing movies. The closest i ever got to cinema salvation was the Godfather, which is my second favorite movie. Two years ago me and my friend became obsessed with movie making and movies. First, watching movies that dealt with subjects we were interested in, war and action. Then we got into movies that showed artistic edge in which we had never experienced. Apocalypse Now, one of the hundreds of movies I've watched is still my all time favorite. A masterpiece in cinema, a very edgy movie dealing with Vietnam. The movies starts out dark with a very twisted humorous feeling almost. As we see Martin Sheen travels down the river things become twisted and disillusioned, becoming a symbolic representation of war and life. I give it 10/10, it's not for everyone. The movie needs to be watched more than once to fully grasp its artistic nature. I hope this helped, pz.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Baring of the human soul,"What can I say about this film is that it's simply one of the best ever. Francis Ford Coppola shows us the deepest emptiness of the human soul that the ruins of war mean. If you have read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", the book in which the movie's concept is based, you will understand the parallelism between the original and the Marlon Brando's Kurtz, the character who symbolizes the greatest and the lowest of the human being.I want to write a meaningful comment, that's because I'm going to talk about the metaphysical part of this movie. There is a lot of comments talking about the movie itself, so read them if you are looking for that.Apocalypse Now is a war movie that encloses a deeper story; the journey of a man who is caught between war and peace, death and life, and doesn't find any meaning for both of them. When his superiors task him an extra-official mission, he is involved in the chase of a ghost, a man who is apparently mad but whose actions in the current war seem to be brilliant. Captain Benjamin L. Willard finds himself chasing a man who admires in order to kill him, although he doesn't know what he will do when he faces Kurtz. In his path Willard have to confront the horrors of war, which degenerate forth to complete madness, nonsense and death like the most terrible nightmare.The rest is history. I think that the Redux version adds darkness and daze to the original Apocalypse Now, deepening more in its real meaning; not only an anti-war movie but the baring of the human soul.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
apocalypse now,"This is by far the best war movie to have come out yet. As the story progresses you become more engrossed in what is happening to Captian Willard and the crew.

It also blends images, music, and moods well not to mention has great special effects that look like the movie was filmed during the war. Redux version offers us a little more into the characters. One of my favorite lines in Redux is when the crew asks Willard if he likes it hot while ditching the air cavalry. He replies by saying "" it's sure as ---- better than seeing what you can become in some factory in Ohio."" Willards journey into the jungle makes him start realizing how Kurtz the renegade colonel has been affected by the war into what seems like insanity but is clarity. "" Never get off the boat.

A Truly Unique Portrayal of the Horrors of War,"Apocalypse Now is a very unusual portrayal of the Vietnam War. It's not the most realistic interpretation of the conflict, and it is very surreal.One problem that I frequently find with war films is that often, especially when showing intense battles, the plot can be difficult to follow. Another major issue is that, especially when there is a large cast, it can be hard to distinguish the main cast.Neither of these problems are present in Apocalypse now. Despite it's surreal nature, the film's plot is actually reasonably straight forward and summed up in the trailer: Willard is ordered to find Colonel Kurtz and terminate his command, then takes a patrol boat with four other men up the Nung River o Kurtz's compound.The majority of the main plot is confined to the patrol boat, dealing with various problems that the main cast encounters over the course of the journey.The cast is actually pretty easy to tell apart. There are five main characters aboard the boat, and all of them have distinctive features which allow them to be recognized instantly.The acting is also brilliant. Martin Sheen is great as Captain Willard, a soldier whose mind has been completely messed up by his experiences in the war. The rest of the main cast (including a really young Lawrence Fishbourne) does great as well, making them very easy to relate to.Most of the other actors have very brief roles, and you won't see much of them, but they are still very memorable. The most famous is Robert Duvall's appearance as Lt. Colonel Bill Kilgore, an air cavalry officer who takes a bit too much pleasure out of the war, playing 'Ride of the Valkyries' while attacking a village and then having his men surf in the middle of the battle.Also notable is Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz, the insane officer whom Willard is sent to kill. His first scene is probably his best, in which both Kurtz and Willard are only partially visible in the dim light.Other supporting actors include Harrison Ford's brief appearance as Colonel Lucas, the officer who assigns Willard his mission; and Dennis Hopper as an annoying photojournalist who admires Kurtz. Both manage to put on great performances.Overall, Apocalypse Now is a very unusual and brilliant portrayal of the Vietnam War. It is very effective in illustrating the insanity that took place, and if you interested in war films, you will definitely have to check it out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A most unusual masterpiece.,"This movie is extremely odd. Looking at this movie makes it obvious that most of the cast and crew were on drugs during filming. The end movie result, is an unique one of a kind movie experience and quite possible the best Vietnam war movie ever made. It's not a movie for everyone though, guess true movie buffs are the only ones who can truly wholeheartedly appreciate this movie and the 'beauty' of all the ugliness in the movie.The movie makes a perfect statement as an anti-war movie. It shows the horror of war and what it does to men. I have to admit that my favorite parts of the movie were the ones with action in it. The chopper attack is truly splendid and a real classic moment of movie history. Still this is not really a movie about shooting and fighting. Its more a movie about the emotional struggles of men during war. The struggles of the main character Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) are told in a most excellent, slow, compelling way. He becomes more and more obsessed and interested in the man he is supposed to 'terminate with extreme prejudice', during his journey over the river to Cambodia, where Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), the man he is supposed to kill, is located. Once the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the journey and the emotional struggles seem to be more difficult and dangerous than the killing of Kurtz.What makes the movie work are the good and realistically brought characters and the actors that portray them. All of the characters are stereotypes in a way, which works extremely well for the movie and its story. Brando is totally flipped in his role as 'crazy' mumbling Colonel Kurtz and even though his role isn't THAT big (ironic sentence, considering the fact that Brando was 40kg overweight, for his role), he still makes a lasting impression. Also totally crazy is Dennis Hopper in his role as American photojournalist that lives under Kurtz. Robert Duvall also gives a most excellent performance as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore. Rest of the cast consists out of big names as Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, G.D. Spradlin and a 14-year old Laurence Fishburne, in one of his first movie roles.The movie has a fantastic and kind if surreal atmosphere, which makes this movie one of the most moody movies ever made, also thanks to the Oscar winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro.Perhaps the whole story surrounding the making of this movie (Sheen's heart-attack, the difficult overweight Brando, the drug abuse, the 16 months of filming in the jungle, the three year editing process.) is more legendary than the movie itself, it still is a classic, one of a kind movie, that might very well be the best Vietnam-war movie (yet).9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now is one of the most disturbing and powerful films of all time,"A stunning masterpiece from the director of the Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola. Apocalypse Now is set during the Vietnam War. It follows the quest of a man called Captain Willard who receives orders to travel up river and locate a renegade officer, the mysterious Colonel Kurtz. Once located Willard is ordered to 'terminate his command with extreme prejudice'. The only problem with this is that as the quest progresses Willard begins to see parts of himself in Kurtz and begins to identify with is intended victim.With an infamous reputation and a cast to match, I built Apocalypse Now up to be a life changing experience. One thing I can say about it is that it stands out among the bombardment of films that my brain has been subjected to over the years. It had a reputation as being a bit of a let down in Coppola's eyes as he spent far too much money for what the film eventually grossed at the box office. To be fair to Coppola, anything that follows a film as prolific and influential as the Godfather would be hard pushed to surpass its predecessor. I believe that Apocalypse Now does this and at the risk of making myself unpopular with all you film buffs out there I believe that Apocalypse Now is twice the film The Godfather is. It is a film that I attempted to watch numerous times but just couldn't concentrate on it, dare I say it I found it tedious. I just couldn't understand how it had the reputation it does. As a film man I very rarely switch a film off but I did this one, at least the first ten attempts. I then was sitting bored the other night and swore to myself that it was something I just had to do so I sat down, stuck the DVD on and started drinking a large cup of coffee. Two and a half hours later I was mesmerised. Some may say it was the coffee, I say it was the film, but never the less that night I just could not sleep with excitement. Apocalypse Now is one of the most disturbing and powerful films of all time, it reflects the true limits of the human mind and demonstrates ideally how our ideology changes in different situations. A true masterpiece of epic proportions, that if stuck with will make you a truly richer person.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Kurtz (Marlon Brando), Martin Sheen has what was probably the best role of his career.Above all, the movie is staunchly anti-war, even more so than ""The Deer Hunter""; ""Apocalypse Now"" condemns the fact that we were in Vietnam to begin with. The Playboy bunny scene not only shows that the GIs were shown the most despicable stuff for entertainment, but it shows that if you expect to create such emotions, don't expect to be able to control them (in that scene, you can see Vietnamese people outside the compound, and you can only imagine how disgusted they must be at American ""entertainment"").Col. Kilgore is of course the ultimate rah-rah military type. Among other things, this ""patriot"" ignores a wounded man, preferring instead to go surfing. He doesn't even flinch when there's an explosion. As he cynically notes: ""Charlie don't surf."" All in all, ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. With top notch performances by the stars and great support from Frederic Forrest, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Sam Bottoms and Harrison Ford, this is one movie that everyone should see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Seriously pretentious yet essential viewing.,"It is the only movie in film history to be both pretentious and utterly essential viewing. The helicopter raid, the movie's standout scene on an ill-fated Vietnamese village, is simply mind-blowing and one of the finest action sequences ever committed to the silver screen. Francis Ford Coppola was wise to stick with such quality actors, he'd previously used in both 'The Godfather' and 'The Conversation', chiefly Robert Duvall as the crazed, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (of the Air Cavalry), Marlon Brando (as the hunted and out of shape -Kurtz) and Gene Hackman (in a lessor role). 'Apocalypse Now' is not just about the horror of war (though it naturally depicts this in large doses) but also deals with the mayhem and absolute chaos that was Vietnam. This anti-war classic has never really dated like other, later 'Nam' movies such as 'Platoon' and to be honest it's impossible to imagine a film of such magnitude, cost and physical endurance ever being produced in today's climate (in fact it would be nigh on impossible). The psychedelic soundtrack (including music) by 'The Doors, together with some brilliant method acting by Martin Sheen, who replaced Harvey Keitel (as the man with a mission), and some rather intense improvisation by madcap Denis Hopper (as a rogue photojournalist), make it seem like one bad but beautiful acid trip. The way longer 'Redux' release, with previously deleted scenes, slows the pace but is still an interesting watch and a huge must for the fans; so basically you will need to own and savour both versions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the Finest Examples of American Cinema - Ever!,"I love movies, from Chaplin, Garbo, Bogart, bad 50s Sci-Fi, Plan B, Giant, Hud, sixties counter-culture, Airplane, Ahnold, Dr Evil, everything from outstanding to truly bad, I love movies.

Now, 23 years later, I have seen Redux (four times this week!) and I must say that AN (and Redux) are STILL the finest ever!

A good film that could have been better.,"This film is one of the more disappointing ""great"" films I've yet to see. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a _good_ movie.  The cinematography is excellent, I thought the Helicopter attack scene was magnificent, and the performances by Sheen, Duvall, and to an extent, Brando's as well, and I felt the pacing was great, if not just a bit slow, but was an excellent parallel to the nature of the war in Vietnam.  For the first 3/4ths of the film, I thought this was a great movie...And then I reached the ending.  This ending was so drawn out and mind-numbingly slow that I couldn't wait for the film to wrap up.  I heard that the reason behind this was that originally Brando's part was relatively short, but he wanted to get more screen time, so he stretched it out as far as humanly possible.  It certainly seems to be the case.  And as such, it is a detriment to what otherwise is a fantastic film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Horrors of War Beautifully Expressed,"Apocalypse Now is a war drama about a U. S. Army solider serving in Vietnam that is given a mission of assassinating a Special Forces Colonel who has gone insane. The film was released in 1979 and is rated R. The movie is directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The film is written in the collaboration of Francis Ford Coppola, John Milus, and Michael Horr, who narrated the film. Apocalypse Now is based loosely on a book called Heart of Darkness by Joesph Conrad. Martin Sheen plays Captain Benjamin L. Willard who is assigned a task to assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, starring Marlon Brando, for his immoral rampage of killing.There were both positives and negatives about the production of the movie. After I watched the film, I did not know what to really think of it. I decided to watch the documentary of the production called Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse to get more information on the movie. I really liked the storyline of the film. Martin Sheen's opening scene performance was very emotional about his character's trauma of the Vietnam war. It showed true vulnerability and his internal conflict. I also really liked how true the movie was about how American soldiers treated others. They were very Gung Ho on war and did not seem to be cautious of shooting others. It was mostly shoot first, ask questions later even if they are just civilians. A lot of war movies depict Americans as heroes of the war and in this movie, it shows the reality of how horrible American soldiers could be.Another position was how the movie could be interpreted as how internal conflict could create a monster. In the beginning Willard struggles with his trauma from the war. Colonel Kurtz's character is struggling with his own demons of trauma and him hurting others. It shows how trauma can affect people differently. Both made different decisions in the end.The production of the movie was quite amazing to see in the documentary. Everything from the explosions to fires and dead bodies, played by actors, were all real. Even some of the props were made. Unfortunately, the weather ruined a lot of sets and equipment.The negatives of the movie were the writing for the ending. I felt the ending did not have much closure of the movie and left it up to the viewer to decide on the philosophy of the film. Another negative was that a few of the crew's health was at risk for making this movie. Sheen had a bad heart attack during work and Coppola had a seizure. It was also mentioned from some of the actors that there was a lot of drugs and alcohol involved to cope with the stress. The planning for the movie was disorganized due to Coppola wanting to make everything perfect and everything his way. Sometimes he would change a scene on the fly, or he would write a scene on set.Overall, I really recommend both this film and watching the documentary to gain more insight into how the movie was produced. To me, watching the documentary and seeing the struggles to achieve the amazing quality of the movie was quite amazing to see. It was even cool to see that they used a lot of real objects and not props. There were no miniatures or projections in the movie. All of it was real. Even the guns were real.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"An experience, not a story","I agree with Ann Medina from the Canadian History channel when she says 'it's not a story, it's an experience'. In my opinion, using the Vietnam war is just a convenient medium to actualize concepts about living everyday life, since our lifestyles can be rife with conflict as well.Others have argued the opposite; that the movie is too extreme, too evil; that it's trying to imply that we must keep depravity close at hand to keep things real and define our lives. I, however, see the movie as a balancing act between religion and inhibitions with individuality, courage, and convictions. Otherwise known as the eternal struggle of man. Concepts of evil are to some degree, culturally based; to kill a cow in India is considered a crime, while in the western world, we eat hamburgers quite regularly. We have already accepted several things in our lives that others would consider sick and depraved. Just ask PETA. Just ask Ret'd UN Commander Romeo Dallaire. But I digress at this point.William Golding's book titled 'The Lord of The Flies' stipulates that evil is simply a nervous and irrational reflex to our fear of the Unknown, in whatever guise that may truly be. For instance, I'm afraid to be thin, because I might be afraid that my excuse for not being sexually appealing will disappear with the extra ugly flab. It could be that I'm just not sexy. *G*Walter Kurtz, as played by Marlon Brando, got a glimpse of that knee-jerk hysterical evil after witnessing the slaughter of innocents; arms that were injected with a polio vaccine had been hacked off. His mistake was in growing to admire the finality of such an action when in fact, it was a chronic lack of understanding of modern medico logy compounded by a preternatural paranoia of a better developed force. But, Walter Kurtz, in turn, had misunderstood the origins of such evil and reacted blindly to it by losing his mind. He merely proves again that reactions from too little knowledge are dangerous and that again, evil has been begotten by past evils. And Benjamin Willard (aka Martin Sheen) perpetuates the downward spiral of human society by executing his own order of justice. But he was afforded the luxury however grotesque, of not having to think overmuch about his task, he merely had to make sure it got done. So who is right or ultimately wrong?Evil exists on various levels. A concept of evil is governed by early childhood experiences, educational, and parental support systems. Evil defined at the most fundamental level is when an entity causes or compels a deeply changed state upon another entity. One type of evil is when genocide is deemed acceptable because people have been deeply compelled to believe that some other types of people are not entirely sentient. Obviously, this is a circular type of evil that perpetuates over many generations. If you have been led to believe that an entity does not enjoy your supposedly higher level of sentience, you will not know that you have committed evil against the entity.A fundamental definition such as this may not be realistically applied since we usually define evil subjectively. For example, an entity is not necessarily committing evil when an entity causes another entity to exist or be born. So should the definition be altered or are we already subjectively moving the definition to our own preference? Is evil an entity causing or compelling a permanently changed state upon another entity rather than an extreme temporary change? We are then saying that drastic changes upon an entity are not evil when they are only finite. The birth of a entity is not evil because the life of the entity is never permanent, the child is never immortal.Murder, rape, and physical or emotional abuse are still evil under this revised definition but for two of those instances it has to be acknowledged, known, or believed that entities can possess souls that live forever beyond physical death. But it also has to be true that the birth of an entity does not mean that the soul is beginning its own existence too. If a soul were not to be evil, the body could only be the temporary host for a soul that had already existed for all of infinity; an entity that had no beginning or no end of being alive. And, in another thought, if heaven was created--which is supposed to last forever--did God Himself commit evil...or did heaven also always existed with an undefined beginning or end?We could do a third improvisation and exclude 'entities' from the definition and instead cite 'organisms' to subjectively skirt Godly issues. We now say that evil is when organisms cause or compel a permanent change upon another organism. What about books like 'Mein Kampf' which sometimes causes a person to permanently alter his or her way of thinking to become anti-government and anti-semitic? Or do we claim that it was the the fault of the reader since the alteration does not occur for everybody? What if written words such as these in this ditsy review of a movie permanently alters one's opinion of evil? D'oh.The definition of what constitutes an organism could be too subjective, inconstant, or contextual. It might be proved one day that man-made electricity is evil. The bumping of electrons from molecule to molecule might be permanently disrupting thousands of unseen galaxies containing countless sentient beings too small for human technology to readily perceive for empirical proof of their existence. But don't let that permanently compel you to turn off your computer, just run away screaming; that's a temporary state.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Best war film ever!,"Martin Sheen's performance is one of the greatest things to ever be done! The sound throughout is ambient glossy perfection, I love how the acting is incredible in every scene. Apocalypse Now is a truly magical adventure thrill ride filled with beautiful atmospheric vibe. There's so much exciting elements even for a non war fan this is masterful for anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Far out of reach for any filmmaker today.,"There are quite a few good movies out in circulation today, many of which have been released in the past five years. None, however, can claim the title of most ambitious film of all time. For that title must go to Apocalypse Now, the classic yet surreal tale of US forces in Vietnam experiencing more than their share of problems and violence amongst the jungles and wilderness.What does one say about a film like this? It certainly isn't easy to criticize, mostly because you don't really watch it so much as experience it. Every scene builds tension and emotion as you watch these young American boys, innocent when arriving, be turned into robotic killers with an almost complete lack of remorse or emotion. Coppola is able to keep our attention and at the same time somehow get us to sympathize but also be stunned at the severity of the action taking place. Each scene is so layered, so complex with what it is trying to evoke that it makes the viewing experience a mind-blowing journey very much like Willard's journey to Kurtz.The success of this film is in no small thanks to the acting, with the classic lineup delivering on the nose the exact tone of monotonous and deplored sense of bewilderment. Of course, it is Marlon Brando who is the show-stopper as Kurtz, the crazed colonel running his own version of the war in the heart of the jungle. As we follow Willard (Martin Sheen) to find Kurtz, we realize perhaps he is not as crazy as first portrayed. After witnessing Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall in perhaps his best work ever) and the insane chaos that is the Do Nung Bridge, could it be possible that Kurtz isn't as bad as they say? This, of course, is part of the journey and something the audience itself needs to figure out.All the same, Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest of all films because it goes farther than any of its kind. The helicopter scene when Kilgore's cavalry attack a Vietnamese village is perhaps the most daring and ambitious sequence ever filmed. No film maker or even studio would dare do such a thing, probably instead using CGI to create the effects. But Coppola was a genius and just crazy enough to be able to try such a stunt. Indeed, the whole movie is a crazy stunt and one that you won't soon forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Philosophical, yet captivating!","Well, I guess everyone who has once seen this move could not have denied its status of a masterpiece. I couldn't as well. Initially, the viewer is served with the captivating, overwhelming song ""The End"" by The Doors, which I am listening to right now. The song very much describes the imminence of the events about to ensue. The greatest amount of the movie's grandiosity lies in multiple separate, self-contained scenes. One of those is the air strike undertaken by Americans while the Wagner's ""Flight of the Valkyries"" is on and there is a splendid juxtaposition of horror over the Vietnamese and the exhilaration among the Americans. Another wholly self-descriptive scene is that of Marlon Brando confessing with his tremendously pervasive and piercing posture. Robert Duvall's peerless courage and uncommon decisiveness is another completely different, yet scathing, character. The movie is philosophic with events meandering here and there but never getting away from the target. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
More than just a film and a Masterpiece,"`Apocalypse Now wasn't about Vietnam, it was Vietnam' they are the famous words of Francis Ford Coppola and I could not agree more with every word he said.   Apocalypse Now for me wasn't just a film, it was an experience which I hold dear to my heart and always will.   It may have taken a long while for this to be made, but imagine what it would have been like if all the problems that occurred didn't happen, it wouldn't be the same film.  It was like it was meant to be a horrendous shoot to make it what it is and that is the great living film ever to be done.   If you take notice into every film Coppola has done since Apocalypse Now you see them as not bad or just good films, but he has accomplished something that is so harrowing and epic as this.  Coppola put so much into the movie based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness it was like he had no more vision left to put into his other projects.  Maybe Apocalypse Now was the film to blame for the not so good Godfather 3.  I enjoyed The Godfather 3 just as much the first two but  you could see something lacking from the third instalment that he didn't bring up like he did with the other two.The story revolves around Captain Willard played by Martin Sheen who is an assassin travelling up a river with a small platoon to terminate a colonel who has gone insane.   That is the movie.  You live with these men for the first two hours of the film on this boat and the situations that happen throughout and then it comes to a halt when they arrive at Kurtz's camp where you finally get to see what you have imagined would look like.  I expected to just see a camp full of soldiers but you instead see a platoon of tribesmen and warriors who have no grip on reality and what is the difference between right and wrong.  The journey up the river starts off exciting with many things happening whether it would be the invasion on the beach with the crazy but commanding Kilgore or the playboy bunnies concert at the barracks.  The more it goes on the slower the plot is and the more relaxing it becomes.  The story begins to tire and so do you but not in a bad way.  It happens in a way where you just feel you know that these soldiers have travelled so far and tragedy has struck them one to many times and there is no reality in their minds anymore.Friends ask me what do I prefer, Redux or the original?  I say both as the original version of Apocalypse Now was just unspeakable of how good a film could be and when I saw Redux it was just a bonus and answered questions that I didn't have the answers to.   It is an emotional roller coaster ride of a movie and does depress you in a way.  You either come out of the film thinking `wow' or `What the hell was that'?   It scares me to think what George Lucas's version would have been like if he took the helm.  It would have been more commercialised  probably in my opinion and also under budget. I think if Orson Welles went ahead with Heart Of Darkness then it would have been great and Coppola could have still made Apocalypse without much comparison to Welles's version as it would not have been set in the same backdrop of the Vietnam war.  But there is a part of me that is thankful for Welles not to direct Heart Of Darkness because it makes Apocalypse Now stand out more to the rest and that's what makes it so groundbreaking.   I remember seeing Redux in the cinema on release and the whole multiplex was packed and when Brando mutters the words `The Horror, The Horror, The Horror' and there are cross dissolves of Willard's painted face and the helicopters from the beginning flying In the background, the lights came on and everyone left in utter silence, and that's what makes Apocalypse Now so good even to this day, it silences everybody and doesn't make you think because there is no message here to read, just an experience of pure madness.   Even though Brando is only seen for at least a quarter of the of the picture, he is the man that steals the film under everybody's except Coppola's feet.  His ad libing of every scene is what an actor is really about.  He is without doubt the last great actor and no one apart from De Niro has been able to touch Brando for what he has achieved in his acting career.  He is not your average type an actor, he's your Jim Morrison of the movies who just doesn't seem all there but speaks words of beauty and terror through his words.   The music of The Doors is as haunting as any original movie score could ever be and comes in at the right time and Carmine Coppola just shines as more as his music did in The Godfather to bring the horror and heart of darkness to an end.Apocalypse Now is not one of the greatest films ever made, it is the greatest film ever made and no film will probably ever surpass it, not in my lifetime anyway and if something does come along then it will have to be noting short of a miracle and let's face it you don't see many of them in Hollywood.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Hard to sit through and not terribly good ending,"The only two problems with this movie are, as the one line summary states, the length and the ending. It's so long that unless you're very determined or very patient, you're not gonna sit through it to the end(particularly not if you're watching the ""redux"" version which I was(un?)lucky enough to see on TV). And the ending seems to suggest that Coppola had either run out of steam or simply didn't know how he should end it. As a war film, it's not particularly realistic, I guess, but more of a piece about the descent into madness that you experience under such dehumanizing circumstances. I found it interesting to see as such a film, but arguably not much else... I also found it interesting to recognize the actors, whom I, for the most part, hadn't seen in a film from, at least before the 80's. If any of this doesn't make sense, don't blame me... blame the fact that I'm writing this as I'm almost falling asleep after the movie. Now, let it be known, that I didn't pay attention to the entire thing; I am neither a man of great patience nor determination(well, not enough, anyway) so I fell asleep once or twice through this film, and actually found myself awaking a few minutes after it had ended, and had to rewind it to catch the ending. Maybe that affected my judgment, maybe not(it probably did). However, what I saw, I mostly liked. The acting is very good. The characters are well-written and nuanced. The action is well-done. The cinematography is very good. All in all, a very good film, if you have the patience and you're sufficiently interested in seeing this very well done piece of film, despite it's very long runtime(maybe you would want to start with the original version, not the ""redux"" one I saw). I recommend it to just about anyone who really is interested in films and the media of movies. If you can sit through it, you probably should. Any Coppola fan should definitely experience this. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Highly overrated war film,"When it comes to films about the Vietnam war, I think that too many people are over-praising. Perhaps many from the generation that lived through that war feel a strong connection to any film about it. Perhaps the explicit horrors of war vindicates their stance at the time so therefore, it's more worthy of praise. Perhaps this is even a generational thing? In any case, the acting was nothing magical. Sheen looked more constipated than anything else throughout the film and his obsession with Kurtz is poorly scripted. The war sequences are not too bad, but hardly the best cinematic portrayal of war.Moreover, the film tends to bathe in its own views, themes and self-importance. After a while, it become tedious (even before REDUX) and interest levels plateau.Then there is the grand finale where we finally meet Kurtz and all is supposedly revealed. But while the quality of the scripting and performances lifts during this period, the actual plotting goes awry. While many will say that the conclusion places caps off an exploration of the dark side of the human psyche, I felt that it was more of a disjointed series of monologues that the viewer never really follows, nor connects totally with. The fact that Kurtz turned out to be a demigod leading a tribe stretched both credibility and sensibility.Cinematography was fairly good and there are enough engaging moments which compels me to give it a higher rating. But drastically overrated and the ending borders on absurd. Full Metal Jacket was the best of the lot in my view and many others get my vote before Apocalypse Now. However, I do give Platoon a lower rating than this as that was woeful.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
WHOLE NEW WAY TO VIEW THIS STUNNING MASTERPIECE,"When this movie was released in 1979, the term ""post traumatic stress disorder"" was rarely used, certainly not nearly as often as it is today, to describe the emotional anxieties endured by battle-weary soldiers who had returned from the jungles of Vietnam. It seems today that APOCALYPSE,NOW!, large chunks of it anyway, illustrate the effects of this disorder on the characters,situations and most especially the atmosphere and tone of the work. Perhaps this is the reason it resonated so strongly with some viewers at the time, despite its unsatisfying concluding moments that failed to deliver the big action moment many hoped would end the film. Instead, Coppola leaves us in a heart of darkness, stuck as it were, in a state of mind from which escape seems impossible. Not only does the movie not give us an exhilarating battle scene to match the helicopter attack seen earlier, it doesn't even give its characters a rescue or deliverance, and certainly not a homecoming. Where another fil-maker might have inserted a psychologist to comment on the awful anxieties the men might be going through, Coppola shows in nearly every scene
the insanity of their surroundings and the twisted world of war in which they live. He succeeds in using his film to immerse the audience as much as possible in the hell this war created in the minds of the veterans forced to endure it.
There have been four great films about that war: The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Coming Home, and this one - but it is this one, Coppola's, that seems most personal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"A hugely important and hypnotic film, like a compelling nightmare from which you cannot awaken.","Apocalypse Now is a stunning film on many levels, and a film that reverberates long after the viewer has come away from it. Visually remarkable, thematically frightening, filled with haunting and dream-like sequences that show the horror and insanity of war in intense detail, it is a film that can be watched and re-watched endlessly without ever failing to throw up new surprises. It was greeted with huge controversy when released in 1979, and almost thirty years on remains as powerful an experience. One thing that has altered over the years is the critical reaction to Marlon Brando's performance as the renegade Colonel Kurtz. Initially, Brando's performance was heavily criticised for being impenetrable and inscrutable (it didn't help that he arrived on set overweight and unprepared), but over the years the cleverness of his interpretation of Kurtz has become more apparent. Kurtz is a man alternately psychotic and eccentric, and always dangerous, and in retrospect Brando's bizarre approach to the role captures the character's insanity quite ingeniously. Those who complain they cannot understand what Kurtz is talking about in the film's final scenes are missing the point - he is lost in his own phantasmagoria and we are not meant to understand his demented ramblings.The story, an updated and relocated adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, deals with an emotionally-scarred Special Services soldier, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), who is instructed to travel upriver into Cambodia on a highly dangerous mission. It seems that a once brilliant colonel, named Kurtz (Marlon Brando), has retreated into the deepest jungle and formed a private army of Montagnard warriors. Quite mad, yet totally influential, Kurtz sends his loyal followers on horrific genocide missions and lords over them like some self-appointed God. Willard's job is to find and eliminate the colonel, an unsound and embarrassing thorn in the side of the American war effort. On his perilous journey to Kurtz's lair, Willard undergoes various surreal and horrifying adventures, the most remarkable of which is a helicopter attack on an enemy village led by the deranged Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who likes the play The Ride Of The Valkyries on loudspeakers during his airborne raids because ""his boys love it..... and it scares the hell out of the gooks!""The film was a real ordeal to make. The shoot in the Phillipines spiralled over budget and took an unprecedented length of time to complete. A typhoon destroyed much of the equipment and the sets; Sheen suffered a near-fatal heart attack despite only being in his 30s. But the decision by Coppola to make the film under such authentic conditions, with no studio filming or special effects trickery, ultimately pays off. This is war like never before seen on film. Nihilistic, horrifying, destructive, pointless, perversely exciting and shockingly brutal. The much-criticised ending, with its heavy symbolism and (pretentious?) ambiguity, has frequently been viewed as the film's main flaw. But in all honesty, was there any other way to end a film of this nature? Would a nice, neat ending in which the loose ends are tidily tied together really fit in a film which goes so far out of its way to blur conventions, morals and reality? Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece - a challenging, unflinching, thought-provoking journey into the heart of darkness which asks many disturbing questions but refuses to yield any easy answers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Crappola!,"What a waste of my time! I DID like Apocalypse Now quite a lot, but I'm so absolutely disgusted by the ""REDUX"" that I'll never watch either again. It's one thing to act, it's quite another to show someone hacking at a water buffalo with a machete FOR REAL!!!!! Perhaps before the movie started, a comment that stated it contained the butchering of real animals would have been appropriate! An unacceptable rating from the humane society isn't enough, not by a long shot. For all those who would say it was a ritual that these people actually perform, I say this...

One of the greatest of war films.,"The SeventiesIn terms of the 1970s of American cinema, in my opinion, the most imposing individual was Francis Ford Coppola. Beyond his own creative output, which was obviously significant, he helped foster some of the most prominent filmmakers of the generation with relationships from mentor to collaborator with people like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Schrader. He was at the center of the new movement of American cinema that we're still seeing the effects of today (most are still making movies, although generally just not at the same level of quality as when they first started).But back in the seventies, Coppola was king. From '72 to '79, he made four movies. All four were nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. He won for two of them (The Conversation's loss was to his own The Godfather Part II). The second loss was to Apocalypse Now, which lost to Kramer vs. Kramer Now, I do really like Kramer vs. Kramer, but it's nothing compared to the mad odyssey into the depths of the jungle that is Apocalypse Now.A DifficultyWith the other movies on my list, I had little difficulty explaining to myself why I loved them individually. The disparate parts of each film assembled so easily together into something often beautiful that I found the experience of writing about them easy. Apocalypse Now is very different. I really see it as a work of genuine madness. Coppola went into the jungle and lost his mind on the way out, the perfect mirror of the main character's journey, and I really do feel like the movie captures that amazingly well.But then that leads to the question: How does madness lead to great art? How do you read an art born of madness?I think the only way to really approach it in an abstract sense. Its effect on the viewer as he watches it. There are arguments that all art should be approached that way, but I do personally feel that formal structural and character based approaches are important to both creating and taking in art, but Apocalypse Now largely forbears any formal approach. Long story short, this post is going to be messy. Let's roll!Apocalypse NowRewatching the movie for this post, I was struck by something that I've seemingly never really processed before. The movie is gorgeous to look at. The colors are vibrant with the wide range of greens of the jungle and the great palate of colors that fill in the gaps. The framing of every shot is beautiful, especially around the flight of the helicopters during the ""Ride of the Valkyrie"" scene. Even during smaller moments, like when Kilgore walks out of frame, it's perfectly shot.Kilgore is crouching down, talking to Willard, ending on a melancholy note, and then proceeds to stand up and just walk to the right. We never see him again. He just disappears into the war. It's such a perfect end for him, and it's done through simple and effective framing.ThemesAs with my other favorite films, Apocalypse Now isn't terribly explicit about what the movie is actually about. The closest it gets, I think, is this line from General Corman near the beginning of the film:Well, you see, Willard, in this war, things get confused out there. Power, ideals, the old morality, and practical military necessity. But out there with these natives, it must be a temptation to be God. Because there's a conflict in every human heart, between the rational and irration, between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes, the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.That quote outlines the idea at the heart of the film. The conflict between the rational and irrational and good and evil. What we end up seeing during Willard trek up the river into Cambodia is the increasing madness.Is that madness specific to the Vietnam War? The surface of the movie? Is that all there is?I don't think so. I think that the surface is part of the equation, but also the least interesting part. As with all great art, Coppola uses the subject of his film to talk to more immediate and relatable concerns. Not much of the audience lived through Vietnam in country, but most of the audience has seen madness. They've understood obsession. They've understood being lost. They've also understood making a choice to turn back from madness.The Journey's EndMany people consider the journey to Kurtz to be great, but once Willard actually gets there, for the movie to peter out. I disagree, the ending is my favorite part of the whole thing.I believe that part of the issue people have is with Marlon Brando. It's not that he plays the part badly, but that he's pretty obviously fat. He promised to show up lean and mean to the set, but he just loved eating too much to actually do what he promised. Coppola panicked. Kurtz wasn't going to be the highly mobile killing machine as he was in the script. Instead, Coppola had to find another solution, choosing to shoot Brando mostly in shadow and turning what was supposed to be a thin man of action in a bulking heavy threat. I actually think that the combination of shadows that the man's size, along with his insane ramblings makes him a rather terrifying figure.I consider the threat of madness infecting others to be a more imposing threat than a single man swinging through the jungle as some great killer, and by stripping Kurtz of the physicality of the character's original ideal and leaving him with only the madness makes the madness all that much stronger in my mind.And besides, the actual death scene is fantastic, using the sacrificial bull to imply that Kurtz himself is a sacrifice, but to what? Is Willard killing Kurtz out of orders? He says no in the voiceover. I think that it's a rejection of the madness in its entirety. What solidifies that in my mind is how Willard could obviously take Kurtz's place, but he simply grabs Lance, the last member of the boat crew, and walks away.In ConclusionThe movie is both a hard watch and an easy one. It's hard because of the inhumanity on display and the questions that it raises. It's easy to watch because of the magnificent cinematography on display and the great performances by everyone involved.In regards to the two versions of the film, I've only ever seen the original cut. I actually own the Redux version (the DVD I bought years ago came with both on the same pair of discs), but I've simply refused to watch it. I'll probably do it one day. I've heard both good things (people saying that it finally completes the package of the movie and makes it great) and bad things (those saying that, in particular, the French plantation isn't worth the price of admission and doesn't add to the movie in any significant way).In the end, though, this work of madness by a madman who lost himself in the jungle is one of the most significant and greatest films made. A great companion piece, by the way, is Hearts of Darkness, the movie that Coppola's wife made about the making of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The most powerful movie ever.,"I watched this movie the first time last summer alone in my apartment and the digital clock showed that time was 02:30AM. Over three hours later, while the sun was climbing above the horizon, I had watched the best movie ever. I just sat in my chair and I was just shocked, amazed and stunned from the strength that Apocalypse Now: Redux had hit me. It took me twenty minutes to come back to Planet Earth.The acting was superb, Martin Sheen did a wonderful job as a man who is fed up with war but can't withdraw from it. Martin Sheen's monologues were very intense and every line had an effect on me. I was very anxious at seeing Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz the first time I watched this, so it almost ruined the whole movie. The second time I watched this I was even more struck by a lightning than the first time.The best thing about this movie was the mood. Coppola's directing made that and also Sheen's voice. But I can't praise this movie enough, so enough of my jabbering, watch this movie and have the greatest movie-experience of your lifetime.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
River revisited,"River revisitedApocalypse Now Redux sets a new standard among the 'Directors Cut'-versions of old classics that has continued to surface during the last decade. True, most of these versions has been better than the originals  most notably the versions of Blade Runner and The Abyss  but they have been more or less the same movie with a few changes. But when 53 minutes  roughly one third of the running time  of unknown events been added to a familiar story, we are set with a new story. Therefore it's more accurate to regard this as a new movie. And there's no doubt about it, this one is even better then the original. To be more precise, it's 53 minutes better The inserts are many, but here's a basic rundown of the major events thats new: First of all, the famous scene on the beach where the mad Colonel wipes out an entire village in order to surf there, has been extended with a clever twist: Willard and his crew steals the colonels surf-board as they sneak off with their boat. The colonel is very upset by this, and pursues them with helicopters. The tape recorder in the chopper doesn't play Wagner any more, though. Instead we hear the colonel on a taped message in which he begs them to return his surfboard to him. That's a scene that has been extended. But there are some scenes that we have never seen before at all. One is a follow-up to the scene where the Playboy Playmates drive the soldiers to a frenzy. They find them again further up in the jungle where they have been stranded, and trade diesel to sexual favours in return from them. These scenes are both observant and strong, and seem very logic as a follow up to the earlier scene. But the best new sequence is when Willard and the crew on the boat arrives to a ragged French rubber-plant in the jungle. A few bits of this has been seen before, in the documentary of the making of Apocalypse Now.This sequence is actually one of the fundaments of the story in the movie. It's quite long, and incorporates several key lines, that are at the core of the story. 'We fight because we fight for our home, for whats been ours for seventy years', says the owner of the plantation. 'You americans, you fight for the worlds biggest nothing', he continues to Willard. There's also a short love affair between Willard and a woman at the plantation. 'Don't you understand theres two of you?' she says to Willard. 'One that loves. And one that hates.' This is one of the key elements to the movie, and adds to our understanding of how and why Willards personality changes as they travel up the river. The ending is much longer. More scenes when Willard confronts Kurtz are added. It doesn't clarify much, though. Sane reasoning and logic has still ceased to exit at the macabre and horrible place at the end of the river. And one of the reasons that I absolutely love this movie is that its narrative and structure follows the dramatic path its characters experience when they travel there.Per Lundblad",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Horror. . . The Horror. . .,"During the Vietnam War, the young American Captain Willard is given the assignment to hunt down and kill one of his own: Colonel Kurtz, who has apparently gone insane, murdered hundreds of innocent people and constructed a strange kingdom for himself deep in the jungle. Willard and his crew embark on a surreal river journey to find Kurtz, meeting along the way a Lieutenant-Colonel who surfs during live combat, Playboy bunnies dropped in by helicopter to entertain rowdy troops, and the inhabitants of a French plantation trapped in colonial times.Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is not a Vietnam War film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to the back drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels. Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors ""The End"" as Martin Sheen's Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. Willard's mission is to ""terminate... with extreme prejudice"" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and, as told by his general, is ""out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat, yet, the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior. Teaming up with a small crew, they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen's raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythic figure, he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay will parallel that of Kurtz's. Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatchable. His genius: undeniable. But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was difficult to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity. If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's fanatical struggle to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen's haunted soldier Willard. I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend. That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress, unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual, the savage and the animalistic. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.....,"It smells like......victory. I wasn't there in Vietnam, just a tad too young. I guess it would be possible to do a movie about that war that displays its insanity better, but I certainly haven't seen it. Martin Sheen and crew of small PBR gunboat are sent deep (and I mean DEEP) into the unclaimed jungle to terminate renegade U.S. Army officer Brando. With each mile they travel civilization moves further and further away. Surrealistic film style captures perfectly what must have been the hell of Vietnam in-country (or any other kind of) service. Duvall is memorable as arrogant air cav officer obsessed with surfing even in the midst of bloody shore assault. Sheen (who I think suffered a heart attack during the filming) is Oscar-caliber as an ordinary guy just trying to do his damn job in the midst of bedlam, and Hall does well in role of stoic gunboat chief. As much as anything this movie turned the post-war attitude of many, like myself, who thought at the time that we should have been there. When you go this far out on a limb there are going to be some hits and some misses. Brando and the movie's final episodes are pretty much of a miss (Hopper makes it bearable), but the rest of the movie is so damn good it almost doesn't matter; the trip rather than the destination is the big story. I initially had problems with the Redux version as it adds to an already mammoth running time, but I've gotten to like very much the French colonial sequence and also Duvall's surfboard search. There are few moments in cinema that top Sheen's monologue inner voice talking about his mission and Kurtz on his way into the jungle. Another of those movies I feel like I lived, in this case its unpleasantness (that I also live with) keeps me from stopping by too often.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Enthralling, but a bit too long...","...That's probably because my first-ever viewing of ""Apocalypse Now"" was in its ""Redux"" version - featuring around 40 minutes of additional footage that, in the 3-hour-plus product, apparently formed the crux of what was ORIGINALLY envisioned.Oh, well. I buy it. Contrary to what most others thought, I didn't have a problem with the film's somewhat bloated running length - though I shouldn't really be able to judge, as I have never, ever seen the film before. Fans of the original tend to side with it, and dismiss THIS 2001 re-release as a cheap marketing gimmick (which most re-releases usually are). Nevertheless, I wasn't too bothered by its epic pace; this masterful Vietnam war picture had an impact that resonated with me all the more strongly BECAUSE of its longevity. The next week I ended up viewing the tighter, original 1979 version - and, while still obviously good, I found I somewhat preferred the newer version, for its fascinating additions that lent new depth and meaning to its images.This is a terrific, and shockingly realistic drama, showcasing unbelievable performances from an all-star cast backed by a legendary director. Obviously enough has been said about the infamous ordeal that countless cast and crew members went through to make it on location. The result was well worth it, and provides an insightful, thoroughly enjoyable window into the hellish, surreal world of the Vietnam war.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

An unfocused trip,"It took me a bit to nail down the reason for my less-than-fawning reaction to ""Apocalypse Now"" - after all, this movie's so damn revered - but, surprisingly, it's Martin Sheen's voyage up-river (which is really the bulk of the movie). I'm surprised as anyone, seeing as I generally dig his stuff. But his journey into Cambodia just tends to meander through the film. Sure, there are firefights mixed in, but none of this is ever as exciting or mysterious as the film's two most winning features: Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando. And they're only present for such a short time. Duvall is just such a larger than life sociopath; it doesn't hurt that he's at the forefront of the movie's wildest set piece, but he owns the screen. I'm fairly certain the man's ruined ""Ride of the Valkyries"" for me (hijacked, not soured). And Brando looms so large over the entire movie that, you're left wondering what kind of answers are coming when Sheen finally tracks him down. And it's a hallucinatory payoff, to be sure.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Coppola's Masterpiece,"Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindness, and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different, and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life, the reason of death, or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work, made against all odds, chronicled in the 1991 documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse""; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture, but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously, ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home"", or in latter ones as ""Platoon"" and ""Casualties of War"", before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, as horror in ""Jacob's Ladder"", or comedies as ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

One of the greats,"As Captain Willard lays on his bed and watches the fan blades spin round, it triggers off memories of the helicopters and a past mission that he was once part of. It is this extremely effective and entrancing opening sequence that quickly establishes Apocalypse Now as a movie for the mind.The viewer is taken on a strange journey up the river to meet an enigmatic figure known as Kurtz through the eyes of Willard (as narrator). On the journey we gain an insight in to the many dark facets of war and the effect that it has on one's humanity. Whether it be the insanity, the humour, the surrealness etc. It all comes across very effectively, with the characters in this film refreshingly real and the dialouge pertinent and on occasion genuinely funny.Apocalypse Now does not make the mistake (as many other war films tend to do) of manipulating you into thinking a particular way, rather it is open-ended enough for you to draw your own conclusions. We are made to feel part of the crew and witness as they do and to have our own perceptions on the events as they occur. I tend to see a movie not that one watches, but experiences.The technical aspects of the film are amazing. The cinematography is breath-taking with each scene exquisitely detailed both visually and sonically. The use of natural light in many scenes is superb (such as the mango sequence) while the music highlights the mood perfectly (The Doors was a perfect choice for the opening). The action sequences were superbly edited, especially the helicopter attack sequence coupled with Wagner blaring in the background which adds to the thrill of that scene.Not a completely realistic film, but I don't believe that that was the vision or the intent. If you crave realism, go rent Platoon as a companion piece to this. When I first saw this film (which wasn't that long ago) I knew it would be one the greatest films I'd ever see just from the first 5 or so minutes.

The Horror! The Horror!,"In the early 1970s, George Lucas wrote a draft of ""Apocalypse Now"" together with John Milius. However, the idea remained on United Artist's shelves, and when it was brought up five years later, Lucas was busy making ""Star Wars"". So, he asked his good friend Francis Ford Coppola if he was willing to take over. And Coppola was more than happy to do so. If he was given free rein with the script, that is.Coppola's new screenplay was based on the 1899 novella ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad. The director changed the setting from late 19th-century Congo to the Vietnam War of the '70s. He also decided to finance the project with the profit from his ""Godfather"" movies. Then Coppola travelled to the Philippines to start filming.What began as a 14-week shoot ended up being extremely difficult logistically. Everything was taking much longer and costing much more than anticipated. Marlon Brando showed up on the set terribly overweight and completely unprepared, while Martin Sheen (in the lead role) suffered a near-fatal heart attack on location.Then there was the weather. A violent typhoon destroyed the sets, causing the movie to shut down for three months. And the problems continued. Back home, it took Coppola over two years to edit the 250 hours of exposed film. When he was finally done there were approximately 247 hours of footage on the cutting room floor.Although the movie was a hit in the United States, it lost money due to its huge negative costs. And it didn't help that the studio squandered money for prints and ads. Three years later, the film still hadn't turned a profit, and Coppola owed United Artists $7 million. So, in the end, the director was forced to hand over the TV rights to the company to pay the balance.

Masterful piece of cinema,"Knowing little about Apocalypse Now bar it being set during the Vietnam conflict, I viewed the Redux version with a completely open mind.Having journeyed through a 3 hour 15 minute epic I can only say this really is as breathtaking and brilliant a movie as I'd been led to believe.Martin Sheen is Captain Willard, a soldier stationed in Saigon after various missions in Vietnam. Holed up alone, he is picked to undertake an assassination mission of the reclusive Colonel Kutz, played by the ever-marvellous Marlon Brando. Getting to Kutz will not be easy, such is the isolation he's ended up in deep in Cambodia. The mission is based on the fact the American army believes Kutz to have become insane, and commanding armies on the wrong side of the war. 'His methods are unsound'. Willard must infiltrate Kutz' army and murder the man himself.However, to say it will be an epic journey is an understatement of some magnitude and summing it all up is practically impossible.The many strengths of this movie result in a level of depth which is quite flabbergasting. The acting is absolutely outstanding and incredibly convincing. We undoubtably care about the characters such is the warmth and affection with which they are portrayed. Even the lesser-featured characters are vastly significant in their own right, such as Robert Duvall's gung-ho Kilgore - he loves the smell of napalm in the morning. And then there's the spaced out but endearing photographer, played by the energetic Dennis Hopper. Similar character to who he was in Easy Rider, but more exaggerated here.Then there is the quite superb direction/cinematography. Each scene has an amazing amount of life within it, with camera work which has to be seen to be believed. Some of the shots are just astounding, either encompassing impressive scale battle, or more humble close ups. I don't quite know how Ford Coppola did it, but this was a masterstroke and a lesson in filmmaking.A review of Apocalypse Now would be empty without mention of the enigmatic Brando. Every scene he is in he steals just as he did in the Godfather. The man was the human embodiment of the brilliance of cinema, and while he's not on-screen for a massive amount, he still becomes by far and away the most important and intriguing character in the entire tale.To summise, Apocalypse Now is everything a movie needs to be; gripping, dramatic, intruiging, exciting and personable.One of the all time greats?

I find it a little more fascinating and gets a little more in depth about the journey and mission martin sheen's character gets involved with. It's the best of Redux really. But what's great about this set is that it comes with all three versions on 3 separate discs so no one is left unsatisfied. It also comes with regular 1080p blu ray versions along with the fantastic unique behind the scenes documentary from 1991 called Hearts Of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. I would rate the 4k visual presentation at 4 out of 5...the elements used in the transfer to digital are a little faded and I suspect multiple sources of film elements were used to make the final cut. However the cinematography of the film is so strong and well lit that it really overshadows any generational loss or fine details issues. The use of neutral density filters in the shooting of the film is prominent and the hdr color and wide contrast reproduction is vivid and blends beautifully. What is much more amazing is the work that went into the surround sound remix for this release. The low end pulses rather dramatically and deeply and the high end fidelity is penetrating. The use of The Doors' ""The End"" song in the infamous dazzling opening shots/scenes are so mesmerizing and spacious that it gets right deep into your brain via your ears and vibrations through your spinal column. This film is reputed as one of the best sound designed films and it's true. It's one of the only films in existence whereby you can listen to the film with the visuals/tv off and still be able to get the story of the film in great detail. It's a testament to pure artistry and psychology delivery via editing of sound and picture. This goes with Thanks to the ultra genius craftsman of film overall, Walter Murch. It's hard to say which cut is better, which is great that all 3 are here in this collection. I rate this film (no matter which cut/length) a 12 out of 10. The 4k restoration is a 4 out of 5 as stated previously and the sound reproduction, Do get this if you are a fan, or just curious. It's a rare perfect movie thats immersive- delving deep into morality, 'tripping out' and of course, madness. Get some Coppola estates red wine and a nice joint and kick back to this fine fine piece of cinema. Its a keystone and testament to how a story should be told.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Extraordinary Movie - among the best war movies of alltime,"Francis Ford Coppola'a Apocalypse Now is one of the best war movies ive ever seen. the movie is extremely long (in fact i saw the original version, the redux version is longer!!) - but there is not one moment when it gets boring. the movie is an excellent voyage voyage into the minds of people in war.martin sheen as captain willard is simply brilliant. Marlon Brando is no great shakes - hes hardly there in the movie. this is a martin sheen movie all the way and he carries it off tremendously aided by the brilliant cinematography and directorial style of the inimitable coppola, who knows how to shock the viewer with his terrific exploration of the shades of grey. one thing that amazes me about coppola's movies - be it godfather, apocalypse now or even dracula - is the way that it portrays neither good nor evil. the chief characters have a bit of both in them.Apocalypse now is a  masterpiece in showing the mental trauma of war. there are many scenes in the movie that will be etched in your memory forever. the chracters are tremendously believable and original. each scene is honest.The other standout features in the movie are its chilling dialogs and the terrific soundtrack to the movie - coppola uses popular classic rock songs from the sixties to terrific effect, the songs highlight the scenes and add a tremendous aural backdrop to the visual scenes. the songs usually take over during the pauses for the audience to think. the dialogs of course are the ones that make you think anyway, especially the narration.its hard to discuss the movie without taking away its impact, suffice it to say that this is a movie that will stay with you for a long time. one of the greatest movies of alltime.a chilling 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
THAT line.,"For years I have been annoying friends and family with the following question: Which famous movie quote is delivered by an unknown actor as the his only line in the movie and he never worked again? The best answer I could get was ""I quit!"" but the correct answer is ""Terminate with extreme Prejuice"" but until now I could never name the actor and was unsure about the last bit. Now thanks to IMDb I am able to see that it was in fact Jerry Ziesmer and see that it was in fact not his only movie. Thank you IMDb but now I am just left with one annoying question: ""Who is Stroder Martin?"" As for the movie it is one of those you either love or hate. I love it. At the time it was made Coppola was on top form and could get away with the excesses he did (like the character Kurtz who ""is operating out there without any control) but the movie stands as a testiment to one of America's best ever film makers. It is a pity he has not been able to discover his best form since then (although I did enjoy Bram Stokers Dracula) but if you listen to his DVD commentary on one of his lesser known projects ""The Godfather"" you can hear that he doesn't have the heart for movie making anymore which is a shame. But he has left us with the two Godfather movies (the less said about the third the better) and this masterpiece which rates a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Interesting Redux,"Believe it or not, I have only just seen the redux.What's interesting is what the redux adds:  For one thing, it better highlights the idea that if Kurtz didn't have a method, he did have (or had had) a goal:  ""Winning"" in Vietnam.  And this dovetails with another image from the original, nicely paired with a new image in the redux.  Image one, from the Playmate USO show:  While the Americans had myriad choices, the Vietnam had a choice between victory or death.  Image two, from the French plantation, reminding us that the French had actually built something there in Vietnam.  What did the Americans have?  The Dominoe Theory.  In other words, we didn't have s**t, and the redux drives this home a little better.I love this movie because it's still a bit of a Rorschach.  It's a mystery wrapped in an enigma, or some f**kin' thing.  To wit:  Are we ever given a satisfactory picture of the meaning behind Kurtz?  The redux seems a little better at conveying the feel of approaching an event horizon, where morality and reality becomes more chaotic and splintered, and it would not be meet and right to expect to be able to walk away ""resolved.""  The movie resolves by resolutely evading a clear resolution.  But there are mirror shards whipping by our heads at 400mph, bearing fleeting perspectives.  Maybe Kurtz *is* ""America in Vietnam.""  Maybe we won't understand the meaning of the Vietnam War until we understand that the best picture we'll ever get of that is Kurtz.  Which is to say that we simply engineered, to the tune of $400B (which, I heard, only *just* got paid off), a horror show to fulfill our Daily Minimum Requirement for The Horror.All that said, there were still a few bits that maybe should have been left out.  The scene with the Bunnies meeting and greeting the crew was unnecessary.  Specifically, Willard engineers the deal--2 tins of diesel for a couple hours with the bunnies--and this is distinctly out of character for the spartan Willard.  The scenes at the French Plantation were a mix 'n' match; Clean's burial; good.  Explanation of prior French integration into Viet society; good.  Opium and sex; again, glaringly out of character for Willard.  Any time Willard cracks a smile or otherwise distracts from his own proto-Kurtz philosophy has to remain suspect.This was a great movie and remains a great movie.  See it.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A movie that asks one question...,"The one question that ""Apocalypse Now"" should leave in the minds of everyone who sees it is ""Why was this movie ever made?"". For starters, it is a direct lift from Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", which is a short story that makes its points briefly and without fuss. It proposes to examine the disaster that was the Vietnam war, but takes forever to make its points, and then makes them with a bludgeon. It is a collection of setpieces and lacks a natural feel. It also features the worst performance Marlon Brando ever turned in. From the moment he appears on the screen he affects the movie the way a rotting whale carcass washed ashore affects a beach party. I missed the opening credits the first time I saw it and was shocked at the end to see that Harrison Ford had been in it. And for a final over-made point, listen to the code word Martin Sheen uses to call in the airstrike. That is not to say that there aren't some good things in it. The Philippine scenery was used well. Frederick Forrest was as good as he can be, and that little scene with the tiger is a gem. Robet Duvall was excellent, and the helicopter assault is one of the best flying sequences ever filmed, a real triumph of editing. My own recommendation is that even if it is pretentious and overblown, it is still worth seeing - a superb failure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Spectacularly Different Each TIme,"If you've ever watched a film or show that blew you away, then missed the feeling of seeing it for the first time, this film, has the unprecedented ability to inflict that sensation upon viewers, viewing after viewing.

A journey into the heart of darkness,"""Apocalypse Now,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a 1979 war film that explores the psychological toll of the Vietnam War. The story follows Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who is sent on a mission to assassinate the rogue Colonel Kurtz, portrayed by Marlon Brando, deep in the Cambodian jungle.The film is visually stunning, with breathtaking cinematography capturing the chaos and beauty of the war-torn landscape. Coppola's direction is ambitious, blending surrealism with intense realism to depict the horrors of war. The performances are compelling, especially from Sheen and Brando, who deliver powerful portrayals of men pushed to the brink of sanity.However, the film's slow pacing and heavy, often confusing narrative might not appeal to everyone. Some viewers may find the prolonged scenes and abstract elements challenging to engage with fully. Despite these issues, ""Apocalypse Now"" remains a significant work in cinematic history for its bold storytelling and profound commentary on the human condition during war.In summary, while ""Apocalypse Now"" may be polarizing, its impact and artistry make it a noteworthy film, deserving of its place in the annals of war cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
True Horror Story: Killed Live Animals and Bought Human Corpses,"I've been hearing about this movie for most of my life, so I finally gave in and watched it. I expected it to be brutal movie abt the Vietnam War but other than that didn't really know that much about it.It was pretty much what I expected. A lot of hype, violence and gore. One of those movies that people watch so they can mindlessly agree with popular opinion that this is a groundbreaking film. The storyline was not that interesting or complex and the ending was very anticlimactic.Couldn't watch the scene of them brutally killing that water buffalo and was horrified when I found out they actually killed a live animal for the scene.The backstory with all the challenges they were faced with while trying to make this movie was the more interesting than the movie.

"Truly, one of the very greats!","Whenever a conversation regarding your favorite movies come up, without hesitation Apocalypse Now always comes forth as the primary contender. Although it took me multiple viewings until I fully started to appreciate the movie for the masterpiece that it was. That for me seems to be the only downside of most truly great films- just a few hours are given for the immersion into the lives of several nuanced characters. While the (mostly) time consuming act of reading a great novel grants the opportunity to grasp the atmosphere of the plot without having to reread.While obviously the movie revolves around the Vietnam war, the historical conflict itself seems to merely be used as a background. In fact, as quite a few other reviewers have pointed out, it has barely any real connection with the actual day to day life of the American soldier during the war. Instead it is a surreal and intense character study of psychologically distinct individuals on a boat going down the same route of consecutive stages of war-induced madness. Only a select few can endure the trip deep in to the heart of darkness without on the way losing oneself to violent bravado, lust and degradation, madness or cold, detached indifference for the rest of the world. This theme becomes more apparent as the characters delve further down the river, deeper into the jungle, slowly abandoning the Vietnam theater while the film adapts a more surreal, almost metaphysical focus.It certainly is one of those movies that divides an audience and to its discredit far too often is compared with other films of the same (or similar) genre. Though it is truly unique, and the fact that (at least to my knowledge) for all these years since its creation no other director has dared to emulate something which doesn't seem to have a tangible formula, speaks for its longevity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Heart of Immense Darkness,"I'd like to get this out of the way, Apocalypse Now is not a film. Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 adventure, war epic transcends the medium of film and even storytelling itself, and becomes something else. What it is, I'm still not entirely sure; a statement on the war in Vietnam, a descent into utter madness, a degradation of civilized humans into their primal selves? It is all of these things and somehow, none of them. All i can say with certainty is that it is the single greatest statement on human nature i have ever seen.Apocalypse Now stars Martin Sheen as Captain Benjamin Willard, a US army veteran living in Saigon, who's experiences in Vietnam have fundamentally changed him as a person. Willard is given a mission from the higher ups in the Army, to travel upriver, from Vietnam into Cambodia.A Green Beret Colonel named Kurtz,played by Marlon Brando, appears to have lost his mind fighting in the war and has led the rest of his unit, along with a number of local tribesman, deep into the jungle. There he resides as their ""God"".As Willard travels upriver, his journey becomes a dreamlike nightmare, consisting of surreal and haunting sights that force Willard and the others on the boat to confront their own nature as humans.The film has the best Cinematography i have ever seen in a film, with beautiful yet disturbing visuals and superb sound design. All actors give excellent performances, especially Sheen, Brando, and Robert Duvall who plays the flamboyant and ruthless Colonel Kilgore.Apocalypse Now is both my personal favorite film of all time, as well as, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made. This film should be required viewing for all, you owe it to yourself to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

G. D. Spradlin -- Dennis Hopper -- Frederic Forrest -- etc. And Marlon Brando, who is handed an impossible role -- a role where our expectations are built up, built up, built UP over the course of the movie before we meet him -- he pulls it off somehow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The last masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola,"""Apocalypse now"" is a film with a great reputation and a big influence. Many people know the sentence ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" without ever having seen the film. This reputation is partly due to the production history (a hell in itself) and the financing (Coppola financed the film himself and put the entire capital he had earned with the ""Godfather"" films at stake). A diffucult production history however does not make in itself a good film.""Apocalypse now"" has many facets, but in my opinion this is more a weakness then a strength of the movie.
As a Vietnam movie it is (in my opinion) surpassed by ""The deer hunter"" (1978, Michael Cimino).
You may object that ""Apocalypse now"" is not a pure Vietnam film and that the book on which it is based (""Heart of darkness"", 1899, Joseph Conrad) is situated in Africa. True, ""Apocalypse now"" is also an odyssey with a river as a metaphor, but also in this category I can think of a better movie (""The night of the hunter"", 1955, Charles Laughton). Well done is the cinematography of Vittorio Storaro who makes the movie darker when it progresses.
In the third place the movie is about sinking into madness, but in this respect I can refer to a film like ""Aguire, der Zorn Gottes"" (1972, Werner Herzog). By the way some characters are already very mad at the beginning of the fim (e.g. colonel Kilgore), it only makes one more curious after the madness of colonel Kurz and if this is the only reason why the US army is so interested in him?
Last but not least the film is about pagan religion. At the end of the film the book ""The golden bough, a study in magic and religion"" (1890, J.G. Frazer) appears briefly on the screen. In this facet the movie outperforms a movie like ""The wicker man"" (1973, Robin Hardy), but that is not a very hard thing to do. Regarding this respect I admired the brilliant close ups of the face of Marlon Brando very much. It was a bit of a disappointment to learn that one of the functions of these close ups was to keep his big belly of the screen.Above I criticized the film as a whole. The film however contains a couple of scenes that are indeed brilliant. Below I shall mention the scenes that striked me the most. ""Apocalypse now"" has been released in three different versions (Original (1979), Redux (2001) and Final cut (2019)). This was possible because Coppola (as mentioned earlier) had financed the film himself, and was thus owner of the copyrights. Not al the critical scenes appear in all versions.The most well known scene is without any doubt the helicopter-attack on the Vietnamese village with the ""Ride of the Walkure"" music. The fact that Walkures take dead war heroes to Walhalla but do not kill them theselves makes the scene no less effective. ""Apocalypse now"" is also the film (together with the popsong ""Good night Saigon"" from Billy Joel) that makes the association between helicopters and the Vietnam war the most explicit (also ""The Doors"" are mentioned in both film and song). What amazes me the most in this scene is that it really is beautiful when one sees the helicopters take off. The horror strikes only when the camera cuts to a Vietnamese schoolyard with playing children.Also worth mentioning is the scene where all of the inhabitants of a Sampan are killed, just because a 17 years old American boy from the Bronx (that we have come to know as rather sympathetic) loses control of his nerves.A second scene with the playmates was introduced in the redux version and again skipped in the final cut. The reason was that it would be too woman unfriendly, which is true. The remaining scene with the playmates is really revealing. Isn't it male unfriendly to sexually arouse adolescent boys so much that they forget that they are only cannon feed?The final scene I would like to draw your attention to is the scene on the French plantation (only in the redux and final cut). Some find this scene to slow, others interpret the French inhabitants of the plantation as ghosts but I would like to draw your intention to the following quote of the French padre familias (ghost or human):""We want to stay here because it's ours - it belongs to us. It keeps our family together. I mean, we fought for that. While you Americans... you are fighting for the biggest nothing in history!""In Vietnam the Americans confused a north-south conflict for an east - west coflict. They fought for the biggest nothing indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Powerful stunning,"The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity.This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Adequate Now!,"I feel like I'm going to get treated and feathered for this, but I wasn't all that impressed by this. Could, quite possibly, be because of the massive hype around it, creating this looming shadow of greatness it could never hope to live up to. It's also equally possible that this just isn't my thing.It's very artsy for a war movie. It feels pretentious and full of itself without showing the dirt and the grime, which is weird because it's not a clean movie by any means, but whether it's the surfing obsession or extensive use of narration, it just never worked for me in the way something like Full Metal Jacket did.The film is well shot, for what it is. It's very grandiose and there is a psychological element that's intriguing. Sheen and Brando are captivating, obviously, so that's nice. I can absolutely see skill and artistry here, it just wasn't for me at the time of watching it. I'll likely revisit it at some point and maybe then feel different. It's still entirely worth watching if only for the historical and cultural impact it's had and because I'm clearly an outlier here and most people love it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
too long but couldn't have been shorter,"Two words: Cutting edge. The film remained quite different from its surroundings at the time. It was the first war film in a long time to receive good acting while many war films were about glory and pure action. It depicted war as a depressing era of death and insanity. While other Nam movies like The Killing Fields (although a great movie) just killed off soldiers, Apocalypse Now made you feel like you lost a member of your family when a soldier died. I felt that the film was to long but with all the information in the film, it couldn't have been shorter. For todays standards people of a younger generation will not appreciate the brilliancy of this film sheerly because from a war film they would expect more violence than dialogue. The Redux version does not compare to the original version and many people will seem impatient as they watch. I suggest eighteen or over not because of the violence, but because it will not appeal to someone younger than that age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"I just wanna learn to cook, maaan!","They don't make 'em like this any more: only the 1970s could have produced such a mixture of creativity, intelligence, counterculturalism and sheer mess. Seeing it recently for the first time in 20+ years, the half hour involving Robert Duvall still awes me and not only because of him: as satire, deadly serious yet funny, and also as sheer cinema, it is unsurpassable. But the rest doesn't live up to that standard: at best it's certainly rambling and uneven. For me, the ending is just wrong: it doesn't in any way fulfil what has gone before, or the threat of the title and the opening sequence, and is actually a bit silly. On the whole then this, narrowly, is a failure; but it's a failure more worthwhile than many a success.Added 2022: I don't think I really did this justice in the original review. It's true that the story is nothing, and the ending a bit silly. Did Coppola happen to have the chance to film an ox being slaughtered, and just decided to link that in with Kurtz? Directors have to work so hard for the effects they want, I think sometimes they give too much prominence - as if in gratitude - to a 'found object'. And it seems to make no sense that they cross 'VC' lines at the start, yet later encounter an ENSA-style revue for American troops and, later still, a French colonial plantation which seems undisturbed by the war. It goes against all one's instincts about this type of film.But I now think - and I hope I'm not just rationalising - that the rambling is kinda the point. Everyone know this is supposed to be based on Heart of Darkness, but it's more like the Odyssey: the meaning is in the journey. Coppola is not really trying to tell a story or discuss ideas - in terms of ideas, it's far from clear what the film wants to say. He is simply trying to bring to the screen the craziness, the ridiculousness and (yes) The Horror of Vietnam, and war in general. Primarily he just needed a device to take his characters through a range of situations; yet the boat, the river, the jungle, together become an important element in their own right. Nobody - either crew or the people they meet - knows where they're supposed to be going, or what they're supposed to be doing, still less why; they just mill around each other in the vast expanse of the jungle, shooting at every noise and shadow, committing casual atrocities in a fog of drugs, confusion and fear. And all of this come through most clearly in the full-length version, Redux. The more rambling, the better!I still think it falls short of being totally satisfying, but it's an amazing film by any standard.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Five out of Five,"Apocalypse Now (1979) is a film that takes place during the Vietnam War, following the quest by a Captain Willard, the protagonist, to find and kill a rogue United States' Colonel that has allegedly gone insane. Captain Willard travels with a band of soldier in the Navy, and along the way, they encounter the Vietcong, native people, other United States troops, and even a wild tiger.At the start of the film, Captain Willard is tormented by the confines of civilization after having completed one tour in Vietnam already. The effects of PTSD are evident in his struggles, and the detrimental effects of war on a person's mental health are commonly displayed throughout the movie. Several soldiers demonstrate various effects of PTSD, ranging from nervous breakdowns, panic attacks, and warped views on what is moral.As the plot progresses, the group travels into increasingly hostile territory. At the first encounter of the enemy, the group is escorted to a drop point by an attack squad of helicopters that decimates a small beachfront village. This is the first example of many of the theme of American disregard for the people of Vietnam and the perceived power that Americans had abroad. The theme itself provided social commentary on the immorality of American actions throughout the war; one such example is how, after destroying a village, a band of American soldiers are only concerned with surfing.As the band of soldiers moves down the fictional Nung River, they are constantly on edge and weary of what lies ahead. A thread throughout the movie is a hazy atmosphere, originating from either fog or smoke from fire/weapons. The hazy atmosphere is symbolic of the uncertainty and indecision the soldiers face as they move through the terrain; for many of the soldiers, there is no clear understanding of why they are fighting, or when they will be able to go home.In addition to a hazy atmosphere, darkness is another common aspect of the cinematography. Particularly in close shots on the faces of Captain Willard and Colonel Kurtz, shadows and limited light are used to symbolize the pain and conflict the men are feeling from what they see while they are abroad.The film Apocalypse Now is a thought-provoking movie regarding American involvement in the Vietnam War. The questions the film raises regarding the morality of war and the duties of soldiers are reinforced by showing a number of internal struggles throughout the film. In the context of many archetypal patterns, I would recommend this movie to anyone for a more serious, engaging war movie. Five out of five stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""I love the smell of napalm in the morning.""","Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is an absolute masterpiece. It doesn't really matter which version of the film you watch; the original '79 version, or the restored and extended ""Redux"" cut. Francis Ford Coppola has said that he personally prefers the longer cut of the film which was finally restored in 2001 and added an additional fifty minutes of footage cut from the original release because of it's already long running time of two and a half hours. When I first saw Apocalypse Now I watched the original version and I was instantly taken by it. It was dark, twisted, and surreal and unlike any other war film I had seen before. A few years later I watched the 2001 ""Redux"" version and was a bit disappointed with it initially. The extra fifty minutes didn't really seem to add much more substance to the overall picture and in return just ended up slowing down the film so much that it just dragged on. Since that time I have only watched the original cut of the film on DVD and still love it. It's one of my all-time favorite war films and probably the best Vietnam war film I've ever seen, and if it's not the best, because certainly Oliver Stone's Platoon is another Vietnam war film that I hold in very high regard, but if Apocalypse Now isn't the best film on Vietnam it's certainly the most original, darkest and fascinating.The film uses Joseph Conrad's novel ""Heart of Darkness"" as the basis for the plot, but setting it in the middle of the Vietnam War. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) leads a top secret classified mission to travel by boat up a long and dangerous river into Cambodia to assassinate a rouge Green Beret officer named Colonel Kurtz, played with a powerfully absorbing intensity by Marlon Brando. Kurtz seems to have gone completely and totally insane, and a local jungle tribe seems to have adopted him and worship him as some kind of God. Along the perilous journey the team encounters many strange and unusual people and places, including a gung-ho Lieutenant Colonel of the Air Calvary named Bill Kilgore, played great by a wild and fun Robert Duvall (in an Oscar nominated performance), that leads an all-out assault on a small village of Vietnamese, which is undoubtedly the most infamous sequence in the film. But that's just the beginning of this bizarre odyssey; as the small group of soldiers makes their way up the river they also meet some Playboy Playmates, and come across a nighttime battle over a destroyed bridge that is nothing but absolute anarchy and chaos, with no one seemingly in control of the combat. And just wait until Captain Willard finally gets to meet Colonel Kurtz, face to face; it's well worth the wait. Oh, and the scene where the cow gets sacrificed, that wasn't faked; that was all done for real.Apocalypse Now is a wild and nightmarish vision of hell on Earth. Francis Ford Coppola's vision of the Vietnam War is so strange and surreal it might as well take place on an entirely different planet all together. The performances are all superb, not a single weak link among them. Among my favorites though has to be Dennis Hopper as an American photojournalist with a motor-mouth and always seems to be on the brink of madness. The Oscar-winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal, and crisp with bolder darks and beautifully bright colors that look even better on the new DVD transfer. It looks so good it's actually hard to believe that the film is nearly thirty years old. And the action sequences are just another aspect of the film that seems to hold up amazingly well over the years. The helicopter attack sequence is breathtaking and still impressive, even by today's standards. The music of Apocalypse Now is another pretty interesting topic. It's mostly an orchestral score done with synthesizers and a few rock tunes from The Rolling Stones (""I can't get no satisfaction"") and The Doors (""The End"") and Robert Wagner's classical march ""The Ride of the Valkyries"", which is a piece of music that has become infamous with the film.I recently re-watched the ""Redux"" cut of Apocalypse Now and must say that I did enjoy it more a second time around. Some scenes, while still feeling long and maybe a bit excessive, don't really feel as uninteresting or unimportant anymore. The additional sequence with the Playmates does still seem to be pretty pointless to me, but the scene with the French plantation now seems to have more of a purpose; of reminding Willard of man's potential for both good and evil. This scene used to seem slow and pointless, now it seems to make a little more sense when you think more about the ending and how important choices of good and evil play out. The extra fifty minutes of restored footage in the ""Redux"" cut seems to add a lot more character development and a little more comradeship to the soldiers, but also it makes the journey up the river longer and more ""tiring"", but in a good way. Personally I like both versions of the film, but choosing which one to watch really depends on what kind of film you're in the mood for. The original cut is more straightforward and to the point. Apocalypse Now Redux is a little more taxing to sit through (running at three hours and twenty two minutes), but has more substance, nudity and truly carries the weight of a dangerous and surreal journey into the heart of darkness. But which ever version you chose to watch, either way it's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""Eventually, the war is going to end""","Even 40 years after its release, this film still gives me the chills in a way that nothing else can. As Coppola said, the purpose of this film was to ""give its audience a sense of the horror, the madness, the sensuousness, and the moral dilemma of the Vietnam war."" After a whopping 202 minutes of haunting sequences one after another, this film surely delivers to fulfill its purpose. This is the all-time greatest war film for me, of course I love the likes of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, but this one just manages to show the madness of war in it's own, unique way.The film was inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. It follows Captain Benjamin Willard, portrayed by Martin Sheen, on a special secret mission to eliminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz apparently went crazy after a long military career, and soon started acting as God and led his own pagan cult in the upper part of the river. Willard, while healing from the mental wounds of his previous Vietnam tour, accepts the task and starts the most disturbing and distressing journey I have ever seen on screen.The acting is just amazing in this film. Martin Sheen as Willard was just the right man for the role, and it was really strange to see Marlon Brando act as a murdering decapitating maniac after the Godfather. Robert Duvall as Colonel Bill Kilgore delivered a few of the most iconic war-epic scenes ever, and took the madness of Vietnam troops to a whole new level. And to see Dennis Hopper as the crazy photojournalist welcoming the crew to the most haunting place ever, was just better than I could even imagine.The reason why I think that this movie has developed its own life that still goes on after 40 years of its initial release, is the atmosphere. The cinematography, the long shots and sequences, all the sets end extras, they just create an atmosphere that is rarely seen in cinema. The soundtrack with The Doors, just perfect. They used huge amounts of explosions, fireworks, dynamite, fire and everything to create the most realistic chaos possible. Let's take for example the scene where Kilgore is leading a pack of helicopters with Willard up north, they start playing ""The Ride Of The Valkyries"" from the speakers. That scene lasted for multiple minutes, just soldiers getting ready to face the enemies, with no idea of what's coming. But it was amazing. The whole movie is about chaining these type of gorgeous memorable sequences together, and that is why this movie is one of my all time favourites. I'll duck everytime when I hear ""The Ride Of The Valkyries.""One thing more interesting to me than the film itself, is its production. Maybe the chaos from the film hits the viewer really hard, because the production was an actual chaos. They started filming in the Filippines, until a typhoon cleared the whole set and they had to build it all again. The infamous scene where the Viet Cong blow up the 150ft bridge wasn't so easy either. The typhoon destroyed the bridge, so they had to build it all over again just to destroy it on film. Martin Sheen suffered a heat exhaustion, and was hospitalized for over a month. They flew in his brother and a load of double actors for him. The films budget, at first, was 12 million dollars, and in the end it cost almost 30 million dollars. Coppola's whole life was at stake, because he had the chance to stop filming when they knew that the budget would be exceeded, but he kept on filming.If you are looking for an easy film to watch and turn off your brains, this isn't for you. But if you want to see something that makes you think and makes you shiver even after a year from watching it, then this is for you. Just to give a little glimpse on why these scenes are so disturbing, I'll give two examples: 1: They actually filmed a real ritual slaughter of a caribou by the tribe Ifugao. 2: In one scene they raid a local villagers boat, and the people in it were actually refugees who had escaped their country only two weeks ago. Imagine that.All in all, this was an experience that left me speechless and staring at the empty screen for a long time. The film took 238 days to shoot, and this is how Coppola addressed the crew in the end: ""I've never in my life seen so many people so happy to be unemployed."" I sure was relieved too when the movie ended. A definite 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Darkness of the Heart,"There are about 10 films ever made that leave indelible images branded into your brain, and this is one of them. Those who comment that the film ranges beyond war into the nature of human beings are on target. The film, like the book, spirals farther and deeper, down into the hot center of the degenerate human heart. Yes, it's a slow, crawling sensation, and like many artists before them, Conrad and Coppola use a river as the symbol of the life's journey we are all floating on, like it or not, as the riverbanks gliding by present ever-changing conflicts. The mad young surfer--the only survivor besides Willard--is yet another version of all the demented or alienated characters in literature who see the truth realized--the Seer in Greek tragedies, the cabin boy in Moby Dick, Jim in Huck Finn, the Pilot's Boy in Rime of the Ancient Mariner, the jesters in Shakespeare's dramas. In never-ending cycles of trauma and peace, both individuals and nations are repeatedly mired in moral dilemmas that create suffering and horror, and reveal the perversity of the human heart. But the soul is never extinguished.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Napalm in the morning,"No doubt, a stunning film when it comes to the visual effects--all of which were created without the use of CGI. There was an abundance of real explosions, planes, helicopters, napalm, etc. That all added to the visual beauty of the movie. This aspect alone deserves a very high rating.Where I think the movie fell short was with regards to the plot and pace. The storyline is interesting enough, but the execution was lacking IMO and the pacing didn't help. Development of the plot was very slow. Surely this was on purpose (meant to mirror the film's setting / subject matter), but I felt that it detracted from the enjoyability. Acting performances were good across the board, but nobody stood out in particular.Wish I had loved this one as much as the general populations seems to, but I just felt there were too many elements that were just OK to justify a GREAT rating (8+).",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the Ten Best Films Ever Made,"You can forget about THE GODFATHER, STAR WARS, or SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. This movie is one of the best there is and is only beaten by a handful of pictures. I'm not talking AFI here, but my own, more accurate scale. This wonderful film, that developed over more than ten years and nearly cost the lives of all involved ranks number 4 on my list of 100 best films, coming in behind CITIZEN KANE, THE TRIAL, and IKIRU.APOCALYPSE NOW is not merely an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", but an improvement upon that work. This film defies genre classification. It could best be described as an epic, and as that it surpasses any epic made before or since. The scope is great, yet the atmosphere is claustrohobic. The setting is bright and beautiful but the tone is dark and disturbing. It is set in the Vietnam war, but it's not about the Vietnam war. Coppola said the movie was the war itself, but it's even more than that.After 25 years in release and thousands of reviews, I'm sure you know the plot, but here it is again just in case. Martin Sheen (BADLANDS, THE DEAD ZONE) is Willard who does certain special covert operations in Vietnam. His latest mission is to find Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando- the greatest), who has gone mad deep in the jungle, and terminate ""with extreme prejudice"". He heads up river on a small navy boat with a mixed bag of men. They first encounter Robert Duval and his love of Wagner, surfing, and napalm. From there things get crazier and crazier. People die, the men lose touch with reality, and then they find Kurtz...There are plenty of famous scenes in the film and a couple of candidates in the REDUX version (which I actually liked). The score director Coppola produced with his father adds to the already eerie atmosphere of these great scenes. Wagner's ""Flight of the Valkyries"", The Doors's ""The End"", Flash Cadillac's ""Suzy Q"", and The Rolling Stones's ""Satisfaction"" are all used to perfect effect as well, and better than would ever be done again. For use of music, the Du Long bridge scene is probably the most haunting example in the film.The visuals in APOCALYPSE NOW are at least as good as the score (or should I say, as great). Coppola hired Vittorio Storaro to photograph his masterpiece. Storaro had previously worked on Bertolucci's THE CONFORMIST and LAST TANGO IN PARIS. Like those two films, APOCALYPSE NOW is visually perfect, every shot a splendid display of color and light. I mean this movie looks good!Saving the best for last, as the movie does, there is Brando as Kurtz himself. He gained too much weight over the course of production to be theKurtz Conrad described or Coppola envisioned but he is still one of the most imposing characters realized on screen. Brando delivers the famous ""the Horror"" speech, not as Milius wrote it, but as his on great bit of improv. His few scenes are addictive in their power. Kurtz has cinema's greatest lines. This is really where all the elements of a movie come together in a perfect blend. With Brando's performance, climaxing a film full of great acting, this becomes a perfect film.APOCALYPSE NOW is a must see film. Whether you're a movie nut or just somebody looking for a good movie, this is the one you can't miss. This picture spent the souls and minds of all who made it; the least we can do is watch it.""Pray for your father.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Impressively well made war drama.,"There are different versions of 'Apocalypse Now'. If you - like me - prefer a faster paced film without all the extra scenes, then I suggest the Theatrical version, which is 147 minutes long. (The Final Cut runs 182 minutes, while the Redux version runs 202 minutes!)The horrors of war does strange things to a man. Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) believes he is a god, and taking matters into his own hands by killing innocent people and destroying villages. The soldiers under his command follow his orders however ridiculous.The Army believes Kurtz to be insane, and orders Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) to follow Kurtz, infiltrate his team, and terminate his command. Together with a small team, Willard head up the river in search of Kurtz. As Willard reads Kurtz's dossier, we get a good background on Kurtz, and realized he made some questionable decisions in his career.There's plenty of action along the way. 'Apocalypse Now' is an impressively well made movie with stunning battle sequences, excellent cinematography, and amazing visuals. The Theatrical version is definitely the best cinematic experience, since the action in the Redux version is slowed down significantly by additional scenes involving the characters that doesn't contribute in any way to the film. You therefore won't miss anything by cutting out around 49 minutes.With Kurtz being accused of being insane, the film also becomes a descent into madness as it hurtles towards the end. The moment Willard encounters Kurtz, the film takes a dramatic turn, plummeting into weirdness...and I mean this literally (in the film).In general, I was highly impressed with 'Apocalypse Now'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Platoon did it better.,"I watched a bunch of 80's military movies for the first time. Platoon, Hamburger Hill, and Apocalypse Now. I was surprised at how poorly this movie held up. I care way more about the war itself and the struggles of it's soldiers and their relationships vs some silly unbelievable story. This movie is for casual movie watchers who like stuff like star wars and avatar, eating up genericism and regurgitated plot you've seen a hundred times. Maybe it just hasn't aged well?

Surrealistic Perception of Nam,"(Flash Review)It would be overly-simplistic to call this film intense. It is visually and physiologically intense in the hands of a director who took bold chances and with top actors in the prime. While many describe this film as a surreal look at war, many others call it realistic as war can be that insane. Nevertheless, the Army assigns Captain Willard (Sheen) to make his way up the Nung River to locate and assassinate a highly intelligent and decorated officer Col. Kurtz. (Brando). The film is about the journey up stream and the bizarre, brutal, surreal and unexpected encounters that cross their path. Many unforgettable scenes yank emotion from the viewer accompanied by an effective and at times novel music score. The acting and screenplay are tremendous and this is a definitive epic not to be viewed on a whim.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Absorbing, thought-provoking, and a little too surreal","APOCALYPSE NOW is a stunning movie, but it's not exactly a war movie.The cinematography was spectacular. The acting was mighty fine, with Sheen playing is part artfully and masterfully. The story was absorbing.My only major gripes with this movie are: 1.) it is a little confusing and takes a lot of mulling over to even approach some sort of explanation to the ending ( -- of course, the lack of logical thinking at the end is the point) and 2.) the movie is too surreal and unbelievable, and it exploits the Vietnam War as its backdrop.I liked PLATOON a lot more than this movie. While both movies examine the loss of innocence and lack of logic in the Vietnam war, PLATOON is more realistic, more touching, and more truthful. Watch PLATOON for a no-nonsense examination of the horrors of war, and watch APOCALYPSE NOW for its cinematic value.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

the horror was sitting through the redux.,"Francis Coppola made two good movies, and those both had ""Godfather"" in the title. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was a miserable excuse for a film, and ""Rumble Fish"" was pretty loathsome. I'd rather see either again than another minute of Apocalypse. I realize this is a pretty trendy movie to like, but frankly backlighting Martin Sheen's ear for the last five hours of play was too pretentious for my taste. I realize this review won't change much, but it surprised me to see that nobody had given this so much as the mildest criticism.

Perhaps the best Vietnam War film ever created,"Apocalypse Now is a deployment to war-ridden Vietnam on acid. It's an exploration of human darkness with the faint scent of napalm in the air. A glimpse into sweltering madness only to turn around and question whether you've entered the rabbit hole yourself. When you're done watching it you'll wonder whether Francis Ford Coppola's best work was in fact behind him. Another of the greats that detailed a bloody excursion in the South Pacific; think Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter, and Platoon. However, despite being an ever-popular topic of film, Apocalypse Now presents a unique perspective on the war as it adapts a previously unrelated story.Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on an ill-defined mission into Cambodia to hunt down Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). A mission wrought with inefficiency and bureaucracy eventually begins to wear on Willard. Kurtz is wanted for murder, but "" charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in the Indy 500."" During Willard's painstaking trip up river he slowly discovers more about the mysterious Kurtz and the nature of this horrific war. How can you destroy and man who's already destroyed himself? To what lengths will we go to maintain sanity in an insane place? Kurtz flows with the river and sways with the jungle like an omniscient, omnipresent ghost. The familiar puttering of the boat engine is our only form of solace as the vines begin to wrap around us and the water appears to pull us upriver.The War is put on display as a series of decisions made by four-star generals sitting in air-conditioned offices somewhere. An attempt at traditional war during exceptional circumstances. Desperate times don't call for moderate measures. Kurtz is the wild card and Willard is sent to clean up after him before he becomes a wild card himself. If the Vietnam War was an asylum, the inmates would surely be running it.Overall, Coppola provides a thought-provoking adaptation of Heart of Darkness. The contemporary nature of the film makes it more approachable than the original story. Despite becoming somewhat of a case-study of movie production problems during filming, Apocalypse Now is undoubtedly one of the best films to come out of the 20th century. It is often the most trying times that provide the most artistic inspiration, and this film is certainly a testament to that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. ""Charlie Don't Surf"".

A Masterpiece of a movie!! My favorite movie of all time!,"I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored! This movie in my opinion Coppola's best among all other works including the Godfather' series. If you are a deep thinking person, this movie is going to hit you so hard. However, I would recommend reading the movie's based novel - ""Heart of Darkness"" - first before watching it. This movie is so deep and black in that it isn't a true war movie; it is anti-war and it shows you how dark and heinous a human can be in the state of war. The movie wants you to realize that war is more than just arms battle between people; war is about unleashing the true nature of human beings and that nature is brutish. So, it's more of a psychological and mental experience in watching Apocalypse Now.
I was also amazed by the performances of all the cast especially Robert Duvall. He was amazing in portraying that careless, dead-hearted Colonel despite having only less than 10 minutes of screen time. He deserved the Oscar so Badly!
However, I caution you that this movie is very underrated in that you either like it so much or hate it so much. There is no middle ground! It's a slow, mystic, deep movie that wants you to react deeply. So, if you are going to watch it for the first time, be prepared to get psychologically and mentally disturbed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A grand failure,"Apocalypse Now and Then is what screenwriter Robert Towne said of this movie: magnificent and a shambles in equal measure.It's sprawling range and portentous style are awesome as is the photography and there are many failed films saved in reputation by the photography. Citizen Kane being a prime example.While it's worth watching, even in parts according to interest and time availability, the first hour is better than the rest, and especially the third hour in the Redux version.The reason is the writing: a narrated film about a character that has not appeared is not a drama, it works in a book, and Hearts of Darkness is stunning prose, although the portentousness wears thin toward the second half.In a movie the novelists' technique fails because we can see the world, framed and edited, but essentially realistic. In that space the drama should be performed, or else it's a novel with pictures and a narrator, which is what Apocalypse Now is. The writing has to be interesting, in the narrator's mouth and the dialog, as there is little real drama happening to keep the audience involved, but here the script misses exposing the extent of Coppola's mediocrity as a writer.In Apocalypse the characters are meaningless, although events happen to them to show the audience how depraved war and this war was; but on and on the background intelligence progresses as the real drama is an intellectual one played between US foreign policy and the American people, especially those who were anti war.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

D descend into the madness,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is a cinematic masterpiece that defies easy categorization. This 1979 epic war drama is a surreal, psychedelic, and deeply unsettling journey into the heart of darkness, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer.The film is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novella ""Heart of Darkness,"" transposed to the Vietnam War. Martin Sheen plays Captain Willard, a US Army officer tasked with assassinating Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a renegade American officer who has gone rogue in Cambodia. As Willard embarks on his perilous journey upriver, he encounters a cast of characters that blur the lines between sanity and madness.Coppola's direction is a work of genius, conjuring a dreamlike atmosphere that immerses the viewer in the chaos and anarchy of war. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the lush, vibrant beauty of the jungle and the eerie, hellish landscape of war-torn Vietnam. The iconic helicopter attack sequence, set to Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries,"" is a masterclass in filmmaking, combining stunning visuals, pulsating sound design, and a sense of frenetic energy.The performances are equally impressive, with Sheen bringing a sense of quiet intensity to Willard's journey. Brando's Kurtz is a mesmerizing, larger-than-life figure, delivering a monologue that ranks among the greatest in cinema history. The supporting cast, including Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, and Harrison Ford, add to the film's sense of chaos and disorder.""Apocalypse Now"" is not just a film about war; it's a film about the human condition. Coppola explores themes of imperialism, colonialism, and the destructive nature of humanity, raising questions about the morality of war and the impact it has on those who fight it.The film's infamous production problems, including typhoons, budget overruns, and Brando's notorious weight gain, only add to its mythology. ""Apocalypse Now"" is a film that was forged in the crucible of chaos, and its rough, unpolished edges only add to its raw power.In conclusion, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a cinematic experience like no other. It's a challenging, thought-provoking, and deeply unsettling film that will leave you changed forever. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this masterpiece. But be warned: once you've entered the heart of darkness, there's no turning back._Recommendation:_ If you enjoy films like ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Platoon,"" or ""Full Metal Jacket,"" you'll appreciate the raw power and intensity of ""Apocalypse Now.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
what is entertainment?,"Sometimes films are not what I would consider entertainment. Those films I usually avoid. I have watched this film about 5 times in the past few years and my interest in it has grown. To say this film is boring may be going too far, however the idea that you may find some parts seem to drag is understandable. I think watching it a few times gives the same effect as having traveled somewhere several times. That 1 hour commute doesn't seem too long after driving it a few times. If on the first viewing, you find it to be totally boring, then maybe you will not even give it the consideration of a second watch thought I hope you do.This movie would get 9/10 from me IF Dennis Hopper's character was omitted or at least replaced by more dialog from the green beret character that has zero lines.In my definition: Entertainment doesn't necessarily require you to become excited or happy.

Spoils Of War,"You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed. Or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of ""judgement""); that layer is completely uninteresting.Or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners, but that's just a coating for commercial mastication.You can try to view this as a 'realistic' Vietnam war film, but ask any veteran and he'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.Or view it as a 'will he or won't he' morality play -- nothing rich there, either.Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference. Coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing 'a great man'.Brando the man was as much of a maverick as the Kurtz character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method', yet he always excelled and won accolades; the 'generals' are uncomfortable with Kurtz's 'unsound methods', in spite of his strategic genius.So Coppola makes a movie all about Brando's greatness. To hammer on the point, he places himself in the movie (as Hopper, a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises. Brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actor's power. And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: ""the horror...""Other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives, including 'being in the firefight' long before ""Private Ryan""; the ground breaking use of sound, notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.Don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Disaster of a movie,"What an awful movie. The worst thing of all is the amount of written material and other forms of mystification produced about it. The whole film is based on the terrible misreading of Joseph Conrads brilliant ""Heart of Darknes"". Coppola turned something which is genuinely a brilliant piece of written fiction into a 3 or more hours of visual disaster. A complex narrative turned into an ordinary kitsch. If there is nothing to understand, it doesn't mean it's masterpiece; it's just stupid. This film is just going nowhere from the beginning to the end. The final scenes, involving Hopper and Brando are the lamest thing I've ever seen. I mean, it's more lame than Troll2: totally bizarre and unmotivated. Read ""Heart of Darkness"" and you'll see what I'm talking about. From technical aspect film is really marvelous, but the whole concept is so pathetic that nothing can save it.

One of the best military movies ever made,"Francis Ford Coppola was a director who could do no wrong in the '70's thanks to masterpieces like ""The Godfather"" parts I-II and ""The Conversation"" but this movie was very new territory for him as a director but not asa a screenwriter due to the fact that he co-wrote the Oscar winning screenplay for ""Patton"" and with this he succeeded in making one of the very best war movies of all time. The main character of the movie is an Army captain named Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) who is assigned on a classified mission by Gen.Corman (G.D. Spradlin) and Col. lucas (Harrison Ford) to kill Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who is a renegade soldier who has gone completely insane due to the effects that war has had on him, and whose actions are described as ""unsound"". Willard has to go through extremely dangerous territory whether it's going through battles with the help of Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), heading a long river with three other soldiers to help him get to the site of his mission, and finally being at the site of the mission which is a potential deathtrap. This movie isn't your traditional war movie because of the fact that there isn't a lot of battle scenes in it which isn't supposed to be the takeaway one gets from seeing a movie like this but the fact that that war is hell and damages a lot of people mentally. When Willard gets to Kurtz's house he meets a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) who is totally afraid of Col. Kurtz and an old friend named Colby (Scott Glenn) who has become one of Kurtz's followers. The movie is a masterclass in how a movie should be made with a masterful screenplay, amazing Oscar winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, great performances throughout (especially by Sheen and Brando who deserved Oscar nominations for their work), and of course flawless execution and masterful direction by Coppola. This is one of the best military movies I've seen in a long time along with ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Patton"", ""The Hurt Locker"", ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Platoon"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Twelve O'Clock High"", ""American Sniper"", ""Inglourious Basterds"", and ""The Longest Day"" just to name some prime examples. This is the very best movie of 1979 and one that is sure to not be forgotten anytime soon, it is a true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"1,2,3, what are we fighting for?","It's that film that loads of people hail as a classic - Apocalypse Now, now a re-cut, re-up, Redux 22 years after it's original release.The film is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it's main plot (if it has one) being Capt. Willard's journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets, and he tells the Colonel's story along the way.My initial feelings towards the film is that it's not particularly gripping at times, especially early on, but at least a good dose of comedy is put in, in the form of surfing fanatic Col. Kilgore. As the film progresses however, a good deal of tension is built up with Willard's reading through various reports on Col. Kurtz until the end is in sight, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end.The usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard. Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional, and I found the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all be worthy of a special mention. The score I found initially sounded out of place, but as the film progressed... I'm not entirely sure if it did actually get better, or it fitted better, or if it had just grown on me, but by the end of the film I was thoroughly enjoying it.This is the second time I have seen the Redux version, (I have seen the original around four times) I'll say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed. I was expecting a ""classic"" film, with lots of war. The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that IS the film seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot), in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully (as with all films that are more character than plot based), as the second time around, you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favourite films.With the big four Vietnam films, Apocalypse Now wins over the rest on atmosphere, but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and cannot really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favourite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great piece of work, especially towards the end where it becomes staggering, and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn't mind some casual violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Coppola's Vietnam,"Francis Ford Coppola has taken Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" and applied it to the Vietnam War as a morality play led by Marlon Brandon at its' center. U.S. army Captain Willard(Martin Sheen) is sent to Saigon on a covert operation to find Colonial Kurtz(Brando)who is not following military orders from his commanders.Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore(Robert Duvall in his most Manic role~I love the smell of napalm in the morning) leads air attack helicopters in breathtaking sequences of both beauty and horror.This needs to be seen on a big screen to appreciate the incredible cinematography with visuals that overwhelm the senses. One slight criticism is a slow middle with Playboy bunnies on a USO tour which is expanded in uncut version of the film. Overall, it's is still a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Problems with the ending (Mainly),"Contains spoilers. The problems I see with the film now: First, Dennis Hopper. At some point Hopper transcended (?) Actor and became a sort of floating Saturday Night Live celebrity guest host for life. --No matter where he is or what he is doing, that is what he is. His characters are never credible, and even more than in the case of Brando, whose celebrity is a monumental thing to sublimate as you watch him, you never for an instant forget you are watching an Actor. Worse than his simple inability to fit into a scenario where verisimilitude is important, though, is the fact that he threatens to undermine the seriousness and horror of this film, by reminding one of the incessantly gibbering, fluttering Disney feature length cartoon comic relief (think of the china ware in Beauty and the Beast). If, along with the reinsertion of formerly edited footage, they could have reduced Hopper's hammy drive-in movie level role (think of Waterworld), they should have. His appearance so close to the end of the film, problematic as that ending already is, is especially damaging.Second, one is loath to say a clearer or more decisive ending would have been welcome or done the film a world of good. Yet after three hours of the most grueling verisimilitude, three hours in which you accept every surreal, absurd, horrific sight laid before you as Gospel truth, an ending that may act as a reality disconnect is a problem indeed. At the time of the 20th anniversary revival of Apocalypse Now, a friend of mine said ""It is a great film, but there is no way I can accept that the ending would have happened the way it does in the film in real life."" Not having seen the film at that point, I marked this off as a philistine gripe. It sounded like the complaint of someone disappointed that the ending wasn't a standard action film call-in-the-air-strike fireworks show.Now, just after having seen it, my friend's comment comes back to nag me. I am forced to concede it is entirely possible that the films agonizingly scrupulous mounting of tone and purpose, one of the most stunning in all film, is damaged by an ending that may make the viewer balk, or at least question its verisimilitude. The end falters by removing us from the most horrifically concrete reality ever put on film --being stuck way up river in the middle of Vietnam during the war; could there be anything worse in the human imagination?-- and offering in place of the reality an arty, impressionistic, cop-out ending that puts a handy Subjectivist toggle switch on Reality/ Perception. Because of this, there is a painted-into-a-corner feeling to the ending, a feeling that an invitation to the audience to fill in the blank has been offered by an artist afraid or unable to complete his statement. The rigorously-wrought horror is dissipated.Understand, I don't enjoy complaining about this major film achievement. There was no other director in the world at the time-- or maybe even now-- who could have made this film. But the ending is just such an incredible letdown. And there is no way a weak ending can erase the gripping power and brilliance of the three hours before it. But if anything, it leaves this film a special dispensation case. As it stands, Apocalypse Now belongs in the company of Erich Von Stroheim's Queen Kelli or Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons-- films that stand as classics despite weak or unsatisfactory resolutions resulting from third-party intervention. Maybe health problems, the strain of crippling financial worries, over-taxed energy levels and the weight on the filmmakers' conscience of Viet Nam itself intervened here, preventing Coppola and company from achieving a wrap up wholly commensurate with the astounding body of this film. Or maybe they simply couldn't bear to put a period at the end of the sentence.Whatever the case, what remains is a complicated, genius film, far beyond the scope of a simple star rating system. (But be warned of animal slaughter scenes, by the way, that Coppola could only have gotten away with filming offshore. If this sort of thing disturbs you, maybe you should pass on the film altogether, because acts of apparently genuine animal slaughter unfortunately have been made integral to the layered ending.)",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Proves the non-human nature of war, and how things can become ironic and corrupted by the power given by power and weapons to politics that don't know anything about peace, humanitarism, or what is moral and what is not (war will never be moral). The end is a little bit ""deux ex machine"", but it is still possible and at least is different.

Beware,"Beware, my friends.  Though bold and striking, this is not a movie that should show its face in the new millennium or any era of artistic expression evolved beyond adolescence.  Casual film-goers will probably be impressed at the scenery, the grandeur and the theatrics as I was when I was 16.  But years later, I've matured a bit, and I am absolutely horrified and sickened at how I was duped.

Certainly the veterans of Vietnam will smell something rank about how Mr. Coppola made such a pretentious carnival out of that truly humbling and difficult time.  But what I found utterly damning of this film, despite the best efforts of performers, were the atrocities that Mr. Coppola committed for the sake of his magnum opus.  A bull was slaughtered live and on camera just for some added gore (of which there is no shortage in this movie).  Acres of beautiful, Filipino countryside were ignited with Hollywood napalm (gasoline).  And last but not least, an entire culture was slandered beyond belief to a degree from which they may not have yet recovered.A few years ago, a New York radio personality gained enormous popularity with his irreverent and vulgar on-air antics.  I admit that at the time I was amused by the novelty, but then I grew up.  It may be a few decades yet, but I have enough faith in human/artistic evolution that this movie will similarly be relegated to its proper place as a monumental but shameful part of our ever-growing history.My advice to those of you with unquenchable curiosity?

The 11th greatest film of all time.,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard is sent on a covert and dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade colonel who has set himself up as a god among a local tribe. Perhaps the problem that people have with Apocalypse Now is that they take it as a serious war film. I can't think of a genuinely serious American war film that could be considered a masterpiece, yet Coppola's proof that his top-running 1972 contender for the 'perfect movie' consensus could be made more perfect in every aspect: Apocalypse Now, is undeniably a masterpiece. So as logic stands, we must rethink what Apocalypse Now is generally assumed to be. Despite being one of the most well known and iconic films on the list, such a bright spotlight does not detract from its majesty. The opening scene to any film is always an indication of the shape of things to come, and Apocalypse Now benefits from one of the most stark, minimalistic sequences of intense pulchritude ever to be directed. What follows is both startling and balming. With a velvety narrative for company that relaxes for the most part yet still reminds us from time to time that what its discussing has the potential to be very upsetting, we are taken through a journey of immense significance to the world of cinema. It might not be a proper, thoroughbred war that the journey brings you through, but it is certainly one of startlingly beautiful decadence, torment and discovery. Just watch Captain Willard's (Martin Sheen) development and how he comes to terms with the task at hand as the jungle setting, filmed in such an aspect ratio to bring out its full potential of mystery and danger, rolls by in the background, and inhale and exhale. Of course, Apocalypse Now isn't just pretty to look at. It contains some of the most classic scenes of all time, above all the popular culture's all-time favourite of the strikingly bold attack on the Viet-Cong outpost in a fleet of helicopters beaming Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"". Although this scene is as intense and vivid as cinema can reach, a scene of pure sensation, dazzling audiences with light and noise, laying bare the stark horror - and unimaginable thrill - of combat, it's the arrival at Colonel Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) camp that is the most curved apex of Hollywood's camera-work ever to be pieced together, an audio-visual descent through the threshold of necessary insanity and surrealism with the single plucks of a sentinel double bass to reinforce it. It's a simply staggering piece of American filmmaking. Apocalypse Now isn't so much an important work, a turning point or a revelation about how to make films like the next feature on the list, but it's something that exceeds all prejudices in purely showcasing the depth, finesse and density of simply pleasurable art that celluloid organic matter has been able to create.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

HOD vs ANow,"This movie is not about Vietnam as many of you have stated. It is an interpretation of the Novella ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad.

In the novella Kurtz is able to keep him from that last step but in the film, that last step is taken when Willard murders Kurtz. Also the representation in the movie is much..much darker than that of the book.The reason Vietnam is used is because of its similarity Africa.

Cinema at its Most Daring,"5/5 Apocalypse Now is one of the few movies about war that doesn't focus on the bloodshed it causes. It is an example of an audacious film that takes us in its dark universe and never lets us see the light.The film is centered around the folly of man's sanity. It shows how some people's lives are centered around war and they believe it's their burden to only be in war. After witnessing one of the most brilliant opening titles ever, we cut to our center character, played by Martin Sheen who says ""Saigon...s***. I was still only in Saigon.Every time I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle. When I was home after my first tour it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce. When I was here I wanted to be there."" There as nothing left for him, but war. There are many symbolisms with the other two main roles RObert Duvall and Marlon Brando who gives a haunting performance.The visuals in the film were also stunning, trying to sink us into the dark atmosphere. The very beginning with the credits shows a jungle getting destroyed by helicopters and the Doors hit The End playing hauntingly in the background. The battle scenes are greatly set and shot and are extremely realistic, even more realistic for some of today's standards.This is probably my all time favorite films.Many have loved it, and many have hated it, I would say definitely check it out. Its not a film based on the brutality of war, but how war affects us to go to measures that play with our sanity. There are violent scenes, but really focus on the soldiers, especially Robert Duvall's character, how he reacts to war.

It may be a respectable movie by years, but it is not very popular today, but it can be boring because it is too long.What impressed me the most in the film is the naturalness of the dialogues. Acting is already fine. Feature Robert Duvall played the crazy colonel role very well. Atmosphere and cinematography are completely different. Such films have one thing in common: they cannot be understood by everyone. It is one of the films that explains the effects of war psychology in humans. If you are a fan of action, do not watch, you will not find what you expect.War fiction (There wasn't much called an effect at that time.) Perfect in one word. People questioning the war and the effect of war on human psychology; some make it a murderer, some make it a hero, and some make it change sides for the sake of its ideals. What matters in a movie is not a high-paced adventure. Movie lovers like Avengers and Captain America do not like such critical films, of course, we are not surprised.It was a point that caught my attention in the movie. American soldiers are spoiled for women, lust, drink and entertainment. It was noteworthy that in the film, it would not be possible to win any victory with such a useless dry crowd, and that a quarter of them would be victorious with people committed to military service. Just like that in real life, committed people are successful.What I don't like in the movie, actually I don't like in any movie; the presence of obscene scenes in the movie. Can't there be a movie without explicit scenes? Most successful films do not have such scenes. It means that there was a movie without sexually explicit scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Redux is a complete coherent story,"I agree This is the End. The end of the myth of the US as a competent force for Good in the world. The end of belief in our govt. The river journey is a twisted voyage of the US inVietnam. At the mouth of the river, the US rules. As you go up, it's VC country. Then you reach the ruthless compound of Col. Kurtz. Kurtz is not God worship, it is leader worship. He can defeat the VC or NVA. The US with its deteriorating commitment and lack of cause cannot. Today we have the end in Afghanistan also. Vietnam 2. That was why I watched this again. I was reminded of that time. The younger generations cannot know the role this war played for my generation and our country as as whole. It's boring? It's slow? It's a fitting metaphor for a war that ruined the lives of many people. All for nothing.I saw the original short version years ago and as I remember the story was choppy and was not that ....complete. Redux puts in parts that flesh out the story much better. The end is different. The original had the airstrike destroying the Kurtz compound. In redux Captain W takes the insane Lance and just leaves. I guess the Chefs message did not get thru. The French plantation scene is rather odd but good as an explanation of the
vapid thinking of The USA. Any Vietnamese Communist govt.,would be Vietnamese. I mean they fought everyone for 30 years. I thought this scene would be a dream or a drug trip. It seems unlikely they would have survived since the 1950\s in a war zone.The whole Vietnam War is madness in this movie. Surfing nuts like Duvalls character for instance. He helps a wounded little girl,but incinerates people in the forest so he can surf. He offers water to a wounded VietCong but forgets the man when the surf star is found.. Col. Kurtz is destroyed by his battle between ruthless soldiering, the morality of that ruthlessness, and the guilt born by soldiers who do the deed. Captain Willard finishes off an innocent wounded girl on a boat. To take her to an aid station would delay his mission to kill Kurtz. Kurtz feels that determination , training, and ruthlessness is lacking in the US effort. He criticizes the US leadership strategy. He must be killed. This final crazy solution is to nuke the whole country !The S Vietnamese are double agents and corrupt. The NV are determined ruthless warriors. They will do anything to win. They have a cause, the US cause is weak. The whole bunny scene shows,how out of focus the US effort is.I found this to be well cast, had excellent photography ,and a fine coherent story in the longer version. It's like a long dreamlike trip, on drugs ? Or a nightmare, lived by the soldiers, caused by lying sit at home politicians and incompetent rear echelon strategists.

The War That Led To Insanity And Beyond,"Attempting to stay clear of, by running parallel to, the clichéd ""what is the point of war"" motif, Francis Ford Coppola directs a stunning portrayal of loyalty, service and madness during the Vietnam war, perhaps the most surreal and nonsensical of all wars, through his most surreal and the most hard hitting about the condition of men in war, Apocalypse Now. Coppola never glamorises the war, he never shies away from showing the brutal nature of the war, capturing scenes of brutal savagery, the irony of which being that these acts of barbarism were not committed by the Vietnamese that were viewed as savages, but the Americans that came to liberate them.Through the performances of his three leading men Coppola continually pounds in to the viewer the sheer insanity of the Vietnam war, that these were soldiers sent out to ostensibly protect the South Vietnamese (as well purge the ever spreading threat of communism) but ended up killing them as much as the Vietcong. That these men are trained to be killing machines and are then somehow expected to maintain morality. The jungles provide a wonderful backdrop to the film as they themselves become part of a transcendent blur, where these lines of consciousness and insanity meet, creating the feel of something out of a nightmare, when for many it was real life.Martin Sheen as Captain Willard gives a memorable performance for as he progresses up the ever narrowing, ever encapsulating ever confining river the degrees of insanity he encounters increases, as does the ever increasing doubt in himself. Encountering Robert Duvall as the bloodthirsty war mongering Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore whose name sums up all that need be said. An officer who enjoys killing ""Charlie"" with a well executed plan as much as going surfing on a beach still hot with activity and gets his jollies from sniffing napalm in the morning breeze. As Willard learns more about the officer he must confront at the end of the mission the more of the officer he sees in himself, as a surreally erotic U.S.O shows turn the troops into lecherous madmen and he passes encampments where the occupants are permanently verging on schizophrenic he ponders over that line that others have crossed and he feels himself slipping onto.The final confrontation leaves Willard in a state of moral upheaval, he sees why the men have succumb and understands their reasonings, and he sees that same potential in himself, which makes for the epic meeting between Willard and the seemingly deranged but philosophically poetic Colonel Kurtz. Kurtz is the personification of all that is whispering to Willard from one half of his being, apotheosising the negative aspects, into the god like being he presents before the natives. Finding himself in the uncompromising position of the head to head confrontation he must ascertain whether Kurtz is truly insane or whether he is seeing the world with unclouded eyes. Coppola's adaptation is an engrossing affair shot simply, in a realistically gritty manner. Delivered is a stark and brutal account of the nonsensicalities of war, the oxymorons and dichotomies, how the soldiers are expected to kill and yet somehow remain human. His leads carry the humanist element effectively and make it a convincing and utterly stunning affair into the psyches of men who must risk their all, and often in the process risk losing themselves. This isn't a story about Vietnam, this is the story of a man in pursuit, not of a colonel, but of himself against the forces that surround him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now and again and again,"This Vietnam War epic is a must-see for lovers of war dramas. The only trouble is which of the three versions to watch. The original version, from 1979, runs 2 hours 27 minutes. The ""Redux"" version, released in 2001, runs 3 hours 16 minutes, and the ""Final Cut"" version, released in 2019 for the 40th Anniversary, runs 3 hours and 2 minutes. There are a couple reasons why Francis Ford Coppola would re-cut and re-release the film twice. Directors are notorious for wanting final cut over their films, but are at the behest of the studio, so they want to show you all the other scenes they shot. The majority of the time Director's Cuts do not make the film better, meaning they make it worse. Coppola has another reason to keep re-cutting and re-releasing this film: money. He actually owns the rights to the film, which allows him to generate more revenue with each subsequent release.

Give yourself the time to fully absorb everything you are watching and, if you appreciate war films, you will likely find yourself in a state of flow when watching this.It starts off with ""The End"" by the Doors and voice over by sheen, setting the stage for what kind of soldier he is before this mission,& lets you know he's ready to take on a vague mission- he'd have taken any mission, but this is what he got. His mental state is already in question, as this happened to many soldiers in Vietnam. He and the crew solidly represent the range of soldier attitudes and circumstances found in 'Nam. Go on a journey with them, as they attempt to complete their mission, (hopefully) unscathed. They don't jsut stay on the boat the entire time, FFC does a fantastic job of immersing them in the side missions and arenas they find themselves in; further allowing the audience to understand the depths of this wars chaotic nature-& what it does to a soldier in that environment.It's really a perfect film, which I don't want to ruin for anyone.

"""Horror and moral terror are your﻿ friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies.""","A+The 1979 Francis Ford Coppola legend, it's definitely a must see. There has been many a film to depict the nightmare that was Vietnam, among the most popular being ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) and ""Platoon"" (1986). They're all incredible films, my personal favorite being ""Platoon"" (William Dafoe just won my heart), but when it comes to striking visuals this one takes the lead. The film is saturated with low-key lighting throughout, quite literally giving the movie the feeling of a horror story. The screenplay is greatly inspired by Joseph Conrad's novella ""Heart of Darkness""; hence the majority of the movie takes place on a fictional river.While certainly a historical piece, the focal point to me would be the inner true savage nature of man which is brought out to the full by the war's onslaught. The notion it seeks to point out is that man has tried to 'domesticate' war, and to an extent their drive to kill. That is what Marlon Brando's character so vividly mocks; the top brass' attempt to make warfare humane. Though some consider his character to truly be insane, I believe he's simply ""a puppet who can see the strings"".The cast is pretty exceptional, with Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishburne, Robert Duvall as the odd Kilgore, and Dennis Hopper in similar role to the one he had in ""Easy Riders"" (1969). And who could forget Sam Bottoms as the acid-tripping soldier who by the end of the movie had not much of a mind left. Adding to this is the psychedelic score by Carmine Coppola, which fits the time yet hasn't aged in the least. In fact, it adds dread to the atmosphere, a dread I honestly haven't seen in a war film since. But above all, I can say the film probably has the most epically shot battle scene of all time when it comes to war movies. Everyone knows it; in fact there was a nice little homage in Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (2009). The timeless Wagner piece 'Ride of the Valkyries' plays as long shots show the extensive damage and mayhem. The music, the quick-cutting and the cinematography come together to make a perfect scene.""Apocalypse Now"" is a Coppola spectacle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Quality work,"This film portrays the horrors of being in a war.The film manages to show how the soldiers go through very horrifying moments when they are in combat, as well as how they become more and more dehumanized due to these battles and how all this turns into mental disorders that severely affect their mental health. It also demonstrates the injustices that the inhabitants of the invaded territory experience when they are deprived of their liberty and sow fear. The movie has great explosion sequences, great battle scenes that look very real, it has good acting, and the locations where it was filmed look very real. Although it also has totally unnecessary nudity and in the end the dynamic rhythm of the story falls off as the ending is excessively long.It is a movie that is enjoyed but you have to be patient, especially at the end because of its long duration, but it shows well what it is to be in a war and how terrible it can impact a single person.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"A brutal, bloody masterpiece.","Some people argue that Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest movies ever made. After watching this film, I can understand their side of the argument. After further research into this film, I have only learned to love this film even more.Watching Apocalypse Now is like observing a slow descent into madness. More than observing, the audience is actively descending into this madness itself. Martin Sheen as Captain Willard lets the audience get into the mind of a soldier slowly losing it. His performance in this film is unmatchable. As Captain Willard gets closer to his goal, we can see how things begin to unravel piece-by-piece. The river itself as a metaphor of the slow descent.Marlon Brando, for his brief appearance in the film as Colonel Kurtz, shows the other side of the madness. The soldier who actually lost his mind and let the war consume him. Chilling and provocative.And I couldn't help but notice that Harrison Ford and Laurence Fishburne made appearances in this film. Truly an AAA+ cast all around.The set pieces used in this film are unmatchable. In a world of pre-CGI, practical effects were the way to go. And this film is far from short of that. Explosions, gunfire, the gore is on full display.

The greatest movie ever made,"Okay, maybe not the greatest movie ever made, but certainly my favorite. Coppola experienced a golden age in the 70s, making four of the greatest films ever made (The Godfather I and II, The Conversation, Apocalypse Now), but this film, released at the end of a revolutionary decade in film, made in the worst possible conditions, plagued by mental and physical ailments among cast and crew, seemingly doomed from the start, comes across as a complete masterpiece, utterly absorbing for every minute and in many ways absolutely terrifying.Martin Sheen, who suffered a near-fatal heart attack during shooting, shows pain and inner turmoil in every single line he forces out and every single facial expression. This can hardly even be called acting; when Sheen looks directly into the camera at different points throughout the movie there is no indication on his face that he sees it at all.The same can be said of Brando's acting. As he rambles on about pilots writing obscene words on their airplanes and rubbing his thumb along his eyebrows, he seems lost inside his own mind. This is Brando's most obscure and inaccessible work by far, but it's a rush to watch him go over the top and down the other side.Dennis Hopper, Robert Duvall, and a very, very young Laurence Fishburne also turn in amazing performances, representing different facets of the insanity of war. Also look for bit parts for Harrison Ford and Scott Glenn. But overall, just sit back and allow one of the most immersive experiences in the history of film take you on a very dark, very pretentious (I say this with nothing but respect) journey into man's ""heart of darkness"".(11/10) (or very emphatic 10, whatever sounds more reasonable)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Sure, war is hell, and that's the point of the movie.  I can even see why Brando felt his performance should be filmed in the dark.  When Robert Duvall's character, Colonel Kilgore, commands the village attack sequence, we are brought into the ""reality"" of the Vietnam conflict.

"Auteurs let sometimes inspiration be hollow, or fake it","Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness was about venturing into the moral depths of colonial Africa. Though it wasn't an immediate sensation, it evidently was not ignored by the literary community. The famous line announcing the antagonist's demise, ""Mistah Kurtz-he dead,"" served as an epigraph to T. S. Eliot's poem ""The Hollow Men.""
Eighty years after Conrad's book debuted, the Coppola film Apocalypse Now hit the big screen. Though lightly influenced by Heart of Darkness, the movie's setting was not the Belgian Congo, but the Vietnam War. And though the antagonist (played by Marlon Brando) was named Kurtz, that particular Kurtz was no ivory trader, but a U. S. military officer who had become mentally unhinged.The book began and ended in the United Kingdom. Though it recounted Marlow's voyage through Belgian Congo in search of Kurtz and is forever linked to the African continent, Conrad's novella began and ended in England. At the story's conclusion, the ""tranquil waterway"" that ""seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness"" was none other than the River Thames.The well-traveled protagonist, Marlow-who appears in other Conrad works, such as Lord Jim-was based on his equally well-traveled creator. In 1890, 32-year-old Conrad sailed the Congo River while serving as second-in-command on a Belgian trading company steamboat. As a career seaman, Conrad explored not only the African continent but also ventured to places ranging from Australia to India to South America.Colonizing was then, when the book appeared,all the rage . Imperialism-now viewed as misguided, oppressive, and ruthless-was much in vogue when Conrad hit shelves. The ""Scramble for Africa"" had seen European powers stake their claims on the majority of the continent. Britain's Queen Victoria was portrayed as the colonies' ""great white mother."" Since the wise magi saw the star in the East, Christianity had found no nobler expression. Conrad, however, did not echo the imperialistic exuberance. He no champion of colonialism,
Chinua Achebe-the Nigerian author -delivered a 1975 lecture called ""An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness"" that described Conrad as a ""thoroughgoing racist"" and his ubiquitous classic novella as ""an offensive and deplorable book."" However, even Achebe credited Conrad for having ""condemned the evil of imperial exploitation."" And others have recognized Heart of Darkness as an indictment of the unfairness and barbarity of the colonial system.Heart of Darkness managed to ascend to immense prominence in the 1950s, after the planet had witnessed ""the horror""-Kurtz's last words in the book-of WWII and the ramifications of influential men who so thoroughly indulged their basest instincts.Coppola's film was based on a terrible misreading of Conrad. Coppola turned a brilliant piece of fiction into a visual disaster. The complex narrative was transformed in ordinary Kitsch. The final scenes, involving Dennis Hopper and Marlon Brando , are lame.What, then, can one see in ""Apocalypse Now""?Little more than all the one-sided anti-American, anti-Vietnam-war stereotypes of those times: Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries subtly suggesting that America might be a counterpart to National Socialism); the denunciation of the ""Ugly American"" alienation; the irony & smartness of metaphors like juxtaposing warfare and surfer-safaris ; and so on. Hardly ""the most honest account of the futility of war."" A better description is ""a schizophrenic approach to the randomness of guerrilla warfare."" An ambiguous fantasy.

"This film is like effective medicine, it leaves a really nasty taste but its good for you.",I watched this film for the first time with some friends round about the time it came out on video. I did not like it that much and decided it was just bad. Years later I watched this again on my own and unexpectedly tuned in to the themes which in my opinion is about madness and hope. In my opinion if you watch this film and see everybody as either being crazy or at the very least on the slippery slope to being crazy and in some cases knowing it then I think you will understand what this film is all about. Some of the characters at times act as if there is element of normality in what they do but it doesn't last as the world where this film is set comes crashing in to destroy any hope they may have. The destruction comes in various forms but the end result is always the same. This film is not a feel good film but it is wonderfully well made and everybody who were involved made a contribution and when it finished I said to myself but for the grace of my god I might have been there. I tried to put myself in that jungle on my own and ill equipped mentally or physically and I would have either died quickly or gone mad even quicker. It is a disturbing study of numerous people trying to survive under extreme circumstances and not succeeding.

"A relatable version of ""Heart of Darkness""","The basic story is that Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who was sent to Vietnam (60's era) to correct a problem, now sees the problem differently and has exceeded his authority in the correction. Therefore Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched to dispatch the colonel. In this Joseph Campbell (""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"") type adventure, he meets with many situations that help him grow and understand the problem that Colonel Kurtz faced. Will he complete his mission or succumb to the same forces as the colonel in the heart of darkness?This is an updated version of Joseph Conrad's book ""Heart of Darkness"" with a lot of Francis Ford Coppola thrown in. The location is Viet Nam, instead of Africa, and as with any update; they thought it would be more relevant than trying to explain the Congo. Toss in some songs from the 60's era (""The Best of the Doors""- 'The End'), and some classics (Wagner - ""Die Walkure: Ride of the Valkyries""), and you have a movie. Too bad it is not that easy.I would not worry too much whether this looks like Vietnam or if certain events take place, as that is not the point of the picture or the intent of the storytelling. The feeling of the book was conveyed. And I would not worry if it does not match the book's story word for word as this is a different medium. If you come away with the question ""what would I do if it were me?"" it worked.Not to distract from the movie review, however, I was in Viet Nam (1967-1968) in an armed reconnaissance organization. And the Vietnam I was in did not have surrealistic scenes. We did get to see Bob Hope and Martha Ray in ""The Big Broadcast of 1938"" (1938). Before that, I always thought it was a bunch of hype. However, it did have influence in having them take the time to go there. So, I could see something as weird as the bunny scene happening.Besides the movie, there are scenes of the destruction of the Kurtz compound set. They were required to clean up after the movie was made. Coppola says that these scenes were removed from the end of the movie, so people did not think that it was part of the story. However, I saw this on TV, and they left the scenes in, and I did think it was part of the story.Another movie interpretation of ""Heart of Darkness"" was made later. Not quite as moving as Apocalypse Now, but you should see it compared to the original, ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death ""(1988).

This tale is of a man who boats up the Congo River to kill a colonel named Kurtz. Oh, and it was written in the late 1800s.  Curious that it is set on a different continent and about a hundred years later, during the peak of the Vietnam War.  Apocalypse Now follows one soldier's mission to kill a rampaging colonel.

Great war epic from Coppola,"Coppola's masterful war film about a Vietnam war captain(Sheen) who is on a mission to kill a renegade green beret who has set himself up as a leader of a local tribe in Cambodia. The film is written well by JOhn Milius and Francis Ford Coppola, directed beautifully by the master director who did his best work in the 70s and this one was his last film of the decade (although in my eyes 83' film Outsiders was brilliant as well). Apocalypse now is a long, detailed, poetic account of the story inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness novel. The cast is great in this film, Brando, Duvall and Hopper are all great while the best performance came from Martin Sheen in the lead. It was also nice to see Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne and Scott Glenn in supporting roles. I liked the cinematography from Vittorio Storaro, and the musical pieces as well.

Brilliant Excursion Into The Heart of Darkness!,"My highest praise goes to Francis Ford Coppola!  In this movie, he hashit upon Joseph Conrad's true intention better than one thousandEnglish teachers lecturing together could have.I first read Heart of Darkness in high school.  At that time, the wordsand images seemed as strange and fleeting as those in a dream.  Istruggled to make sense of what I was reading.  The entire story seemed unreal, as though what I were reading couldn't really be happening.After seeing ""Apocalypse Now: Redux,"" the meaning of Heart of Darkness, the original literary source of the movie, has become clear to me. The novel seems convoluted and confused because the author's intent is toshow the deepest depths of darkness in human nature and the despair andconfusion of the human mind when confronted by amorphous, total evil.Coppola brilliantly sets the action and commentary in the movie againstthe backdrop of the jungles of Southeast Asia and the Vietnam War.In that milieu, the images and action unfold in the same nightmarishway as they do in Conrad's novel.  I think Joseph Conrad would bepleasantly surprised and maybe even grateful at the way Coppola hasbrought his novel to life.The characters jump out at you:  Captain Willard and the men under hiscommand, the men and women of the French plantation, the photojournalist apostle of Kurtz, to the irrepressible essence of darkest evilpersonified by Kurtz himself.""The horror. . . the horror. . . .""  These words uttered by Kurtzcapture the essence of the movie and the novel.  The presence of evilnags at us, disquiets us, disturbs us vaguely, even in our most peaceful and secure moments.  The dark side of human nature demands a seriousconsideration.  It will not let us flee.  Its influence, its dark,brooding shadow, is everywhere:  in the jungle, in our hearts, in oursouls.Conrad knew nothing of the Vietnam War, or even the two world wars.  Helived before them.  But I'm sure that he could appreciate the perfectatmosphere for his novel that total war provides.  Coppola is a greatilluminator of Conrad's intention and his own in ""Apocalypse Now."" A fine touch, a superb touch, worthy of an Oscar.  The movie and thebook, though controversial, are memorable on many levels.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"You're an errand boy, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.","Apocalypse Now is a epic psychological war film directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

Some good scenes here and there regarding war and when they did the war scenes it was great and looked really good too but this wasn't a war film and didn't showcase actual warfare a lot. When you saw the devastation of Vietnam and how the soldiers had to live in Vietnam it's crazy and the things that would happen there, I thought showing the tragedy of it was pretty good. The cinematography was pretty good though showcasing the sunset mood lighting the best. It's just too long for a film where barely anything relevant to the story happens. The characters aren't that great apart from Captain Benjamin Willard who is probably the only good character in the film. It's just a long movie with not a lot going on with some nice looking scenes along the way.

Smells Like Victory,"""Apocolypse Now"" is more of a piece of art than a movie. The cinematography, acting, directing, score and screenplay work together as a whole better than any movie has ever done. As a period piece it is widely compared to ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" as to which movie more accurately depicts the Vietnam war. I have heard by many in my family who fought in Vietnam that ""Platoon"" does better at showing the experience of everyday life in Vietnam but that ""Apocolypse Now"" hands down displays the truest feelings of despair, hopelessness and loss that took place in Vietnam. Loss as in the loss of one's self.Throughout the whole movie there is a constant elusive reality that the characters in the movie loose more and more as they travel up the river. The movie is so thought provoking and psychedelic that it entrances you and begs you to watch it. And what Brando does in this film is nothing less than perfect. Marlon Brando accomplished displaying sanity within insanity and makes every viewer of movie question what truth and power really are.To watch Duvall stand in the middle of a battlefield affixed in a mechanic yet vulnerable state is quite an experience to witness and probably one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Not to mention, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed for twelve strait hours. When it was all over I walked up and we didn't find a one of 'em. Not one stinking dink body.

Review as if it was just released today,"For years I heard so much about Apocalypse Now, but just tonight I finally got around to watching it. Since so much has already been said about its importance, significance, and achievements, I'm going to do a raw review, like I just watched a brand new movie that came out today so rather than analyze, I'll be a reactionary film-goer just exiting the theater.Wow, this movie is crazy! It is one of the craziest movies I have ever seen.From a technical perspective, it is really phenomenal. Coppola directs a stunning depiction of the Vietnam war as a backdrop for the story of a man on a classified mission to find a former well-respected Colonel who has lost his mind in the midst of the war and is now running some kind of a cult in Cambodia with a small colony of Vietnamese, Vietcong, and Cambodians in the jungle.Most of the aspects of the film are perfect, from the acting to the directing, writing, cinematography, action sequences, and editing. In addition, there are several unforgettable characters (Kilgore) and some unforgettable lines along the way (I love the smell of napalm in the morning).But the story itself is insane as it unfolds and you get to eventually see Colonel Kurtz, the mad soldier who went astray from his command and formed some crazy pagan-worshipping like cult, where he is some sort of high priest of some sort.I still am not sure what to think about it. I don't know how much I like the film because the end is sort of disturbing and open to interpretation. all I know is it seems possible to assume that the whole entire point of the film was to expose and reveal the horrors of war, especially the Vietnam war. It is not a movie that is meant to take lightly, it seems.It is more of a social commentary on the questions of war. For that, I would say it succeeded in most ways, but for a movie that is going to become one of your favorites because of entertainment purposes, it won't be that kind of movie. While some parts, you'd want to watch again (anything with Kilgore and a few of the scenes in the beginning), as a whole it doesn't have much rewatch value. But it is definitely a riveting film and technically it is excellent. The story, however, is just a little too disturbing and dark to become a favorite.I'll give it a high score for the technical achievements, but it is not even close to being one of my favorites because in the end I thought the story was too dark and needed more explanation. For example, we knew the guy was nuts from the beginning, and while it was hinted he might be a genius, he never spoke anything that was totally mind blowing and his character therefore could have been developed more once the assassin arrived. The open interpretation works as a contemplative trick to produce an uncanny reaction and unique response, but more explanation or perhaps more plot development once the film arrived at Kurtz would have actually worked even better, and the potential was there.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Is this one the pinnacle of anti vietnam war movies ?,"30 years too late , I now sense that I would not have been able to view this in 1979. It is darker than dark , unremitting and never flagging

with as much tension as the finished product , even today in 2021 ! "" the few words of dialogue which i do not recall accurately were.
""you are fighting this war for nothing "" This depiction of that war is a testimony to the stupidity , not only of man and sometimes woman ,
fighting, killing, maiming, traumatising to a level that any survivor will never succeed in rehabilitation or recovery , also we the viewers
cannot for one second escape the crude futility of what we are witnessing ? Many brilliant authors and no less numbers of brilliant movie
directors and producers have given us a small window through which we may observe this specific futile pointless and exaggeratedly costly
high human loss rates and exorbitant financial squandering ! The egotistical pure evil and confusion ensuing during those fateful 10 years
of American embarrassment will live infamously in history books throughout the civilised world for decades . Although this movie is undoubtedly accurate as an historical account of a fictional narrative,, it should be shown to school graduates and university students as
a stark example of how when they are in charge to never permit such disagreements leading to all out war . I highly recommend this movie
which I hope and trust no other movie makers will ever attempt to think they could do their version , as nothing and no one can do additional justice to any future war film . Read as many reviews as you can, as they are all valid, apart from the spoilers. And anyone who has the staying
power to sit and watch this right to the very last frame , hopefully will fully realise the powers that control us are very often out of control themselves .....Michael.......",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocolpyse Now and the Horror,"Coppola's epic ""Apocalypse Now"" is probably one of the most important war movies in history. The movie does not only address political topics like war, colonialism, imperialism and capitalism, but also covers philosophical topics like absurdity, the inner-self and savageness of man kind. The criticism of America's involvement in southeast Asia is obvious. The film does not hesitate to portray everything that is a result of capitalism and imperialism as evil and negative, hitting a nerve, since the US's involvement in foreign countries is criticized to this day, making the film extremely contemporary. While the movie is an adaption of the novel ""Hearths of Darkness"", which addresses the effects of colonialism in the Belgian Congo, ""Apocalypse Now"" portrays the exact same effects, just changing the setting and adding the nuance of modern cold war imperialism. The philosophical standpoint of the film is just as important as its political message. The idea of horror is the main idea of the movie. The horror being our savage selves, which can only be reached through a long journey, during which we lose piece by piece our civilized face, our existence falling into absurdity. Coppola manages to portray the search of our inner self as something we don't want to discover. While most movies try to portray this journey as a sentimental journey, connecting to ourselves, Coppola portrays it as a long, violent and dark path that, after watching the movie we don't want to go down, out of fear, not out of fear of encountering horror, but becoming it. Apocalypse Now triggers a feeling of absurdity: How can there be a sense of life if at the end of the journey to our inner selves we encounter plein horror. By giving the viewer this feeling Coppola connects the movie to the French writer Albert Camus' idea of the pointless life, existence with no reason, since if we turn to our savage selves we turn into something condemned by society: horror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Left speechless by Apocalypse,"Francis Ford Coppolla's tenacious ability to produce a true masterpiece against all the odds is summed up by Apocalypse Now. The struggles that enveloped the production are well documented, yet, nearly a quarter of a century later, the film remains a real gem.It's debatable whether Apocalypse Now is a bona-fide depiction of war experience; it's skill, however, is to combine chaos, mismanagement and human suffering with the 'horror' of war and brutality.Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novella, Heart of Darkness, Coppolla brings out a string of memorable performance. Martin Sheen, undoubtedly, is the real star of the film, despite being credited behind Brando and Duvall in the titles.Coupled with stunning cinematography and sound, the imagery employed by Coppolla is like poetry. The feeling of movement throughout the film - as the boat heads up river in contrast with the current of the water, diverted only by, in the 'Redux' version, the French plantation scene, which adds a historical and philosophical dimension - builds up to an ambivalente conclusion. The intrigue at the finish provides the most one of the most effective endings to a film ever. Few movies leave me completely speechless at the end, though Coppolla knows exactly how to achieve this.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The same goes for the overlong French Quarter visit scene. It was way too long and putting the movie to a complete standstill.

Apocalypse Now Redux: the masterpiece of epic proportion,"Words could not adequately describe the power of experiencing Apocalypse Now Redux screened in 70mm on the gigantic screen at Jordon Commons in Sandy, Utah with the audience who drove tens of miles to attend - young and old alike. Awe-inspiring, mind-blowing, astonishing.Apocalypse Now Redux is a vast improvement upon the original, albeit with a radically different political viewpoint. I consider myself a fan of the original (as the owner of the 1991 reissue laserdisc), but I was stunned by the ""restored"" version. There are footages that are legendary for being missing from the original, most famously the French plantation sequence (which, before the re-release, could only be seen in the making-of documentary Hearts of Darkness). The wait is worth 22 years for the re-release. Francis Ford Coppola commissioned his last great film in the restored, expanded and remastered version because the viewers of Apocalypse Now 5-hour bootleg video wrote the letters requesting restoration. The result is Mr. Coppola giving back to the cinema fans as a compliment. Without film lovers' enthusiastic support, the re-edited and restored re-release wouldn't be possible and the lost footages would stay missing in the vault.The film exemplifies the madness of war and violence. Francis said regarding the underlying metaphor of war and insanity in the film at a press conference at Cannes 1979: ""It is NOT about Vietnam War. It IS Vietnam War"". That's well said by watching the horror of the war and madness in Apocalypse Now Redux and Terrence Malick's (equally flawed as the original theatrical cut of Apocalypse Now) World War II film The Thin Red Line.It's worth the time and energy watching the 3 1/4 hour film. Apocalypse Now Redux is quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made, but that's my opinion. I hope the film gets nominated again for the Oscars.I give my gratitude to Francis Ford Coppola, Bob Weinstein and the Redux restoration crew for the masterpiece that will remain undelible in the epic proportion of vision, sound and politics in the history of film for years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Journey into the Heart of Darkness,"Experiencing ""Apocalypse Now"" is akin to stepping into a surreal nightmare where the lines between sanity and chaos blur. I remember the first time I watched it; I was captivated from the very first frame. The haunting visuals and the dissonant score set the stage for a journey that felt both epic and intimate. The film's portrayal of the Vietnam War is not just a depiction of conflict but a deep dive into the human psyche, exploring the darkness that resides within us all.As Martin Sheen's Captain Willard embarks on his harrowing mission up the river, I felt an unsettling sense of dread. Each scene unfolded like a fever dream, with the jungle becoming a character in its own right-lush and beautiful, yet menacing and oppressive. The cinematography was breathtaking, capturing the stark contrast between the serene beauty of nature and the horrors of war. I was struck by the sheer brutality of it all, especially during the infamous napalm scene, where the juxtaposition of The Doors' music against the backdrop of destruction left an indelible mark on my memory.What truly resonated with me was the philosophical undercurrent of the film. The journey was not just about finding Colonel Kurtz; it was a descent into madness, a confrontation with the moral ambiguity of war. The film forces you to grapple with uncomfortable questions about power, morality, and the human condition. As I watched Willard confront Kurtz, I felt the weight of those questions pressing down on me, leaving me in a state of reflection long after the credits rolled.""Apocalypse Now"" is not a film you watch lightly; it's an experience that lingers, a haunting reminder of the cost of conflict. It challenges you to confront the darkness within and around us, making it a masterpiece that transcends its time. I left the viewing not just entertained but profoundly moved, with a deeper understanding of the complexities of war and the fragility of humanity.

I'm judging it by the (relatively-)timeless standard of film storytelling.It seems incoherent, meandering, with no real point to it, apart from the pointlessness of war. Was that the point?  If so, why did it take Coppola so long to make it?",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Thanks Mr. Coppola,"Apocalypse now This is a story of one squad in Vietnam war. Colonel Kurtz, who used to be a great commander, governs his own empire in deep jangle and against the U.S. army. Captain Willard and his squad are send to assassinate him. They keep on the way in the miserable battle field. We cannot deny that this is one of Coppola's masterpieces and I'm sure it will be forever as a great Vietnam war film. He describes the madness, which seems to be unique to Vietnam war. Everyone and everything has madness in Vietnam in those days. We can view such element in every single scene, especially the ending. It is so shocking and crazy, but probably we expected it since the story started. Also this is the irony of the madness of the U.S. Military action.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Superb,"I really enjoyed Apocalypse Now, but can't help think that I missed something as I'm not quite understanding all the hype around it.It lays bare the horror of war in a spectacularly brutal and uncompromising fashion. It looks incredible. The direction from Coppola is flawless. The acting superb.But I just found something missing, perhaps in the plot itself, which makes it hard for me to score it higher than an 8.A terrific film nonetheless and an unquestionable classic and defining movie of the Vietnam War.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Few Great Moments but Many Poor Ones,"""Apocalypse Now"" shows some greatness here and there, but its also one of the most over-rated movies. Its a very good illustration of why egotistical directors often need someone to make big cuts in their work due to self-indulgence. Here and there, much of ""AN"" stretches on seemingly endlessly, with very little compensation in imagery, especially in the longer version. Some of the images and other elements might satisfy those with a taste for the surreal, but that's not a lot to say for such a long movie. And often ""surreal"" is just a fancy name for pretentiousness.The whole French episode is silly, and seems pretty pointless except to show that the French once had a presence in Vietnam, and to exhibit the physical attributes of one French actress. Much of the dialog in this segment is unintentionally comical too, including at a funeral. The French episode along with an extended stay with some stranded Playboy bunnies badly break up the continuity of the plot, with very long interludes in which nothing much happens except for some sophomoric humor in the case of the bunnies. On the other hand, an advantage of the longer movie version over the one initially released in theaters is that it includes a few brief clips early on which reveal a bit more about the major characters on the boat.I'm unimpressed by the characterizations throughout the movie. The characters mostly seem as if they were pulled from a comic book. For those who remember the old Sergeant Rock comic books, AN is sort of like a spacy, cynical, hip version of them. And its fashionable nowadays to criticize earlier war movies for their inclusion of soldiers from all walks of life: the poor kid, the farm boy, the immigrant, the rich kid, etc. AN, for all its pseudo-sophistication, does a 1970's version of this, particularly with the boat crew.For me, Dennis Hopper and Robert Duvall are by far the best elements of the movie. Hopper as a wacked-out, guru-following photographer is very much like a few 1960's relics whom I've known, and he nicely captures their wackiness, obsessions and paranoia. Robert Duvall is also good as the cocky, driven, combative officer who shows flashes of compassion. He and Hopper were much more memorable than the main characters in the boat, except maybe for the Fishburne character nicknamed ""Clean."" Brando shows off his weirdness, which is somewhat appropriate for the role of Kurtz. For my taste, it would have been more satisfying to see Kurtz more, but the filmmakers probably wanted to keep some mysteriousness about him, which is legitimate.Don't watch AN thinking that this is a ""Vietnam movie."" Please people, remember that you won't get history from movies like this! Sure, AN shows some of the absurdity and horror of that war, but there is absurdity and horror in every war, and in many other major human undertakings. AN does touch upon a few aspects of Vietnam such as the jungle settings, draftees, poor morale in some sectors, and no front lines, but it seems to fit more into some sort of adventure/mythology/noir genre than a realistic depiction of war.On the plus side, AN serves at times as a pretty good adventure story, or it would if it was drastically cut. Much of the credit for its good story elements and major themes should go to Joseph Conrad, who wrote Heart of Darkness upon which AN is very loosely based. The combat scenes with the Air Cavalry are also pretty well done, and some of the imagery is nice and imaginative, such as the boat floating underneath a wrecked plane. Overall, though, the sophomoric humor and pretentiousness which saturate this movie are big flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
They say either you love it or hate it...,"I am not a big fan of this movie. I understand that its disjointedness and melancholy feel is supposed to be representative of the war, but I found it absurd in many ways. I remember my response when my wife asked me what I was watching and, when I told her, she asked if it was as good as they say. I told her that the cinematography was phenomenal, but the story line was not believable and most of the characters were not accurate representations of 90% of the people who served in Vietnam.In my opinion, Vietnam is the war in which film makers still want to use to push a pacifist or leftist agenda. There were hundreds of thousands of Vietnam veterans who served their country proudly and loyally who have yet to have their story told.

One might argue that Apocalypse Now tries to do everything at once and that's true but it's also what makes it one of the most original films on war.

Coppola, takes you on an awe inspiring oddysey through the Vietnam war.  The dark frightening jungle, and the omonous river that snakes through it are amazing, and each scene takes you farther from reality and into a realm of madness. The movie takes a while for Willard to get up the river to meet Kurtz, however his character is so beautifully dramatized, I feel like I know him, respect him, and fear him before he is introduced.

Apocalypse Now,"This is, I think, the definitive Vietnam war movie. Martin Sheen is ""Capt. Willard"", a war weary veteran who is sent on a top secret mission to track down and stop the rogue Colonel 'Kurtz"" (Marlon Brando) who is operating independently from Cambodia. With only a small crew of rookie squaddies, he sets off along the treacherous Nung River where, along the way, they alight on ""Kilgore"" (Robert Duvall) and face all sorts of dangers against both man and nature as they seek their quarry. The sheer intensity of the journey, and of the challenges it throws up cause ""Willard"" to re-evaluate his whole perspective, and not just on the war, as the horrors of this conflict manifest before him. It's a stunningly strong depiction of war; the humanity and vulnerability of the characters - even those who are outwardly strong - and the casting is inspired. It's bloody and gory at times, but never gratuitously and the closely shorn Brando is in a class of his own as the megalomaniac ""Kurtz"". Though fictional in fact, it doesn't pull it's punches and leaves us all with a bitter taste in our mouth and some seriously thought-provoking questions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Possibly the greatest adapted screenplay in history,"Having seen this film for the second time about two months ago, I am yet to finish wiping my brains off the walls from when my mind blew. Going into the film I was slightly sceptcial due to the disappointment of the Godfather series. I had also seen The Conversation, which was impressive, so I decided to give this one a shot. To this day it is indisputably my favourite film.I had always considered Heart of Darkness to be one of the great literary texts, and its adaptation is as close to perfect as I can imagine. The genius of Coppola is in the initial idea to turn Conrad's novella into a war film set in Vietnam, allowing him some flexibility with the characters. Captain Willard, played superbly by Martin Sheen, replaces Conrad's literary character Charles Marlow, and other replacements are visible throughout the film (Dennis Hopper replacing 'the Russian' for example). Coppola, whose understanding of the text seems absolute, saw that a literal adaptation of the novella would prove to be impossible, or at least fail (as the film 'Heart of Darkness' proved), because it could not possibly preserve the philosophical intensity prevalent in Conrad's writing. The film combines a brilliant script, great performances (particularly from Sheen and Robert Duvall), and stunning visual effects to do justice to one of the great philosophical works.The main themes of Heart of Darkness, namely the underlying irrationality of society and the true violent nature of humanity, are explored cleverly and comprehensively through the setting of war, one of the great showcases for these themes. The intensity of the book which is impossible to translate into film is more than made up for by the incredible special effects which will have you gasping for much of the time.I agree with IMDb's top 250 in one sense; a Coppola movie should indeed be at #1, but it isn't the Godfather part II",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A wandering elephant,"""My movie is not ABOUT Vietnam,"" Francis Ford Coppola said at a press conference during the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.  ""It IS Vietnam.""  The men who actually fought that never officially declared war may disagree that ""Apocalypse Now,"" the movie is question, is what its director claimed, but there are similarities.  Like Vietnam, this film is long, pointless and costly.  It opens impressively, if pretentiously, with Lt. Willard, the almost ghostly protagonist, sprawled across a bed in a Saigon hotel room, mumbling through a voiceover reminiscent of a 1940s private eye movie, while helicopters are superimposed over his sweat-beaded face.  Before the scene concludes, Willard (Martin Sheen), seemingly suffers a nervous breakdown, smashing his hand through a mirror, then sinking to the floor, sobbing as The Doors perform ""The End"" on the soundtrack.  This surreal moment soon gives way to a scene that could have been lifted from a dozen James Bond movies:  Willard is ordered to track down and kill Colonel Kurtz, a mysterious figure who has established a military outpost that acknowledges no rule but his own.  What follows are some spectacular battle scenes, some good acting (Robert Duvall), some bad acting (Frederic Forrest), and some acting leftover from ""Easy Rider"" ten years earlier (Dennis Hopper), all of it as disconnected as the war itself.  When Willard finally confronts Colonel Kurtz, we find Marlon Brando, his head shaved and his enormous bulk swamped in shadows, lethargically mumbling incoherent dialogue that, instead of tying up loose ends, leaves them dangling as precariously than ever. The final moments are so darkly lit, it's debatable whether Willard carries out his mission or not. Peopled by actors who made their name in films with which Coppola was associated (Duvall, Forrest, Harrison Ford), or found renewed popularity under his direction (Brando), this is the biggest home movie ever made. It is essentially a vanity production fueled by the director's enormous ego. Who else but an egomaniac would make a comment like the one Coppola made at Cannes?  The true star of ""Apocalypse Now,"" however, is not Coppola or Brando, but Vittorio Storaro whose cinematography almost makes this wandering elephant worthwhile.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Napalm Can't Smell that Good,"War movies such as this put me in an emotional quandary which makes it hard for me to judge them.

A rewarding cinematic experience showcasing war and psyche.,"It is said that it took two years for the film to be edited, for Coppola had shot around 1.5 million feet of film. These endeavours have been a gift to the art of motion pictures and Coppola's Apocalypse Now is undoubtedly one of the finest movies ever made.
Vietnam War has found her place in many movies but none has got it better than this masterpiece.Coppola has shown almost every facet of the war: brutality, horror, innocent victims, arbitrariness and uncertainty. But, the film also takes us to a journey into a soldier's psyche who couldn't keep a line between what he has been through and what he currently is.Cinematography is the biggest plus of the film. The camera work combined with a very natural looking lighting has made sure that viewers go through the situations by themselves.As for the performances, they are mostly good. I really liked Robert Duvall as Colonel Kilgore and Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz, though his appearance was rather short.Other things to like about the film is the placement and variations of music. Rock n' Roll themes have been deployed in the initial parts which are in line with the lavish war breaking out there.

Redux impressions,"I hadn't seen the original theatre release version on home video in many years. So I wanted to see Redux when it appeared on TCM.The two scenes added were helpful for showing the boat crew a reminder of why they wanted to live in a free world, jeopardized by communism: the decadent French rubber plantation owners' sense of private ownership privilege, plus the decadent, gruesome Playboy bunny's riverfront campsite after being abused ala the sexual revolution of that era. I think those two scenes broadened the story's interest, made it more contemporary vs. Military-historic. That was emphasized by showing newspaper headlines from the times, to reinforce that message.What confused me at first, but later I understood why, was the boat crew members doing crazy things while in enemy territory. Such as yelling, playing loud music, and setting off smoke flares on their boat. That reckless behavior attracted them to ""Charlie"", ending up killing two of them. I didn't understand why the two more mature boat crew allowed the other three to do that multiple times, at first. But then empathized with them all, and understood sometimes they had to vent and escape in their minds. It was a microcosm of America in an unwelcoming world.The entire film is basically a mind trip on the human condition.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Near Hell, stir crazy","I first saw Apocalypse Now on TV and it seemed I had forgotten it all except the fact that I didn't find it all that good. The higher the expectations, the deeper the let-down. This year the 'Redux' version has been released and it was time for giving it a second chance. The jungle edge appears on screen. A dusty frame. Then the sound, dust-erratic. Eventually the music heralding the end slices through the dust. To no avail: Jim Morrison's voice permanently settles the torpor of violence that encompasses the whole movie. With no exit. Neither in Saigon nor at the end of the river. The napalm reminds me of what was this movie about. The heavy flames swallowing the resigned trees, human beings at odds with it... this is simply not the typical quest you could easily remember. No Graal, no Lost Ark. You're not relieved to see the hero achieving his goal.From beginning to end the movie is top art. Coppola likes to shoot his main character telling his mind with few lines but trying to make do with more nervous characters. The Conversation, The Godfather, and even Dracula works that way. You might find it brilliant but you might as well find it boring. The new scenes in the 'Redux' version are not less brilliant (i.e. interesting for movie enthusiasts at least) but do they make the movie greater?

Just watched it,"I bought the DVD and kept it for 3 years in my collection. Finally thought I was in the right mood to watch it last night. I have mixed feelings about this movie. I think we have been spoiled by recent war movies that puts the viewer right in the action - started as Saving Private Ryan, then recently Black Hawk Down, The fire fights were so intense in these movies you feel exhausted after that. Apocalypse Now was made in the older style, but I think it was cutting edge for its day. Note the helicopter attack sequences had lots of long shots and wide angles, you have a 'birds eye view' but do not feel that you are in the thick of the battle. No feeling of bullets whizzing past like Forrest Gump. As a Vietnam War Movie, I thought it was rather abstract. The characters were extreme and did not have the realism of Platoon, or even We Were Soldiers in its depiction of real soldiers. This unrealism gets more extreme towards the ending, and I wasn't sure if it ended up like Mad Max meets Planet of the Apes there. I think this was intended no doubt, but I was expecting more realism. This made the violence unreal and I couldn't connect with that. e.g. decapitated heads should have been gruesome, but in the context of the surreal camp grounds, it had as much effect on me as an Orc head from the Lord of the Rings. Sorry, but I do have a big problem with the ending sequence The cinematography was good, but some night shots had too much glare and lens flare from spotlights.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"This is the end, indeed!","I have just finished reading an interview with Vittorio Storaro, cinematographer for Apocalypse Now, and I am in a state of shock. Apparently, the plan, when preparing Apocalypse Now Redux, was to keep the original negative intact, and to edit the new material into a freshly struck inter positive. Unfortunately, the negative, 25 years old, was starting to fade, and Storaro was concerned that new prints would not be up to his, or the audience's, high standards. He suggested to Coppola that they re-edit directly into the original negative. This, of course, would eliminate the need for an inter positive, and allow for beautiful new prints to be struck. On the other hand, the original negative in its ""classic"" incarnation would be gone forever. Storaro asked Coppola, ""Let me know one single thing, in the future, in 10, 20, 50, 100 years from now, which version would you want the audience to see?"" And he said, ""This one.""I remember asking myself why the additional footage couldn't have been relegated to the ""Extras"" section of a DVD. My guess had been that the entire affair was a cynical attempt stir up interest in a theatrical re-release in order to make a few more bucks for the perennially cash- hungry Coppola. Would that he had been so cynical. Now we will never have the chance to see a beautiful new Technicolor dye transfer print of the original Apocalypse, a genuine classic, because Coppola actually thinks that the god-awful Redux, a bloated, ponderous, amateurish mess, is the version for which he should be remembered.I have seen the original Apocalypse dozens of times, and each time it has felt fresh, vital, visionary. I almost walked out of the theater during Redux. Like mold, the new footage had corrupted the old, making the whole film dank and dreary. Most of the new footage was hasty, improvised, and pointless, and integrated badly into the whole. The performances resembled juvenile acting class exercises. The legendary French Plantation scenes were so over the top and silly that I thought an unused sequence from Monty Python's The Meaning of Life had been dropped into the film.As Paulette Goddard once said of Chaplin, ""(Coppola) sometimes thinks he thinks."" Despite his reputation as a rebellious visionary, Coppola has always done his best work for hire. When he has been allowed to go off the rails, he has produced crap fests like One From the Heart (which I actually saw in a theater) and Redux. Looks like it was only the pressure to deliver that prevented box office disaster and bankruptcy in 1979. I, like many others, have spent the last 25 years waiting for another Coppola masterpiece. From the evidence in the Storaro interview, we have all waited in vain. The man's judgment is faulty. Maybe if he can get back together with Bob Evans...",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece,"Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece that explores the dark side of humanity with the Vietnam war as a backdrop. The film is very unique and very well done. While there is much to take in on a visceral level, this is a very psychological film. Apocalypse Now is Hell on Earth that reflects the dark side of American culture and takes the characters from the Heart Of Darkness novel and places them in a Vietnam war setting. The acting, cinematography and score are all top notch. I guess this originally was supposed to be directed by George Lucas, but fell into the hands of Francis Ford Coppola and I would not change a thing. John Milius wrote the screenplay to this and along with Coppola, he is one of the best filmakers in Hollywood.

It will truly immerse the viewer in the horrifying world that was Vietnam.The actors did a superb job of emulating their scripts and Brando truly makes his Godlike character come to life in a down-to-earth manner.My only comment on the film is that it can feel a little to contrived at times and I understand that contrivances have a place in contributing to the greater meaning of the story but it brings me out of the immersion.Otherwise the film is near perfect, and I would suggest it to anyone that is willing to see a heavy and occasionally gory but meaningful take on the Vietnam war.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
could keep watching this,"In making this movie, Coppola must have seen this thing that is not always visible. And if he did not see it in its entirety then in what must surely be a cliché by now, he saw enough of it to allow the heart of its darkness to pulse throughout this film.And just as Coppola was changed by his experience in the jungle, so too his most mysterious character. Something happened to Colonel Kurtz. Something he saw fractured his mind, the diamond bullet shattering his perceptions into a single struggle that he himself, deep within his heart, knew he was unable to comes to terms with. And this is the crux of this movie, that this journey into darkness can promise a truth so clear that it blinds you, a truth so powerful that is keeps a hold of you and does not let you go and traps you into staying exactly, exactly where you are.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Watched the Redux version,"Apocalypse Now is often considered one of the greatest Vietnam War movies of all time. But, funny enough, the film had one of the most troubled productions ever known. Released in 1979, the film was an instant classic and would see a rerelease in 2001 called Apocalypse Now Redux (which I watched) which had an additional 49 minutes of footage. The film is loosely based on the 1899 book Heart of Darkness. The film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather films) and also had a cameo in the film, as well as produced, was a writer along with John Milius (writer of Jerimiah Johnson, writer and director of Red Dawn, and writer of Dirty Harry), and supposedly did the music as well. The film stars Marlon Brando (The Godfather, Superman, and The Island of Dr. Moreau), Martin Sheen (The Dead Zone, Firestarter, and Gettysburg), Robert Duvall (The Godfather, The Godfather II, and Newsies), Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix movies), Dennis Hopper (Speed, Waterworld, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), and Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones movies). People may also recognize an early performance by R. Lee Ermy (Full Metal Jacket, Seven, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre reboot films). The film upon release was a critical and box office success.It is the Vietnam War and Army officer Willard (Martin Sheen) is given a highly dangerous mission. He must go upriver into Cambodia (an off limits area during the Vietnam War) and find a rogue Colonel and assassinate him.Again for the record, I have only seen the 2001 Redux version of this film but for those who do prefer to watch the original, don't worry, I will keep an open mind about the film in general. Now, where do I begin. I have never seen anything quite like this film EVER. To me, this should have been the Stanley Kubrick Vietnam War film. I say that because this film is like 2001: A Space Odyssey in that it can be interpreted in different ways. The story seems simple enough in that it is just about a man going upriver during a war to kill a rogue Colonel. But when watching this film, you can interpret what the true story is about. People are going to have different interpretations of this film. Mine is that this film is truly about a man's journey into madness with each new encounter being apart of the journey. I think it makes sense but then again, I am not no psych major so, what do I
know? I must address some of the common criticisms about this Redux version and determine whether these criticisms are warranted. First off, people say the additional scenes slow down the film. Well, in my opinion, this works for the most part in the film's favor. We, the viewers, are along for the journey that is (again, how I easily interpret it) this man descending into madness due to the ongoing war. Each of the events is apart of the journey. Sure, large parts could and originally were removed but if you came to see a dangerous yet mesmerizing journey, you would want to see everything that occurs. At first, I could see why people would have negative thoughts on this and I was at first on that boat (pun intended), but when you think of the big picture, it will make sense. That is not to say that there are scenes that should not be included. Namely the French Plantation scenes. I could not even begin to tell you why it exists. Thankfully it is not in the theatrical version of the film. Really though, that is my only complaint in regards to the redux version of the film. Now, I will address a more common criticism with the film in general. That being the last half hour of the film. Now, while watching the film, I was not a huge fan because I was not really thinking about the whole ""journey into madness"" deal and was let down. Why? That is when we see Marlon Brando for the first time and even still I did not see what he brought to the film. But that is when I thought over this film and came to the conclusion about the ""journey into madness"" bit. I am not gonna try and go anymore in depth to this film because I am not a psych major and there are plenty of articles and YouTube videos that explain not only my preferred interpretation, but other interpretations as well. Now, my ultimate praise. Never have I ever seen a film quite like this before. It is a film that talks about the horrors of war without having all in your face about it. I should mention that this film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won two for Best Sound and Best Cinematography and holy crap does it deserve it! The cinematography is so beautiful that I could not tell that this film was made in the 70's. The use of color, shadows, and light make it a very beautiful film to watch. The film surprisingly has big and beautiful battle scenes (trying to refrain from using the term action in a war movie) and uses the best of this film's budget. The acting is just fantastic and the characters are fairly memorable with memorable performances from literally everyone in this film. This goes on to show that Francis Ford Coppola is a truly great film director.I suppose the original theatrical version of this film would have been better to watch but when it comes to the big picture, this film is truly a masterpiece. It is truly an experience and possibly one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Shocking Still,"Pictorial literature. Timeless. Forever current. Forever meaningful. Carves deeper the relief of man's depravity.

classic,"This is a classic Viet Nam film with an excellent cast and fantastic story line. I've watched it with Viet Nam vets and not only did they like it, they could actually relate some of their experiences to it. It was one film that got my father in law to open up his own experiences as a U.S. Army chopper pilot in country during 1967-68. I joined the U.S. Navy in 1977 and served with former ""grunts"" and ""brown water"" sailors. Every one of these individuals came back to the world a little messed up. It's one of my all time favorites; right up there with ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""The D.I."" I've lost count of the times I've watched this film and I always seem to find something new or gain more insight into what our men and women experienced in our long and protracted conflict in Southeast Asia.

Kurtz's Final Judgment,"As a huge fan of the novella, and someone who actually understands it, maybe it isn't fair for me to comment on this movie. Even if the movie had been done correctly, and had done justice to the book, I probably wouldn't have been all that happy with it. But even so, I think I have the right to complain when a deep and though provoking story, with a fairly clear message, is drained of all meaning in the movie version.In the novel Kurtz's dying words, ""The Horror, the Horror"" were a summing up of everything the story was saying. That man is basically evil, our hearts are black, all we seek is our own pleasure, and that the only thing keeping us from becoming savages ourselves are the carefully placed guidelines of society.The movie isn't so clear about ""The Horror"" line. As near as I can tell, and from talking to people who haven't had the pleasure of reading the novel, ""the horror"" is referring to war itself. My response to this is ""duhhhhhhhh."" Of course war is horrible. The movie should have ended after it's only brilliant scene that makes this abundantly clear. The scene where the soldiers kill a child after she makes a silly move to save the life of her pet puppy. Now do you really need to be told that war is horrible after this? Is that a conclusion you need some help to reach? If it is then you're a moron!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
War is hard,"Excellent portrayal. Brando was the much better Coppola reunion in this movie and the Golden Globe and BAFTA wins were absolutely deserving. And when there is no visual horror...horror (e.g. A severed head or the death of the character played by the very young Laurence Fishburne), we hear people talking about it, for example Kurtz' story on severed children's arms.The redux version of the movie runs for considerably over 3 hours, about 200 minutes, and I would lie if I said there was not a single moment when it dragged. It did, occasionally, for example when they meet the French guys. I could have done without that part. The cast is pretty spectacular. Apart from everybody I already mentioned, there's also Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Frederic Forrest in this movie, all 3 Academy Award nominees themselves. It's an interesting take on soldiers' lives during this difficult time. But apart from all the brutal battle scenes and (during one scene) the unsuccessful longing for leadership, we also see a bunch of playboy bunnies giving the troops some pleasure with their mere presence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Visual Masterpiece,"Apocalypse Now is not just a film-it is, in every sense, a work of art. The intensely powerful visuals alone elevate it to the level of a masterpiece. But what makes it truly exceptional is that this stunning imagery isn't just there for the sake of style; it is cohesive and deeply intentional, always in service of the story.Every frame of this film is so meticulously crafted, so rich with symbolism and beauty, that it leaves an indelible imprint on the viewer's mind. The lighting is a particular triumph-its contrasts are not just striking but meaningful, always reinforcing the themes of the story. Shadows and light interplay to mirror the moral ambiguity of war, with scenes like Kurtz's lair bathed in darkness, emphasizing his enigmatic and haunting presence.The transitions are another highlight, seamlessly blending one moment into the next with an artistry that feels almost poetic. From the iconic dissolve of a fan into helicopter blades to the surreal montages, every cut serves a purpose, immersing the viewer deeper into the chaotic and dreamlike world of the Vietnam War.Nothing in Apocalypse Now is accidental. Unlike some films that feel like exercises in style (comme certains films récents, style pour le style), every choice here-lighting, camera angles, sound, and pacing-works together to create a coherent whole. It is cinema at its purest, where form and content are inseparable, each strengthening the other.Beyond its technical brilliance, the film delves into complex and thought-provoking themes. Captain Willard's journey is as much about confronting his own darkness as it is about completing his mission. His reflections on violence and war give the audience a window into the psychological toll of conflict. Opposing him, Colonel Kurtz embodies the madness and moral decay that arise in war's chaos. Their interactions form a gripping exploration of humanity's capacity for both destruction and self-destruction.In the end, Apocalypse Now is more than a film-it's a masterpiece. Its visuals are breathtaking, its storytelling profound, and its impact eternal. A true work of art that sets the gold standard for cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Garbage in garbage out,"The biggest problem watching this film is that I am a Vietnam Veteran and I am aware of the movie's outlandish plot.

Coppola's Curse,"Apocalypse Now certainly maintains a high level of production quality.  Few other films are as deserving of their Oscars for Best Sound and Cinematography.  Actually, it deserved more than that.  The entire movie is one visual trip after another and director Francis Ford Coppola finally understands the value of visual artistry that he avoided in his previous work.As it is well known, the movie took forever to create and everyone suffered in the production.  Coppola, totally obsessed as he was with telling this story, almost went mad and wound up remaking Bram Stoker's Dracula.  In the end, no one came out the wiser as many of the cast and crew failed to learn any lessons from this.The movie is an interesting Vietnam-period parallel to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.  However, the moods in the two respective stories are very far apart and nowhere near as similar as one would have you believe.  I am certain that the script for Apocalypse Now was written by Milius up until the eventual encounter with Brando, then Coppola took over.  You can tell by examining the differing level of detail and interaction.The story up to that point is so brilliant in its not-so-subtle fashion of hiding the message from us that the audience feels more than a little cheated when the go ahead and hammer it at us for the last half-hour.  ""The horror.  The horror.""As said, the sound creation and editing for this movie is phenomenal.  The transport us to a drugged-out, psychedelic battlefield.  Coppola's juiced-up camera work enhances the senses and tells the story gloriously with Martin Sheen's edgy narration.  The man may not be a splendid actor, but he presents a compelling case.Even more insightful (or is it insane?) is Robert Duvall.  The scene of his introduction plays out more like a carnival than a war zone with different attractions that the camera passes by, none of them holding our attention for long.  Perhaps they were trying to create some kind of symbolism with Duvall's character in all this, but he is merely a nuisance and can't supersede ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning.""Brando is the most controversial element of the story, of this I am certain. He is underplayed, too somber, and half-interested in his work.  If Duvall was a nuisance, Brando is a disappointment, not helped by Dennis Hopper's crazy photographer character spouting a load of rubbish everywhere.  Perhaps by that stage in the movie, everything was meant for explanation as the preceding 150 minutes hadn't done any of that.  I don't know...Overall, a movie I have mixed feelings about.  I recommend one viewing of it (either the original or the mammoth Redux version) to anyone who considers themselves movie lovers, film experts, or wannabe filmmakers.  4 out of 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Indeed a work of art,"Apocalypse Now is Coppola's most artistic work. A film fundamentally about one thing: War is Hell. To send this message this film fully utilizes all the possibilities of cinema: fully exploiting images and sounds in their capacity for generating brain stimuli. This is Coppola's most ""artistic"" film and it is a very, very different film from the Godfathers, which are much more traditional drama films. This is not a drama, nor action, nor thriller, nor any genre, though one could call it a War Epic, it is more of an art-house film made with a blockbuster budget, like the German classic, Aguirre, made with a budget 40 times larger.I would place this film as the second greatest war film ever made (after the Japanese masterpiece, Grave of the Fireflies). Though these two are very different films (the second, however, generated a greater emotional response from me, that's why I put it first)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"The smell of napalm, ""Flight of the Valkyries"" and the sinister Colonel Kurtz. One of the most important films in history.","The films of Francis Ford Coppola have always been distinguished by a closed and meaningful plot.Coppola broke three world records: ""The Godfather"" - best gangster film, as well as best film in general; and ""Apocalypse Now"" - best war film worldwide. In this review, I will explain in detail the hidden meaning in the movie ""Apocalypse Now"". I'll also tell you why the movie is called that.The point is that fighting is shown as an absolutely irrational activity that has a detrimental effect on its participants.The main storyline is about a special forces captain, Willard, who is sent into the jungles of Cambodia to eliminate a mad Colonel Kurtz, who commands a squad of local residents and is accused of killing several Vietnamese.During the journey with Willard, many strange events occur, and under the influence of the environment, as he approaches the goal, he gradually loses his sense of reality and ceases to understand what to do next.One of the main thoughts of the picture is that a person cannot consider himself a truly supreme being of nature, as long as he allows madness like wars to happen. Only the person himself determines for himself which path to choose and which way to go.The film got its name from a badge that co-writer John Milius saw on one of the hippies. It had ""Nirvana Now"" written on it and a peace symbol. Milius bought the same badge, turned the peace symbol into a B-52 plane, added a tail and wings to it, and the inscription changed its meaning from ""Nirvana Now"" to ""Apocalypse Now"". So the name of the film appeared, and Milius placed the drawing in one of the storyboards.Milius also felt that the name ""Apocalypse Now"" makes fun of pacifist hippies who were both opposed to the war and for the legalization of drugs with the slogan ""Nirvana today"".Category: Did you know that...The film is based on the novel ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad (1902).In scenes with Dennis Hopper, you can see the inscription Apocalypse Now on stone structures.Francis Ford Coppola played a small role as a journalist who reports during the fight. His words: ""Don't look at the camera, pretend to fight!"".According to the British Film4 channel, the film was ranked # 1 in the list of ""50 must-see movies before you die"".""When Francis Ford Coppola asked Al Pacino to play Willard, he declined, saying,' I know what it's going to be like. You're going to sit there in a helicopter and tell me what to do, and I'm going to be stuck in this swamp for five months."" In fact, the shooting lasted 1 year and 4 months.John Milius wrote his script in 1969. The script was called ""Psychedelic Soldier"". According to his own version, the rebel colonel not only declared himself a god, but also entered into a direct war with the American army.During filming, Coppola lost 100 pounds of weight.Marlon Brando was the worst actor on the set. He was paid a million dollars in advance, but each time he threatened to leave the film. Then Coppola told his agent that he didn't care, and instead of Brando, he wanted Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford or Al Pacino. In the end, Brando stayed, gained 40 kilograms of weight during filming, refused to read the original script and even Conrad's novel, rejected Coppola's director's script, agreed only to improvise his role and forbade filming himself in the light-only in the dark.Coppola joked that if Al Pacino had accepted the role of Kurtz, he would have had to shoot his film in Pacino's New York apartment.To get into the film, Laurence Fishburne lied about his age (filming began in ' 76, he was 14 years old at the time).""I'm sure I created a piece of art, and I couldn't have done better, ""Francis Ford Coppola said of Apocalypse Now.Coppola explained why the film does not and should not have credits: each viewer who came to view it anywhere in the world, along with the ticket, should be given a special booklet with a detailed story about the shooting of the film and with detailed information about its creators with a list of all members of the film crew.Some participants in the Vietnam War consider the film ""Apocalypse Now"" to be the most plausible film about this war.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Apocalypse Now released in 1979 and directed by Francis Coppola is more than just a war film,"On the surface of the film, it is directly about a crew of American soldiers who are travelling during the Vietnam War down a dangerous river leading to Cambodia, in order to escort the commanding officer, Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), on a classified mission. He must find a man who was once a great American fighter who was in the Special Forces, but unfortunately began to lose his mind and became the leader of a murderous colony. The commanding officer is clearly distraught by the fact that he must slaughter one of his own people, and not just an American, but a former soldier. Benjamin Willard and his group of men are forced to deal with many situations as they arise and not everyone makes it out alive. Many scenes show the disturbing factors of the war and utter insanity. Underneath the general story line is an intense transformation of the men over the duration of the film. It provides an inside look at the journey into darkness the men must face. It has a contrast in moods through the movie because at some points it shows the chaos and the torment caused by the war, and other times the setting is bright and everyone is smiling and joking. The film establishes many moods and settings through montages and long shot pictures. The film can be extremely difficult to follow however because scenes jump around often and there are tons of characters, some of which are only around for a scene or two and then never reappear. It is the sort of movie you need to focus on and pay attention to or else following the plot may be impossible.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I haven't tried reviewing this film before. Guess I'll try now.,"Apocalypse Now was a movie born from troubled beginnings, changed hands throughout the early days of development (Star Wars' George Lucas revised the Heart of Darkness premise into the Vietnam War setting, who was a longtime friend of Francis Ford Coppola), and in spite of one of Cinema's most chaotic productions in history, Apocalypse Now went above and beyond its behind-the-scenes troubles and became one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a war movie; it's a study in wartime psychology; it's a journey into one of America's darkest moments in history; and it's a relentlessly bleak look at warfare itself.Apocalypse Now has proven itself time and time again in Cinema history: it's been reimagined over the years as the 'Redux' and the 'Final Cut' even though the baseline film itself was already perfect; heck, there's even a four-hour+ bootleg cut that's never been officially released. It's amazing a film that's almost a half-century old has been revisited and consistently revered as a filmmaking landmark STILL attracts newcomers today; and boy are they in for an experience. French plantation subplot or no, Apocalypse Now is Platinum Cinema easily.I'm hoping this review wasn't redundant or anything; I was just trying to give an honest if not entirely unique critique on a film so many have already spoken about so warmly.

A bit like Jack Nicholson in THE SHINING, we see from the start that Willard is a man already damaged, probably a sociopath, but the perilous trip up the river and the confrontation with Kurtz turn him into a psychopath, as deluded and dangerous as the renegade he has been tasked with eliminating.The Radio Times film critic named this as his favorite picture. Brilliant as it clearly is, it's not mine (If it's possible to have a ""favorite"" Vietnam movie, THE DEER HUNTER is mine, as much thanks to its beguiling theme music as to its disturbing central storyline).

Coppola's apocaliptic vision about war,"After Coppola and Brando wowed the big screen with The Godfather, they both took the next step with this war film about the hellish Vietnam War. Although it is a film with a very dense script and atmosphere, it cannot be denied that it is a film that meets a valuable requirement that makes it worthy of being part of war cinema. There are good action sequences that include the memorable moment when Richard Wagner's classic piece Rise Of The Valkyries is heard and which becomes a battle hymn. The title really does a lot of honor to the film because the Vietnam War is represented as an apocalyptic event. That is a good success because wars of these magnitudes tend to be experienced as a real hell. The film manages to reflect the vision of horror that the Vietnam War has as if it were an indescribable nightmare. What differentiates this film from others that are also focused on the Vietnam War is that the combat scenes do not have as much relevance as other films. Here it was decided to give more importance to the psychological factor. Willard is a soldier who already knows from the start that he is someone psychologically damaged by the war and who must deal with that once again when he is sent to assassinate Colonel Kurtz. The two soldiers are not that different, as they are both mentally damaged by the war, and the more Willard finds out about Kurtz along the way, the more he realizes that they both have something in common. Willard even begins to have doubts about having to kill a soldier of the same elite and the film ends up playing with the hypothesis that soldiers are just pawns that can be eliminated when they are no longer needed. This and other reflections the film raises about the horrors of war make Apocalypse Now a film worthy of some recognition for its apocalyptic vision of war. My final rating for this movie is an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"""The horror... the horror...""","Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", a loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", is generally considered one of the greatest war films of all time. The movie is based around a mission to track down a renegade officer and terminate his command 'with extreme prejudice'.The cast is enviable, with Marlon Brando portraying the 'unsound' Colonel Kurtz and Martin Sheen playing the man tasked with bringing him down. Robert Duvall received an Oscar nomination for his spirited portrayal of the eccentric Lieutenant Kilgore. Dennis Hopper also delivered a memorably unhinged performance as a photojournalist who's become a devotee of Kurtz. The rest of the cast is solid but not particularly distinguished.The story is compelling but those expecting a typical war film may be disappointed. The story has none of the usual 'good guys versus bad guys' Hollywood approach and instead revels in darkness and surrealism. The film is, first and foremost, a journey. I'm not totally satisfied with the ending but I respect that the film makes its points with subtlety and verve.Coppola's direction is flawless and the Academy Award-winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is breathtaking. The film also won an Oscar for its sound, which is excellent. The soundtrack is also notable due to the deft use of the Doors' song ""The End"". The synthesizer score doesn't really suit my tastes but, even so, I can't deny that parts of it are highly atmospheric.In the end, this is a unquestionably a must-see film.

"Commenting on Apocalypse Now Redux, Not the Original","I'm sure a couple of people would probably shoot me for this, but after seeing the 'new' version of Apocalypse Now that screened at Cannes last year, I was really disappointed that Francis Ford Coppola took what was, in my opinion, a perfect masterpiece and added so much more footage to the movie.  The thing that was so absolutely chilling and chaotic about the original was all the little spaces left where one understood the insanity and chaos of the war but did not get straight linear explanations for each step of it.  To me, not having been around for the war, it gave me (what I felt like to be) a really guttural feeling for just how confusing, violent and generally f*cked up the whole Vietnam experience was.  How difficult it was to figure who the bad guys were and who were innocent.  It brought up the pivotal question ""What is this war really about?""  I was truly mesmerized by the film and walked away with alot of compassion for both the men that fought in Vietnam and the innocent locals that got caught in the middle.  I also walked away with so many moral, ethical and psychological conflicts as to everything that went down there and found myself wondering how anyone who was involved with this war on either side could possibly come out any other way but scarred.For me, Coppola diluted his film by redoing it and adding the extra footage. It took away it's strongest point - that of being a film that put you in the experience but made no overt statements about it - thus making the strongest statement possible.  What I walked away with after watching the recut is a little too much indicating and less of the chaos that made this film the classic that it is.  My advice to Coppola?  Don't mess with a good thing.  Sometimes things should be left well enough alone.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I love the smell of napalm in the morning,"A good war-film should do two things. Firstly, unflinchingly portray the brutalities of war and secondly demonstrate the unshakeable bond that soldiers share with each other. Apocalypse Now ticks both of these boxes. Despite how Robert Duvall has only fifteen minutes of screen time, he is brilliant as a psychotic American colonel. He is by far one of the best parts of the film. Perhaps even better than Marlon Brando. I was very disappointed with Brando's contribution. He had little to no presence and was largely forgettable in his role as the film's antagonist. Also at two and a half hours, the film's pace does drag a little and it gets boring at times.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/pw044Z",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
What a great shoot-em-up movie!,"Apocalypse Now is another of those films that is about half dream sequence. First of all it is a great movie.  It has great characters: Sheen defines the height of his character actor career.  Hopper plays his Easy Rider character o a T,  but this time with a job and a camera. Duval, utters those immortal words ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" and ""Charlie don't surf!"", and Brando is at his best. It has plenty of Vietnam War action for you, whether you liked the war, hated the war or fought the war, and is a slam-bang shoot-em-up of the kind that has been replaced by the computerized action films of the 21st century.  Realism or the lack of it aside (your opinion, your call) one can't help caught up in Sheen's Willard and his mission to terminate the command of Brando's Kurtz ""with extreme prejudice"" and all the entertaining and exciting stuff involved in this purposeful character's quest.  Never does Sheen's character waiver from this purpose and seldom does the story of the film wander from this path. (when it does wander, you love it.) With ""Redux"", through the wonder of the DVD format (ever heard of too much of a good thing?) New scenes are added (swept up from the cutting room floor) and pasted in here and there.  A new viewer of Apocalypse Now Redux might not notice that the bits are added, even though the movie has gone on past his bed time, but a veteran watcher of it might find them annoying, irrelevant, and easily skipable.  To me the ""Redux"" version came down to this question:  ""OK, so they didn't change the ending, why did they change the end"".  In ""Redux"" I seriously miss the dreamy end with its combination of napalm, burning trees, The Doors and the final credits.  I'd give up all the cutting room floor stuff for the original finale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Madness In The Midst of a War,"Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now is a war epic that delves deep into the psychological toll of war. Written by Coppola, John Milius, and initially worked on by George Lucas, the film stars Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, and Dennis Hopper. Produced by Coppola himself, the movie is often hailed as one of the greatest war films of all time.The story follows Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), who is sent on a mission during the Vietnam War to assassinate the rogue Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz has gone mad, creating a cult-like following deep in the jungle, and Willard's journey to find him becomes a harrowing descent into the horrors of war and madness. Along the way, Willard encounters various military figures, including the iconic Lieutenant Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who famously declares, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning.""Apocalypse Now is a visually striking film, filled with surreal imagery that blurs the lines between reality and the psychological unraveling of its characters. Coppola's direction is bold, and his vision is fully realized through the film's rich cinematography and innovative use of sound. One of the production highlights is the atmosphere Coppola creates, especially with the hallucinatory sequences that convey the madness of war. The soundtrack, which includes ""The End"" by The Doors, perfectly complements the eerie tone of the film.However, the film's length and pacing are significant drawbacks. At times, it feels overly drawn out, which detracts from its overall impact. While the psychological journey is captivating, the film tends to meander, which can leave the viewer feeling disconnected from its core message. The performances, particularly by Brando and Duvall, are undeniably powerful, but the film would have benefited from tighter editing to maintain its intensity.Overall, Apocalypse Now is a film that every person should experience, particularly for its innovative approach to storytelling and its exploration of the human psyche under extreme conditions. While I don't believe it holds up as a masterpiece in today's cinematic landscape, it remains a valuable piece of film history. The psychological aspects resonate, even if the war elements and pacing feel excessive by modern standards.In conclusion, Apocalypse Now is a visually compelling and thematically rich film that is at its best when focused on the psychological toll of war. While it may not fully retain its ""masterpiece"" status for me today, it's still a film worth watching for its ambitious scope and incredible performances.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A must see,"Francis Ford Coppola's controversial take on the Vietnam war still stands strong today as one of the best war movies ever made. It is a timeless classic, as well as a perfect example of the modern day epic. It's the story of Captain Benjamin Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who travels to Cambodia for an extremely confidential mission. That mission is to kill a renegade Colonel Kurtz, played by legendary Marlon Brando. It might seem like a simple synopsis, but as the film progresses it twists into a complex psychological journey, focusing on the absurdity and horror of war. The whole film encompasses a raw and visceral intensity that is beautifully constructed and perfectly paced. Its a fantastic focus on the disastrous effects of war on the human mind and it beautifully illustrates this throughout the films stunning visuals. Apocalypse Now is an incredible experience that is not for the weak of heart.One of the greatest aspects of this film is definitely its visuals. They are beautifully, as well as very emotionally stirring in the context of the films events and subject matter. Coppola brilliantly utilizes light and smoke to create numerous dark and riveting effects in the film. Every moment is so carefully put together. Nothing about this film feels rushed or poorly paced in any way. And it shouldn't considering filming alone took 16 months, and the movie took three years to finally complete. Apocalypse Now is certainly extravagant, but not overdone. It never goes over the top and never feels flashy or boastful. The harrowing beauty comes in just the right amounts. It's not too much, and it's not too little. It will leave you with disturbing and also breathtaking images that are hard to forget. The film possesses the kind of indescribable passion and fervor behind its visuals that has such an intense effect on your mind when you lose yourself in this incredible experience.Some of the best films ever made are war movies because of the deep and controversial subject matter they deal with. Yet with Apocalypse Now we experience something much deeper. War is but a backdrop for this film that is mostly a psychological thriller. War plays the role of ""the horror"" and its effects on the human psyche. The story and subtext of Apocalypse Now give it the dark and visceral edge that is exemplified by its visuals. The story has its strong points that drive home the purpose of this film but the characters are what fuel the psychological study of the film. Each character represents some branch of the effects of war. Martin Sheen's character the one who moves past it all and can most successfully wear a facade that suggests he can cope with the horrors he experiences. Colonel Kurtz, Brando's character, is the account of the man who has fallen off the deep end and into pure insanity. But he deals with his own insanity in his own highly unconventional way. Then of course there is Lieutenant Colonol Kilgore, played by Robert Duvall, who is the personification of the absurdity of war. He's the man who, in spite of the horrific and traumatizing events happening around him, figures it will be a good idea to surf on the beaches of your newly won encampment. He's also the speaker of the infamous line, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning."" This just about sums up what he's all about, and what he represents to the human psyche and its response to horrific events such as these.I usually try not to base my opinion of a movie around what happens behind the scenes, and really try to focus on what the final product encompasses, but the cursed and horribly laborious work this film took to finish is not something that can go unmentioned. Francis Ford Coppola and his film crew flew out to the Phillipines for a scheduled six week shoot. But due to casting issues, money issues, and a typhoon that destroyed the set, those six weeks turned into sixteen months. It was one of the most stressful and exhausting shoots ever, and Coppola reportedly threatened suicide multiple times while filming. Just reading the trivia section on the movies IMDb page makes it apparent that this is the film that should have never been made. With all the unforeseen issues, it is absolutely incredible that the film was ever finished. But through Coppola's perseverance he was able to finish shooting with over 200 hours of footage, and then spend another difficult couple of years editing the film together for not just a great film, but a groundbreaking and absolutely revolutionary film experience. I can't say that there are many directors today who would stick a production like this out till the very end, and even if they did I don't know how they could manage to construct something half as good as Apocalypse Now.This film is a perfect look into the psychology of war, and it covers so much existential ground. It is one of the most intense and stunning cinematic experiences ever, without a single imperfection to legitimately criticize it on. It elicits emotions that are hardly describable with words, and it is something you have to experience for yourself. Apocalypse Now is one of the few films that I believe every person must see before they die. It's a massive scale epic that will withstand time, and never lose its relevance, as long as horror still exists in this world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Confronting your morality,"Is there such a thing as a moral human being? Who defines what is moral, and what is right? These questions among others are questions I sit and reflect upon after watching Apocalypse Now.Apocalypse Now both promotes and denigrates war by showing us that there is no winners and losers in a war. There are only losers. We all lose in one way or another, and perceived victories cannot be claimed without acknowledging loss along the way. This is truly the case in this movie as we the viewers witness horror and tragic moments alongside glory and greatness portrayed by magnificent cinematography alongside a small army of helicopters, tanks weapons and extras.There really isn't another movie like Apocalypse Now. With a memorable villain played by the great Marlon Brando and stellar performances by other actors such as Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall this movie shows us in a unique way how soldiers can become corrupted by their surroundings and learn traits by their enemies to commit even worse acts of horrors than their enemies committed against themselves. Crazy is a matter of perspective and moral has different meaning according to who you ask.There are simply to many great scenes in this movie to be able to summarize them into a short review. To be able to truly appreciate how great of a movie this is, you truly need to watch it multiple times to notice all the reflections, practical effects, camera angles, music, locations, dialog, character arcs and so and so on.This is as good as it can get, and there isn't a better, more complex war movie than this.My rating: 94/100.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The true war is within a man's soul.,"Apocalypse Now is a movie of complexity that is rarely seen in modern cinema. What I like about this movie is that it is not a Saving Private Ryan sort of war movie. This movie is narrative driven, not action driven. While SPR was a good movie in it's own right, there are no forty-five minute fight scenes to overshadow the fact that there is little to no character development in this movie. This movie examines the effects of war on man, which in the most extreme case (Kurtz) leads to the darkest depths of a man's soul. Captain Willard (Sheen) must also examine his own beliefs and inner being as he ventures further from all that keeps civilization is check and closer to true insanity in his pursuit of Kurtz. This is NOT a movie that is made to entertain, so if you want something like that, watch We Were Soldiers.

Hopper seems to go a little over the top but it makes us smile. Because we are wondering all the time that we are, of course, anticipating Marlon Brando but he does it so well finally.

Damn Near Perfect,"Apocalypse Now is potentially one of the best films of all time. I really could not find one flaw in the film now that I think back to it. It really brought war to a level where all people would want to watch. But the real magic to the movie is the eerie feeling and the psychological impact it has on the viewers observing war at it's deadliest.The movie is about a man sent on a mission in Vietnam to find and eliminate a general who went a bit AWOL. The man encounters the trials and tribulations of war as he makes his way to his destination. When he ultimately finds the general, he learns that he's created a civilization that bows and worships him. And may use sadistic means to keep their leader happy.Martin Sheen does excellent as the main character. Marlon Brando basically takes the cake in terms of acting here, as the leader and the awol general. He's so creepy in this movie, and philosophical that it's scary.

One of the Greats,"Which is better? The original cut, or ""Redux""? My theatrical/literary timeline for this saga is as follows. I saw ""Apocalypse Now"" when it was released theatrically in 1979, and I thought it was one of the best movies I had ever seen. Then some years later I read ""Heart of Darkness"" on which ""Apocalypse Now"" is based. It's not an easy book; short, but a tough pull. After reading the novel, I disagreed about the movie's supposed close relationship to the novel and felt the two had less in common than many reviewers claimed. I had the distinct feeling that the closest some of these columnists had come to the ""Heart of Darkness"" was the Classic Comic. Then, many years later, I watched ""Redux"".The editing and additional scenes make ""Redux"" less a war movie than the original, and textually closer to the ""Heart of Darkness"" with its slow trip up the dark, tropical river. The better film? The original is tighter and tells a better story. If you've seen neither, this is the one. But if you've seen the original and loved it, rent ""Redux"". You'll be pleased.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
All the Children Are Insane,"The most startling thing about Apocalypse Now Redux may not be the reinstated footage, but the new Technicolor dye-transfer prints. Rather than chemical color development, dyes are transferred to the film directly, bringing about the genuinely astonishing '40s, '50s Technicolor look: Sumptuous, striking, razor-sharp, glowing, with deep, authentic blacks. The consequently voluptuous and wringing wet material look of a film like this is what's threatened by digital projection. Coppola also thrusts the blanket off with the re-mastered soundtrack, which envelops us. To return home from the hell-on-earth production situation on the Philippines with a film of such specialized mastery is mind-blowing. It discredits modern apprehension. To watch it is to be elevated to the pinnacle where movies truly can actually take you, but just so seldom do. The film is a timeless cathedral hall echoing with the genuine reverberations of the war in Vietnam, in all their convolution and grief.The story involves a voyage upriver by Capt. Willard, who orders a patrol boat to infiltrate enemy lines and determine the mysterious fortification of the virtually legendary Col. Kurtz, one of the Army's most decorated combatants, now commanding his own group of tribesmen. When you unearth who Kurtz has become and what he is thinking, you can see how the war took such a large role in malforming the elemental American idealism. The movie is a succession of set pieces. The most famed is the attack on a village, announcing itself with the helicopter loudspeakers blaring Wagner at the petrified students and teachers, enduring with Lt. Kilgore, hard-wired to disregard the value of Vietnamese life, and his blustering audacity on the beach, multiple times distracted completely from brutally killed or suffering Vietnamese villagers by the subject of surfing. Other sequences are also in the everlasting remembrance of moviegoers: The drugged tedium of the river expedition, the unexpected barrage of bullets that massacres a boat, the Playboy Playmates entertaining the much too frustratedly eager troops, the trancelike ultimate advance toward Kurtz's compound, the shadowed Kurtz and his grim maxims, the sniggering acquiescence of the stoned photographer, the Citizen to his Caesar.To the magnificence of these scenes in their movement to Kurtz's famous last words, Coppola supplements 49 minutes, most of them invested in a stopover by the platoon to a French cultivated area, a colonial leftover that somehow endures. At dinner the Americans and French argue the colonial saga of Vietnam, and Willard's eyes encounter those of a widow who'll finish the night in his embrace. Other restored footage comprises dialogue and exploits on the boat, later comic relief with the Playmates, and added Kurtz interchange. Most importantly, this Redux is not merely a Lucas- or Spielberg-style ""special edition,"" a slight variation on the same song, but an original version of the movie, from scratch. Coppola and his longtime editor Walter Murch, one of the very best at his trade, re-edited the film from the initial uncut raw footage, and so probably even some of the shots that seem the same to us are different takes than those we experienced before.The 1979 version frightened Coppola, he says, feeling it was too long, too bizarre and didn't answer itself in a sort of typical climactic battle. Confronting financial ruin, he fashioned it for the conventional audience of its era, and 20 years later, seeing it again, he found it comparatively meek. To deem this ordeal middle-of-the-road or tame in either form is a peculiar ruling for Coppola to decide on his film, but then he has a record of being rash and perplexing. My own sentiment is that the 1979 version was neither conventional nor tame, but grand, ambitious filmmaking on a magnitude within the spread of but a handful of directors, Tarkovsky, Lean, Eisenstein, Kurosawa. Right down to expressive decapitated heads and the shadow of arrows accosting a boat populated by lost, disoriented men, Apocalypse Now is the modern Aguirre in cinema terms, as well as modern Conrad in literary ones. The Redux consequently prompted my doubts. I was ecstatic to see the supplementary footage. But did the movie require it? No.Regardless, some of the newly seen footage seamlessly crosses the work's threshold and evaporates, deepening it. That would take account of the river footage and some instants with Hopper's photographer. The new Brando footage, including some more barbed examination of the war, is an important adjunct. What gives me the most discomfort is the French plantation sequence. It's protracted enough that it sidetracks from the movie's complete sweep. The river passage sets the film's pulse, and too much time on the banks arrests it. But the sequence is cogent and even abrasive, despite the glaringly cringe-worthy music during the love scene. Carmine's inexplicable use of educational video-level synthesizer music, which is inspired when it's low-key, but is otherwise unforgivable and agonizing. Again, Coppola being completely baffling.Longer or shorter, redux or not, and whether or not one morally agrees with using the actual ritualistic slaughtering of an actual animal as a dramatic tool in a fictitious story, and whatever other issue one may have with a unique cinematic affair of such runaway, limitless passion to an almost transgressive degree, Coppola's overpowering head trip is, regardless, one of the crucial dealings of a film-goer's life, a threshold test, a virtual reality even. To have it in this stunning print is a treat, your eyes and ears awash with its lingering vision and the reverberation from the continuous rotor blades of helicopters and from distant blasts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A true masterpiece,"When Francis Ford Coppola said 'Apocalypse Now isn't about Vietnam, it IS Vietnam' little did many realize how right he was. This isn't a war movie, it's a movie about madness, about insanity. The insanity of Col. Kurtz, the insanity of the war itself, and finally, and most revealing, is the real life insanity this movie caused the filmmakers and several of the actors in it. Beset by disasters, natural and otherwise, the production was over stretched, and way over budget, nearly killing it's leading man, and sending it's director to the poor house.What remains is one of my favorite movies of all time.

Based on Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', we see Willard go deep into his own dark heart, as he ascends up the river to the final showdown with Kurtz. A confrontation that is memorable to say the least. Morality, philosophy, terror, and madness are all at the heart of Apocalypse Now...",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Terrifying. Tormenting. Beautiful. Truly magnificent.,"I was born in the XXI century and do, naturally, have a clip thinking that does not welcome long preludes for something.That's why I started my exploration of Francis Ford Coppola's art works by this very film, considered by many to be the highest peak of his mastery, moreover, I managed to watch its extended version because of the 40-year jubilee. Well, as I was looking at the final titles, I could not more see the life the way I used to. I felt as if my head had been hit with something massive. Genuinely did I have some kind of a hangover: a terrible headache, a slight feeling of being sick and - the pain whenever I tried to think about the film, it's meaning and message.However, the pain leaves, but your thoughts stay. What was the film about? The essence of war? The new perception of the one that was in Vietnam? Maybe about the concept of the Übermensch in the named realities? I can not know. All I know is that it scared me to death and made me wonder, reflect and sink in questions.I will not speak of the excellent acting or soundtrack, which are nevertheless notable. Without any doubt, there were enough people to talk about this. But I can't not point out the operator work. I dare to suppose that it is these long scenes, that some of the reviewers called unnecessary, that actually make the film so utterly beautiful as long as cruel and horrifying. The film has its own poetry. Combined with a controversial topic and a meaningful storyline, you get a masterpiece. In my opinion, watching ""Apocalypse Now"" is like a marathon: after you have just finished it you can't believe you've done that, you think you are going to die and will not ever be able to do that again. But as the time goes by, you're starting to see the charm and the hidden depths. And you do.I strongly advise you not to watch the movie alone and at home, with children or family. It will not reward you if you're looking for something light and fun. It will not give you a clue to itself. But as long as you are ready to strain your thoughts and feelings and get lost - you are welcome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Redux equal to its original,"Apocalypse Now is perhaps, or in my opinion even probably, the best piece of film recorded thus far in cinematic history. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to see it in the cinemas, so when Redux opened in 2001 my expectations were, to say the least, huge, and the 21st century update of the movie didn't let me down. Nor was it better than the original, and I mean, how could it be? It was simply different.The new scenes, which I believe add up to almost a whole extra hour in the Redux version, adds new depth and detail to the movie at first, but in the second half of the movie they are just as guilty of destroying some of the pace of the film, which in the original was so perfectly calculated. Willard's stop at a French plantation for example is, in a sense, almost a step back on his journey to ""hell"". These new scenes are however beautifully incorporated with the old ones and Coppola has done a wonderful job using his father's classical music compositions to create new music for the additions.To sum things up, Apocalypse Now Redux remains as great a movie as the original with its superb score and scenes like the one where Col. Kilgore goes surfing, the crossing of the Do Lung Bridge and of course the big finale engraved in movie history forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The River Turns, it Bends, it Twists in the Wind.",A true masterpiece.  The brains behind this work can only be described as genius.  It contemplates the true hopeless and bizarre nature of war.

The journey through the jungles along the river this special agent takes involves many aspects of warfare where lines become hazy.  Who is in charge?  Where is the enemy?  Who is the enemy?

This movie is art,"Apocalypse Now is one of those movies that you can't take in all at once. It takes repeated viewings to appreciate the full spectrum and breadth of the film. Rarely has a film so spectacular and awe-inspiring been made, especially in regards to a war film. This movie boasts a stellar cast, intricate yet simple plot, emotional soundtrack, beautiful locations and cinematography, and a firm grasp of the horrors, weirdness, and confusion of war. Martin Sheen gives what is perhaps the best performance of his career. Marlon Brando provides a suitably eerie and mysterious air. Robert Duvall deserves special praise for his over the top portrayal of Col. Kilgore. The entire cast is wonderful but these three characters stand out. The journey up the Mekong river by the four man crew of the PBR and Sheen is at times funny, exciting, sad and soul-searching. The end of this film is one of the most atmospheric that I have ever seen, and borders on art. The 45 minutes of footage that has been restored to the film are for the most part,worthwhile additions. The French dinner scene however, slows the pacing of the movie and drags on pointlessly. It is the only complaint I have about this masterpiece. Bottom Line: Apocalypse Now might just be one of the best movies ever. If you haven't seen it yet you owe it to yourself to experience this one of a kind film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
great movie,"If there are war/drama movie fans out there this movie is a great one to see, it has all the elements that I personally look for in war/drama film; someone freaking out because they can't cope with the world they come back to after war, people getting ordered to do things that are wrong but the soldier has to follow the orders, large amounts of violence,and of course the mission being completed at a cost. The acting is great, the story line is also great.

"For the most part, a great war movie","The first three quarters of 'Apocalypse Now' is excellent, a near flawless portrayal of the Vietnam War. The last quarter didn't do much for me at all, especially the butchering of the ox and the long, drawn out final scenes. I don't think either added much to the film overall.The film is brilliantly acted and directed with stunning visuals and cinematography, one of the most realistic and compelling portrayals of war I've seen. Martin Sheen delivers a memorable performance as Captain Willard. All in all, despite a final quarter that wasn't what I had hoped for, 'Apocalypse Now' is a technically great war film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""He has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible which is also detestable.""","Apocalypse Now is not a conventional film and it makes no attempts to be one. Do not sit down and expect to see a 2 hour film with a structure to it because you'll be disappointed. The movie lurches along with action scenes interspersed into moments of psycological reflection. And then some simply inexplicable scenes.Overall, the pace of the movie is fairly slow. Coppola breaks all the rules of conventional film making with the movie opening with no titles and shots throughout the movie of up to 2 minutes. However, in the context of the film it works well. These men aren't normal people and Vietnam isn't a normal place and the film reflects this. Through the narration of Sheen's character, Captain Willard, we get an insight into the human mind and how it reacts to such adverse conditions. Like Marlow in Conrad's novella, we follow the psycological change of the protagonist as though it is our own.The disappointment of the film is Brando's character, Colonel Kurtz. Although a lunatic he is obviously a man of surreal intellect yet on screen little of this is developed. An attempt is made, through Kurtz's discourses to analyse his mind but it isn't done anywhere near as well as with Sheen's character. Having said that, in some ways this just reinforces the idea that men can sometimes get so lost within their own little world that those outside of them couldn't possibly understand them and perhaps this was what Coppola wished to portray.Overall, Apocalypse Now is an interesting look at the workings of the human mind in an adverse environment and also an interesting interpretation of Conrad's classic novella. There is some excellent photography throughout the film and despite its length it does manage to retain attention through most of the movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Thank goodness for the fast forward button on the remote,"This movie has many powerful scenes.  It deserves it's status as an American film classic.  However, I found the redux version way too long.  I felt some of the restored scenes in the movie took away from the flow.  Especially out of place was the scene where they arrive at the French plantation.  I think the picture does a good job of conveying the hopelessness and confusion that probably existed in the battlefield.  Duval's character was my favorite of the film.  His character's willingness to attack a difficult target was more inspired by his desire to surf on the beach than to accomplish a military goal.  I think that conveyed a sense of the way that some military decisions were made.  However, I didn't buy the Kurtz character.  I thought Brando's acting was great, but the situation of him forming his own little army to fight the war was too outlandish.  Oh well, certainly a classic, I think I'll take the original over the Redux, and I think I would have prefered a more believable conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A hellish cruise for a nihilistic crusade ...,"Attempting to analyze a movie like ""Apocalypse Now"" is as futile and dangerous as naively asking: why do people kill each other? Any answer would fatally disappoint. So the most honest approach is to admit that some things are morally wrong and some others are obligatory, and when the two unite, then I guess, you have an idea of what hell is about  hell, as the most eloquent and representative synonym of war.The genius of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is to depict war in a cinematically powerful form, which is, let's face it, one of the most exhilarating and psychologically gripping experiences ever. To watch ""Apocalypse Now"" is to feel the essence of war, to hear its heart-breaking cry and to witness its devastating damages  the film makes you think less than feel, the film transcends any abstraction. War is a state of mind, yes, but war is made of fights, guts splattered, instant deaths, cries, shouts, explosions of napalm and insanity, genuine breakdowns and orgasmic thrills  everything is real, yet, with a depth never reached by another War film, before or after. There will never be another ""Apocalypse Now"".The film challenges your perceptions with an incredibly haunting cinematography, taking you in a road whose end is uncertain  but uncertainty is like the uncomfortable pillow while patriotism acts as sleeping pills. In more comprehensible words, the value of life is so questionable in wartime that the very idea of winning and losing is useless. Are we humans or are we tools? Why the war? If ""Apocalypse Now"" answered these questions, the script would have lost my respect. But instead of telling us why the war exists, Coppola shows what war is. It doesn't even make it more rational, or more understandable, but the film is not about answering questions; it's about making us question ourselves.And we question ourselves. In the boots of Captain Willard, a man whose strange top secret mission will plunge him into the depth of the insanity governing a War. But ""Apocalypse Now"" is not a descent into madness; it's a thought-provoking script inviting us to a journey introspecting the very meaning of War as a conflict that tortures our minds. War starts inside us. And the first victim of a war is not the man we'll kill, it's our spirit that we destroy forever, this part of us, for which, human value had a meaning. And forever means forever  we banish ourselves from human community as soon as we participate to war. It's a duty condemning us for eternal alienation, for a purgatory, whose symbolic incarnation is the Colonel Kurtz's tribe, the objective of Willard's mission.Kurtz, created a universe where War has been pushed to its more extreme expression. He reached his breaking point and literally went insane, alienated by a desire to grave War in golden letters, to give a meaning to his military duty. And Coppola's approach is a stroke of genius, because it leaves us perplexed, torn between fascination and disgust, and our guilt to lean towards the former one. The movie doesn't try to inspire our disgust; it respects our intelligence enough not to be judgmental. On the contrary, we respect these men fallen in the trap of an inevitable insanity. They may be assassins, soldiers; they're still men as long as they tried to follow a path made of an idea of what is duty. Yes, they're morally wrong, but in wartime, the only right is to win. Fighting is obligatory. The rest is bullshit.And this is why ""Apocalypse Now"" is the movie that best defines war. Because this bullshit, whatever it is, is made of the most precious things you have in your life. And you, soon, get the feeling, that the movie invites you to discover a universe where your only choice is to die or to survive by becoming more ruthless and cold-blooded than your enemy. Kurtz knew that. Willard will know that. And we learn that. ""Apocalypse Now"" is not about war, it IS War in the most horrific and realistic view. It's real, it's made of feeling, not ideas, the only ones who express ideas in the film (I'm talking of the Redux version) are those who don't fight. Fighters don't think, they cry, they shout, they object, but ultimately, they kill or are killed, there are no alternatives, and when you kill, it's not to be killed.It's about learning to kill; it's about exploring the most efficient ways to terminate the enemy, about desensitizing ourselves to feel the power not to fear war, but to spouse it in a bloody nuptial nightmare. Desensitizing, indeed, no passion in War, no excitement, no entertainment, no enjoyment, whoever enjoys war condemns himself for death or failure. This is why the first segment of Willard's twisted odyssey is to enlighten us about the inevitability of the American defeat, and the exhilaration driven by the iconic Ride of the Valkyries' helicopter scene, by Colonel Kilgore's charisma, by the bunnies' sexy dancing, or the psychedelic effects of the ""Satisfaction"" scene, with the water skiing, are just misleading. The road is on the river, the boat is the only referential, but the closer they'll get to Kurtz, the more palpable will be the effects of war. And to get Kurtz is to become Kurtz, and to understand Kurtz is to understand war. To understand war, is to understand hell.Francis Ford Coppola is a genius, because he offered to Cinema a unique creation, defining Cinema as an Art, as something meaningful, with a strange capability to make us feel something we didn't experience, like the emptiness of a hellish War where the only way of survival is killing, and passionless killing though. No room for feelings, this is the Apocalypse. And the way the movie opens, speaks loudly the horrific message to humanity  This is the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A take on war film from a different side.,"The tone of the film is very dark and might be a little depressing but only for some time , You find yourself wondering ,how the hell will he be able to complete his mission given the conditions. Well brando is a superb actor. But the film looked to be too long to me. I was fascinated after learning that the film went into so many problems. But even after the problems it faced it did came out nice and a definite one time watch. Martin sheen as captain Willard performed very fine and looked very mature at most of the times. The locations looked scary and haunting all the times , It escalated the tension at some times. The length could have shorter. Other than this it was a good film.""A definite watch for all war lovers.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Film that Transcends Its Genre!,"Let me be frank when I say this: Apocalypse Now is not a war movie. There aren't long, drawn-out gun fight sequences and there isn't a lot of confrontation. However, this film is so much more satisfying for what it truly is. Apocalypse Now is actually a modern retelling of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now reintroduces and builds upon the themes presented in Conrad's masterpiece. For anyone who hasn't read Heart of Darkness, I suggest it. This film separates itself from the rest of the similar Vietnam period films made when it comes to its core concept: its plot.Apocalypse Now tells the story of a young soldier, Benjamin Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who is sent on a mission to find and ""relieve"" the renegade Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, of his duties. Willard is unsure of what he will find as he makes his way down the river toward the location of Kurtz, and as he travels deeper down the river, he descends into the darkness. I never want to spoil anything so I'll leave the plot at that, but let's just say that there are a fair share of disturbing and memorable scenes.Of course, the characters are what really bring this whole story to life. Martin Sheen does a great job, portraying the gradual realizations of Willard, and his constant confusion in the midst of two powerful forces. Marlon Brando brings the character of Kurtz to life and accurately portrays him just as I always envisioned him in Heart of Darkness. I don't really want to tell you much about the character though. It's best that like Willard, slowly flowing down the river, you learn more and more as you watch the film. There are some great supporting performances too like Robert Duvall's performance as Colonel Kilgore, a cunning yet maniacal officer, who is best remembered for his trademark line, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning."" These performances really add so much more depth to this already powerful and pervasive film.The camera work is great here and what else would you expect from Coppola. Coupled with large rounds of intense music and more subtle touches, Coppola's cinematography really brings the setting of Vietnam to life. The atmosphere is haunting at times yet enchanting at others. It truly feels like we are watching the events unfold from Willard's perspective.By the end of the film, I was left satisfied and slightly perturbed, much like how I felt after reading Heart of Darkness. The film truly brings another dimension of Vietnam to the table, with classic themes told through the medium of war. Ultimately, this is not a war movie. This is a movie about a man's journey into the heart of darkness and what he finds there. It has its share of sequences with bullets being exchanged, but make no mistake; this film transcends the war genre and adds a novel magnitude to the film culture of Vietnam.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This film is my favorite for many reasons.,"The intro to Apocalypse Now is not just intense, but surreal and somewhat frightening at the same time. This idea pretty much sums up the movie. Not only are there moments of terrible action, but the entire film has a dreamlike quality. This can partly be attributed to the eerily poetic voice over, but mostly the cinematographer Vittorio Storraro is the one responsible for the nightmarish mood.Everything clicks in the film: the acting, the direction, the writing, the production values, etc. Not one thing is wrong with this film, though many people find it to be boring. For me, every time I watch it I am taken on a journey into the heart of darkness.One last note: I prefer the original version to the Redux version.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Well-Made But Worthless Movie,"I just watched the ""Redux"" extended version of this film.  I watched it after reading a number of these comments.  I think my tastes in movies are rather broad; they include epic adventure and war movies--I like the Lord of the Rings movies very much, The Last of the Mohicans, Saving Private Ryan, etc.  Still, this movie left me quite underwhelmed!  I'm not saying that I wasn't -affected- by the movie, but the effect it had was to sober me to life, but at the same time to put me into a strange post-LONG-movie stupor. And so I spent 3-1/2 hours of my life watching this movie--one of the best of all time?--and I saw no value in it!  I wasn't entertained, educated, or encouraged to do anything about anything.  I call that a waste of time, even though--as others have noted--the cinematography was masterful.  Many other movies have great cinematography: watch one of them.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Classica,"This film had to show how insane the war was. I watched the film in 2025, and I see how this Vietnam war was. But I wanted to see Russian soldiers in cinemas because the war was between the USA and the SSSR. The war scenes are very best and modern, like now. All music used to be very right in this film.Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is more than a war film-it is a psychological odyssey into the darkness of human nature. Inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the film follows Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a mission to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a rogue officer who has created his own empire deep in the jungle.The film's opening, with The Doors' The End playing over napalm explosions, immediately sets a hypnotic and unsettling tone. As Willard's crew journeys upriver, each encounter reveals the absurdity and horror of war. The legendary helicopter assault, scored to Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, is a striking mix of cinematic spectacle and grim reality.Brando's portrayal of Kurtz is haunting, his cryptic monologues questioning the meaning of war, power, and sanity. Robert Duvall's Kilgore provides a stark contrast, embodying the reckless bravado of the U. S. military. The film's visuals, crafted by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, make every frame feel both dreamlike and nightmarish.The film's troubled production-storms, budget issues, Sheen's heart attack-only adds to its legend. The final act is a fever dream, where Willard faces the moral decay at the heart of war. Apocalypse Now is not just about Vietnam; it is about the darkness within us all.With its philosophical depth and unforgettable imagery, Apocalypse Now remains one of the greatest war films ever made. It is an experience that lingers, challenging viewers to confront war's true horror.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Half A Great Film Destroyed By Brando,"""Apocalypse Now"" is almost impossible to give a numerical grade to. The reason why is simple, while the first part is very good, the film simply falls to pieces once Marlon Brando appears. Full of unforgettable scenes and images the first part might qualify as great cinema except for the need for a narration to make sense of the material - a sure sign of the mess the script was in as shooting began. Brando in the end manages to destroy everything with a mumbling, mannered wreck of a performance. If Brando had given Coppola one of his great latter turns in ""The Godfather"", here he gives the worst performance by a name actor I have ever seen. It stinks and anybody who tries to persuade you otherwise is deluded. Apparently Coppola was influenced by Herzog's ""Aguirre"", and certainly both movies are a mixture of the great and the awful, what lifts Herzog's film though is Klaus Kinski's performance. In my dreams I have an ""Apocalypse Now"" with Kinski in the Brando role -it's a much better film even though I'll never see it. The ""Redux"" version adds running time but detracts from the film by much more and should be avoided.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Conrad > Coppola,"Unlike Joseph Conrad, Coppola never understood his subject matter. Conrad spent years at sea, sailing the world as a professional mariner before embarking on his writing career. He experienced first hand much of the content that wound up in his books. His travels hardened, wizened and salted him. FFC was a self-absorbed, hypersensitive, neurotic, ego-centric hollywood filmmaker. Much like his fellow travelers in hollywood, he was a soft, sheltered manchild completely oblivious of the real world. So, like many before and after him, he had to resort to infantile fantasy in his career. E.g. The romanticized, sentimental, psychologically complex and conflicted mob boss in GF. Pretty much the exact opposite of what these guys are in real life. Same with AN. This fanciful, sanctimonious hippy rock music video set in Vietnam, with elements of HOD layered in (always useful to have an original plot handy free of charge) is too bombastic and absurd to be taken seriously on any level. Too sensationalized to be a good war movie, too superficial and melodramatic to be a serious literary adaptation, AN is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Sheen and Brando are about as believable as SF officers as my cat. (Less actually, she's pretty stealthy & lethal). Sheen was laughably fragile and insipid. Brando was a dull, corpulent sloth, many years past his viability as an actor even then. Both were horribly miscast in these roles. Perhaps equal blame lies with Milius but at least he wasn't shy about his criticisms. The cinematography was great but it's not nearly enough to save this bloated mess, not by a sight.

27 years later and has points of interest,"I served with the Army during the Persian Gulf Conflict (1990) and find this movie interesting having seen it twice. This concerns more a moral and inward journey by an officer who is a loner and sees parts of himself in the man he is assigned to terminate. The movie can be dealt with in many areas. I have even allowed Ryann and Nathan (my kids) to view this movie with a sense of instilling them with the futility of so many wars. I am not a pacifist by any means, but I feel the underlying message here is still in the inner journey of a man torn apart by the insanity he sees surrounding his mission as well as the erosion of all values in humanity in each step along the way. Almost a sort of Dante's Inferno as he descends each step closer into Hell by moving upriver to his final destination. This is a very deep and complex movie. I do not recommend this for the faint of heart, but by all means complete the movie if you have started it.

Apocalypse Now is one of the best films about war ever made,"One of the crown jewels of Zoetrope Studios, Apocalypse Now infamous for its director's over-budget and over-schedule process. The six-week shoot ultimately took 16 months. The project was plagued by problems. Coppola shot nearly 200 hours of film and took almost three years to edit the project. Despite multiple glitches in the process, the final product is a gripping and incredibly disturbing image of the murkiness of war and the depths of human depravity. Despite it being one of the greatest films of all time, parents might want to consider the film's psychological suspense and extreme violence before letting their teens watch it.Apocalypse features outstanding performances by Sheen, Fishburne and Forrest. Robert Duvall gives a disturbing performance as Lieutenant Kilgore, a man who finds surfing and combat compatible activities and the character credited with one of the films most famous lines, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning.""

Pretensions of Profundity,"Here's one of those movies that receives accolades solely because it deals with a weighty subject and has Pretensions of Profundity.Is it actually worth watching? I don't believe so. Wish i could get back the time i spent on this lemon of a film. There isn't enough story here to make it a great film and the whole climax is sorely botched. Without writing a spoiler i'll just say that Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz- for whose appearance you wait the entire film for- was a huge letdown.Although Brando is inarguably one of the greatest actors ever, he was miscast and given vacuous lines to deliver to boot. The movie ends as one big melodramatic farce.Additionally, the fact that this was a work of director Francis Ford Coppola who directed the inimitable Godfather films does not mean that you should watch this film too. It only means that you should go back and watch the Godfather again (and again). This is shameful compared to those films and it's hard to see any true artist wanting this sham attached to their name.The only part that was at all enjoyable and made me forget how that the movie was going nowhere, were the parts with Robert Duvall as the macho commander.

Unforgettable,"Breathtaking at it's best, intriguing at it's worst, Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest ever film depiction centered around America's involvement in Vietnam.What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. Growing up as movie buff, and with a particular interest in war films, I've seen many films, which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so. Films such as 'Hamburger Hill' and 'We were soldiers' fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by depicting 'heroic battles' which are, more often than not, tainted by the zeal of Hollywood film production.In 'Apocalypse now' there are no battles, no heroes or villains, there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of Vietnam through the physical aspects of war. Rather, it is a film, which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute 'horror' of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century.The sheer brilliance of the acting (in particular the interpretation of taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen), along with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Phillipines), which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film, makes 'Apocalypse Now' an unforgettable epic.Evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation, 'Apocalypse now' is not for the light-hearted moviegoer.

"Muddled narrative, stunning visuals","In the introduction to the most recent version, Apocalypse Now: Final Cut, Coppola refers to the surrealistic tone of the film and its avant gardist vision (that Vietnam turned capitalist?). But I wonder if a more apt description of its underlying esthetic is that of a surrealist homage to Dadaism, and rather long-winded at that; because the only firm opinion I could draw from viewing it this third time (my previous viewings were its predecessors), was that it was basically informed by a nod, intended or otherwise, to the absurdist elements of art as they pertain to film, with form prevailing over substance in a very spectacular fashion. Ironically, it was this latest version with its enhanced visuals and sound reproduction and effects that drove me to this conclusion, I guess because the narrative paled even further next to the ramped up audio-visual sensory experience, bringing out all the holes and glaring inconsistencies. One could argue that the absurdist element is a broad metaphor for war, in this case the Vietnamese war, but for a film that sets out to meticulously fill in the character of Kurtz the renegade Colonel through the eyes of Captain Willard the Special Ops assassin, both of whom one would assume have an inkling of the role of the US Military in the American Military-Industrial complex (Willard even refers to it as 'the Corporation' not entirely euphemistically), the received plot summary that Kurtz, having discovered the military isn't interested in winning the war, violating his principles as a warrior and a patriot, has gone insane and formed his own rogue army in the jungle of Cambodia to impose a reign of terror on those trying to depose him (one assumes from both sides), just doesn't ring true. For a Harvard grad with a Masters in History and member of the establishment, one would expect him politically savvy and cynical enough to know that war is business by other means, and that's it's not necessarily just about destroying the enemy and winning; or to paraphrase R. West talking about the military of the Romans: 'They had no use for the local potentates which would build up the Empire by raising their territories to military and economic strength; they wanted it as a defenceless field of exploitation for an international army.""But the narrative would have you believe that Kurtz is an idealist who made his way up the ranks, only to discover that the military doesn't function like he'd always been led to believe, and his disillusionment drives him to fight against his own - to rescue the honor of the US Military and his country? Maybe he really is a stubbornly idealistic idiot whose actions are threatening the profiteering activities of the Corporation and the top brass and he has to be eliminated. I have a similar issue with the Willard character. Yes, he is essentially an 'errand boy', as Kurtz pronounces him, but he too comes across as naive regarding why the Corporation want Kurtz eliminated - perhaps it's his job not to dig too deep. In the final analysis, one can see the parallels with Heart of Darkness. In the novel Kurtz uses brutal methods to run his end of the Company's ivory business and his success threatens the job security of complacent others higher up in the office; and similarly in the film, Kurtz has discovered that the only way to win the war by fighting brutality with greater brutality, but the Corporation keeps putting obstacles in his path. But their motives differ. The former is in it for profit and promotion, whereas the latter is working for the greater good of his country and his own noble cause as a warrior. What they share however is that both are driven to madness by the exigencies of their jobs-lives, which is to achieve the greatest possible success, as measured either in ivory or battle victories, regardless of how horrific and brutal the methods, divorced from their conscience and morals, which in essence the modus operandi of raw, unfettered capitalism where people are mere actors driven by blind forces, in the market place or the the service of the capitalist nation-state. If this indeed is 'the message' of the film, that insanity and inhumanity are at the core of capitalism, where war is business and business is war, then it is even more lost in the latest (final?) version.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Kurtz's involvement in Iran's nuclear program revealed,"Bush Administration must be warned immediately about this disturbing development.

Anyway while the voice over was relating this, a newspaper clipping was shown with Kurtz's picture and the title Green Beret Under Fire. Now I know this is a very sad thing to do but I zoomed in on the rest of the article to read it. It is about Iran's nuclear program and the morality of the West's involvement in its development. Apparently they were receiving parts or advice from West Germany. Of course this was when Iran had a pro western regime, which was replaced by the current one. Kind of topical eh?

Even Col. Kurtz has the same name as the character in HoD.This is all-too-often missed by movie fans. I am a great admirer of the film version and not some kind of cynic who thinks movies butcher novels. However, while I feel that AN has added a great amount to the shelf life of HoD and that it serves as an homage to the original text, I feel that it is Conrad, not Coppola, who deserves the greater credit for the success of AN. Either way, it shows what a fantastic story - and a great exploration of the savagery that is within us all - HoD really is, that it can be adapted in such a way and still remain relevant. Its message, about the heart of darkness that lies within even the most civilised nations, remains as powerful in its new form as in the original print version.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""I Love the Smell of Napalm in the Morning.""","I have many ideas and thoughts about Apocalypse Now. Based off Joseph Conrad's Hearts of Darkness, it is considered to be one of the best films of the twentieth century and one of the best Vietnam War movies ever made. I can generally agree with that assessment, but this movie is overly complicated sometimes. The movie has much to say on character and Darwinism. This movie follows Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) as he is tasked to travel downriver from Vietnam to Cambodia to assassinate a former American colonel, Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). But when Willard arrives to meet the Colonel, he realizes all is not what it really is. Kurtz has sided with the North Vietnamese for reasons of Darwinism and staying alive. He confesses how much stronger the Vietcong were than the Americans. They would go to any length to win the war and that is what gave them strength according to Kurtz. Kurtz was once one of the greatest soldiers in the American army and now after the reality of the war set in, he is taken over by madness and despair. This entire movie is about the journey Willard takes to understand what exactly Kurtz has gone through over the course of the war because Willard is going through the same ordeal.This movie shows both the joy and angst of filmmaking as director Francis Ford Coppola will say. This movie was a very hard shoot as it took over four years to film. (Actor Laurence Fishburne was 14 when he began shooting, and 18 when it ended and Harrison Ford filmed his part before Star Wars made him famous..and that was two years before this movie's release). The movie was full of complications ranging from sickness (Martin Sheen had a heart attack on set) to actors being very hard to work with (Brando being Brando). But in the end, this was Coppola's baby. Sure, he had The Godfather films but this is his heart and soul. With all the trouble this film had, it is remarkable how great this film is. Coppola really makes clear what he thought about the war itself and how hard it damaged the human psyche. He underlines the hell these humans have gone through over the course of this journey.One of the best supporting characters is Robert Duvall as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (he said the opening quote of this review). His performance actually earned him an Academy Award nomination rightfully so. Talking about insanity, this man only cares about surfing and beaches. He only agrees to help Willard take a beach because that beach had great waves. Plus in the Redux version (which this review is from), Kilgore uses helicopters to chase down Willard on the river because of accusations that they stole their surfboards. He also uses his choppers as he plays Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as he swoops down over young schoolchildren. It's a little over-the-top, but I guess that fits the insanity part very well. Another fun supporting character is Dennis Hopper's role as a photojournalist for Kurtz. He is supposed to be the funnyman and he incites poetry which he clearly heard from Kurtz himself.There is one thing that this film wouldn't work without and that is the opening song. ""The End"" from The Doors is an iconic tune and it has a significance in the film. I can't imagine the opening sequence of the treeline being blown away working well without this song. Also keep an eye on the Oscar-winning cinematography from Vittorio Storaro. The movie is utterly gorgeous and he created some of the most beautiful sequences in cinema history.As well-liked this film is, it does have its share of controversies. Brando, whom was perfect for the role, had a salary of one million dollars (which was unheard of during its time). But there is a sequence in the movie that created even more controversy. The live killing of a cow as part of a sacrifice. Animals are supposed to be protected during movie-making, but this movie actually killed a cow for an incredibly gruesome scene. That is one scene that really appalls me due to an actual animal being killed.Apocalypse Now is an important movie. Following the success of 1978's The Deer Hunter, it proved there was an audience for Vietnam War movies after all. It took me several tries to realize what a monumental and influential film this is. It is a very long movie, but it's a journey about how humankind reacts to the horrors of war. You see Kurtz as a villain at first, but as you come to the end of the movie, that is where we gain some sympathy for the man after everything he has been through. Francis Ford Coppola created a very important piece of art-the biggest film of his career. This is a hard movie to get through, but I think it's worth watching in the end.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Coppola's zenith,"The granddaddy of all Vietnam War films only improves with each successive viewing; in years to come, long after the others have been all but forgotten, this will be the one still being watched and talked about. Worthless as history (and never intended as such) it nevertheless is a triumph of filmmaking, showing astonishing craftsmanship in every moment of soldier/assassin Martin Sheen's obsessive search for renegade Special Forces Colonel Martin Brando. The plot is episodic (even rambling) as it follows a narrowing river deep into Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but unlike later, more popular treatments of the war it never pauses to stroke the viewer's guilt or wrap the conflict up in any sort of tidy resolution. Despite the obvious care lavished on every frame, the narrative remains even more messy and incoherent than the war itself, with each new sequence becoming more surreal and disturbing until the final, hypnotic confrontation with Brando and his native army in the pit of his own private jungle hell. Audiences continue to respond more to the helicopter attack on the Vietcong village, ironically the only conventional, 'old-fashioned' war movie scene in the entire film (a point driven home by the heroic Wagner fanfare). The last act, by contrast, is usually dismissed as too murky and cerebral, perhaps because it shows all too clearly how the human conscience becomes an irrelevant luxury when faced with the moral depravity needed to effectively exterminate an enemy. That's not exactly a message anyone wants to hear; witness the patriotic justifications for Operations Desert Storm and Just Cause, and the invasions of Panama and Granada, to name but a few of our post-Vietnam overseas adventures. The end result is a climate of horror few other war films have managed to capture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"watch the original version, not the Redux","This is a review of the Redux version:Much of this film is wonderful, especially the first half. It is truly an unforgettable film. But this film also includes sections that are so boring, they are painful to watch. After watching this film, I found out that the sections I found boring are the same sections that were removed from the original version.Maybe not coincidentally, the main removed scenes are the only scenes that have female-speaking characters. This makes me wonder if Coppola inserted those scenes only because he wanted to attract a female audience. Or maybe he thought ""sex sells"", and added the scenes for that reason. In any case, those scenes are boring and detract from the rest of the film. The studio executives were smart to remove them from the original version.I do recommend watching this film. But try to see the original version instead of the Redux one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The standard by which all war films should be judged,"In the 1960s, the Indochine conflict that had been raging for most of the twentieth century finally boiled over into the Vietnam War. America went into this war with a tribal, technologically underdeveloped people, firm in the belief that if they committed enough weaponry and soldiers to the battle, the conflict could be won quickly. Obviously, they were wrong, and one of the many things that Apocalypse Now does brilliantly is illustrate some of the reasons why. One officer of the Viet Cong army, I forget who, told the Americans that they would get tired of the war before the Vietnamese do.This absolute chaos was reflected in the production of Apocalypse Now. Taking over a year to shoot, and around three years to massage into a shape for release, it has become the definitive war epic, not just for a generation, but for all time. Part of this stems from the fact that it is neither pro-Vietnamese nor pro-American, but simply telling the story of one man's terrible journey, leaving the viewer to make up their own mind what to take from it. This is in spite of a fairly slow, even languid pace, and even the great possibility in the late 1970s that it might never be released at all.In 2001, Francis Ford Coppola released a new version of his masterpiece, complete with a remixed soundtrack and forty-nine minutes of footage that had not been integrated into the cut when the distributors, getting nervous about the production woes, demanded that Coppola release something to the public. The resulting 153-minute cut was hailed as one of the best war films ever made. In spite of this, it did show a little incoherence at times. Scenes seemed to jump from one to another without transition. So the 202-minute Redux addressed this in two ways. First, it obviously added a good deal of footage that gave more development and background to many of the characters, especially Martin Sheen's burned out Captain. It also reorganised existing footage into an order that made somewhat more sense. The scene in which we are introduced to Robert Duvall's insane airborne commander now flows much more smoothly, to cite the best example.In a much lesser film, it is said that a dream of one war is a dream of all wars. Apocalypse Now is a great expression of this fact. By proxy of a fictional report on the war's progress, we are told in different words that unless we adapt ourselves to our battlefield, victory is impossible. We are also told how technology and manpower alone will not win wars. The film more or less tells us that commitment is far more important in the key to winning a war, and this seems to be a lesson that America is still struggling to learn. If anything, Apocalypse Now is more relevant today than it was in 1979. We are still lying to ourselves, our fearless leaders still lie to us, and we still have the same delusions we call morality.Strangely enough, Apocalypse Now's signature scene comes early in the piece. The flight of the helicopters over the village to the tune of Wagner's Ride Of The Valkyries is so memorable that the two have literally become one. Many a listener can no longer hear the music without thinking of the film. Unlike many other films, the contemporary music used here also perfectly complements the on screen action. Hearing Jim Morrison sing ""can you picture what will be?"" as helicopter flybys fade into Martin Sheen resting in a Saigon hotel is one thing that convinced me contemporary music could work in films that were not themed around it. Matter of fact, some of the music heard in this film is just as haunting as the story being told. Which is saying quite a lot.Not only is Apocalypse Now one of the best war films ever made, it is also one of the best adaptations of existing source material ever made. In this case, the film is somewhat loosely based upon the Joseph Conrad novel Heart Of Darkness. Rather than attempt to create a word-for-word adaptation, Coppola transplants the story into what was then a modern setting and embellishes it with all the things that setting allows. As a result, we have something here that stands head and shoulders above other adaptations of novels set in the Vietnam war. Just watch the eerie, surreal bridge sequence here, and compare it with the sniper hunt sequence in the truly abysmal Full Metal Jacket. The difference in quality when a filmmaker is willing to put his health and sanity on the line to capture that authentic feel of a world gone utterly mad. Forget the Windtalkers or Saving Private Ryans, this is as close as one will ever get to live warfare on the screen.I gave Apocalypse Now a ten out of ten. In spite of flawed editing in its original incarnation, it deserves this rating in both the original and Redux edits. Like RoboCop or X-Men 2, it simply must be preserved as a record of the world's mentality at the time it was made. It is a classic that every storyteller should study intently.

He also encounters many ruthless characters including an officer called Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who launches a napalm bomb attack on a beach so that one of his men can go surfing.

The version Coppola always wanted to make,"I'm going to be honest here for a second and let you know, I've never watched the original. Watching Apocalypse Now: Final Cut - the version director Francis Ford Coppola always wanted to make - seemed to be a great opportunity for me to experience this classic on the big screen.This year marks the 40th anniversary of Apocalypse Now. Rereleased in 2001 as 'Redux'-version, 'Final Cut' cuts down to a three hour running time and uses state-of-the-art Dolby Atmos sound and crystal clear 4k restored imagery. Every scene got polished and feels and looks like a new film. Coppola seems to be saying goodbye to his magnum opus with this final cut, showing us exactly the way he wanted Apocalypse Now to look like in the first place.The opening shot of palm trees turning into ashes, to the sound of The Doors' ""The End"" is burned into my mind. Just beautiful in every way. This image might not look as hi-def as you'd hope for in the final cut, but this has to do with the way it was shot on celluloid. Nonetheless, gives you an idea what awaits you. Helicopters and motel-room ceiling fans edited in a way that it overlaps, shows how affected Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is by this war - PTSD shown in the most artistic way.Where the first two acts are really compelling, the final act really lost me. The first two acts explore post traumatic stress syndrome and the challenges that come with it. The Vietnam war is still roaring in the background, but our main group of characters is put on a side mission upriver, to hunt down a deserter - demented colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). The Captain reads through Kurtz's files while traveling through Vietnam, danger luring around every corner and trying not to lose focus on his goal. This war changed many men forever. Coppola and his team show the insanity in the jungle and trenches, while these soldiers have nothing else to lose than their minds.The final act starts with a very strange scene at a plantation that has nothing to add to the story. Here we get seated around a dinner table with French colonialists discussing politics, that seems to go on forever. To then move further down the river to introduce Brando's character in a cultish way. This third act feels like a different film and to me was very anti-climactic. That doesn't mean this film isn't a masterpiece, because the work and practical effects put into the making of this is simply astonishing. Watching Robert Duvall act for his life, was jaw-dropping and made me smile every time he appeared on screen.I've never seen anything like Apocalypse Now: Final Cut before, and I don't think I'll ever see anything like this ever again. StudioCanal decided to distribute this new version in Australia. If you get the chance to watch this on the big screen from Thursday July 25 (in selected cinemas), please do, you won't regret it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Stunning achievement in war cinema and filmmaking as a whole,"-Final Cut; 4K Restoration-A true cinematic translation of the War Is Hell phrase. Continual barrages, both literal and of smoke and fire, while the sun dives towards the horizon to escape the madness and boots trudge through the glistering mud. One of the most 'tangible' films ever made, which can be in large attributed to the insane production value. Seeing a 5-second shot with dozens of extras and a couple helicopters in the sky or giant constructions violently exploding are far from rare. It's in part why, for example, the Wagner sequence is so arresting, though of course there are many elements at play. I guess it's understandable that some read it as pro-war/America, but when those chants kick in as the choppers move landward with the ocean waves, it should become instantly clear how that patriotism moreso stands for delusions of grandeur, acting like a source of divine intervention. This is further illustrated by Kilgore, who likes to stand tall when everyone ducks and seems more interested in bringing surfing to Vietnam than the battlefield he is currently in the middle of, in a sense acting out an even dumber version of the White Man's Burden.Coppola also cleverly communicates the mental collapse of the soldiers. Whereas so many Vietnam films resort to a soldier crying and hopelessly yelling that he can't take it no more, Apocalypse Now employs a much more subtle and psychological approach, often utilizing film form itself like with the brilliant uses of overlapping shots to convey a fragmented mind. There are some noticable tropes (though that isn't much of a problem considering this was one of the earliest Vietnam films), in particular the narration stands out, but unlike, for instance, The Thin Red Line, it's well spaced out and never feels pretentious. Overall, though, it is much more concerned with non-verbality, conjuring an atmosphere worthy of being called hell on earth. Not that it'd have to worry about words: dialogue is precise, memorable (what smell did he like again?) and consistently delivered with excellence. Martin Sheen is a powerhouse, but Marlon Brando is close to stealing the show. His screentime is little and is usually spent in lengthy and dark close-ups with low-key lighting, which reflects just how confident Coppola must've been in his performance (unsurprising given The Godfather) and is truly all that was needed. Throughout the entire 3-hour runtime there was a near constant stream of people going in and out of the theatre for a quick bathroom break, but when Brando was on screen? Utter immobility. Having your performance be the climax of a 2-hour buildup is tough, but he makes it look easy.Truly a shame about that plantation section - courtesy of the Final Cut - that occupies an awkward position as both a damper on the otherwise flawless pacing and as simply being subpar (or at the very least, not on the same level as everything else) because otherwise this might be as good as it gets. A stunning achievement in war cinema and filmmaking as a whole.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The horror, the horror","I am not a fan of war movies. Most of the time, I find them boring and repetitive. But ""Apocalypse Now"" was different. There are three versions of this film. The original, the redux and the final cut. The final cut is by far the best. The original is missing a lot of great scenes and I found the redux version to be too long (It's 3 1/2 hours). But the final cut is pretty much perfect.The acting is very good. Especially Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando. It portrays the madness, war can get one into perfectly, without stretching it too much and without repeating itself. The scenery is beautiful, Coppola did a great job there. All in all, I gave this movie a 9/10. If this movie only existed in its final cut, it would probably be a 10/10.SPOILERS:Francis Ford Coppola shows the crazyness of the Vietnam war by creating an instensity that barely any other film has. Sheen and Brando's characters are comparable on a certain level. Throughout the film, we are told again and again that Brando is crazy. But during our journey through the Vietnam War, Sheen himself becomes crazier and crazier, threatening to become like the general he is sent to kill. Coppola thus shows that it is not a personal attitude but the war itself that is the gateway to losing oneself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The darkest, most enigmatic, and most beautiful evocation of war ever filmed","Was Vietnam a unique or peculiar war? I can't honestly see how, except perhaps insofar as it involved young men going off to fight in a distant land for a cause they didn't rightly understand, on behalf of a people who didn't much appreciate their efforts. Kind of like Afghanistan, in recent years. Like Ashley Wilkes said, more or less, in Gone With The Wind, by the time the war's over no-one can rightly remember how it started or what it was all about. At one point in Platoon, Charlie Sheen has a monologue in which his first tour grunt says that he doesn't know what's right or wrong anymore. Maybe that is a feature of Nam that makes it a singular conflict? But I have my doubts.Suffice to say, in the theatre of war, stuff happens, all kinds of bad stuff. In the case of Apocalypse Now (1979) a renegade colonel goes awol and his fellow top brass activate a military asset (Bourne trilogy terminology there) to hunt him down and terminate him. The assassin, Willard (Martin Sheen) begins a journey down river and deep into the jungle, with just a handful of sailors as companions, the others unaware of his secret, non-existent mission. Apocalypse Now presents war for what it is, a failure of civilisation, the breakdown of communications and diplomacy, an outburst of chaos. The battles the sailors witness have an absurd theatricality to them, but as they journey further into the darkness, it all comes down to one thing, the act of killing, and the horror of it. Once you take a life anything becomes possible. The lights stay black.Coppola's film won two Oscars, for sound and for cinematography, and such is quite right, for this movie is a breathtaking, often beautiful phantasmagoria. It is full of haunting images, from first to last. It is simultaneously modern and atavistic. In terms of its vision, its artistry, it is far superior to a film like Platoon, which shows mainly trauma, occasionally made melodramatic through the (mis)use of Barber's Adagio. Naturally, no film starring Charlie Sheen can possibly be as good as a film starring his dad, Martin Sheen, so I'm afraid if I had to choose it would be for Coppola's existential epic rather than Stone's jungle crime spree. I'd also prefer Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket as a story about what war does to young men who join up with naive enthusiasm and get traumatised by the aggression and violence they experience. Coppola's Willard is a marine who has become a lone gunman, a sort of grunt doppelganger to his quarry, the brilliant Kurtz (Marlon Brando). He is not raw, but this challenge is one that will change him, irrevocably. Is there any coming back from such knowledge?I saw the Redux cut when it appeared, and I think Coppola has produced at least one more version of the 1979 original since then. Personally, I thought the additional scenes put into Redux achieved nothing, only obstructing the journey, needlessly. I remain loyal to the original version.* It's as perfect as a film ever could be. It makes you thankful that you can contemplate the savagery, the dark side of the Jungian (we're in Kubrick territory again) from a safe distance of years and centuries and satellite communications and bourgeois complacency. Be thankful you were never sent to a zone like this one.Never get out of the boat.*Lately seen the Final Cut, which cuts back on the additional material put into Redux. It's still replete with unnecessary scenes and bits of scenes, all of which serve only to make the film too long and too diffuse. Coppola got it as right as he ever could the first time around. It's noteworthy that voices had to be redubbed for the restored material at the turn of the millennium, and music recomposed for the added plantation scenes, which explain why that whole episode is so doubly anachronistic. An entirely different project centred on holdouts from France's Indochina colony, akin to UK television's The Jewel in the Crown, would be fascinating. Perhaps there is one already?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Apocalypse Now is a hallucinatory war epic that delves into the psychological corruption, albeit an overrated film.","After watching this, I've probably seen all the classic war masterpieces so am able to compare and contrast with many variations. There is no doubt that this is one of the best, just not THE best. The story is a loose adaptation of ""Heart of Darkness"" where a captain is ordered to terminate a colonel who they believe has gone mentally insane. Set in the midst of the Vietnam War, this is a visual spectacle. The bluray restoration in itself is magnificent, but the cinematography used here back in 1979 was way ahead of every other film. A yellow tinged filter applied to the majority of the shots to highlight the fire and harsh sunlight. The lighting was exquisitely minimal to enhance shadowy figures and the darkness of the jungle. Coppola's direction is yet again perfect. The narrative was consistently paced. The build up of Colonel Kurtz as a character was stupendous. He was portrayed to be a myth, a legend, with such anonymity yet with ominous overshadowing. Martin Sheen took on a transformative role and portrayed his character with class. A no nonsense captain who's mind is solely focussed on his classified objective. The supporting cast were good, albeit slightly unmemorable (except Robert Duvall). The lavish action set pieces were grand in scale and the mass usage of explosives made the depiction of war feel authentic. But...there lies my problem. On one half the narrative explores the war and its devastation, the other it attempts to expand on the psychological analysis of said war. The two didn't marinate. The only character that evolved psychologically was the captain. Everyone else was just there to exist and further the plot. It wasn't really executed intelligently. Then the confrontation with Kurtz felt like a let down. Brando's performance was great, but his character really didn't feel insane. It was subtly ambiguous, but his build up was loud and clear so it felt like a juxtaposition. Epic war film, mediocre psychological drama.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Francis Ford Coppola Lays Bare ""The Horror"" of Combat!","With a famously horrific shoot, it's now almost unfathomable how Francis Ford Coppola managed to harness the chaotic energy into one of the most potent examinations of war and masculinity to ever grace celluloid in his masterpiece Apocalypse Now.The story, based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, centers on Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), a US Army intelligence officer with a mission to travel into Cambodia and terminate the command of the renegade Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) - a colonel who went crazy and went native, forming his own Montagnard army out in the darkness of the jungle.. Needing to get back in the game, Willard takes the mission and finds himself among a motley crew. Nobody on the boat really understands the mission, least of all Willard himself, who keeps squinting at Kurtz's dossier and marveling at what a model soldier he was. Perhaps Kurtz hasn't gone rogue; perhaps he has simply achieved military apotheosis, carrying out the logical extension of the armed forces. Along the way he bonds with the crew of the boat taking him up-river as they encounter a gung-ho surfing Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a sexy French woman, a few Playboy Bunnies, a free-wheeling journalist and more war-time horrors than they could have imagined, until he finally meets Colonel Kurtz. This epic dark fantasia ends on a rather elliptical note, which seems the only way for it to end.'Apocalypse Now' is a confounding mix of the conventional and the surreal, a man-on-a-mission war flick that expands into a meditation. There is greatness to it, but there is also madness, and they feed off each other. From its opening scene of Capt. Willard falling apart in a Saigon hotel, the movie is a nightmare trip into the darkest reaches of the human soul. The depth and audacity of Mr. Coppola's vision makes even the most ambitious of today's films look timid and dreary by comparison. His direction is impeccable, capturing both the intimate detail, overarching spectacle and layered depth of meaning, often all in one shot and thus delivering a harrowing masterwork that bursts with malarial, mystical images. The movie is stunningly beautiful to look at, remarkably moving and horrific, and jammed with memorable characters in unforgettable situations. The score is wondrous, the production design solid and never overdone, and the cinematography is just wow.On the acting front, Martin Sheen brings astonishing sincerity to Willard and is entirely believable as the cipher, the burned-out husk who's seen too much death to be at peace. Robert Duvall's brilliant turn as Col. Kilgore - a near-cartoonish hawk who lives and breathes war, rings with bracing energy. But the movie ultimately belongs to the maestro himself – Marlon Brando. In a role that has all off 15 minutes of screen time - most of which is spent mumbling in the shadows, delivering hipster rants about atrocities – Brando is extraordinary as the great bald shambling mountain, who both does and doesn't seem to be the monster we've been waiting for.By any standard, Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece, a towering achievement of sight and sound - an epic freak-out, a fever dream of immense proportions, laying bare the stark horror and unimaginable thrill of combat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The best movie I've ever seen!!!!,"I'm not one for watching movies over 2 and a half hours, but this movie had me hooked from start to end.Usually I can't STAND narration in films, but Coppola is able to make sure that the narration is backstory or is something that adds towards the mystery and build-up to meeting Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz.Only one thing that I will comment on as a negative, and that's the plantation part of the movie. This is only in the final cut and makes more sense without it.The battle sequences are gripping and scenes like the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" and the ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" are iconic and well coordinated and written.Then there is Brando's character, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. One of the most terrifying and gripping characters I've seen in a movie. His dialogue and execution of his lines is the BEST I've seen in a long time.When you find out the trouble that Coppola and the rest of the crew had to deal with, you appreciate this movie even more. The choppers used in the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" scene were called out to an actual battle.If you haven't seen this 1979 war epic. I would highly recommend it. A masterpiece!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Coppola's phantasmagoric ode to the madness of war,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)War is a kind of madness. It has its own logic. Kill or be killed. Follow orders, follow the leader. Go crazy. Do horrific things. Become a beast. Do all of this in a steamy jungle amid a alien culture for an unclear purpose in an ineffective way and you've got some idea of what Vietnam was like. Coppola's Vietnam is the Vietnam of a soldier's Thai stick/acid trip. The filming actually took place in the Phillippines, but no matter: that's better than Kubrick's excellent Full Metal Jacket which was partially filmed on constructed sets in England of all places.The jungle is dark and green and deep and unbelievable lush, filled with snakes and tigers, insects that bite and swarm, bats and spiders and little tan men who dig tunnels and can't be seen. You shoot at the jungle, and you shoot and shoot and shoot. And you can imagine the effect it has. Like trying to kill flies with a .357 Magnum. Which is what we tried to do in Vietnam.Army Capt Ben Willard (Martin Sheen) on R and R in a Saigon hotel, going stir crazy, drinking Martell Cordon Bleu and passing out, gets a knock on the door. He has orders: go up river into Cambodia and terminate an army colonel (Marlon Brando) who has gone AWOL. Oh, and by the way, Colonel Kurtz in his charismatic madness has built his own little unauthorized empire in the jungle, fortified with crazed admirers. You might want to approach with caution.So this is the plot: a quest to a forbidden land with fantastic adventures along the way providing us with a view of the war from a gunboat. The flares at night, the ""purple haze,"" the tracers flying at the boat, the fog, the black nights, the little things the men do to retain some semblance of sanity, smoke a jay, polish your boots, reread a letter from home.And then there is the ordinary madness of the war lover personified in Robert Duvall's swashbuckling army colonel who likes to take off his shirt and watch his men surf the waves as all about him bombs are bursting and bullets flying. But he never flinches because to flinch would show weakness and possibly a lack of love for what one is doing. In one of the most memorable lines in all of filmdom, Duvall declares, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory."" Well, there was no victory. There was only the blood and the bombs, the jungle that could not be beaten back or Agent Orange'd enough, the mud and Charlie, always Charlie hidden somewhere, disguised or invisible and unkillable, like a hydra-headed monster, and dead bodies of your buddies on their way back to the land of the big PXs in body bags. And yet there is always the mission, and so upstream Willard goes. And the more he reads about Col Kurtz the more he admires the man. And then when he gets there, the question arises, how can he penetrate the Colonel's jungle fortress? He has been advised, belatedly, aboard the boat when it was too late to turn back and refuse the mission, that he had a predecessor, someone else sent to terminate Colonel Kurtz. So Colonel Kurtz will know why you, Capt Willard, are coming to visit.He calls you a messenger boy. You are put in a bamboo cage. A photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) turned worshipful admirer of the Colonel gives you water, lights a cigarette and puts it in your mouth. Delirious dreams and phantasmagoric nightmares, surreal imaginings and the haunting face of Kurtz and his poetry, quoting T.S. Eliot and Andrew Marvel, flood your mind. You have called an air strike should you not return, and then--was it a dream or was it real?--the head of the soldier who would call the strike is delivered to you on a banana leaf--something like that happened or didn't and maybe you will soon be, or already are, as mad as the Colonel.Coppola and crew spent two years in the jungle filming this. It is a great epic of mystery and beauty, a fantastic picture of the war, part brutal reality, part imagined enchantment with fascinating characters indelibly spun out by one of the greatest of all film makers. By all means see this for Francis Ford Coppola, one of the few directors who could be considered a genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Very timely,"Apocalypse Now is a haunting exploration of the madness of war and the human psyche. Francis Ford Coppola's vision of the Vietnam War goes beyond a traditional war film, delving into themes of morality, chaos, and the thin line between civilization and savagery. The stunning cinematography, eerie atmosphere, and unforgettable performances-especially from Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando-create an intense, almost surreal experience. Its adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness amplifies the personal and philosophical struggle at its core. Apocalypse Now is a bold, disturbing, and thought-provoking masterpiece that lingers long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Redux the better,"Just finished reading a very lucid and well prepared argument against the redux version of the film released in 2001. I must admit, at the moment i am neither particularly lucid nor well prepared, but i found the redux version superior to the original release for several reasons, a few of which i suspect to be sound. Clarity. I am as much a fan of drug induced incoherence as anyone (a quick stroll through my other IMDbposted remarks should prove that); but the expanse of the redone film film with its little morality play Playboy bunny arc and Renoir homage French Plantation sequence adds so much moral weight to the vision that it is barely the same film. The 1979 version is like an acid trip, jumping from one great scene to the next where the mind spend much of its time trying to catch up. In the Redux version all scenes seem connected, everything makes sense, even if the sense is somewhat uglier than the original. To me the French plantation sequence is of paramount importance to establishing the gravity of the film as a grand indictment and not just a heady horror story with intellectual presumptions.Sure, rent either, preferably both, but i believe if you do rent both you'll agree the extra clarity and gravity of the longer version was worth the 22 year wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Greatest Film Ever Made. Period.,"""Apocalypse Now"" is the end result of literary genius in direct collision with human madness. A film that took more than two years to make that crippled Coppola's confidence as a film maker and rendered many of its stars ill health -- Martin Sheen suffered a near fatal heart attack and Brando was border line mad -- would have to be meritorious to justify its arduous developments. It was. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now is the story of a spiritually listless Captain Ben Willard (in a brilliantly understated performance by Martin Sheen) who is delegated with the task of executing the rogue colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has defected from the American establishment as the condition of a spiritual and psychological awakening. There have been numerous, and better, studies on the themes and popular significance of Apocalypse Now, so trying to encapsulate the essence of the film in a simple review would be discrediting it to say the least.Its parallels to Homer's Odyssey are obvious, however while Odysseus' journey was fraught with danger it ultimately concluded on a note of harmony and enlightenment. Apocalypse Now, on the other hand, is a hell without purpose in which there is no coherent notion given to reason and logic. It is one of those incredibly rare films that transcends conventional genre and narrative and becomes an alien like experience that delves as deeply into its geographical heart as it does into the human spirit. The film is essentially composed of three acts: Willard's departure; the trip up river, and the destination. Along the way the viewer witnesses the en masse assault on villagers from a barrage of helicopters to the Wagnerian splendour of Ride of the Valkyries, GI's surf during a hectic conflict, and all of this surreal violence is to contrast the moral absurdity of Willard's mission, which by definition sounds straightforward, however as the film unfolds the mission becomes as questionable as the war itself. There's a double-emphasis with the narration, and it is used as a device to simultaneously guide the audience down the river and illustrate Willard's descent into moral chaos. In the first two acts the narration provides an insight into the mission and his mind, however in the third it becomes disturbed and suddenly Willard ceases to exist as a man and becomes a mere physical extension of the task he was relegated to – a ""Hollow Man"". The irony of this is punctuated between the existential dialogues Willard shares with Kurtz in that there is certain reasoning in the ravings of Kurtz which prompted the Army to surreptitiously assassinate him in the first place. So, Kurtz and Willard are the end result of their superiors. They are two men diametrically opposed, but their fates are cosmically intertwined. Kurtz is the existential Demigod that only could have resulted through war – he is the anti-thesis to the conformist American with conservative values, in fact he is so far removed from the ideal Western citizen that he can only be described as a crude prophet. Indeed his philosophical espousals become truths as he dissects everything from free will to humanitarianism to barbarism. And it is in these dialogues that the film transcends warfare, but aims for the human condition – man's war that is entirely spiritual and deeply personal. Neither man, nor nature, can endure such madness and perhaps it was Coppola's intention to comment on the banality of evil of the Vietnam War by compacting all of its toxic elements within one man's spirit. Apocalypse Now was one of the last of the ""great"" Hollywood productions in which its grandeur was the end result of a film maker's undying love for the medium. Fundamentally on absolutely every conceivable technical and artistic level, Apocalypse Now endures as a timeless masterpiece that reminds viewers that films can be an art form.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Last year I starting to watch Apocalypse Now but it is the Workprint Version and I started it last year and did not finished this film almost a year later, oops I was due.","Apocalypse Now is an absolute masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise that it has received. From the stunning visuals to the incredible performances, everything about this film is top-notch. Here are five reasons why I think it deserves a 5-star review:The direction: Francis Ford Coppola's direction is absolutely masterful. Every shot in this film is meticulously crafted to convey a sense of dread and chaos. The use of sound and music is also incredible, with the haunting sound of helicopters and the eerie music of The Doors creating a truly unforgettable atmosphere.The performances: The performances in this film are truly outstanding. Martin Sheen gives an incredible performance as Captain Willard, perfectly capturing the character's descent into madness. Marlon Brando is also phenomenal as Colonel Kurtz, bringing a sense of gravitas and danger to the role.The themes: Apocalypse Now is a film that is rich in themes and ideas. From the horrors of war to the human capacity for evil, this film explores some of the darkest aspects of the human condition. It's a film that will leave you thinking long after the credits have rolled.The cinematography: The cinematography in this film is simply breathtaking. The lush, green landscapes of Vietnam are juxtaposed with the stark, brutal realities of war to create a truly stunning visual experience.The legacy: Apocalypse Now is a film that has had a lasting impact on cinema. Its influence can be seen in countless films that have come since, and it remains a timeless classic that will continue to be studied and appreciated for generations to come.In short, Apocalypse Now is a truly remarkable film that deserves all of the praise that it has received. It's a film that will stay with you long after you've watched it, and it's one that I would recommend to anyone who appreciates great cinema.The reason I started to watch the Workprint Version is because it has a longer scenes that were not in either cuts, surprisingly shocking but people were correct this is the most important film of 1979, famous director known for The Godfather films, but the Workprint Version Quality it is posted on YouTube which thank you, wasn't the best Quality and barely hear the music score, shot by shot scenes and boy was this film right all along. I was a year due for not watching the entire movie that's because the creator ""Sunday Pancake Breakfast"" did not posted, there was 12 parts made it shorter but at least I gave it a break for a while and decided should I finished this and today I finally did for the first rime in a year, the critics and audiences are right definitely a watch for sure.

DARKNESS MADE VISIBLE.,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Coppola's megalomania, Brando's behaviour, Sheen's heart attack - all of the behind the scenes stuff, 'add' rather than distract to the overall viewing experience of 'Apocalypse Now'.Terrifying, brutal, experimental and an effective expressionistic War film masterpiece. A stunning piece of art and a filmmaker's apocalypse getting it made.Coppola kept shooting and shooting and shooting, accumulating miles and miles of exposed footage without knowing precisely what story he wanted to tell or how he wanted to end it. Back in the bad old days Coppola claims in press notes for the new and improved Apocalypse Now Redux - 'We were terrified that the film was too long, too strange and didn't resolve itself in a kind of classical big battle at the end... 22 years ago I was under more pressure to make this into what was then considered a 'normal' war film. Now I have the opportunity to widen the focus.'Coppola was required by the Philippine government to destroy the Kurtz compound after he was finished shooting. He photographed it being blown up and decided to use this footage over his closing 35 MM credits. The destruction of the compound was later confused as an alternative ending to the film.It is well-known by now that the making of Apocalypse Now was fraught with trauma. Sheen had a heart attack, the Philippine locations were politically and meteorologically unstable and Coppola was reportedly in a paranoid coke frenzy to name a few. Somehow it only makes the grandiosity of the end result all the more impressive.George Lucas was originally set to direct Apocalypse Now based on a screenplay by John Milius. Lucas's initial plan was to shoot the movie as a faux-documentary on location in South Vietnam while the war was still in progress. Coppola who was to be the executive producer tried to get the film made as part of a production deal with Warner Bros. but the deal fell through and Coppola went on to direct The Godfather (1972). By the time both men had enough clout to get the film made, Saigon had fallen and Lucas was making Star Wars (1977). Milius had no interest in directing the film and Lucas gave Coppola his blessing to direct the film himself.Originally scheduled to be shot over six weeks, the filming ended up taking 16 months. The cow slaughter in the climactic scene is real. According to the editor Walter Murch, it took nearly 2 years to edit the movie with an average of less than one cut per day.Apocalypse Now can be either seen as a stunning work of cinema - or a mixed bag of raw excess and ambition.HATCHED IN AGONY AND REDEEMED BY RECKLESS SHARDS OF CINEMATIC BRILLIANCE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

It's very difficult to describe, everything is so surreal it's hard to categorise further than a psychological war film. It's a little slow to begin with, and the part with the French takes a bit from the building atmosphere, but the last half hour is so gripping, it makes it all worth it.

"A Story about War, Law and Insanity","Apocalypse Now is one of the single most sad and enjoyable movies I've ever seen. This is a story set in the Vietnam War. The characters all feel like real people that were put into a horrifying situation. This feels so real because this actually did happen in real life. This film opens your eyes about the horror of war and what drives people insane. It also laughs at the idea of trying to call one action murder when everyone in this war was killing unnecessarily. This movie is shot beautifully and has some of the best action ever recorded. The focus is never on the action during action scenes, it's on the people. You'll often see bodies casually laying on the ground as if nobody is effected by it. This is extremely present when they meet the villain, but you realize there's no difference between the corpses at the Villain's temple and the corpses in the burned villages, the idea of calling murder of one justified and the murder of another evil is just not a line you can always determine in war.

"Disturbing, real, dark and excellent","For starters i'd like to address the people who give this movie a 1/10 purely because they dislike the redux version, i haven't seen it and i don't want to but whats the point of taking it out on the original which is in my opinion the best movie ever made, just because you don't like another version doesn't mean you have to rate it awful and had the redux not been released or at least had it received it's own IMDb page i think apocalypse now would comfortably fit into the top 10.Now for the review, the intro to this film completely sets the tone, it has a somber and disturbing feel and this is definitely helped by the song 'the end' by 'the doors'. When the napalm hits that tree-line you know you aren't in for your typical Vietnam war film no, this is something much more, a story of prejudice and curiosity which will take captain Willard (Martin sheen) into a world of despair and one that will question his confidence in normal civilization, and raises the question 'what will he find when he reaches Col. Kurtz' ?The dialogue in this film is just great, it has one of the most haunting monologues in film history acted perfectly by the legend Marlon Brando. It includes narration by martin sheen that takes us on a journey through the jungle, although we really don't know much about the characters' backgrounds apart form colonel Kurtz, since we hear first hand his dossier throughout the first half of the film. The cinematography is great and will deeply absorb you into the plot, this is particularly evident when we finally see kurtz, we do not see his face much just glimpses and so in the few parts when we clearly see, it is a frightening face.We get a true portrayal of war here, the grit, the horrors and the damage it caused to not only the Vietnamese people but that damage it caused to the American soldiers. This does not make war look fun, like some other movies nor does it follow the cliché agenda of a hero and a villain, we do not know who the villain is nor who the hero is.If you go into this expecting just a fast paced war film then do not watch you will be disappointed go watch fury instead, this film will take you on a journey that will be impossible to forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Over-rated film,"Although this film may have been impressive for its time, it is comparable to a B-movie by today's standards.  If you want more realistic war movies from similar genre, there's Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, Born on the Fourth of July.  The first 2/3 of Apocalypse Now is not bad at all, however the last 1/3 and ending were just littered with poorly thought-out, cheap B-movie production qualities.  Because this is a war movie, there obviously has to be a lot of dead bodies.  Well, the dead bodies all over the ground were all fresh and clean, as if they were all washed with soap and preservatives after they died.  Humans have buried (or burned) dead bodies for a reason, and yet the townsfolk appear to intentionally litter their community with the bodies of their dead victims (again, all clean and fresh) like expensive furniture.  I can go on but it's not even worth my time to comment further.  I give this movie a 6/10 for a spectacular 2/3 beginning and horrible 1/3 ending.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now is a weird movie,"In all fairness, this film can certainly be exciting when watching for the first time (whether you're familiar with its inspiration Heart of Darkness or not), as the movie is all the way to the end filled with great suspense, but ultimately the film's ending does not deliver what the suspense promised, except weirdness.This movie well illustrates why 'war movie' is such an ambiguous term. The Vietnam war is the backdrop, but barely any authentic military operations are depicted. The characters are caricatures and over the top.To that effect, as a fan of more realistic war movies, I somehow ended up feeling a bit cheated about having spent my time watching Apocalypse Now. It is a piece of art, with many beautiful and haunting images, but it is not ""a war movie"" to the sense I would like that term to have.The IMDB rating therefore is a bit high for my taste.

A classic (plus why I would recommend sticking with the theatrical version),"First time I've finally got round to watching the theatrical version! Only had access to the Redux version before, which I know I'd watched at least a couple of times, and it did always feel a bit too long. Comparatively, this version might even feel a little fast paced, but when considered independently from its very long alternate version, I think it feels mostly right. Not sure I'll ever be in the mood to watch the other version - the Final Cut - but never say never I guess.Can't remember as many synths in the score in the Redux version, so maybe the music was different in that, as another difference besides the obvious length? Although it's been a while, so I might be misremembering.Other than that... there's not much more to say about Apocalypse Now that hasn't already been said. It's messy and not quite a flat out masterpiece, but it often works because of some of its rough qualities. It's an unhinged movie, threatening to fall apart at any moment. You could even argue it does, in the climax, when it starts to meander and stop and start... but it kind of works when considering that that's the point in the story when the madness of the characters is at its strongest and all that.Apocalypse Now is beautifully shot, has lots of memorable performances by many actors who are only in a scene or two, and containing many, many images and scenes that will stick with you for better or worse, it's easy to understand why it's is so highly regarded.As a sidenote: have always felt bad for Martin Sheen getting listed third in the cast behind Brando and Duvall.

A masterpiece - one of the greatest movies ever made,"A masterpiece - one of the greatest movies ever made.Vietnam, 1967. An elite soldier, Captain Willard (played by Martin Sheen), is sent on a top secret mission to ""terminate with extreme prejudice"" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Colonel Kurtz is a US Army officer who has apparently gone insane and is fighting his own war from within Cambodia with an army of native soldiers. To find Kurtz, Willard sets off down the river on a patrol boat...Searingly brilliant. As a story alone this movie is fantastic. Superb plot with some iconic scenes (eg Ride of the Valkyries), great, quotable dialogue (eg Napalm in the morning, The Horror) and some very funny lines (""Charlie don't surf!"").Director Francis Ford Coppola expertly builds the tension. The movie starts off quite light-heartedly - the first third or so of the movie is quite funny, especially anything involving Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall). It is actually over-the-top funny (eg surfing in the middle of a fire fight), which might seem strange but shows you the insanity of war and soldiers at war, and prepares you for what comes later.As the movie goes on it becomes much darker. Coppola slowly tightens the rope around the viewer's neck, until the intensity is suffocating. By the end you're in the middle of a nightmare, a hell on earth. This demonstrates the slow progression from balanced soldier to insane maniac.So many deeper issues tackled along the way: the duality of man, good vs evil, the morality of war and why the US lost in Vietnam.Excellent performances from Sheen, Brando and Duvall. Duvall received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance. Good support from a cast that includes Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Laurence Fishburne.One thing: regarding the Redux version (the 2001 director's cut which included 43 extra minutes), its add-on scenes are of mixed value. Some are great - anything involving Colonel Kilgore / Robert Duvall is definitely a win as his character is comedy gold. Some parts of the French plantation scene are very useful, and give you a clue to where the US is going with the war and why they will lose it, but some of it feels like padding. The entire Medevac scene (with the Playboy bunnies) is unnecessary.So a bit hit-and-miss. Overall the extra scenes probably enhance the movie, slightly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Martin Sheen's character does not desend into madness as I think was intended - he is already there from the beginning.  I think the film would much more powerful if we saw this change in him as he got sucked deeper and deeper into the Heart of Darkness as the film progresses.  As it is, it is hard to identify with or relate to any of the characters.  I think some people like the ambiguity of the film, but I suspect that ambiguity stems from the divergent political viewpoints of the writers, Milius and Coppola, as opposed to it being carefully and purposely structured into the story.  Having said all that, it is quite an impressive piece of work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

My Redux Review.,"Apocalyse Now has been something that a lot of movie critics have been banging on about for a while! In fact they go on about it so much that they actually end up killing some of its magic I feel. Although it should be something that should be watched by every movie lover the truth was that I was putting of watching it for quite a while. Reasons ranged from me being young and not understanding it well enough to me not really liking war movies that much. However I came across a really cheap DVD copy of it some time ago and thought might as well give it shot. One should keep in mind that this is the review of the redux movie and not the original Copella film version. What I can say is that I understand why this movie won a few awards , I mean Martin Sheen is just plain cool and it is a joy watching him undertaking this journey into madness as well as the creepy but yet enthralling philosophical Brando. The whole movie is like conducting some sort classical music - loud and flamboyant one minute then calm and serene the other ! What I also just loved about it was that the scenes matched wonderfully with the music and thusly creating some sort of magical method of drawing one into its world. The lighting, colouring actually the whole way that the movie was shot actually showed us a trip into the jaws of hell , in which one hangs on for dear sanity but feels completely disconnected from the world around him and that is what I felt that Apocalyse Now is really all about. The down side about Apocalyse Now Redux is that it is a little way too long and does require a solid frame of mind view , one just like Martin Sheen has 'want' it to enjoy it. Although the movie uses visuals and colours nicely it just sometimes drags on a little to far which might cause one to lose interest in it I mean I understand it is a build up to a big climax but it should keep you building towards that and not sway away. To conclude I am glad I finally got a chance to see Apocalyse Now , although it might not have been the original but I am glad I got to see it , because to me it was not really a movie focusing on a war but a movie focusing on the horror of war and the madness it brings with it. As a wise man said 'war is only good to those who have not tasted it', so I would say check it out and draw your own conclusion , I am glad I finally got round to it.APOCALYSE NOW : REDUX - 8.3 OUT OF 10The Horror...The Horror...",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now; This is the way the world ends,"Capt. Willard is sent on a mission in Vietnam to kill a man named Kurtz whose methods in the war became 'unsound'. Kurtz is a former officer who settled himself somewhere in Cambodia on the end of the Nung River, deep in the jungle. This film follows Capt. Willard on his seemingly endless journey on the Nung River that leads to the Colonel. On his journey Willard slowly becomes absorbed by Kurtz' life story and especially, his philosophy. Director Brian de Palma shows his true excellence in filming this trip; it is everything that film is supposed to be. It is full of tension and the dialogs are unforgettable. Not to mention the last 30 minutes of the film, which is to me the best ending to a film I have ever seen. When Kurtz (Brando) starts his monologue about the inoculated children, I sizzled. It was just great. The intriguing thing is that if you take your time to absorb the dialogs then you slowly start to comprehend what Kurtz had gone through. Apocalypse Now is definitely a work of art.About the Redux version; many people are not pleased with the added scenes. Partly I agree, since why would we change something what is already perfect? On the other hand, the extra scenes are interesting when you concentrate on them; at least, that is what I think.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

THE GREATEST,"The greatest war movie ever - the helicopter attack is still one of the great set pieces in cinema history, Robert Duvall with one of the most quoted lines in cinema history, and a film that captures the overriding insanity that war is propelled by and generates. Martin Sheen's performance has always been undervalued in this film - he is the heart of the movie, as he his dragged further and further into the nightmare of Vietnam - he is a professional solider, a special forces officer but even he is overwhelmed by the chaos caused by Kurtz in what was the hidden war on the Cambodian border. Sheen is a great actor and vividly portrays a character who has been finally been submerged by the horror and brutality of the American policy towards the Vietnam conflict. Brando is on a different planet, but that is the intention, given Kurtz has become completely removed mentally from the war around him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Goof,"I would like to submit the following goof.During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen wading out in the river, asking to be taken away and seeking to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases. Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone. They have duffel bags, packs and footlockers but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping. Additionally, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water. This is probably a very good indication that it is empty,otherwise it would sink.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The war is not only fought on the field but also in the shadows,"Apocalypse Now is a Vietnam War masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola.The good. This is an other one of those movie you could list everything here. Once again, I'll just mention what makes it special. The impeccable photography, the viscerally poignant visuals, and the incredible score perfectly emphasize the dark chilling gloom of the situation, the sense of impending doom. The story is a solid tale that exposes the twisted nature of the conflict. The long and slow scenario really lets you sink into the morass faced by the main character, like feeling a centipede crawl across your skin. Unexpected events popup all the time.The actors. Martin Sheen shines and quietly shows his talent as the tortured special force soldier sent on a mission of a lifetime. Robert Duvall is the perfect blustery unshakable commander. Marlon Brando displays all his talent as he portrays a genius commander gone mad. An extremely young and unrecognizable Laurence Fishburne already shows us his potential. And finally, Harrison Ford, fresh from Star Wars, plays a small role as a colonel.The bad. Nothing.The ugly. Nothing.The result.

The Redux is an Education!,"The original cinema release of Apocalypse Now was close to perfection. One of the all time great war movies dealing with Vietnam. The Redux, is twice as good. Many of the ""lost"" or ""removed"" scenes are controversial. Other scenes are beautifully shot if not add to the original story that was Vietnam. Many of the removed scenes add to Brando and Sheen's character as more of their story is told to the audience. An interesting scene that last for 15 minutes and was taken out entirely was the dinner scene at the French quarters. Here, we see native French ""citizens"" who refuse to leave Vietnam. Others in the group want to go and fear that much of the French influenced countries are being lost. Very political, the scene takes away from the overall violence that makes up Apocalypse Now. Still, the scene is great and adds to the story of why America was in the war to begin with. A great scene, and only one of the many reasons to check out the Redux version.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Important film,"I really liked this film. It was different from your average war movie. It seems to me that a lot of war movies glorify war. But apocalypse now sticks right in your face with all the insanity and you just realize that war really is demented.There are some long sequences people get bored with, but they were interesting to me.I don't think apocalypse now is the most exciting or entertaining film, but i think its an important war film like a classic anti war book.My history teacher told us in high school, we should all see this movie. I agree, and so i give it a ten on the basis that its an important film in our society. I also have to say that the visual effects are excellent and the special effects are O.K. The original music scores aren't very good, but they set the mood well. They make the setting very creepy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse then,"Francis Ford Coppola was at the height of his powers when he decided to make his gramatically-challenged film 'Apocalypse Now', which pivots around the brilliant idea of using Joseph Conrad's novel 'Heart of Darkness', about Kurtz, a capable and idealistic colonialist gone mad in deepest Africa, as a metaphor for the Vietnam war.  It should also have been the first major American film to address that difficult subject, but it was subject to numerous, infamous delays in production and was not finished until 1979, by which time other films (like 'The Deer Hunter' or, indirectly, 'Taxi Driver') had already addressed the same subject.  What remains is a wildly ambitious film of vast scope, full of astonishing images but possessed of a certain fundamental silliness in a way that 'The Deer Hunter', for example, completely avoids.  Having read the book since I first saw the film, however, one surprising discovery is that the incoherence and relative absence of closure, which some may consider faults, actually derive from the source material.Viewed solely as cinema, 'Apocalypse Now' is a flawed but original, thought-provoking and and highly distinctive piece of film.  But it's also interesting in terms of where it fits into the (by now, very well defined) genre of Vietnam movies.  The classic narrative now avoids the political question (should the war have been fought?) to concentrate on the hardships of the (mainly working class) young soldiers whose misfortune was to have to fight it.  'Apocalypse Now', although not overtly political itself, is arguably a stronger film than most, because it does not allow its protagonists to escape personal responsibility for their actions: the draftees may have been victims, but they were perpetrators too, and the film recognises the duality.  However, this does not make it a peacenik anti-war flick.  Coppola cleverly borrows the ambivalence that Marlowe, Conrad's narrator, has towards Kurtz, for his own narrator Willard.  Willard's (and Kurtz's) hatred of the war as is manifests itself in split emotions, one peaceable and the other hostile, the urge to destroy, to kill, to fight hard and with ""clarity"" of purpose - rather like the Viet Kong - with the implication that this way the war could have been won.  This double psychology is central to the mood of the whole story, and is a convincing mindset for these two professional soldiers.  But perhaps also serves to make the film slightly more palatable to its domestic audience, allowing the viewer to take away the message of their choice.  Another observation is that the portrayal of the ""natives"" is scarcely more advanced than it was in Conrad's book - the Vietnamese appear as little more than romantic savages, and others have commented how the largely uninhabited jungles through which Willard travels ignore the reality of densely populated Vietnam.  As with 'Heart of Darkness', 'Apocalypse Now' is best seen as a fable, that asks questions about the behaviour of supposedly civilised men, but which operates within terms of reference that the same men would recognise.The final word must be on Marlon Brando, who is surely the perfect embodiment of the enigmatic Kurtz.  His is a great performance, though it doesn't last long - a shame, for he holds the screen with a quiet brilliance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Awesome & Epic,"This movie installed a great love and respect in my soul for what our soldiers went through. I am a vet myself, The movies' realistic pyros and Philipino back ground setting was the real life visual of the Vietnam setting. The back stories that were built, the character craft that was developed is phenomenal. Martin Sheen's heart attack while on the set was a bit of a set back, you think he would call it quits, but no, that Cuban blood that flows through his body did not allow him to give up. How do I know he is part Cuban, my dad knew his dad from Cuba. That's why he was a perfect actor for the movie ""The Believers"". All I can say to the characters and the real soldiers, WELCOME HOME..

I am unsure of how to begin because of how stunned I am by it. Okay, let's give this a try...A soldier in the Vietnam War is assigned a mission to find and assassinate a former Green Beret turned cult leader. That's basically the plot. It seems interesting enough already, but oh boy, does it get better: the two leads are Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando, it's directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and everything revolves around ""The End"" by the Doors.Although everything in the film is very interesting, the ending is... well, it's a hell of a something.

Of course photography and sound deserved the oscars they got but what about best picture, best screenplay? I saw Kramer VS. Kramer and I thought it was decent but nowhere near as powerful as this. I'm only about 14 and still I love this movie and if I show it to anyone else my age that I know, they will think it's long, boring, and pointless.

This Movie Isn't About Vietnam; It IS Vietnam,"Francis Ford Coppola's extraordinary Vietnam film is deeply flawed, but in this case the flaws feel so right for the subject matter that they almost make the movie better.This movie is a perfect marrying of source material and directorial vision. Setting Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" against the backdrop of the Vietnam jungles is brilliant, and the dark odyssey of Martin Sheen's character is so nightmarish, feverish and sweaty that this movie feels more like it IS Vietnam than merely ABOUT Vietnam.With a number of memorable appearances, notably Robert Duvall as a war-hungry Army officer glorying in the carnage around him; Dennis Hopper as a drugged out photojournalist who's lost his mind to the jungle; and, perhaps most memorable for its pure weirdness, Marlon Brando as Kurtz, the officer who's gone missing and has fashioned himself as a dark God amongst the primitive natives.The movie totally loses its way toward the end, but that somehow feels right.Recommendation: Don't watch the redux version if you can avoid it. It's yet further proof that directors usually have good instincts and that what they initially cut from their movies should remain cut.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Really good and really, really, really long...","Really long movie just got longer!  I must have checked my watch in disbelief about 15 times.  And it's not like I hadn't seen the original several times.  I remember saying at one point, ""I think it's getting close to wrapping up,"" and seeing that it had only been one hour and seven minutes (out of three hours and fifteen minutes).  And now I unleash this really long review upon you.  Happy mulling.Nevertheless, would you believe that I loved it, too?  I was blown away! ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of my favorite movies and it is now even more so.True, it's not the most uplifting of movies.  But, obviously, it's not supposed to be.And, while most of the ideas bandied about are very interesting and compelling, the truth is that the message of the movie is pretty unclear. Sure, we're all programmed to assume that wanton violence is meant to remind us that war is hell and inane military leaders are used to remind us that absolute power corrupts absolutely and that ANY Vietnam movie is meant to remind us that, while war is bad, Vietnam was REALLY bad.  But what does ""Apocalypse Now"" really mean?One of the interesting aspects of the film is how appealing each of the main characters is and (as they dominate the screen) how sensible their ideologies sound:WILLARD-""Bent"" but likeable, (even more so in REDUX).  Pretty much a cypher, though.  Most everything is ""done unto"" him (even his hand is forced in the climactic killing of Kurtz) but still a compelling ""Ishmael"" to guide us on our Odyssey.IDEOLOGY- This war is bulls***.  We shouldn't be here.  Though billed by the government and the press as such, this war is not sane or decent.  It is hell!  The charges against Kurtz are bogus.  Kurtz's actions are inevitable in an environment so insane.  Nevertheless, if my orders are to kill him than that's what I'm gonna do.  Plus I'll kill anyone that gets in my way of doing so (however innocent).  Orders are orders.CORMAN(The Lieutenant-General that commissions Willard's mission)- His monologue about the dark side sometimes winning out over what Lincoln called, ""the better angels of our nature"" is one of he film's best.  He sounds sensible and sympathetic as he decrees that Kurtz must be terminated. His reservation is palpable.  Even his homey directions regarding passing the food both ways to save time add to his multi-dimensional (however short) role.IDEOLOGY-We are going to win this war and we are going to do it because God and our government require us to do the right thing even though it may require much sacrifice.  While we must fight in this war, we must remain faithful to the guidelines of conduct established by the US Military and to the mores given us by God.KILGORE-Psycho but absolutely charismatic.  A complete idiot who was born for this conflict and laments the fact that ""someday this war's gonna end"". He loves his men and loves this war.IDEOLOGY-I like to kill!  I also like to surf!  I love my good ol' American boys and I'm gonna watch over them and make sure that them damn gooks don't hurt 'em and if they do...God help 'em.KURTZ-Beautiful and brilliant.  His description of the Ohio river and the plantation that looked like ""heaven had fallen on the earth in the form of gardenias"" and his recounting of the VC reaction to the inoculation of their babies are enthralling.  ""I cried...I cried like some grandmother.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I wanted to tear my teeth out.""  I could listen to him muse forever.  You can see why Hopper's character was so enamoured with him.  And yet, there is no doubt, that Kurtz is absolutely insane. And not in a glorified, ""so close to God he's crazy"" way either.  We're talking murderously psychotic.IDEOLOGY:  We can not win this war or any other unless we truly unleash our id (on command) and become primeval killing animals (just as the VC does). Our problem, then is not that we are fighting this war but that we're not doing it well enough.NOTE:  The restored love scene (complete with psychotic ""Fantasy Island"" music) with the French woman also carries this point home.  ""You are two people: a lover and a killer, a god and a beast."" (paraphrase)As is the case in any great movie, each of these parts is played as if the actors truly believe in their roles and in the ideologies that motivate their characters.  The problem is that all these conflicting ideologies are directed as if Coppola truly believes them all to be true too.  As you watch ""Apocalypse Now"", you can't help but utter that banal statement we've all caught ourselves saying, ""Hm, this movie is important.""  But, at the same time, you have to ask yourself, ""Now, what the hell does it mean?""Of course, as will always be the case with the enigmatic, the question is: Is it truly ambiguous or am I just an idiot?  And then, if it is ambiguous, is that a strength, weakness, or both?I think (if possible) it is both.I guess when you come right down to it ""Apocalypse Now"" is what Vietnam must have been: terrifying and confusing.  In that respect it will always be one of the best and most indelible portrayals of this war.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

It'll take you out there.,"Capt. Willard: ""They told me that you had gone... totally insane... and that your methods were unsound.""Col. Kurtz: ""Are my methods unsound?""Capt. Willard: ""I don't see... any methods... at all, sir.""Ah, Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite war film of all time.Coming from the huge success of The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II, Francis Coppola was offered the possibility to direct a big-budget epic about the Vietnam war. Did I say big-budget and about the Vietnam war? Ok, I have come up with only a couple of statements and there is something to say already. While the planned budget for the film was undoubtedly large, the process of filming it was a true Odyssey; endless problems, including but not limited to a typhoon that destroyed most of the sets, difficulties with the authorities of the Philippines (where the film was shot), and personal problems with the actors and the crew, brought the costs sky high, and the shooting process from the scheduled six weeks up to 16 months. In case you are interested, there is a 1991 documentary titled Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse that is said to narrate the incredible adventure that the making of the film was, and how Coppola himself at the end was almost physically, financially and psychologically devastated. Sadly, I have not been able to see the aforementioned documentary, but it must be definitely worth a look if you are a fan of Coppola or filmmaking in general.While Apocalypse Now's context is strongly related to the Vietnam war, its ambitions are higher and its implications much broader: it is not simply an opera about Vietnam, it is an adventure in human insanity where war is only part of it. Perhaps the most interesting quality of the film is that, far more than any other war movies I have seen, it works perfectly on multiple levels; on a more immediate level, it is a depiction of the struggles, the bad judgments, and the madness of the battlefield. On further analysis, it is a metaphorical, visceral adventure into the depths of the darkest side of the human mind, a trip that's most definitely open to many different interpretations and opinions. Of course, like in every masterpiece, the two layers complement each other perfectly and reflect one another, building a memorable picture of intense emotional power. Simply put, Apocalypse Now successfully goes where other popular war movies such as Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket fail to go, or more realistically (pun somewhat intended) just don't have the ambition to go.Apocalypse Now liberally adapts Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, transplanting it into the chaos of the Vietnam war circa 1969. The main character is Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) of US Army Intelligence. Willard has already carried out ""assassinations"" for the Government and is, his own way, almost a war victim; he is alive, but he feels soulless, and his perspective for a regular life seems lost forever -- especially after the divorce from his wife, which he blames for the greater part on himself. In Saigon, he is handed a mission. Out there in Cambodia, the former outstanding officer Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) has stopped following the orders and is now conducting his own personal, ferocious war with his own army, who apparently worship him like a god; he is operating ""beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct"" and, as General R. Corman (G.D. Spradlin) informs Willard, his command must be terminated. Kurtz must be terminated. With extreme prejudice. Willard will have to track the Colonel by riding a small boat upriver with a few soldiers, then kill him. A long dossier on Kurtz is handed to Willard so that he'll be able to understand what is going on in Kurtz's mind.Perhaps one of the most memorable characters in Apocalypse Now is William Kilgore (Robert Duvall), the loud-mouthed Colonel whose orders are to transport and escort Willard and his boat crew for a brief period. Kilgore is just about the complete opposite of Kurtz, but he is almost as scary. The famous sequence where he orders to play Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries during an air raid is without a doubt an immortal piece of cinema, and the same can be said about his infamous quote, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning... It smells like... victory.""Speaking of memorable scenes, there are so many that I just don't know where to begin; the film is visually a real tour de force. The opening, with The Door's ""The End"" playing while we are witnessing the destruction of a portion of jungle, sets the mood with apocalyptic undertones that will only grow stronger as the movie progresses; the near-riot caused by a Playboy show plays like a dream sequence, and seems to underline the progressive detachment from sanity and rational thoughts; the tragic consequences of the boat's crew incompetence in dealing with a simple canoe is a heartbreaking moment where personal regret and the horror of amoral choices come stronger than ever. Probably most riveting of all are the shocking images of an army without commanding officer and completely on the loose in a remote outpost.The pacing is perfect. As we crawl along the river, we experience an ever-deepening spiral into darkness, madness, and seemingly unreal events; the conduction of war is taking wrong turns on all parts and Willard is progressively descending into mental instability. Like Kurtz, Willard is appalled by the incompetence and the horror surrounding him; the boat crew is slowly killed off one by one.Col. Kurtz's compound is, quite literally, the end of the river: the last stage of madness, or the ultimate bowel of hell on Earth. And yet, it is strangely fascinating. Kurtz is part demon, part prophet. He has, quite simply, stopped questioning the morality of his choices and now lives and acts following the rules of the jungle. In many ways, Kurtz represents Willard's inner demon, and the final scene where Willard has to become Kurtz to get rid of him and what he represents is, in my opinion, absolutely outstanding.The acting is excellent on all parts. Martin Sheen's restrained performance perfectly fits the emotionally disrupted Capt. Willard, and his voice-over does not feel obtrusive or grow boring. Marlon Brando is great as the man whose soul has hit rock bottom, Kurtz, and Robert Duvall offers what is possibly his best performance to date (ok, together with The Godfather). The supporting cast (that includes Frederic Forrest, Dennis Hopper, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, and Sam Bottoms) never fails.One particular mention goes to the soundtrack. The mix of rock tunes and atmospheric sounds works in a magnificent way creating a mix of real/surreal that's been rarely matched in the history of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Words cant describe it, but I will try","Ill try not to overly praise this movie, but its very difficult. I'm infatuated with it. The cinematography can't be put into words, its the single greatest motion picture achievement these eyes have seen.No need to get into plot details here. If you haven't seen the movie and you're here reading this, you've read the hype already. People will preach to you about how this is an anti-war movie or an anti-Nam movie. These are the narrow-minded and short-sighted who fail to see the big picture. Thats not to say they're wrong, but they're missing the point. This movie is a commentary on humanity, not one short function of life known as war.Its not the violence of war that throws Kurtz off the deep end. The war simply provides as a backdrop. Society and human nature is the culprit here. Coppola is not attempting to show us the horror of war, hes showing us the horror of man's violent nature.Back to the movie itself. I've noticed my favorite films all have narrations by the main character (Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, American Beauty are some examples). This movie tops them all in that aspect. Coppolla uses the narration and psyche of Willard to create and detail the character of Kurtz.We only know of Kurtz that Willard knows, and the suspense is amazing. No one can watch this movie and not be drawn to this character.Along the way we are taken through hell on the banks of a river. One cant help but wonder what would cause humans to behave in such a way or subject themselves to such conditions. My example here is the bridge scene. You have a group of human beings in a world of s**t. Their existence has been reduced to nothing. They are only there to kill VC's. Their once normal lives back home no longer exist. They are too deep to ever go back.I bought the Redux version of this film, and I think it makes the original seem more perfect. Every scene that was cut didn't belong. These scenes offered us a more personal look at Willard, and offers more compassion towards him as having a human side (when he steals the surfboard or gets close to the French woman). I personally prefer the cold, stoic character I came to know from the original. It gives the film a darker sense and does more for me. Had the movie been released in Redux, i doubt id feel the same way about it. Kudos to Coppola for knowing what to remove.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A landmark work of filmmaking.,"This iconic motion picture can be summed up in a single phrase: A descent into Hell. In essence, the sum total of the Vietnam War. It begins as a relatively bland exploration of life in the military in those days, more specifically in the life of a single soldier, given the distasteful task of the elimination of a rogue officer. Then it immediately, inexorably morphs into an abundant panorama of the horrors that characterized the horrors of that tragic and unnecessary conflict. The director, a superb Francis Ford Coppola, wisely relies on intense visual imagery to tell the story, instead of using the heavy-handed moralizing or storytelling so liberally used in most depictions of war, allowing the ever changing landscape to reveal this soldier's tale of both inner confusion and his unflinching, rigid implementation of military code. In his incredible use of the filmmaker's art, Coppola gradually develops a sense of fear and dread unseen in previous war films, epitomized by the final appearance of an incredible Marlon Brando in one of the most memorable and controversial roles of his career.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""The Horror"" (literally)","An intensely cynical and horrific portrayal of militarism, its delight in destruction, and its profound hypocrisy.Here's my breakdown:STORY:

A dystopian criticism against all wars.,"Francis Ford Coppola played the sorcerer's apprentice in this movie but, contrary to what happened with the legendary apprentice, the magic went very well. But this film is not about reality or the real Vietnam War. We may regard it as a parody or a joke, but I think its deeper than that, its a statement of the director's opinion regarding the war, in particular Vietnam. And Coppola's statement is crystal clear: war was a total disaster where thousands of Americans died in vain and any war is always the apocalypse. Coppola wanted to give the public a view of this through this movies and we can prove this not only by the shocking graphic violence that punctuates it but also by the dystopic form as the conflict is portrayed and narrated. This way of facing the war is also evident in some of the dialogues. Its as if the war transformed the human being into the worst and raw of the animals, according to Coppola's mind. At first, the film was largely softened with various cuts but, recently, a DVD with an extended version appeared on the market. I understand the reasons: at the time, Vietnam was a hot topic, Coppola wanted to raise awareness and show what he thought about it but he might not want to hurt social morality. But today things are different. The scenes with the Playboy bunnies, however, seem to be left in the film, though they look as animalistic as the soldiers, as if they were objects and not real women.The film features an extraordinary Marlon Brando (for me, it is his best film after ""The Godfather"") and a good Martin Sheen, alongside Robert Duvall (who would specialize in action films and hard characters), Laurence Fishburne , Harrison Ford (still far from stardom), Dennis Hopper and Scott Glenn. All the actors have been quite well. The film has a constantly very heavy environment and the combat scenes were filmed quite realistically. I know some older people who have been at war (not in Vietnam but in Portuguese Africa) and cannot stand it because they feel again at war and awakens traumatic memories. So I'll leave the warning: if you cannot handle violent movies, if you're sensitive, suggestible or underage, do not watch this movie. Giving good advice never hurts, does it?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This is/shouldn't be entertainment,"""I love the smell of napalm in the morning,"" is such a famous quote most audiences forget everything else about the famous war drama Apocalypse Now. While I was in film school, the film was made a subject of study; part of the course's curriculum was to show the first fifteen minutes of classics in hopes that students would clammer to the library to rent DVD copies and finish their education on their own. Alas, I was uninspired to watch the rest of this Vietnam drama, although I knew it was among the most famous.Perhaps it's because we lost the war, or perhaps it's because many liberals who were so angry about it in the first place found their way to Hollywood to make their statements, but I've yet to find a Vietnam War movie that I can classify in the realm of entertainment. As it was Marlon Brando's highlighted week on Hot Toasty Rag, I felt compelled to watch the rest of this very long movie, and I turned it off twice, only rallied by my best friend to continue the journey. I complained to her that the film's attitude towards the soldiers was smug. Robert Duvall's projection of a war mongering ""Patton-esque"" commanding officer strutted about and puffed his feathers - so obviously making the point that he was a ""rotten person"". In countless scenes, young soldiers are seen goofing off, listening to the radio, trying to get Playmate of the Month girls into bed. One boy admits to dropping acid and isn't on his right mind to be on alert. In two instances, men are firing upon ""the enemy"" only to be discovered that they have no commanding officer, no orders, and have merely gone out of their minds from the war.Obviously, there are lots of people who loved this movie (my best friend included). I just couldn't get past the self-righteous tone that seemed to say, ""Aren't we realistic? War is so awful, isn't it, and the only ones who actually try to be good soldiers are sadistic monsters? Isn't this message deep?"" There's one scene where a soldier gets killed and while his friends are weeping over his body, we hear a voice over of his mother's last letter to him, trying to make the audience feel terrible that a young boy was needlessly killed. But, as Anthony Hopkins so perfectly stated in Legends of the Fall, ""He was a soldier, and soldiers die!"" Yes, it's sad when a man gets killed; but if he was a soldier, it shouldn't be unexpected. The entire scene felt, once again, that the filmmakers were pushing their agendas on the audience.My friend also likes similar classics Full Metal Jacket and Platoon, so if your tastes match hers, you probably really like Apocalypse Now. I don't like all three. I don't find it entertainment to see desolate, despondent circumstances for the sole purpose of making the audience feel a smug satisfaction that they also opposed the war. I don't find it entertainment to show a cow getting hacked to bits by machetes, and I maintain that effective war movies can be made without being so gruesome. Every WWII movie made during the time had to abide by the Production Code, and they managed to be violent, upsetting, and realistic all the same.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. In nearly every scene, the camera swirls around to follow helicopters or fast war action. In particular, about 2.5 hours in, after Martin Sheen says, ""If I was still alive, it was because he wanted it that way,"" the camera spins upside down a few times, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look Mom!""

A Movie to Experience!,"Coppola represented the harrowing experience of Vietnam War through the story or rather the movie's theme itself. The classy yet intense editing, the beautiful yet upsetting cinematography, and the fluid yet disturbing camera movements and shots, all have a major role in conveying the message of the movie. The violence could have been more powerful and gritty, but that's not what Coppola wanted, he wanted to show the horror of war by depicting it as an annoying and irritating experience.Unfortunately, the movie could have been way better. There are many sub-plots that could have been used in a way that adds to the main plot by emphasizes on the moral dilemma of the movie. That's exactly what made the ending falls flat, at least for me. Instead of being one of the greatest endings ever, I found it kinda cheesy!(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

About the war,"Apocalypse Now is an excellent film. Like other -specially about Vietnam-, I don't think is a war movie. Its a movie that deeply reflects on war brutality. At this point, I see Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Martin Sheen at their very best. This detail also make a huge difference with ""Heart of Darkness"", the novel of Conrad. I'm pretty sure that ""Apocalypse Now"" should be remembered for the reflection without concessions on all the war stuff. Of course, is not a commercial movie.

The Redux spoiled the original,"I love the original Apocalypse Now, this is the Francis Coppola movie I saw, I love the director immediately. 20 years later, the Redux of AN came out, I was delighted to see some of the extra footages in it. But I had to say, I was disappointed, the Redux brought nothing to the movie except boredom, irrationality, and extreme length. The point of AN has gone and I felt like watching a complete mess. The scene Willard and his guys trade their fuel for bunnies is so ludicrous that made me laugh so hard, I paused a minute to calm myself down. The French Plantation scene was too long to watch, even though I have a long attention span, I still couldn't watch it through. After such loooooooong time, I totally lost my interest in seeing the Redux, I turned my TV off right before they got to Col.Kurtz. Francis Coppola cut out those scenes for good reasons and now he addded them again? I have to say this is my first time I was let down by Francis Ford Coppola.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now  - Vietnam being the perfect setting for the Heart of Darkness,"In contrast to the review by Donald J. Lamb from Philadelphia, PA I feel that Vietnam really was the perfect setting to re-render Conrad's The Heart of Darkness in the modern era. The point about US adventures in Vietnam - like European adventures in Africa in the late nineteenth century - was that the darkness at the heart of Vietnam/Cambodia (and Africa) was none other then the projected shadow of imperialism itself. As such it is an excellent war movie, showing the futility, degradation, and degenerative effects of war upon the psyche and cohesion of both individuals minds (soldiers, captains and generals) and communities (Cambodian villagers).Its use of the Door's ""The End"" in the napalm sequences testifies to the simple but terrifying truth about the nature of genocide, while the Wagner blaring from speakers placed on U.S. helicopters about to blow up a Vietnamese village is symbolic of the militaristic egotism with which the Calvary division take up their own act of genocide (reflecting the militaristic egotism of Wagner's own music and attitudes). The soldier surfing to the Stone's ""Satisfaction"" is - in relative terms - a light rendering of the frustrations, and delusions of denial suffered by GIs in the Vietnam war.It really is a great film - although Donald seems to have missed the point of it. Its not an expression about the directors madness, but about the collective madness, delusion and suffering that war brings about in ourselves (as conquerors) and others (as conquered). As Willard says (in the narrative) in the movie where the conquerors can go home, the conquered have only two choices, to die or to win.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Promising at a glimpse, but fails to deliver (Redux)","Never before has a film been spoken of in such high regard, but been so disappointing to view. Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is the most highly acclaimed film to explore the dark underside of the war in Vietnam. It takes the viewer on a mythological journey through the war torn jungles of southeast Asia, but fails miserably to deliver what it sets into motion. The film promises good performances from its actors, and it delivers in that regard. The cast is loaded with talent, most notably that of Robert Duvall. His characters' presence in the film is short in duration, but very moving. In the beginning (like ""Platoon""), ""Apocalypse Now"" seems to provide a glimpse into the psychological impact of an anarchic Vietnam on its wartime inhabitants. The film moves along nicely as Sheen journeys to find his imposter (Brando) who has concocted a dangerous cult following in the jungles of Cambodia. Several incidents along the way (again, like ""Platoon"") give the viewer insight into how unstable wartime conditions manipulate every mans psyche.Up until this point, I thought the film was quite good. However, it takes a horrific turn for the worse when Sheens men stumble upon a family of French aristocracy still residing in Cambodia. At this point, the film jumps into a scene of pretentious political and social discourse about American involvement in the war. This miserably long scene broke the continuity of the film, as well as my interest. Trying desperately to recover from this editing atrocity, I try to stay optimistic about the films' direction. Unfortunately, its continuity is further interrupted by another unnecessary scene involving fuel exchange for sex. Still thinking it would revive itself, I tried to stay as optimistic as possible.Finally, Sheen and his patrol boat reach the site of Brando's cult followers, and the film plunges into absolute absurdity. It now takes the form of a cheesy pseudo sci-fi thriller, and plummets past the point of anything remotely reasonable. Disappointed by direction and exhausted from unnecessary extended footage, I had to finish the film. Brando's mythical character is enveloped in stereotypical, horroresque camera shots. The film now basks in all that is predictable and unreasonable. For filmgoers who wish to have your experience handed to you on a silver platter, this is a must see. ""Apocalypse Now"" is ruined by blatant disregard for fluidity and reason. Any philosophical implications the film wishes to provide are drastically overshadowed by a painfully cheesy and predictable story. At the end, it seems as if Coppola had no direction for his story. The ending seems forced and unnatural. If you must view, please find the original cut, not the Redux version. Oh the horror...",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A timeless masterpiece!,"This is one of those iconic films that will linger in your memory for a lifetime! I first saw it at 19, just two years before I enlisted in the Army, and it was on a completely different level compared to the Fellini films I adored back then. It was raw and felt incredibly authentic!Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" draws inspiration from Joseph Conrad's novel ""Heart of Darkness,"" which tells the story of a European named Kurtz who ventures deep into the Congo and becomes a god-like figure. A boat is sent to find him, and as the narrator travels, he begins to lose faith in the stability of civilization; he feels the oppressive weight of the jungle surrounding him, a merciless Darwinian battleground where every creature fights daily to survive.Some scenes will stick with you for years, and there's a good reason for that! While many films are fortunate to have one memorable moment, ""Apocalypse Now"" delivers a series of unforgettable sequences, all connected by the river journey. One of the most striking is the helicopter assault on a Vietnamese village, led by Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), whose helicopters blast Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as they descend upon a yard filled with schoolchildren. It was pure chaos, and visually stunning!What the journey ultimately reveals isn't just about the protagonist; it's a profound realization that our lives and routines are a delicate facade precariously balanced above the relentless forces of nature that could consume us at any moment. A fulfilling life is merely a temporary escape from this truth.A timeless masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
GREATEST WAR MOVIE EVER !,THIS FILM WAS A MASTERPIECE THE GREATEST WAR FILM OF ALL TIME I ENJOYED THIS FILM FOR THE WHOLE 3 HOURS WAS JUST AMAZING. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IN THIS FILM WAS BEAUTIFUL.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The beauty... The beauty,"Continuing or streak of reviewing Coppola movies, we have Apocalypse Now, released in 1979. A film that, although not nearly as influential or beloved as the first two Godfathers, remains to many as one of the greatest movies of all time, and is, alongside Godfather 1 and 2, one of my personal favorite films of all time.The main thing that I love this movie is that, unlike a lot of other war stories, Apocalypse Now does a deep, but very memorable and interesting, portrayal of both sides of the war, with the vietnamese being serious, careful and armed to the teeth, whereas the americans are careless and sex-obsessed. This may initially seem kind of concerning and maybe offensive, but that´s until you realise that this was how these sides behaved back in the Vietnam War in real-life, so it´s not trying to deliberately be anti-american or pro-vietnam, but rather portraying them realistically in the context of the Vietnam War, with neither side being treated as in the wrong or right, further examplified by the fact that the vietnamese aren´t necessairly the main villains of the movie, but rather a mentally-disturbed american colonel named Walter E. Kurtz, (played amazingly once again by the great Marlon Brando), who during the war forms an empire who worships him and wages a guerrilla war against other american forces, showing not only how much war can change someone´s philosophy and ideology, whilst also documenting how much one man can affect the course of an international battle, but also showing that even the countries individually can turn against themselves and be their own enemies, something that´s never really explored in war movies today and back at the time.However, its themes and story aren´t the only things to love about the film, as there are plenty of iconic scenes, from the stage with the sexy female actors, to the helicopter strike scene, where they play Wagner´s ""Ride of the Valkyries"" on speakers, from the beginning scene, where the main character, Ben Willard (played by Martin Sheen of all people), arrives home exhausted but also depressed after he served his duty in the war, to the ending, where they say the classic ""... The horror ... the horror ..."" line. Nearly every scene is so nearly perfectly executed and worth remembering in their own way.And there are other things to love about this movie, such as the atmosphere, which is mostly dark and edgy, but occasionally colorful; the superb acting from almost every actor, with the main highlights being, again, Brando and Sheen; the soundtrack, with some music even coming from the north-american band The Doors; the loveable and memorable characters; and I could go on about why I love this movie so much, but I don´t really have much time right now.To conclude, Apocalypse Now, while nowhere near as excellent as The Godfather duology (I´ll get to the third one eventually), remains one of my favorite films of all time, due to it doing nearly everything in the book right, with the only flaws boiling down to minor nitpicks, much like a lot of Francis Ford Coppola´s filmography. It´s definitely the best war movie I´ve seen, and I highly recommend you check it out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I watched it that night and once the ending credits rolled I was shocked, then amazed.  THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!  Well, it more of a work of art than a movie.  Anyway the point Im getting to is that everyone I knew at school had never hear of Apocalypse Now! which I think is a real shame.  I think our genertaion needs to see this masterpiece.

The Horror,"Spent the last three morning workouts watching the redux version of this. Coppola inserted about 50 extra minutes for this 2001 rerelease. The longest segment, where Martin Sheen's Captain Willard spends some time with a French family they meet on the river, was a smart edit for the original. It interrupts the action just as they are about the reach Colonel Kurtz and does little to advance the narrative.The true genius of this film is how long it takes to meet Kurtz. The audience knows he's played by Marlon Brando and we want to see him and what the jungle has done to him, but we have to wait. We don't even hear his voice. As Willard is studying Kurtz's dossier as they travel up the river it's Sheen's voice we hear, not Brando's. It's like ""Don't Stop Believing."" That song is beloved because we don't get to sing those iconic words till the very end. Art by way of anticipation.And speaking of music, though The Doors' ""The End"" was written more than a decade before this film, it's seems like it was scored for the picture. Coppola uses it to open his opus and also, fittingly, at the end. And it's brilliant. The final five minutes of this movie, while it's not for the weak of heart, is a marvel of filmmaking.Most war pictures have one of two goals. They either want to show what true heroism is, or they want to demonstrate how destructive war can be. While the best of them accomplish both (like Saving Private Ryan) in my humble opinion no movie captures ""the horror"" of warfare better than Apocalypse Now.As you probably guessed, this gets 10 stars from me. Although I didn't need the extra 50 minutes in this Redux version. The original, which my dad took me to see in the theaters back when it was released, and maybe the reason I'm such a pacifist today, is just fine with me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Copola's best film,"Copola's best film. The lighting (Vittorio Storaro) and special effects contribute to the impact of the film too. Brando's first appearance in unforgettable chiaroscuro. A burnt orange light illuminates his shaved head from the side and turns the naked scalp into a luminous crescent. Then Brando bows his head, dips his fingers into a bowl of water and flutters his fingertips along the skin as if playing a piano or celesta. Sheen's boat and its two-man crew glide very slowly into the tiny cove which serves as Brando's main port. The place looks like mannequin factory. There are bodies and body parts strewn about. Bodies that are more or less whole droop from the trees and from the gargoyle monuments that surround the entrance to Brando's dark and beckoning castle. Hundreds of half-naked natives with spears and guns have assembled in silence to greet the boat. Out of this unholy horde dances a crazed photographic journalist, the ever reliably crazed Dennis Hopper. He shouts greetings, shakes hands, welcomes them warmly, but adds in a wary tone, ""They think you've come to kill him -- and I hope THAT'S not true."" He leads the stunned Sheen through the throng that opens before them. Sheen is gaping at some of the body parts. ""The heads -- you're lookin' at the heads! Y'know, sometimes he goes too far, but he'll be the first to admit it, man.""Brando is a warrior and a poet. Near the end, one scene seems to be a T. S. Eliot study group gone awfully wrong. He's a philosopher. ""Did you ever think that the middle word of LIFE is IF?"" That whole climactic visit to Brando's fortress in the wilderness lifts the movie out of whatever sense of reality it had earlier carried and places it squarely into the surreal. It's just impossible. A viewer can't tell what consequences any given event will precipitate.

I'm just here to report about the Final Cut,"I just watched the Final Cut and it looked and sounded great! But I saw the Redux version 20 years ago and was hoping Coppola would have listened to the critics and removed that plantation scene. Alas, it's still in there, in the final cut. It's the one major flaw in his revisions of his film. I feel the original theatrical cut got it right. The pacing was perfect, and it just kept the build up going. But this nagging french plantation, while interesting, so very out of place. It stops the movie dead in its tracks for a good 20 minutes. I kind of understand why Coppola wants it in there, because they give a bit of a history lesson on how things came about in the Vietnam conflict, with the french being the original colonialists. But the movie, the way I see it, is bigger than just the conflict. While it's set in Vietnam, it wasn't specifically anti-vietnam war. It was more like anti-war in general, and anti-colonialism, like the book. But by doing the history lesson in the plantation scene, it kind of ruins the metaphorical aspect of the film.
Anyway, that's my rant on that scene. It's a wonderful film to watch, at least I know the aforementioned scene is a good spot to go for a bathroom break!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Other notable cast members are: Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper. Scott Glenn, G.D. Spradlin, Harrison Ford and R. Lee Ermey all have minor roles. Sam Bottoms and a young Laurence Fishburne are cardboard and pedestrian.

Major Movie Review: Apocalypse Now,"I love reviewing older, classic films. When I watch a really great movie that was made in the 70's or some bygone decade, I get that tingle in my cinephilic being that I just gotta discuss it or bring it up to a friend of mine who may have never even heard of the movie! APOCALYPSE NOW, is a film like THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA or LAWRENCE OF ARABIA; it's highly acclaimed by nearly every movie lover out there. So it'd be blasphemous for me NOT to talk about this movie and perhaps even introduce the movie to younger cinephiles that haven't seen anything beyond what's been released during their recent lifetime. So is APOCALYPSE NOW, really a great piece of art or a long, boring war movie?MARTIN SHEEN is Special Operations Vet., Captain Ben Willard, a troubled American soldier who is called back to duty during the Vietnam War. His mission is to track down and kill a renegade, Col. Walter E.

Top 5 Films Ever Made,"This is one one of the greatest films ever made. Based upon the novella by Joseph Conrad and brought to screen by Francis Ford Coppola, this one is so rich and multi-layered. Vietnam is the vehicle but this is really a film about the true nature of man, and it is disturbing. Like Coppla's other films this one has fantastic performances, stunning visuals, and thoughtful dialogue. This one can be, and maybe has to be, watched again and again to get the full richness of it. I was never in war, but this film made me feel like I understood it on some level. The soundtrack is perfect. I can't say enough good things about this. It is brutal and violent and Very adult.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Cinema In Mythic Transcendence,"Know outright that this great film has no aspiration toward being a slice of life document of the average U.S. soldier's experience during the Vietnam conflict of the 1960's and 70's. Psychedelic or otherwise, the Vietnam War was simply the most apropos contemporary setting to place this adaptation of Joseph Conrad's mythic novel ""Heart Of Darkness"".The plot is nothing more (or less) than one man's destiny to confront another man. It's Martin Sheen's Captain Willard floating through surreal chaos in existential angst on a clandestinely assigned mission to find this rogue-warrior-cum-mad-messiah figure of Marlon Brando's Colonial Kurts and either end him or succum to the same madness. In dreamy slow burn we hear the internal dialogue and intimate journal entries of a war wery Willard as he drifts futher down river with his army entourage encountering one bizzare event after another, all the while crystalizing his sole focus on finding the deep jungle compound of this enigmatic Kurts and ultimately eliminating him with ""extreme prejudice"". But will he? Can he? Should he? Why? Who's to say what is even the moral priority anymore in the midst of this grotesque farce of torrential terror and trivial turmoil? The final act and resolution is nothing short of a baroque masterpiece.The tone is engulfing dread for impending doom. It's this heavy pull-down immersion into the sinking ""heart of darkness"". It's the apocalypse... right now. As Jim Morrison's voice announces over the opening shot of a carpet bombing napalm drop over a palm tree horizon - ""this is the end my beautiful friend"".Vittorio Storarro's hypnotically tranquil anamorphic cinematography is astonishing in both its lushness and chairoscuro tenebrism. Walter Murch's editing and sound design is fluidly detailed, layered, and mercurial. With the vital contribution of Grateful Dead drummers Mickey Heart and Bill Kreutzmann - father/composer Carmine Coppola, and director Francis himself created an eerie vortex of percussion and abstract sonic experimentation that would become a prototype for the progression of ambient and industrial avante garde music. Francis Ford Coppola mounted a seminally bold vision of Cinema as myth at its highest level of narrative trandscendence. Truly an epic odyssey through the struggling volition of the sentient soul, oneirically seeped in perennial paramnesia. Utterly magnificent and profound.And the behind the scenes making of the film itself is maybe even more harrowing. Following the experience of this magnas opus, watch the outstanding documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" as an essential peak into the ground level turbulence and strife that enduringly plagued the legendary production. As documented on location and narrated by director Coppola's stalwart wife Eleanor (with additional subsequent interviewee perspective), the curtain is totally stripped away as each calamity culminates into dangerous flirtation with complete catastrophe. Broadly considered the most transparent and enthralling behind-the-scenes companion piece to a biblically taxing production of a equally worthy Cinematic achievement ever.Everything around and about ""Apocalypse Now"" is just stunning and rife with wreckage, resilience, and resonance.I personally prefer the extended ""Redux"" version edit for its ever more sprawling surrealism.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Pretentious pastiche.,"Overblown, occasionally interesting, but mostly pretentious pastiche of Joseph Conrad's  *Heart of Darkness*.  The Vietnam conflict serves as the Ultimate Metaphor for Coppola, as he sends discharged Captain Willard (Martin Sheen)  up the Mekong Delta.  His assignment?  Dispatch a certain Colonel Kurtz, a Green Beret who has apparently gone stark raving mad in the jungle of Cambodia.  Along the way, Willard meets a middle-aged Robert Duvall who can talk about nothing but surfing  (and in a Southern drawl, too), and a small crew of your typical  'Nam grunts that accompany him on his boat ride.  The general point of the film seems to be that War is Hell, or that Man is a murderous savage at the very least.  Wow, man.Coppola throws so much at the screen that some of it is bound to stick and hold your attention.  The scene where the Hueys glide above the breaking surf with Wagner's  ""Flight of the Valkyries""  blaring on rigged-up speakers on the copters is justly famous  (though nonsensical and over-the-top). Dennis Hopper in a brief appearance manages to steal the entire movie (""Did you know that  'if'  is in the middle of  'life', man?!"", etc.). Coppola's setting-afire of an entire jungle with Jim Morrison intoning  ""This is the end . . .""  on the soundtrack is an astonishing sight, though necessarily modified by the knowledge that this film continues to be condemned for creating some of the worst environmental damage in the history of movies. And there's a truly chilling sequence in which Willard stumbles upon a last outpost of GI's engaged in a chaotic, meaningless firefight with an unseen enemy.But most of the movie is merely the boat ride, accompanied by some truly dreadful faux-noir voice-over narration  (""Accusing someone of murder here was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500"" . . . you get the idea).  Willard mulls over the spectacularly banal history of Colonel Kurtz, while the crew gets on each other's nerves.  In the  *Redux*  version, there's an excruciating detour on a plantation that houses a group of snappily dressed French expatriates, a 30-minute digression that was edited out of the first cut for a very good reason:  it's sophomoric.  Anyway, on it goes, until Willard finally comes face-to-face with Ultimate Evil . . . which turns out to be just a middle-aged, overweight Marlon Brando, mumbling inaudibly, snacking on what appears to be macadamia nuts, and reading to Willard alternately between old issues of  ""Time Magazine""  and T.S. Eliot's poetry.  ""It smelled of death in there,""  narrates Willard, referring to Kurtz' lair, ""Of malaria . . . nightmares . . .""  but we remain bemusedly unconvinced.  Perhaps it smelled simply of macadamia nuts.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

It is a film you surely won't forget in a hurry.The acting performances are superb across the board with all time greats such as Marlon Brando, Robert Duval, and Martin Sheen delivering nuanced, larger than life performances that command your attention whenever the are on screen.The cinematography throughout the film is extraordinary to say the least. The foreboding lighting and shadows of many shots, the nightmarishly surreal visual style, and the claustrophobia of the dense jungle setting all help to create a distinctly oppressive atmosphere.The film's stunning action is another one of its major strengths. Most of the jaw dropping battle sequences were done almost entirely with practical effects and stunts and it shows. These scenes are also remarkably well shot and choreographed. All the explosions, attack helicopters, and brutal killings feel so vivid and immersive that it is almost overwhelmingThe story is also a masterclass in psychological suspense and tension, with many shocking surprises to further help keep you firmly at the edge of your seat for the film's entire runtime.Overall, Apocalypse Now is a truly great, astonishing piece of cinema.

Colossal,"A colossal masterpiece... The story is fabulous, a mental dive into the jungle and madness. Everything in the mise-en-scene contributes to making it an experience of immense depth: the editing which plays with superpositions and reminiscences, Willard's introspective voice-over which structures the entire film, Carmine Coppola's haunting electronic score...You shouldn't expect a real war film, except perhaps in its first part where we find Colonel Kilgore, the helicopters, Wagner, the explosions and all, but the film quickly becomes something else, a physical and mental odyssey connected to the psyche of Colonel Kurtz, an ambiguous and fascinating character embodied in an incredible and instinctive way by Marlon Brando and his improvised monologues.I rather recommend the original edit, because the scenes added in the Redux and Final Cut versions are a bit weaker and tend to dilute the impact of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Perhaps the Methods Were Sound, Afterall.","Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now (1979), produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and co-written by Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius is arguably the best action and war film of all time. Set in Vietnam in 1970, Apocalypse Now trails the hellish journey up-river endured by Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), as he seeks to find and destroy Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a man who we learn has gone crazy after seeing the savage truths of the American strategy in Vietnam and is perhaps best described as the literal heart of darkness. Accompanied by Air Cavalry Officer Kilgore (Robert Duvall), and a nameless, spirited freelance photographer (Dennis Hopper), we watch as Willard, an already emotionally unstable man, unravels more and more due to the chaos and horrors experienced during the journey. The farther up the river they travel, the crazier things get. This film stirs up such a range of emotions. Initially, I felt awe inspired over the incredible cinematography and in addition to such magnificent shots is the skillful acting which made for such fascinating and memorable characters. As the film proceeds to the second and third acts however, the mood changed from awe to dread - a feeling this film captures quite perfectly. There's so much to say about the images: the quick shot where Martin Sheen's painted face surfaces from the water at night; the entrance to Kurtz's village and his monologue that follows perfectly depicts the horrors and madness of war as well as the fear, loneliness, and isolation. I physically felt all this more and more with each scene. Moreover, the immersive sound experience stood up to the impressively vivid visuals and did well to reflect the mood of war. Though Coppola has explicitly stated it's not an antiwar film, the theme of the nature of evil, power, and the soul crushing impact of war on the human psyche aligns with the high criticism of the Vietnam war coming out of Hollywood at the time, and certainly seems particularly concerned with revealing the atrocities of the Vietnam war in the name of democracy and freedom. So, if you're looking for your average war time movie, this isn't it. However, while I will say it lacks a definitive plot, if I'd still recommend this film due to the incredible performances, the advanced level of creativity of each scene and the theme related to the madness of war.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I love it!,"This is one of the most unsettling and terrifying movies I have ever watched. This is a big statement considering the number of great movies on this topic. The film gives you a sense of chaos that is unnerving. Unlike other war movies that portray various things, what makes this movie unique is its directing, acting, writing, and cinematography.The directing by Francis Ford Coppola is remarkable. It feels like you are in the middle of the war, feeling confused, shocked, and frightened. The writing is also excellent and keeps you engaged for the three-hour movie. The cinematography is creepy and adds to the overall experience of watching the film, capturing all the madness around you, even when everything looks calm.The acting is spine-chilling. Marlon Brando's performance, in particular, is his last outstanding one, playing a delusional and unbalanced colonel. Martin Sheen's incredible performance allows you to see everything through his eyes, experience all the insanity he is going through, and yet cheer for him to achieve his goal. Robert Duvall's portrayal of a commander with his bizarre battle strategies, such as playing music to alert the enemy that he is coming, is also impressive. Supporting performances by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms, and Frederic Forest, who all captured the attitudes of many soldiers at that time without being cliché, were fantastic. Cameos by Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford are also noteworthy.I highly recommend this movie. It delivers a message, and everyone involved in creating it is at their best.

The Greatest War Film of All Time,"Honestly I don't know where to start. So I'll start with the cinematic elements. Though the making of this film was a production nightmare from what I've heard, Francis Ford Coppola managed to create one of the most immersive and hallucinatory experiences of any film I have ever witnessed. The cinematography from Vittorio Storaro is hauntingly beautiful and euphoric. Watching Coppola's mastery of the craft here was an awakening to me. Martin Sheen delivers his best performance. He is very well known amongst cinephiles, but in my opinion he does not get the amount of appreciation he deserves. I'd put him in the same league as some of the greats. Speaking of some of the greats, Marlon Brando who though has a handful of minutes of screen-time his presence in the final act of the film was nothing short of compelling. ""Your an errand boy... sent by grocery store clerks... to collect the bill."" But what holds the film together is the themes it is depicting. The themes of duality, Western imperialism, and of course the descent into madness. How deep someone can go into their own psyche before they succumb to the darkest part of themselves. All of these ideas are expertly complemented by the aforementioned cinematic mastery from Francis Ford Coppola. In my humble opinion this is his best film and is of course one of my indisputable favorite films of all time.""I love the smell of napalm in the morning""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Sublime,"Precise rhythm with great interpretation of the problems caused by post-traumatic stress, despite the aura of mystery due to the mysterious character, the personality of the subject is sensed and no matter how intriguing the modus operandi of the protagonist and the individual he pursues, one arrives to a deserving conclusion full of morality and tangibly raw perspective.Due to the way in which the secondary characters and extras or actors of little relevance are expressed and described, they are not lost, however the crew members of the boat where they travel through Vietnam are a reflection of some typical American soldiers of that time; idiotic, arrogant and insensitive, mainly for not knowing the true motivation to continue and do it because it is the best alternative.Excellent phrases and great cult show.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now: A Cinematic Odyssey Through Madness,"Apocalypse Now, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a mesmerizing cinematic masterpiece that takes viewers on an unforgettable odyssey through the depths of madness and despair. Released in 1979, this film stands as a timeless exploration of the consequences of war, expertly crafted with a vision that transcends the genre's boundaries. With a gripping narrative and stunning visuals, the movie immerses its audience in a world where reality blurs with the chaotic horrors of war.One of the most compelling elements of Apocalypse Now is the brilliant use of Willard's voice-over narration, penned by the talented Michael Herr. The narration not only provides insights into the psyche of the protagonist but also serves as a window into the madness that ensues as he journeys up the Nung River. Herr's writing infuses Willard's narration with a poetic quality, capturing both the physical and psychological turmoil experienced by the characters. It becomes the thread that ties together the fragmented events, deepening the film's intensity and giving a poignant perspective to the turmoil unfolding on screen.Coppola and his collaborator, George Lucas, intentionally aimed to create a film that transcended the traditional war genre. In their pursuit of an archetypal tale, they transformed Apocalypse Now into a modern-day Greek Myth, an allegorical journey that examines the psychological descent into madness at all levels. By blurring the boundaries between reality and hallucination, they craft vivid portraits of characters who are grappling with their own inner demons as they navigate the unforgiving landscape of war. This approach elevates the film beyond a simple depiction of a conflict; instead, it becomes a timeless exploration of humanity's capacity for darkness.The visual mastery displayed in Apocalypse Now further enhances its status as a cinematic landmark. The breathtaking cinematography by Vittorio Storaro captures the ethereal beauty and chaos of the Vietnamese landscape, juxtaposing moments of calm with explosive violence. Deliberate use of lighting and color schemes heightens the atmospheric tension, immersing the audience in a world filled with dread and uncertainty.From the exceptional performances of the cast, particularly Martin Sheen's riveting portrayal of Captain Willard, to the haunting soundtrack that seamlessly blends with the narrative, every element of Apocalypse Now contributes to its status as an extraordinary piece of filmmaking. Coppola's meticulous direction and dedication to exploring the human psyche set it apart, making it a true work of art that challenges conventional storytelling and leaves a lasting impact on anyone who watches it.Apocalypse Now stands as a testament to the power of cinema to capture the complexities of the human experience. With its exploration of madness and the timeless themes it tackles, this film is not just a war movie but a profound exploration of the human condition. It transfixes viewers, challenging them to confront the darkness lurking within, and in doing so, solidifying its place as a true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"""Apocalypse Now"" transcends the ""war film"" genre, raising questions about the cruel nature of man, his quest for power, and the irreversible effects of the horror of war","Right at the beginning of ""Apocalypse Now"" we are introduced to the film's hallucinatory atmosphere, through images of bombings in the jungle to the sound of the song ""The End"", by The Doors. Then, the images of a fan and a helicopter propeller mix, reflecting the thoughts of Captain Willard, who desperately wants to return to the jungle because he no longer knows how-to live-in society. Found in the midst of an alcoholism crisis, where he even injured himself by breaking a mirror, he sees the invitation from the Army Special Forces (note the small participation of Harrison Ford, who would become a star two years later) as an opportunity to return to the combat, without knowing that by accepting the invitation, he would live an experience that would change his life forever.Coppola (who makes a cameo in the film as the TV director) directs ""Apocalypse Now"" with extreme elegance, creating absolutely unforgettable shots and sequences, such as the air attack on a Vietnamese village on the beach, to the sound of ""The Cavalcade of the Valkyries"", by Wagner, and the scene in which jets spread napalm in the jungle. Furthermore, the director manages to create incredibly realistic sequences during combat, making the viewer feel like they are part of the conflict and allowing them to journey through the horror of war alongside Willard. Observe, for example, the exceptional aerial shots during a helicopter attack, interspersed with images of children playing in the village, making clear the cruelty of that attack, made clear when these little children run to hide. Coppola still makes the most of the region's beautiful landscapes to compose impactful images, such as the impressive attack by the natives on Captain Willard's boat, right after pink smoke is spread through the air. The director also creates moments of suspense, causing a great scare in the scene of the tiger attack, which extracts the deepest truths from the Chief (Frederic Forrest) (and also takes anyone out of their chair), and touching scenes, such as when Clean (Laurence Fishburne, very young and performing well) dies next to the recorder on which he heard his mother's voice.It's obvious that Coppola chooses a very fresh theme for Americans in 1979, just four years after the end of the Vietnam War. But the proposal is completely different from what is generally addressed. Vietnam is, above all, a symbol of the crumbling of the idea of civilization in the midst of the boom of science, technology and progress. The Viet Cong, barbaric and brutal, managed to inflict a historic defeat on the Americans, who emerged from the conflict completely destroyed. The civilized and civilizing people had their project ruined in a few years. Coppola demonstrates that civilization and barbarism go hand in hand, much closer than one might imagine. Killings are carried out on a large scale both in ""uncivilized"" societies and in the name of the project of civilizing them. It is important to say that more bombs were dropped on Vietnam than in the entire Second World War. There is one scene in particular that clearly reveals the transformation that takes place during the ascent of the Nung River. A soldier fires furiously into the darkness, even though there are no enemies to shoot. Willard asks him who is in command and the mad fighter responds with an expression of horror: ""Isn't it you?"" There was no longer any command. More than a war, the trajectory along the river transformed the civilizing impulses of each soldier into vapor, bringing out their most primitive instincts, such as those to kill and survive.The extreme realism achieved in ""Apocalypse Now"" is also due to the exceptional quality of the team's technical work. During a soldier's surfing on the river, the golden photography (directed by Vittorio Storaro) reflects the young man's joy at that moment. On the other hand, in the combat scenes Storaro adopts a more desaturated tone, dominated by mossy green, yellow and brown, reflecting the difficult and uncolorful life of war. The sound is spectacular, capturing the helicopter propeller, the gunshots, the bombs that explode and even the small insects inside the forest, and the constant noise of the helicopters in the first half of the film contribute to the perfect war atmosphere, as well as the competent art direction by Angelo P. Graham, noticeable in the equipment and boats of the American army, and the costumes by Charles E. James. To finish, the beautiful soundtrack by the trio Carmine Coppola, Francis Ford Coppola and Mickey Hart adopts a mysterious tone, with dry beats during the rise of the river, totally opposite to the opening themes, the attack on the village and the ending, accompanied by the classics and beautiful songs by the group The Doors and classical music by Richard Wagner.But it is clear that the name most strongly linked to ""Apocalypse Now"" is Francis Ford Coppola. His tenacity - some prefer to speak of stubbornness - was essential for the film to be made. The director put millions of his own money into the production and left with a huge crew to film in the jungles of the Philippines. Infernal heat, mosquitoes, boredom, illnesses, insanity, constant delays... This all seems to have been the least of it. The fact that Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack during filming and that Marlon Brando suffered attacks of exaggerated stardom was much more explored by the press, which followed the making of the film with great attention. In a time without the facilities of computer graphics, all the scenes that we see in ""Apocalypse Now"" had to be solved and carried out with great technical effort, in an epic production that, at one point, seemed to have gone out of the control of its directors. But we don't see any of that while watching the movie.And the remarkable performances in ""Apocalypse Now"" begin with Robert Duvall, who is sensational as Lieutenant Kilgore, demonstrating firmness with his imposing voice and determined look, but also demonstrating leadership in the way he leads his soldiers. Kilgore seems to fear nothing, or simply thinks he has nothing left to lose, even finding time to encourage surfing in the middle of an attack, which leads Captain Willard to make serious reflections on the way his country is facing that conflict. The striking sequence in which he says that the full of napalm symbolizes victory is captured with precision by the camera that slowly zooms in on his face, highlighting Duvall's great performance. Martin Sheen is very good as Captain Willard. From the convincing narration (full of questions and reflections), through the character's determination to find Colonel Kurtz and reaching the apotheotic end of his trajectory, we can notice the quality of Sheen's work. Willard's reflections increase when he sees the soldier's smoking marijuana and getting drunk frequently, and he is sure that everything is wrong when he witnesses the Playboy magazine girls' show in the middle of Vietnam. (""The Viet Cong don't have fun. In their spare time, they eat fried rice and rats""). Dennis Hopper is spectacular as the busy photographer who becomes an admirer of Kurtz. His rapid speech, his stuttering and his heavy breathing demonstrate the character's anxiety, who cannot stop talking, such is the excitement he feels upon meeting Captain Willard.And finally, the legend Marlon Brando needs no comments as the mysterious Colonel Kurtz. Completely devastated by the horror of war, the numb Colonel Kurtz is someone blinded by power. The construction of his myth is slowly and carefully driven by the narrative, leading Willard (and the viewer) to constantly question what his real motivations are. Brando expresses the incarnation of the power that his character represents magnificently, through his superior and intimidating gaze. His speeches, full of symbolism and reflections, create hypnotic and unforgettable sequences. He watches as his face is slowly revealed, as if we are carefully being prepared to stand before a god. Even the way Coppola films the character demonstrates this, leaving him practically inaccessible, submerged in shadows and more like a spirit or a deity (Kurtz most likely considered himself as such). It is then that, when faced with the myth, Willard's reflections begin to take even more shape. After all, who is really crazy: Kurtz, his commanders, or all of them? The answer may lie in the countless phrases spread throughout Coppola's own excellent script, among which we can mention: ""Accusing a man of murder in this place was the most absurd thing imaginable"", ""In the heart of every man there is a conflict between the rational and the irrational, between good and evil and it is not always good that comes out the winner"" and ""One day this war will end. For the boys on the boat, it's fine. They want nothing more than to find a way home. The problem is that I've already returned and I know that that place doesn't exist anymore.""""Apocalypse Now"" is the cinematographic milestone of an important effect that occurred in American culture shortly after the Vietnam War: the loss of innocence. Masterfully directed by a cinematic genius, played magnificently by a strong cast and also featuring refined and wonderful technical work, ""Apocalypse Now"" far transcends the ""war film"" genre, raising numerous questions about the cruel nature of man, the tragic results of his quest for power, and the irreversible effects of the horror of war. And best of all, ""Apocalypse Now"" never directly answers the questions it raises, leaving the viewer to reflect on everything they saw and come to their own conclusions, which is always admirable. After watching this masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola, the viewer has the feeling that, regardless of its final outcome, the war has no winners.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The face of horror...,"Apocalypse Now is not a war movie, the war is just a framework. It's about our protagonist, Willard, and his journey through hell. To find the meaning of mortality and death by going headfirst into the horrors of the jungle itself... finally accepting the darkness within.Willard is sort of a silent observer which helps us to project ourselves into him, to see the world from his eyes, and experience the madness that this film relentlessly relishes. The Jungle can look grotesque, muddy waters and the bloodshed in the woods are enough to make you and everyone around you go insane but there's also a sort of beauty, in the Jungle. Some shots make it look entrancing and bewitching with the use of colorful smoke, heavy fog, slow pans, and its significance as something that provides life.The atmosphere is captured with excellence, you don't know what you'll see next, how will the confrontations go, you might encounter a battlefield which has distorted circus music playing in the background, or other times you might encounter a very well-lit show for the soldiers, completely randomly. Such events might make it seem like the movie has pacing issues or tonal issues but no, far from it. It flows naturally, the pacing feels perfect and the tones are just right for every scene. Having 2 shots super-imposed onto each other also helps give a more mystical sense to the movie where time is irrelevant, it starts to feel like a fever dream.The final sequence is just perfect. The colors, the music, the outstanding camera work, and the context of the situation breathe so much life into each scene. It plays well with the idea of our protagonist finally coming to terms with the darkness that he plunged into, and the symbol of power that he has to face. It ends with our protagonist finding the much-needed clarity in the heart of darkness and insanity.Still, with so much good, there's always some bad and unfortunately, this movie is plagued with one major flaw and that is over-acting. Some actors over-did themselves, to the point of making them feel annoying and unnecessary. I know it's supposed to make us understand how insane everyone around our protagonist is becoming, but it didn't work well with me because of the utter contrast between Willard and his crewmates. Still, Apocalypse Now is an excellent film that went through literal hell in production to finally come to fruition and tell a story about the figurative hell, it's a horrifying journey that everyone should experience at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Through methods of the hallucinatory surreal, this film ironically depicts war in the most vivid reality.","Disturbingly surreal and real, Apocalypse Now is so classic because it is the first, and to this day the only war movie of its kind, in that it conveys the darkness and brutality of Vietnam through not just a deception of the grim reality of war like any other preaching drama film would to hammer their message through, but by the psychological torment to come from the horrors of war, by vividly expressing its reality through the means of hazy and bizarre experiments in thick atmosphere, and bleakly unsettling nihilistic philosophy based upon its reality. This results in a film morbidly shocking and gruesome on the surface, while at the same time being subtle in its strangeness, with the latter ending up being more disturbing than the gore, and both nevertheless just as impressionable as one another while sharing an epic scope. A literally pitch-PERFECT piece with prevalent dark overtones, and the masterfully executed ambition to heighten the impact to such an effective level to be a cinematic experience unlike anything else in film history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A staggering piece of filmaking in all aspects.,"In 1902 Joseph Conrad wrote a story based on his own experiences called 'Heart of Darkness', which is about a steamboat captain travelling up the Congo. The captain witnesses the appalling effects of Belgian imperialism on the Africans as he slowly moves deeper and deeper into the jungle, where he will meet Kurtz, a formerly brilliant Belgian agent who has gone mad. It is a story of civilisation and savagery, and it is one of the great works of English literature.In 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released 'Apocalypse Now', a movie based on Conrad's tale but about a different form of colonisation. Set during the Vietnam War, it is the story of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who travels upriver with a boat of mostly young soldiers on an assignment to 'terminate the command' of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a formerly brilliant special forces officer who has gone rogue. For all their hardware, for all their awesome technologies of death, the Americans are losing the war because they simply will not go as far, will not give as much as the Viet Cong. Nor can they win over the Vietnamese people, because they do not really care about them. They are tools, a means of stopping Communism from spreading to somewhere really important, and they are treated as such. Kurtz has decided to change this: he is leading a cult who will do anything to win. Anything.The version that I have seen is a new, longer cut called 'Apocalypse Now Redux'. I have not seen the original so I cannot say if it is an improvement, but what can say is that Redux is a masterpiece. It is the best war movie I have seen: it shows modern battle in both its awful glory and its muddy, bloody wretchedness. The sun sets, golden behind dark trees, the jungle explodes in flames, choppers whir in and out of earshot, bullets zip out of the foliage, men and women lose their minds and lives. It shows, in a series of lurid scenes, what the war, the jungle and the heat have brought out in the men: their brutality, their casual race and sexism, the crumbling of their humanity. Though it seems pompous to say so - a silly feeling, as like all art movies can be more than just entertainment - this is a profound film.However it could have been better. I could have done without the manic and rather irritating photojournalist played by Dennis Hopper: what he tells us about Kurtz could have been shown to us directly, or been spoken by the man himself. There is also a sequence set on a French plantation that was added by Coppola. The soldiers have a break from the war, bury a dead comrade, over dinner there is a discussion about the war in a wider context, and Willard has a romantic encounter with a lonely French woman. In itself it these are good scenes, but they breaks up the momentum of the movie. As the soldiers have been going deeper into the heart of darkness, facing horrors that have gotten more and more intense, this relatively peaceful episode dissipates some of the tension that has built up. It also lengthens what is already a very long movie.That aside, in the blackness of a movie theatre, with the screen taking up my whole field of vision, the sound of The Doors' eerie 'This Is The End' filling my ears, from the beginning of the movie to the end I was riveted to my seat. There is a famous scene where choppers come out of the blue horizon, Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries' thundering from their speakers, and rain death apon a village where the terrified Vietnamese scurry like insects. It is terrible and beautiful, grotesque and exhilarating. It is like reading Revelations. It may be what the Apocalypse feels like.9 1/2 / 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Chilling Vietnam story,"Apocalypse Now tells the story of a soldier who is sent out to find and terminate Col. Kurtz, a highly decorated war hero who has been driven insane by the horrors of Vietnam. We follow Captain Willard and his crew through their journey up the river to find Col. Kurtz, including battles among the enemy as well as amongst themselves, and we see the toll war can take on the human mind. This is a chilling portrayal of the Vietnam war, and it's not your usual war movie.Francis Ford Coppola was hot off the success of The Godfather, The Godfather Part II and The Conversation when he tackled this movie, based off a book called Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Coppola went through utter hell making this movie, but it was all worth it, because he churned out a good project. This movie isn't your conventional tale of war. It is more a tale of the inner turmoil that can be caused by war. The action scenes are few, but the dramatic scenes are so well done that you find yourself not craving the action. I truly enjoyed the style the film was made in. The movie starts off with a realistic atmosphere, but as Captain Willard's journey progresses, things begin to look more and more unhinged, more and more surreal, until he reaches the utter insanity of Col. Kurtz's base camp.The performances in this movie are great. The movie is filled with great actors including Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, and Robert Duvall, and they all give knockout performances.Overall, this is a very chilling and very stylish war film, and I'd recommend that anyone who watches it not sit down expecting a film like Platoon.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Once OK, Redux is brilliant","I didn't care for Apocalypse Now (1979) when I first saw it. Too anti-American and simple-minded concerning the Vietnamese War, I thought.  Something compelled me to see the re-edited and lengthened version, Apocalypse Now/Redux (2001), however, and I'm very glad I did.Apocaplyse Now is the story of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), who we first meet as a tightly wound Army intelligence agent awaiting a new assignment in Saigon in 1968.  He is sent on a mission to find and assassinate a Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who is holed up in a compound upriver just over the Vietnamese border in Cambodia, waging his own war.  It is assumed that Kurtz has gone insane.Willard takes a small but interesting crew along: Chief (Sam Bottoms), Chef (Frederic Forrest), Lance (a famous California surfer dude), and Clean (Laurence Fishburn).  Battles and boredom beset them, and as they travel the outposts of civilization become less and less civilized, as do they.  Kurtz's domain is the paradoxical archetype of this anarchic hell.The major plot differences from the original movie include a salacious visit with some Playboy bunnies sent to entertain the troops and a visit to a French plantation, stubbornly holding on to the colonial ways.The new movie is stunning from a visual and sound aspect. Small segments have been added to bring out the characters more fully. Scenes like the famous helicopter assault on a small village, led by a testosterone fueled Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), still have power but seem more balanced in the overall content of the film.Despite it's 3-1/2-hour length, I was mesmerized throughout. This, finally, is the film Francis Ford Coppola meant to make.Apocalyse Now/Redux (2001) - 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Like Lemmings running off a cliff...,"This is how I interpret all the baffling high ratings this movie has gotten from viewers. I believe people will 'make themselves' see a special, wonderful, intellectual movie where there is none. They follow closely with other viewers (like lemmings running off a cliff en mass to their peril). This film reminds me of Citizen Kane- how people immediately assume that movie 'must' be the greatest movie of all time. Can any honest viewer actually watch Citizen Kane and compare it to Gone with the Wind or Casablanca or On the Waterfront or Ben Hur or The Big Country? Citizen Kane will put you to sleep- but people think it's 'supposed' to be artful, innovative, ingenious masterpiece. Apocalypse Now is the same scenario. Many people have heard amazing things about the film prior to watching and thus unconsciously force themselves to find genius and great acting and great script where there is quite the opposite. Other people watch it and see a truly weird, eccentric, failed effort at trying to make a artful, philosophical explanation of Vietnam- an overdone effort with the mantra being 'the weirder and more offbeat and melodramatic, the better'. Newsflash- that kind of movie- making is easy. Being weird and is easy- and it's a strategy to overwhelm the viewer with nonsense to such a degree that even the most objective, critical viewer will conclude 'such a weird, sick, pointless movie MUST be art.. must be genius.. must be a masterpiece. Here's a hint to the other viewers who found this to be the best movie of all time- it's easy to be strange and eerily unconventional. The true masterpieces are those movies which are simple and traditional, yet we walk away from them never forgetting, i.e. Schindlers List, The Godfather, Braveheart, North by Northwest, Rosemary's Baby, The Graduate, The Deer Hunter, etc. These are movies- classics with great acting, writing, and music, and frankly are endlessly watchable. I think any honest movie fan cannot really say they can watch a sleeper like Apocalypse more than once- it feels like a bad acid trip. Words to remember- extreme weirdness is not a recipe for a truly good movie or even a half decent one- but judging from the ridiculously high reviews, it does hypnotize its audience into thinking they are watching something worth watching. Oh well.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Overrated !,"I'm a very big fan of ""The Godfather I & II"" (notice I didn't say III). With that said, everytime I hear the title ""Apocalypse Now"" the first word that automatically pops into my head is the word ""overrated"".This movie had almost as much hype to it as Harry Potter. It also was the most expensive movie ever made at the time. Yet, after watching it time after time after time, I can't help but think that half the budget went into Brando's pocket.This movie has never has ""connected"" with me. God knows I have given it plenty of chances (I've probably watched it about 10 times). Everytime I see it I keep telling myself ""This is going to be the time that I understand what all the fuss is about""....but it never happens.This movie was made in 1979, approximately five years after the last American troops left VietNam. Personally, I think that is a significant factor in the popularity of this movie. I believe in 1979 Americans were JUST starting to accept the fact that we actually lost the war (and I mean on a very wide scale - just beginning to accept). This movie plays into that mentality by showing a General who is going against his orders. It also shows disillusioned American soldier looking for answers. I think people saw one of the great American directors coming out with a ""Vietnam"" movie (starring one of the all-time greatest actors) portraying the American troops that way, and instantly deemed it a ""classic"".It seems as though it kinda gave alot of Americans something to refer to and point at and say ""see, that's what it was like""...because of the names involved. So the testosterone started flowing, college dorms started putting up the movie poster, and next thing you know a huge snowball effect had started, and ""Apocalypse Now"" was more-less deemed the standard when it came to Vietnam movies.Now, don't get me wrong ""Apocalypse Now"" has some great moments. Some of the camera work in it is really breathtaking. But to call it a classic is simply ridiculous.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""'Never get out of the boat.' Absolutely g****mn right! Unless you were going' all the way...""","Apocalypse Now is an experience so weird, disturbing, and dark, I had to take a class to fully understand it. The key thing is that it's more than a mere war movie; as an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's book, Heart of Darkness, the film is a dark and primal exploration of the savagery of the human heart, and a journey into insanity.Set in the Vietnam war, there are just a few combat scenes in Apocalypse Now. The beach attack in the beginning half of the film is probably the most impressive action scene, for it is well-staged and thrilling. The rest of the film, however, settles into a slower, moodier, and more trance-like pacing. Action and violence occurs sporadically, but most of the film plays out like a mesmerizing nightmare. Much like a nightmare, there are gnarly and scary things to see, but it's hard to turn away from it.Therein lies the film's greatest strength: its ability to convey horror and insanity within its narrative. The story itself is all about the journey into the ""heart of darkness,"" figuratively and literally. As the characters traverse deeper into enemy territory, civilization gradually breaks down, until they reach a savage core. Thus, things become crazier, more insane, and more brutal, right up to the end. By the time you reach the end, strong themes emerge concerning savagery, the darkness of the human spirit, and morality. As a war movie, the film also harps a lot on the futility and insanity of war.Even on the surface level, the story is pretty solid. The plot is pretty random, but it follows the structure of Joseph Conrad's novel pretty closely, and uses a lot of the same characters. The film treats the story and characters with diligent respect; even though it adapts a lot from the original book, it makes things fit into the Vietnam setting really well, and makes them stand out in their own unique ways. Whether you look at it as an adaptation or just another war movie, it works.The filmmakers went through Hell and back to make this movie. The actual shooting went on sixteen months and went well over-budget, and in all that time, there were horrendous problems. Martin Sheen nearly died from a heart attack during filming. That scene in the beginning when he punches a mirror is not acting, and that was real blood on his hands. Marlon Brando arrived on the set totally unprepared for his role, causing even more grief. Other actors succumbed to substance abuse. Director Francis Ford Coppola lost a ton of weight during this project; later, he had an affair, which strained things even further. A typhoon destroyed some of the sets, delaying the production even further. The helicopters, which were on loan from the Filipino government, had to be withdrawn at certain times (even in the middle of shooting) to fight rebels in the area. The sheer amount of stress is palpable on-screen, and helps make it feel more real.The film has splendid photography and editing. Acting is quite decent from the whole cast, and is admirable considering all they went through. Writing is good. This production uses a plethora of very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. A lot of scenes are specifically staged to reflect actual iconic events of the Vietnam war, for decent effect. Music is wild: the actual score is really funky, but the use of the Doors music and Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries is iconic.There are at least two versions of this film available. The theatrical cut is a good, trim version that runs for two-and-a-half hours. The Redux edition adds on another 49 minutes: a massive wealth of new scenes, which slows things down a bit, but offers a lot more to the story and themes. There are a few scenes in the Redux version I didn't care for, but it is well worth seeing at least once. An alternate end-credits sequence was filmed (a fairly awesome scene where everything blows up), but never used for any of the film's cuts; it can be seen as a DVD or Blu-Ray special feature only.Apocalypse Now is a sobering and mesmerizing exploration into the dark pit of mankind's primal soul. It gets pretty weird, dark, and violent, but the film is never distasteful about it. Even though it might be a hard thing to watch, in terms of its content and storytelling, it is worthwhile seeing at least once.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A Journey into the Heart o,"Watching ""Apocalypse Now"" was an experience that transcended mere film viewing; it was a visceral journey into the heart of chaos and the darkest corners of the human psyche. From the moment the haunting strains of The Doors' ""The End"" filled the theater, I felt as if I was being pulled into a surreal nightmare where time and reality blurred.The cinematography was nothing short of breathtaking, with each frame meticulously crafted to evoke the lush yet menacing beauty of the Vietnamese jungle. The river, winding like a serpent, became a character in its own right, guiding us deeper into the madness that lay ahead. As Captain Willard, played with haunting intensity by Martin Sheen, embarked on his mission to find Colonel Kurtz, I couldn't help but feel the weight of his existential burden. The film masterfully captures the disintegration of sanity amidst the backdrop of war, and I found myself questioning the very nature of morality and humanity.Robert Duvall's portrayal of Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore was a striking juxtaposition to the chaos surrounding him. His infamous line about loving the smell of napalm in the morning epitomized the absurdity of war, a sentiment that resonated deeply as I watched the film unfold. The scenes of destruction, the haunting imagery of severed heads, and the surreal encounters with the locals painted a stark picture of the horrors inflicted on both sides of the conflict.What struck me most was the film's ability to evoke a sense of helplessness and despair. As Willard delved deeper into Kurtz's world, I felt the weight of his realization that the journey was not just about the mission but a reflection of our own darkest impulses. The film forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about ourselves and the cyclical nature of violence.By the time the credits rolled, I was left in a contemplative silence, grappling with the profound themes of madness, power, and the futility of war. ""Apocalypse Now"" is not merely a war film; it is a haunting exploration of the human condition that lingers long after the final scene. It is a masterpiece that demands to be experienced, not just watched, and its impact is one that I will carry with me for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Hallucinatory and enigmatic war film,"This is a review of the Redux version.Apocalypse Now is a visually spectacular, cryptic movie that explores the psychological madness of war. This trip down the river is a metaphorical journey, from the gung-ho naivety of the surfing crewmen, via the leaderless and directionless soldiers who don't know what they are fighting for, to finally the battle-hardened madness epitomized by Colonel Kurtz in his Cambodian retreat. The assassin, Captain Willard, has clearly been chosen to hunt down and exterminate Kurtz on the basis that he too is of a similar mindset. He is an extremely damaged individual whose experiences in Vietnam have irrevocably altered his psyche, such that he is a cold and emotionless killing machine. His crew are identification figures for the audience. Clean represents the very young men who were destroyed in this extremely violent conflict and Chief is an example of the committed professional soldier. But perhaps Lance is more illustrative. He enters the story fresh-faced and naive, beginning his journey down the river on a surf board; soon he becomes a part of a massacre of civilians; before long he descends into madness. Lance's journey down the river is the metaphor for the experience of the average combat soldier in Vietnam; from enthusiasm via horror to mental breakdown.Vittorio Storaro's photography is stunning throughout and really helps create the somewhat hallucinatory tone of the film. Apocalypse Now does not go for the realism of war that the likes of Platoon epitomized. Instead it adopts a slightly surrealistic approach, which works because the movie is more of an expression of the madness of war than an expose of the horrors that the troops had to suffer on the ground in Vietnam. This slightly more artistic manner may be off-putting to some who prefer their war films to be more realistic. Everything is very stylized, from the Flight of the Valkyries helicopter attack to the nightmarish Cambodian retreat of Colonel Kurtz. The film is also bookended by memorable sequences soundtracked to The Doors psychedelic classic 'The End'. The whole Vietnam experience is presented as a bit hyper-real.The extended directors cut of Apocalypse Now – the Redux version – is an interesting but inferior alternative to the original release. It's debatable whether any of the new scenes actually improve the film. For the most part they break the inertia of the movie, knocking the pacing off, sometimes going into thematic cul-de-sacs or altering the tone unnecessarily. Although I think it's unquestionably a fascinating version with a considerable amount of new material to digest, it's also true that the shorter cut has more purpose and direction, and proves less is more. Nevertheless, I enjoy Redux as an optional, if lesser, alternative. So in summary, the definitive version is the original but Redux is still good. This is certainly a one-of-a-kind war movie and is yet another classic from the fertile 70's film-making period now referred to as New Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The Rhetoric of ""Apocalypse Now""","In the film ""Apocalypse Now"", we follow Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on his mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade Green Beret; Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has set himself up as a God among a local tribe. In a sense, Kurtz has set up his own army within the jungle that resembles that of a tribe. As Willard descends into the jungle he is slowly over taken by the jungle's mesmerizing powers and the battles and insanity which surround him. The further he takes his journey, the more he becomes like the man that he was sent to kill. Kurtz has succumbed to the power of the jungle around him. At one point Willard mentions that ""The jungle is where he really takes his orders from"". Willard can feel himself slipping into the same mode of human existence.There are echoes of Bahktinian discourse within  ""Apocalypse Now"" in that there are always two forms of rhetoric speaking and opposing one another. The first is the civilized western institution of the miliary. The second is a more primitive, instinctual world, where primal instincts prevail. These two voices seem to be always oppose one another, but when it comes down to the climax of the film, we see that the film has attempted to draw a relation between the two.The structured, civilized, and supposedly moral institution of the military has given Willard a simple' assignment to travel up river, find Kurtz and terminate his command ""with extreme prejudice"". These orders laid out in a highly structured manner, which is characteristic of military discourse. Willard soon realizes that the mission really isn't as simple as his commanders attest it to be. In one scene later on Willard says ""I thought I would know exactly what I was going to do when I saw Kurtz, but now I'm not sure"". His journey along the river gives him a certain insight into Kurtz's psyche.In practice, even the rest of the military that Willard encounters as his escorts up river seems to be undermined by carnivalization, meaning that there is more freedom from restraint than what the military would expectedly allow. We have Sgt, Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who seems more concerned with surfing than with the war they are fighting. He is constantly looking at the tides to determine the plausibility of a good surf, and having his men surf the beach whenever they invaded a village. There is even a scene where they bring in two Playboy bunnies to dance for the sex starved soldiers of Vietnam.  Men also water ski behind the patrol boat, and suntan on deck. This is not something that we would expect to have occurred in Vietnam.As Willard continues his journey, he still is aware of the mission that he has been sent to accomplish, but he sees more references to primitive and tribal ways, the closer he gets to Kurtz. In one scene, the jungle seems to come alive and attack the boat. Suddenly thousands of spears are hurled at the boat, from no apparent location except for the jungle itself. All we see are the arrows flying out from the brush, we never see anyone throwing them. And arrows in themselves are a symbol of tribal practice.When Willard meets Kurtz, it is then that the voices of ordered military and primitive, tribal instincts are truly revealed, but Kurtz does not see them as opposing, as such. He suggests that the two may be amalgamated, which is perhaps a sign of his psychoses. In a long monologue, he argues that the military needs men who are moral, but yet at the same time are able to utilize their primordal instincts to kill without feeling, without passion, without judgement. ""...It's judgement that defeats us"". He says that ""if I had ten divisions of those men, our troubles here would be over very quickly"". This is where the two opposing discourses truly meet with one another.There are multiple ways that one can interpret ""Apocalypse Now"". The film has a huge multiplicity of meaning and what I have said is only one of many ways of viewing it.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A Journey Into the Heart of Insanity,"The film begins: a man, Captain Willard, is lost between two worlds and he can no longer fully belong to either one again. He is both fascinated and appalled by the world of the soldier. He is left cold by and no longer fit for the world of the civilian. The sound of the fan turning in his room evokes helicoptor blades, he dreams of the thick rows of trees of the jungle being lit up under an orange sky, a sky full of wrath and destruction.The soldier receives a mission. We then witness a man's journey through madness and death, he is obsessed with both and both have become his world's obsession. It is a dark odyssey of disorder and chaos and it is captured meticulously and paced excellently as it progresses to its apotheosis. Willard is brought face-to-face with Vietnam itself (the war that is, not the country) in Colonel Kurtz, a man who has made himself a god but who knows that he has violated his nature just as nature has violated him. He has taken his madness and reflected it back to those who drove him to it. Unable to bear it, those responsible must now attempt to terminate the man who has shown them exactly what they have spawned.The film is a dark, beautiful allegory which takes the viewer on a uniquely unforgettable experience. It skillfully uses editing to show juxtaposition and metaphor. It is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam, and it becomes so because the director and crew allowed themselves to go to places which were dangerously uncomfortable.Nb - If you're watching this for the first time, watch the original cut, not the Redux version.

War = Horror,"This is film is truly incredible.  The action is so real, it is like a live documentary.  Coppola paints a horrific vision of the tragedy and madness of the Vietnam war.  It is so interesting that it took 16 months to film, well over its expectancy and the fact that Coppola also had to use his own personal income to complete after it dramatically exceeded budgets.It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism.  A true masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now Redux - A piece of History,"I give this version an 8 out of 10,  original version 8 out of 10 also.The redux didn't change my reaction to the film,  which I have seen probably 10 times.  The most significant change is added depth to Martin Sheen's character, Capt. Willard.  He gets to have some fun and shows compassion for his crew.  Most of the additions lighten up parts of the film with humour and transgressions from the main focus of the plot.  The most fascinating aspect of this re-release is the vivid colours and excellent sound.  All previous big screen viewings of this film I have seen in the past have been scratched old prints played in a theatre with inferior sound.  This new print was made with the mostly defunct Technicolor process (now called Technovision).  The yellows and reds jump out with searing intensity, (there are really no blues in the film).  Combined with a booming soundtrack, this is a feast for the senses.    There is additional material where Kilgore's pre-occupation with surfing is accentuated, including a funny gag where Willard steals Col. Kilgore's surfboard.  Later, helicopters are hunting for Willard and crew,  with loudspeakers blaring Kilgore's voice, `Return my surfboard'.   The next major addition is the boat arriving at a decimated post up the river,  where the Playboy girls are stranded.  This gives Coppola a chance to infuse sex into the film,  as part of his plan to include all the required Hollywood Blockbuster elements.   By far the longest and worst addition is the `French plantation' sequence.  It feels like a reel from `Indochine' or something was accidentally thrown into a film.   It consists mainly of a bunch of French guys arguing about some philosophies that you can't understand.  The audience feels like Willard does on-screen;  bewildered, tired, and wishing you could leave.  But no, a French women has been making eyes at Willard,  and drags him into her bedroom.  More gratuitous nudity.  You almost forget what movie you're in, except that you can see the river outside the window.  Oh yeah,  the boat, Col. Kurtz, the mission.   The few additions of Kurtz don't change your opinion of him,  but they don't hurt the film.When this version comes out on DVD,  use the power of the remote to skip the French scenes.  Otherwise,  this epic has grown well,  and the aficionados will have a chance to appreciate the lost scenes, for better or worse.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
How this movie finally made sense,"Please note, this review/guide contains references to drug and alcohol use. It is not intended as a recommendation or instruction for anybody to follow. It is just what worked for me.--- I watched Apocalypse Now a number of times through my life, and while I always enjoyed it I found it slightly beyond my reach. Drug use is a (minor) theme in the movie, and I suspect a major theme in the making of it (it certainly was for at least one of the cast). I'm somewhat unusual that I started experimenting with different substances later in life, and was never really much of a philosopher, so I never really understood some of the more abstract aspects of this movie. However I finally watched Apocalypse Now and it all made sense, as much as it can. Part of that was to stop expecting it to make sense, which is an obvious metaphor for how many felt about the war itself.So here's my recipe for ""getting it"". This could be unique to me and how I interpret things. It is in no way intended as an instruction or recommendation, it's just what worked for me. The following are chronological steps that can be separated by months or preferably even years.Step 1: familiarise yourself with the Vietnam war. Watch movies, the likes of Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, even Hamburger Hill and some lesser known ones. Read the literature, both fiction and non-fiction. Listen to the music of the era.Step 2: know what it's like to consume lots of alcohol. Note the above point where I say this is not a recommendation - health authorities will tell you this step and the following ones are bad...Step 3: smoke some weed.Step 4: experiment with hallucinogenics. LSD, mushrooms, mescaline, whatever floats your proverbial boat.Step 5: know what it's like to question your own sanity. This step definitely isn't recommended, but chances are if you've followed the above steps you might have some idea.Now revisit step 3, sit down, and watch this movie. I personally prefer the redux version but that's a matter of preference. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Wonderful Adaptation,"This movie is a livid (and vivid) adaptation of Joseph Conrad's commentary on Imperialism.  The film ends up being equal to the novel in complexity and expression, making it a rarity in Hollywood.  The imagery is ugly and sobering, but Coppola gives it a mythical quality which lends the violence an odd form and purpose.  Overall, an excellent film, regardless of how disturbing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Truly unforgettable,"Francis Ford Coppola has made ""Apocalypse Now"" a truly unforgettable film about the war in Vietnam.  The cinematography is sensational and so is the acting.  Martin Sheen is terrific as Willard, the agent who is sent by the Army to take out an out of control Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando who gives one of the memorable performances in his career.  Robert Duvall is superb as the wild surfing fanatic/Air Calvary leader Kilgore who says a few famous quotes after a helicopter attack on a small village that's held by the Viet Cong.  Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, and Larry Fishburne have some solid moments as the members of PT crew that take Willard in Cambodia.  It takes a while before the boat meets its destination where we find Kurtz's camp and surprise, an American pot smoking photojournalist is there to greet the surviving members of the PT crew and Willard.  The photojournalist is wonderfully played by Dennis Hopper who is also there like Willard to find out more about Kurtz.  Then Kurtz (Brando) himself enters the picture in a way that no one could have ever thought of at the time.  It does get bogged before I see what happens to Kurtz and it doesn't look pretty.  Overall, ""Apocalyspe Now"" is a masterpiece that should be treasured by anyone who sees the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Overrated!,"When I hear people say that this was the best film about Vietnam ever, I have to puke, I mean laugh. This was a boring, unrealistic, slow ride to nowhere. I am aware that it is based on ""Heart of Darkness"", but you know what? That was a boring, pointless book as well. I know there are messages all over the movie and the expense of this film must have been incredible. And yes, Duval makes me laugh. But the bad just far outweighs the good here. This movie is a mess. From a movie I seek one of two things, interest or excitement. This had neither. Is that to say that there are no interesting or exciting scenes? No, there are, but the boring, pointless scenes just outweigh them by so much. For a realistic look at Vietnam, I would suggest ""Platoon"" or ""Full Metal Jacket."" For a far out movie that has interest, I would suggest ""Easy Rider"" or ""A Clockwork Orange."" However, if you want to be bored and see some of the silliest war scenes ever, try this one. A one word description of this film is OVERRATED!",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Perhaps the best movie of all time,"I am not even a Coppola fan. I believe that most of the films he did (including 'Godfather') are laughable. But 'Apocalypse Now' is a work of art, an untouchable piece of film making, that will never lose any of its values.The story is about two men who discover their weaknesses as well as their strengths in the hellish background of war. Coppola treats his audience with total respect. He doesn't attempt to moralize or even take sides. He leaves the decision to us.But what is so magnificent about the script is the way it plays with the war element. 'Apocalypse Now' starts as a typical war movie, but then it becomes a film noir type of thriller. Suddenly the war element returns and then you have no idea where this will lead. You are left at the hands of the director, who ultimately takes the audience, exactly were he wanted to take them.The production is huge. Totally breath taking. At a time were everything is computer generated, the Redux version is here to destroy everything that was released in the last 20 years. Can you handle the power of the explosions? The flares the burst in front of you? The whole reality element is printed on film and is there to prove that nothing can replace authenticity.Coppola's direction is phenomenal. Dark, slow, captivating and Gothic. This is an absolute work of art, the explosion of Coppola's talent in one film. He could retire right after that movie.Sheen is great and Brando is simply the best actor of all time. Notice in 'Superman, the Movie' how he says '...this fortress of solitude'. Everyone else would be ridiculed saying something like that, but not Brando.The Redux version is not another re-release with some unnecessary extra scenes. When you watch the original version, you get the feeling that a lot of aggressive editing took place. The new version is simply amazing, 3 hours of excellence, nothing is redundant, the editing is beautiful, the sound track is perfect.'Apocalypse Now - Redux' is perhaps the best movie of all time and I haven't said that for any other movie yet.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
near cinematic perfection,"i give this a 9 out of 10. the only negative comment i can say about this movie is that i felt kurtz was a bit too ""dramatic"" and ""literate"" at the end. if i were doing this movie i would have made him more savagelike. forget about his little desk with the bible and poetry. we should have seen a kurtz who beheaded kurtz' boatmate! a kurtz who was having orgies with the cambodian natives. i dont mean for coppola to have turned on the sex and gore at the end, just give us a kurtz who was a little less ""shakespeare"" and a little more ""rambo"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Simply a great movie,"Apocalypse Now is probably the best war movie I've seen. If you like ""The Deer Hunter"" or ""Platoon"" you will certainly love this movie, as Vietnam's war starts again. Capt. Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) has a mission to terminate Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), (Terminate, wich extreme prejudice) who (Gotta love that line) has gone out of his mind and Capt. Willard shoots his way through the dangers of Vietnam to fulfill his mission. I love the way Martin Sheen thinks and how he tells about himself, and his character is also good. I like Marlon Brando's character and how he speaks with his scary voice and of course the other crazy characters. I totally love all the action scenes and even some of the talking scenes. This is simply a great movie, 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A world of its own,"Apocalypse Now (redux) was the first DVD movie I owned (my father bought it for me), I was originally looking for the DVD to assist me with my reading of 'heart of darkness'. What I found was very different and more mesmerizing than the novella itself, Apocalypse Now paved the way for my uncontrollable obsession with fine cinema.Dark and mysterious, the cinematography is characteristic of Francis Ford Coppola. No other film I have viewed has ever bought such a hypnotic, bizarre and strange world to the screen as apocalypse now does. It is realistic visual and auditory art at its finest and if not admired for its honesty towards presenting the complications of a particular life, then surely apocalypse now must be held in high regard for the indescribable unique atmosphere it produces, in which the enraptured viewer cannot help but simply become encapsulated within from the very beginning to powerful ending.You wont come across another movie that will hypnotize you in the way that apocalypse now does. Martin Sheen is simply brilliant, his character, Marlowe, is strong willed and torn simultaneously - yet Martin Sheen gives the infinitely complex character of Marlowe an undying consistency and commitment that comes through as stunning and forever interesting. You will feel privileged to watch a film in which the main character is just as unexplainable and astounding as the setting in which he interacts with, the duality is purely artistic, and through the interplay of rationality and savagery, suggests that there are no answers to the complications of life itself.Although not a cult classic, apocalypse now is an indication of the capabilities and possibilities that cinema could offer for audiences, contemporary Hollywood cinema is failing in its ability to make its audience not just see, but actually FEEL strange new worlds and open doors of perception for individuals. It makes me sad to see the kind of movies that are released as of today, MOST of them are horrible junk movies with no point and no taste, movies which you know your money was never worth because they don't provoke thoughts or emotions within you to a sufficient extent.Hats off to Apocalypse Now for what it is. A must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Depiction of the human mind,"The movie begins with the motion of helicopter blades followed by ""The End"" by The Doors, already this film is perfect. Coppola depicts everything there is about Vietnam, war and the human mind within this film.I won't divulge into the story itself, I'm sure anyone viewing this will already know. Also for anyone interested, read Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad it is what Coppola based this film upon.The performances by Martin Sheen, Denis Hopper and the late Marlon Brando are sublime, all of them adding such depth to the film. The way Sheen narrates the story to the viewer is sheer genius, the dramatic music and gloomy looking backdrops the sky orange and the forest bright green yet filled with danger.This film perfectly depicts Vietnam and everything it was, a complete mess. When they arrive at the US camp and it has no superior officer. Just guys smoking dope, shooting everywhere. 'The west is the best' ? But this film goes further than anything you could imagine, every scene, every part furthers characters and to an extent the human mind, this is very true of Martin Sheen, Brando and Hopper. The latter are already past coming back and soon enough Sheen joins them, but it was inevitable. War itself changes men, and the further he got to Kurtz the farther away from sanity he got. This was Vietnam, this is war. This is the human race.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Excellent war movie,"This movie depicts the horror of the Vietnam War very excellent.  It shows how to ""take extreme prejudice"" in the war.  The performances of the soldiers were excellent.  Marlon Brando does very well and it is good to remember him besides The Godfather.  Martin Sheen was very cool in this and I liked his performance most of all.  He looks just like his son Charlie in this.  This one beats Platoon and The Thin Red Line.Overall the performances were very good and I was extremely surprised at how they depicted the horrors of the Vietnam War.  Very accurate.

Total disappointment,"I've somehow read about, but never managed to actually see this film for years, not a novel situation for me, but in the past the films I knew about but never saw until many years after they were made had me sitting up till late watching, amazingly surprised at how good they were. One example (another film made from a novella but far better done) was Death In Venice. I read Heart of Darkness as part of an English degree course and was too young to appreciate the novella at the time-it made its impact in later years. Eventually I watched Apocalypse Now thinking it would be equally good. Wrong. It was virtually unrecognisable. Another reviewer put it well when he said West Side Story bore more resemblance to Romeo and Juliet than this pretentious mish mash of pointless violence does to Heart of Darkness. As for Marlon Brando, he was as big a disappointment in this film as he was in The Godfather. So..the ""horrors of war""...""the thin veneer of civilisation"" so easily stripped away..nothing new, no depth. The worst horror was the slaughter of the bull. Tedious repetitive violence, presumably intended to be some kind of psychological journey. Boring, and I never want to see it again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Is this a war or politics,"As we learn going along that the anti-hero Kurtz knew what the Vietnamese war was really about and chose to position himself where he could force change. By the time Kurtz is given his new command he knew all about the lies and political compromise of the American generals and especially the politicians who ""ran"" the war.Time after time Kurtz's successful actions embarrassed the powers that be, so eventually he just went off into his own little world and made war the best he could and he was just a little too good.So along comes Capt Willard, ready and eager to get back into the fray. But upon reading Kurtz file, he comes to admire him, to understand him. Still his own mission must be fulfilled, what to do? Notice at the end Willard taking Kurtz's notes and other papers with him as leaves. He knows just how important they are.Unlike many here who claim this movie is NOT about war, well I disagree. It is about the hypocrisy of war, and most specifically how the American politicians and generals fought that war in the public square unable or unwilling to prosecute the war as ""just war."" Sadly the US has yet to learn that lesson.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the Best Viet Nam War Films!,"""Apocalypse Now"" either in its original version (1979) or the expanded Redux version (2001) is one of the best ever films dealing with the Viet Nam war. The story deals with the trials and tribulations of army Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) who is sent on a secret mission to assassinate a highly decorated army colonel (Marlon Brando) who has reached his breaking point and is causing embarrassment to the U.S. government. To reach his quarry, Willard must sail up a river in a small boat into the forbidden country of Cambodia. The helicopter raid on a small village is a highlight of the journey.Director Francis Ford Coppula gives us a visually stunning film filled with unforgettable characters. In addition to Sheen (in his best role to date) and Brando, there is a great performance by Robert Duvall as Colonel Kilgore who ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning"", Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and a teen-aged Laurence Fishburne as the boat crew, Dennis Hopper as a spaced out photo journalist, G. D. Spradlin and a young Harrison Ford as the men who send Willard on his quest and in the Redux version, distinguished French actor Christian Marquand as the owner of the French Plantation. If you blink you'll miss Scott Glenn as Sheen's predecessor.Speaking of the Redux version, although it adds a couple of extra stops on Willard's journey, it really doesn't improve on an already great film. It adds scenes involving the Playboy playmates, a visit to the French Plantation and an extra scene for Brando. But it doesn't expand on the ending which I still find confusing. For example, how does Willard just walk away from Brando's camp with his supporters (who have performed brutal acts already) staring on with glassy-eyed disinterest, particularly in view of the grisly events that have just taken place.Still in either version, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a truly great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This Is The End...,"Francis Ford Coppola directs this fascinating but very strange, unique film about Army Captain Willard(Martin Sheen, fine shell-shocked performance) who is sent ""Up River"" on a secret mission to assassinate renegade Col. Kurtz(Marlon Brando, bizarre but unforgettable performance) who has apparently gone insane, abandoned his command, and now rules over a primitive people in the remote jungles of Vietnam.Story is far more involved than that though, especially in the expanded directors cut that is much longer, but also fascinating. Willard encounters many strange sights and people(even among his own crew) as he tries to make sense out of the enveloping madness of this war, and his own inner demons.Film is a visual marvel, and holds your attention as it unfolds its increasingly philosophical, even existentialist narrative. May take multiple viewings to fully comprehend, but is worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Jarring piece of cinema history,"No movie will ever come out like this one. Try as they might, they will never manage to reproduce the way this film feels, looks, sound and even tastes. Because filming during 16 months (that's almost a year and a half) in the Phillipines, during a war in that country, with a director on the verge of suicide and actors on the verge of breakdown will never again be tried by any sensible production company. A pity then, that we won't get another shot at something like this, but that's what makes this movie so unique. This is the ultimate example of how from chaos comes perfection. Everything about it is absolutely spectacular, and strangely crafted, considering the production conditions, which makes us think about what was the academy thinking about when they acclaimed ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" against this colossal masterpiece, only granting it two oscars. The redux version is one step further into this world and even if you only saw the film once with some attention, you will understand where are the new features, and their major roles here. Made in an era where there was no CGI, your jaw will drop in some shots, where more than 20 helicopters pass in front of the camera lenses, while a tank destroys a hut by the river, with thousands of extras running by. This was the ultimate challenge to the human resistance, and at one point in the movie, we no longer feel that it's only a movie. Its rawness comes like a near-documentary. Like Coppola himself said ""It's not a movie about Vietnam. It's Vietnam itself"". No doubt, it's the best war movie ever made, and one of the best movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Great work Copolla,"Well, it's a really long movie, but if you want some thing previous you can go and read a review, right?I think this is a great movie, it's actually more than I expected.It's a really shocking movie for some i think, it made me question how much someone can loose their humanity when they really want something and how cruel a human can be.That may not be the point of the film for you, but I think everything looks different from everyone's pov.The cinematography it's really good and makes you think you're inside the story, makes you feel scared for the soldiers and the people in the war, it shows the reality of a soldier's mind sometimes, cause he knows he will never be the same and sometimes only wants to die.I've never really done this before, so I don't know how to properly wirite a review and I'm brazilian and learnt english all by myself, so I hope everything's correct in this.I would highly recommend this movie for you if you're interested in cinema and if you have the time to watch it, it's a good experience, well, it made me terrified by sometimes, I think it really confirms my point cause Copolla and all the people working here created an atmosphere in which I felt inside for the whole movie and still feel like I really was there.I won't get into the deepest details cause I think it'll ruin your experience, but I hope my review makes you interested and I hope you agree with me somehow, I really enjoyed it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Never seen anything like this before.,"This movie is a complete mindf*ck. From the opening scene, with the takes of helicopters and Vietnamese jungle and Captain Willard in a hotel room, all with some background, intense, progressive rock music, you know you are not going to watch an ordinary movie. This is something special, this plays with your mind.Scene after scene, the movie keeps getting weirder, but it's such a slippery slope up until the end that you don't even realize that what you are watching is completely bizarre. From the beginning, Coppola sets the rules of the game and makes the public abide to them. And once you're deep down in the movie, there's no way out. This is not an ordinary Vietnam War movie, yet in its insanity and surrealism there's no other movie that depicts the cruelty and madness of war so well. Coppola makes no effort in trying to show a realistic Vietnam War, but because of that is that no other director has fully apprehended the meaning of war so well. To understand the traumas that war veterans go through, it is not enough with just showing a lot of cruel scenes, blood and friends and foes dying, you need to go beyond reality, you need to grasp the subconscious part of it. And Coppola does it terrificly.Music deserves a special mention. A big part of the state in mind in which Coppola puts you in is because of the amazing soundtrack. I had never seen another movie with such a good use of sound effects and music in order to convey the desired message.I didn't really know what to expect of this movie before seeing it. I only knew is about Vietnam. I really did not expect this movie to have the effect it had on me. Needless to say, this movie is a must- see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Apocalypse Now,"Coppola's spaced out Vietnam epic features Martin Sheen as Captain Willard, sent on a secret mission into the Cambodian Jungle to assassinate Brando's Colonel Kurtz, a war hero gone mad. As he travels with a small group of soldiers on a boat up the river, it is clear the whole war is insane and out of control.Astonishing piece of work with amazing set pieces and an extraordinary sense of growing dread as the crew moves closer to Godlike Kurtz along the river.The crazed and glorious stand alone scenes incl Duvall's surf crazy Colonel, playmate girls performing in the middle of the jungle for the men and ultimately Kurtz' horrific encampment are now almost legendary. All performances are excellent with Duvall believable as another mad Colonel, Hopper, seemingly out of it and Brando still showing vast screen presence. All this is held together by a strong central performance by Sheen. Coppola has over the years continued to tinker with his film, producing his Redux and Final Cut versions. Both feature an elongated section where the crew stop at a French plantation for tea - whatever it's historical merits, this remains a dull and diversionary section that should have remained on the cutting room floor.

As everyone who has seen the film knows, it is an unforgettable odyssey of alternately surreal, beautiful, and at times shocking images.  Many veterans have complained that the film isn't realistic, but that isn't the point.  The point is in all the set pieces throughout the film, starting with Martin Sheen's drunken binge in the hotel room.

Surreal Visual,"Apocalypse Now is a surreal visual and cinematic masterpiece that fails to acknowledge its uncredited basis: Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Viewers unfamiliar with Conrad would likely perceive Francis Ford Coppola's film as wholly original. The movie offers no clear explanation for Col. Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) descent into madness, Capt. Willard's (Martin Sheen) mission to assassinate Kurtz instead of apprehending him, or the illogical choice of a patrol boat for the journey, when a helicopter could have completed the mission in minutes.The film loosely adapts Heart of Darkness, a critique of European colonialism in the Congo, offering a grim portrayal of futility and brutality. Conrad's work emphasizes the savagery and moral corruption of both African natives exploited in the ivory trade and the European colonialists perpetuating the violence. Apocalypse Now substitutes the Vietnam War as its setting, showcasing sporadic historical realism amid scenes of senseless destruction reminiscent of Conrad's themes. However, Coppola misses the deeper complexity of the novel's critique.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

It baffles me how so many people can have so little taste or appreciation for what is an absolute stunning movie.The atmosphere it creates is so authentic, so chilling, so insane, that it alone beats every other Vietnam movie hands down. Add to that an incredible soundtrack and score, along with a career best performance from Sheen and you have a wonderful movie. It goes even further though featuring the greatest actor of all time, Marlon Brando.It is an epic masterpiece that will blow you away if you have never seen it before. It will also make you wonder why, these days with all the money spent on effects etc, the vast, vast majority of other movies, of any genre cannot pull off believable, compelling atmospheres and settings.

"The Horror, The Horror","I know, I'll be in the minority with this review, but I thought this was awful!! I only got to the end on my third attempt. I have never seen the original version, and only watched the redux version when I bought it on bluray bundle of 5 for £30.Plot In A Paragraph: During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen )is sent on a dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade colonel (A ridiculous Marlon Brando)who has set himself up as a god among a local tribe.It's ironic Brando playing a man who thought he was a God, as that is probably what he thought of himself.The plus points for this are Martin Sheen gives a career high performance, Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper are both as reliable as they always are. Harrison Ford does OK in his small role, but he is not really given much to do. Laurence Fishburne and Scott Glenn are both good too.The bad, Brando is awfully over the top. When he eventually comes on screen its distracting. It moves at such a slow pace, it makes the already long running time seem twice as long.

Cinematic Masterpiece!,"This brilliant war epic is a testament to the turmoil Francis Ford Coppola and his family went through in making this film. Along with Martin Sheen's heart attack, Marlon Brando's ego and Dennis Hopper forgetting his lines, Coppola had to deal with budgeting problems, the weather and the antics of the Phillipines government. The journey which Martin Sheen takes is not only down the river, but a journey within himself. The movie deals with a number of issues and is lifted by the supperb cast. It was a stroke of genius to drop Harvey Keitel as Captain Willard and put Sheen in his place. This is definitely one of the great films of all time.  The film was Beautifully shot and duly one an Academy award for cinematography.The highlight of this was illustrated in the helicopter scene which was set to the tune of Ride of the Valkyries. The most remembable line of the film would have to be ""I Love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" which was uttered by Robert Duvall. Another notable line was said right at the end of the film by Marlon Brando, ""the horror. the horror"". This film is very deep and is best watched late at night in complete darkness for full effect.This film is a long journey into oneself that turns into something that defies belief and stretches the imagination.

Apocalypse WOW!(spoilers),"This has to be the greatest Vietnam movie ever made. Its not a surprise that the director of The Godfather I and II made again another great epic. The most memorable scene in the movie has to be the opening scene of the movie.The opening scene begins with just a shot of the Vietnamesse jungle with a helicopter going around the jungle. Then all the sudden napalm all over the jungle, with ""The End"" by the Doors playing, that is just an incredible scene. Then again it comes to no surprise that Francis Ford Coppola has yet another great opening scene.The story is simple. Its about a Sargent Willard getting a mission to terminate a renegade Colonel named Walter E. Kurtz(Brando). The whole movie sets in the Vietnamese river, Williard is with U.S. army sailors. The names of the sailors are Lance, Mr. CLean. Chef and Chief Phillips. During the whole time Williard is reading dossiers of Kurtz including records he set in his academy. Willard is impressed of Kurtz's records and does not know why the U.S. army wants him killed. With Chief Phillps and Mr. CLean dead, Chef, Lance, and Williard go to their destination. Willard gets caught and he is impressed with the wisdom that Kurtz has. Then he now realizes why they want Kurtz dead. It's a human feeling, a temptation to be God.This movie is my top 10 period. Brando's acting is just awesome. What i like most about the movie is that surreal feeling it has to it especially at the end, when Kurtz delivers his famous monologue.4/4""The Horror, the horror""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"It has it all - war, drama, violence, humer...","This film is one of my 3 all time greatests. (Coming along with ""Braeking the Waves and ""Wings Of Desire""). Apocalypse now is an outstanding piece of art. This movie left me so shocked, I could'nt stop thinking about it for like 2 weeks after I saw it. Fantastic director - Coppola had to work for almost three years to end this epic story about a few american soldiers that are sent to destroy their own general Kurtz. The group is led by Captain Wilard who is performed wonderfully by Martin Sheen. This movie is like so much different than everything else i've ever seen. It deals with the crazyness of the war in vietnam, and the sanity of the american army. The movie is directed in an outstanding way by coppola, and is acted brightly by all the leading cast.

Delving into madness,"I watched the Redux versionApocalypse now is a movie that has been on my list for so long and finally watching it, it´s amazing. Now I can understand I have watched the subpar version to some, but if this is the worst it gets it can only get absolutely amazing. Apocalypse Now is an absolutely incredible journey from start to finish and no doubt one of the grandest watches I have had in a while. Taking it all in is a lot and the mere scope is absolutely breathtaking. But even when you set aside the absolutely astounding production and cinematography, this is a gruelling story about people. About people in war who succumb to the darkness and as they travel further into Vietnam, they travel further down their own psyche and believes. This is an absolutely heartbreaking movie when you think of it in many ways, turning itself into one of the most anti-war movies I have ever seen with it´s dark comedy and inhuman dialogue. This, this is cinema, this is art at its finest.Captain Willard is pulled back into war, the Vietnam war and is tasked to kill colonel Kurtz, an American that has gone rough and joined his own war. Willard is torn with killing an American and sets out to find him with a small crew on a boat.Let´s start with some negatives. I don´t think all line delivery is perfect here. I think it can become a bit too American at times in its delivery, too cliché and read sounding. There is a particular scene in the French estate that really didn't 'work for me with inside of you there are two wolves vibes. But this is not all the time and mostly I think the acting is pretty good here. The voice over is also a bit too much, but I think it works as to hear Willard's thoughts without making it too forced. Some lines also seem a bit redundant, but again this is only some times. In general I think the performances are pretty great. I love Martin Sheens understated performance, his more of a reactor and has gone numb after he has been in so much war and it´s more about seeing him reacting in subtle ways that work for the character. I love the many POV camera shots for Willard, it seems like he kind of trials of sometimes and can´t focus on what´s being said, and we are shown this in a great way. There are so many great performers here that all do amazing. Sheen as said, Frederic Forrest, Marlon Brando, Robert Duval, all giving powerhouse performances.My biggest praise for this movie is the scope of the production and the cinematography. The helicopter scene towards the start of the movie took my breath away as to how well it was made. To know all this is practical is insane and every single shoot just ends up working on another level. So many frames are perfectly made with so much great chorography in the background. Add movement, characters, machines, smoke, colour and bam, you have absolutely stunning moving frames. It´s been a while since the scope of a movie really wowed me, but this movie did it! I cannot really describe how incredible the cinematography is or how absolutely insane the production is, I can´t give it justice. But know I was impressed and I´m a bit of a sceptic. The use of coloured smoke and colour grading is also so well done and once again, create absolutely stunning frames. This is movie is a visual feast from start to finish. The iconic helicopter scenes, the head out of the water, the purple smoke, all of these moments stand out to me and impress me. Seriously the helicopter scenes and aftermath might go over in history for me as one of my favourite sequences of all time.In the end this is a road movie. A movie about characters that change throughout their experiences and journey. I love how the movie starts with this young crew that don´t know what they are getting into. Starting in American territory, but the more they delve into the Vietnam territory, the more they see and do, the more their psyche breaks, loosing cloth and their regards for human life. They start out as just cool soldiers that thinks this is going to be fun, but slowly become like Willard an utter broken man. This sounds familiar to many other movies. War bad we get it, but the scope of the movie is what makes it.This is a greet anti-war dark comedy at times. A character like Kilgore that starts to want to surf in the middle of an active warzone. The propaganda, the girl shows that dehumanize women and later does to an even sadder degree, the French telling truths people aren´t ready for. This movie takes it a step back and analyses all the aspects of the Vietnam war in the most direct, uncuttable but also darkly cruel way that really worked for me. It tells you everything from as many perspectives as possible, making you question everything.I must say I felt a bit underwhelmed by the ending, but that´s the point. The movie leads you through it slowly, takes it´s time, makes you question everything you have heard and then delivers an anticlimax in the best way possible. While I see it as the point, it can feel a bit flat too.I love the later morbid disregard for human life everyone develops. The idea of a soldier dying but another person being worried about a dog is insane and it hits you right in the emotions because all of these people are utter broken, they can never come back from this. Life has become absolutely nothing to them and all the terror they have seen has broken them to a point where nothing really matters anymore.Since this is a road movie it´s different elements and scenes can feel a bit disjointed, I think they all serve the narrative, but I get why this movie was cut down. I liked all the aspects individually, but it can make the movie feel a bit bloated. But this is important to understand the decent. This is a road movie to hell. People starting happy and safe and slowly becoming more and more broken. The more they delve into the deeps of the jungle, the more they start to question themselves, their mission, who or what they are, what a life is and by the end even what taking a life has become. This is a great road movie, slowly peeling back the characters, slowly destroying them, and slowly showing us how far down humanity can go and what a person with nothing to live for looks and feels like.Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece on so many levels. Technically, production wise, cinematography, the concept itself all coming together to make a grand and epic movie that truly lives up to those descriptions, delivering cinema on a level I haven´t felt in a long time. This doesn't mean there aren´t some problems with it, and maybe after watching the theatrical cut it will change everything, but this movie is a masterclass in conceptual and visual storytelling and I can´t wait to watch it again already.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Visually stunning, easily Coppola's best","First of all let's get my beef out of the way.  I know this is a really stupid reason to give a movie only 9.5 out of ten instead of the 10 that it deserves, but Marlon Brando bugs me.  In this movie, he was on screen for no more than fifteen minutes.  He was paid an exhorbitant amount of money and he was nothing but a problem on the set.  He was constantly too high to do his lines by heart, he was so fat and out of shape that Coppola had to do his scenes in a different shade of light just to make him look plausible as a soldier.  His attitude alone put the film over-budget and behind schedule and that bothers me.  When one person thinks he is bigger than the collective whole, it takes away from the experience of watching the film. It was impossible for me to watch Brando on screen and not cringe.  He was a disgrace to acting and to his profession and I am glad that he is no longer around Hollywood.  Having said all that, I will now get to what is good about Apocalypse Now.  And that is everything else.This is certainly one of the best films ever made and it is so because of how dark it is and how realistic it feels.  Martin Sheen is so brilliant that it is scary.  And of course who can forget Robert Duval's performance. But what makes this film over the top and the classic that it is, is Coppola's attention to detail.  The helicopters flying in the background, the explosions over the horizon, the unseen enemy lurking imminently in the darkness.  This is the first war movie that I had seen that made me think I knew what the horrors of war were really about.  With everything this movie stands for, it is a shame that it lost best director that year and it is really a tragedy that Kramer vs. Kramer beat it out for best picture. What a terrific film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Vietnam-ish war movie,"Although this movie is less grounded in reality and historical accuracy, it remains one of the better Vietnam era war movies to be released in my opinion.

My favorite Coppola film,"You might think, ""You like it more than Godfather?"" Yeah, I do. I love how intense, disturbing, and psychological this movie is. And I greatly respect how ambitious of an undertaking it was. Plus, you only grow to appreciate the movie more after you learn about all of the hell everyone went through to make it.The cinematography is beautiful.The score is haunting.The characters are interesting and well-defined.The acting is phenomenal.The dialogue is quotable.The story is simple but effective.The violence is disturbing.The action set pieces are pretty much flawless. There are some very noticeable splicing of two differently played out scenes but considering what they went through to make the movie there's an excuse. Plus, it's not distracting.My only real complaint is the movie feels really long. Though maybe there's an argument to be made that that was the objective. The movie is trying to exhaust you. It certainly does that.I know a lot of people are split on the ending. I think it fits the movie really well. And I love how it's spliced together with the animal slaughter.It's one of the best movies ever made for a reason and, in my opinion, it is Coppola at his best.

A psychological journey into the human heart of darkness.,"""Apocalypse Now"" has been hailed as not only one of the best war films ever made but as one of the greatest films ever created. The mighty status is definitely earned but on an individual level, must be discovered after several careful viewings. It's a film with much depth, substance, and meaning than one can divulge in one viewing. It's a profound piece of cinema that continues to stagger above the rest as a fiction with a lot to say.Francis Ford Coppola and his incredible team achieved what could be the creative climax of his career. Based on the novella by Joseph Conrad (having read the book I believe inspired might be a more appropriate word), the story follows a U.S. military captain and chronicles his journey up the Vietnam and Cambodia river to find and terminate a rouge Colonel.Technically, the film, both the theatrical and redux versions both show superior craftsmanship in not only telling a great story but in suggesting feelings and thoughts to the audience through meticulous editing, sound, music, and cinematography. Edited by the great Walter Murch, ""Apocalypse Now"" is cut together beautifully with tremendously enthralling pacing and tempo. Even with the redux version clocking in at over three hours, the film never feels dull or uninteresting. Each sequence presents something new to think about and ponder and adds to the previous sequence.Of the few academy awards it won, cinematography contributed highly to the film's overall atmosphere and meaning. Providing nuance and complexity to the characters, this film is shot gorgeously with dreamlike contrast and surreal color. As the story progresses, we see how the filmmakers used the lighting of day to tell the story in the editing room. The beginning of the film reflects a lighter sunrise feel to the picture as the journey begins. Near the end, we gradually see less and move towards the sunset of the story. Until the very climax shot in the dark twilight of night. As the cinematographic aesthetics reflect the gradual change in character through the darkness, so too does the audience take the journey along until they no longer know how they feel or what they think.Narratively speaking, the story's progression and sequences of events may be off-putting to some viewers. Some have complained that the film's direction is random and confusing which makes it difficult to understand the theme of the piece. I would say it's important to understand that ""Apocalypse Now"", much like ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad, is allegorical. It's a symbolic and psychological journey into the darkness of the human heart. Each scene does indeed not only become easier to accept over several viewings, but the meaning behind each scene is there.For any film-lover, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a must see. Each piece of the film provides a profound commentary on the human condition while also making anti-war statements which have always been relevant. It's a film for those who are ready to surrender and be completely affected by what the film has to say. It may not be for everyone but it sure is an experience that must be felt by everyone. In my opinion, ""Apocalypse Now"" is indeed one of the greatest films ever made and continues to impress me with each viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Insanity and Hell on Earth,"APOCALYPSE NOW is not a war movie. Or at least, it's no more a war movie than Joseph Conrad's novel THE HEART OF DARKNESS, from which this movie was adapted, is about British imperialism. Therefore, nitpicking this film's military anachronisms is rather silly. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is instead a study of man's dark side, where the utilization of primordial instincts can lead to insanity and ultimately Hell on Earth.Coppola's take on Conrad's vision of this dark side is absolutely brilliant. The film moves you closer and closer until finally Hell on Earth is ultimately reached, and Satan takes the form of the insane Col. Walter Kurtz, chillingly portrayed by Marlon Brando. Equally brilliant is the transformation of the film's protagonist, Capt. Willard, into a killer who in his own words ""understands a thing or two about Col. Kurtz that he didn't before.""Martin Sheen's portayal of Capt. Willard is utilitarian, but he does shine, particularly in the scenes with Brando, where Willard is held captive in Kurtz's compound.  Robert Duvall's all-too-brief appearance in the film as the nutty surfer-wannabe Col. Bill Kilgore is without a doubt the film's finest performance, as acknowledged by an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Other notable performances include Frederic Forrest as Chef and Lawrence Fishburne's film debut as Clean. All-in-all, this film was brilliantly acted.APOCALYPSE NOW is not only one of the few films brave enough to tackle this controversial subject matter, but it also does so better than any other film I have ever seen. Furthermore, the haunting images: Hueys flying through the fire of Napalm Hell, Col. Kurtz lurking in the shadows, and Capt. Willard rising out of the water with machete in hand looking chillingly Kurtz-like,  are the kind that stay with you forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Not a (Vietnam) war movie but a green hell on earth!,"Two days ago I saw Apocalypse Now for the very first time and I was astounded by it. I had never seen a movie like it. The camera work was beautiful and some of the scenes were almost surreal. Great and fascinating characters, especially Brando's and Duvall's. The first hour and a half of suspense before Kurtz appeared for the first time so you could see for yourself what happened to him was very well done. And when he finally appeared the movie didn't collapse due to the built up suspense and promises. This movie goes beyond the Vietnam conflict. Unlike war movies like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon this movie doesn't only show the atrocities of war but the very insanity of the human concept of war. This movie shows a view of hell on earth created by man and also the heavenly beauty of nature. Which makes it a green hell.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"it is a classic among classics, best Vietnam war movie","This will stand out as the best Vietnam films that there is, its explicit description of war and its vast effect on the mind of those who are engaged in it are well shown. The movie is exactly the meaning of the Neville Chamberlain quote ""In war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners, but all are losers."" Not a huge fan of war movies, but some just stand out Saving Private Ryan (1998) is one, and Apocalypse Now is another. The details in the movie, the progression from the point of kill to the execution and ""The Horror the horror"" the horror of war, mass killing and the genocide are so well depicted in this movie. Kudos has to go to Francis Ford Coppola who produced and directed this movie.Boasting of excellent cinematography, as you watch you just have to appreciate the great camera views the movie depletes, the light effects are so well done to make sure you get the feel of being in a jungle.Apocalypse Now is a 1979 epic war film set during the Vietnam War, its story revolves around two characters U.S. Army special operations officer Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) and U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando).Willard was sent on a special mission to kill Kurtz, who is believed to be insane. The movie is about the journey from where Willard is seen going to the psychological effects of war, to where he was called and sent on the mission. His mission led him to meet more soldiers each having a different mechanism of coping with the war.Willard's journey led him to Kurtz who is worshipped by the locals and he sits high as a king among them.The movie production went on for over 3 years with Coppola thinking he will never finish the movie, with Typhoon Olga ruining the set at one time, the theft of the entire payroll, Marlon Brando showing up over weight the movie looked like something that was not forth coming but Coppola pulled it off in the end making a masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come If you are not a fan of animal cruelty the movie's ending is not for you, even I that I can't seem to care less about animal cruelty was moved by the ritual of the local Ifugao tribe, the ritual involves the butchering of a water buffalo in such a cruel manner.The last words of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is one that has been used popularly in the cinematic universe ""The Horror. the horror.""

Undoubtedly one of the best 10 movies ever made,"This movie is not an attempt at a ""realistic"" depiction of the Viet Nam war. This movie was made for a movie audience, not for of bunch of Vets, who still wear their fatigues and army jackets (which had to have been purchased from an Army surplus store, since the army won't let you keep the ones they loaned you) and want to relive the ""horror"" that they claim to be trying to get over.

Weird portrayal of insanity that prevailed in different forms by those who fought in the Vietnam wars...,"1st watched 6/3/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Francis Coppola): Weird portrayal of insanity that prevailed in different forms by those who fought in the Vietnam wars.  This is much more than a war movie.  It is about ""the horror""(as Brando's character echoes) that consumes human being when they seek after power and meaning in a totally messed-up world. Coppola usually works with extremes which reveals what he is up to in his movies.  The real star of the movie is Martin Sheen because he is there from beginning to end, although Brando got more attention.  Sheen's character is a man who knows nothing but the war and could not leave to go to any other setting.  He is summoned to hunt down Kurtz in Cambodia(outside of our war zone) and is told that he has lost his senses and is leading a group of natives and basically has become their God.  Sheen and a few navy people head up the Nam river to find Kurtz and run into a few strange people along the way.  One (an officer played by Robert Duvall) is more concerned with surfing than being an officer in the war.  What makes this picture works is that the insanity doesn't end.  Kurtz is found and after Sheen's character spends some time with him, he does his duty.  This is insanity in itself because he realizes that Kurtz is no worse than anyone else when he gets there but does not stop himself.

"Psychotically, Ungodly, Gloriously Perfect","Let me come out and say it: this is the best movie about the Vietnam War. I'd call it the Schindler's List of Vietnam, but it's possible that one of these days, they will make a better WWII movie than Schindler's List. They will never make a better Vietnam War movie than Apocalypse Now. In fact, they will likely never make a better war movie than Apocalypse Now. No film has ever described war better. Describing war is not just about describing the bombs that go off or the people whose lives are affected. If that's all there was, The Hurt Locker would be as good of a film as this is. And it's not.No. Describing war involves personifying it, portraying it as an animal or a reaper or, in this film's case, a maddening plague. This movie is often described as being anti-war, but I don't think that's accurate. There are very few anti-war movies, and they are all terrible. The great war movies involve conveying the experience to the audience, and letting them feel it for themselves.And there's no film that does a better job of that than Apocalypse Now.That is one of the all time great movie titles, by the way. The word 'apocalypse' conjures up images of a destroyed future aka Terminator or some fantastical force ruining everything, like Sauron in TLotR. But this movie doesn't concern itself with all that. It is not talking about some far off or fantastical apocalypse. It is talking about an apocalypse in the world right now, hence the name 'Apocalypse Now.' And notice that it doesn't just throw out this term; it enforces it. The napalm-drenched skies look like a war zone, yes, but they also look like harbingers of the end of the world. Think of the tone of this movie. It is hopeless and maddening and often nihilistic, just like a movie about the end of the world would be. Coppola makes the case that the Vietnam War is comparable to the end of the war in environment and mood and happenings.There are two versions of this movie. There is the original cut, released in the 70's, and there is also the Redux Cut, released in 2001. The original cut is better, but not significantly so. Anyone who's already watched the film should give the Redux Cut a shot, but any newbies should stick to the original. Either way, it's a long haul. The original cut clocks in at about three hours, and the Redux is about twenty minutes longer.Our main character is Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who is sent to assassinate a rogue colonel, played famously by Marlon Brando. Madness ensues.If you look closely, you can see a very young Lawrence Fishburne. He was only fourteen when he auditioned, so he lied about his age to get the role. The funny thing is, by the time this film was finished, he was almost eighteen years old.Why did the movie take so long to make? Because it had one of if not the most troubled productions of all time.I don't have time to list out everything that went wrong, so I'll just talk about one example. Anyone who's seen the movie knows the helicopter scene. Not a lot of people know that the music- Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries- which plays during it is supposed to evoke the Nazi army, but I digress. Those choppers had to be given back to the country from which they were borrowed- The Philippines- because they had to be used for actual war.As I said, it is either to say what went right during filming than what went wrong. It's kinda like the Vietnam War, now that I think about it.Most films try to either manipulate the audience's emotions or get them running. This film manages to do both. It shakes your emotions free of their coffers, then takes control of them. Every time I watch this movie, I am shaken. It is ungodly perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
the horror,This is one of the greatest films that i have ever seen. For some reason i waited for a long time to see this movie. I don't know why i waited so long though. If you ever had any intentions to see this movie go for it. It is amazing. I found that it was easy to get into but you have to pay attention to everything or you will miss out. I saw the Redux version with the extra footage. It was great. I was not alive during the Vietnamm War so this was a giant history lesson for me. I thought everything about it was great. I found that the colors in this movie were very vibrant it many have just been me thought. Brando was of course fabulous. Dennis Hopper was also very good in this film and Martin Sheen was amazing. Definitely check this movie out. 10-10,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Greatest Film Ever Made?,"Well, I happen to think so.  I tend to judge films on their emotional impact and I've never seen another film that is as viscerally involving as this one.  The film actually gets more disturbing after multiple viewings when you know what is coming.  Then the awful events loom over you instead of sneaking up on you. The film has a flimsy plot which it derives from it's source material, Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness.""  While it employs the structure of Willard's boat journey up a river to find Kurtz it employs it to different meaning. Conrad's novel was a deconstruction of colonialism but Coppola's subject is war.  But he famously said, ""My film isn't about Vietnam.  It is Vietnam."" Coppola's film isn't really interested in the specific politics of the Vietnam War.  The extent to which it is even really a ""war"" film is debatable. Truffaut said it was impossible to make an anti-war film because film by it's energy tends to argue for war by making it seem exciting.  This film uses that fact intentionally.  The horror of war is brought home to us not by our witnessing it, but by our taking part in it.  Apocalypse Now's technique is to create an anti-war film not by having us critique war from the outside, but by involving us in the actual thing itself.  We are forced to confront our own heart of darkness as a result.  We must look within ourselves and see how we would have reacted in the same circumstances. What is the meaning of war?, is the final question of the film.  The film has come under criticism because the ending does not provide a tidy resolution for this theme.  But the resolution is the arc of the entire movie.  When we get to the heart of the darkness at the center of war we don't find any answer that is expressed in intellectual terms.  That is the film's ultimate message: war is not a product of our intellect but of our deepest human nature, our human heart of darkness. Do you think yourself the master of your own heart of darkness?  So did Kurtz...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct.","One of Kubrick's best and certainly the most gut-wrenching & cerebral films. This isn't your typical warfilm of ""them and us"" and it would be a mistake to think of this film in the same context as Platoon or SPR.This is a far more implicit, personal tale of a Captain's insular view of a world finally gone mad - there are so many one-liners throughout the film that signpost to good effect the blatant contradictions of America's true purpose in this war - Kurtz is a top Colonel of the old school; a tactical genius who finally flips when his own side declares that he murdered rather than ""killed"" spies even though all the evidence pointed in his favour.Other contradictions include the summary above - of a man who has gone beyond acceptable human conduct. And yet you get US aircraft dumping napalm on remote villages maiming women & children.Sheen's Captain Willard's mind is full of these contradictions to the extent that he is gradually losing focus on what his true purpose is out there. His only solace is drugs & booze while praying/dreading the next mission: a mission into the heart of darkness.The entire film is really nothing more than what is going on in Willard's deug induced chaotic mind - there are so many unbalanced things going on: kids surfing, tanning and listening to Jimi Hendrix, Bunny Girls appearing & disappearing out of the Heavens; a photo journalist high on drugs but full on poetic enlightenment!Wherever he looks he sees conspiracy to cover up other people's concepts of indiscretion. Later he meets Lieutenant Kilgore (apt surname) supremely played by Duvell, who seems to consider finding the best time & place to surf more important than carrying out his mission. But even after one particular battle he comes reflective that very soon the war is going to end even though he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning"". There is no happiness in his voice at the thought of the war ending, far from it, he wants it to last forever because that gives him (and perhaps many other one-dimensional officers) a purpose, a political (not moral) reason; an excuse to carry out their actions with impunity; and yet at the same time Willard has to hunt down & kill a decent General on a trumped up charge, because ""he has gone beyond the pale""!It goes on & on, the bulls__t never ends; and this is Coppola's message. American 4 star generals blame their own mistakes on others and want those mistakes ""terminated with extreme prejudice"". Kurtz proved to a  thorn in their side and want him ""terminated"" but for not obeying orders to kill only those they want him to kill.If you've seen the documentary you will be aware of how much time, effort & money (and health!) it took to get the printed word onto film and in my judgement it is perhaps the best movie indictment of America's protracted stay in Vietnam, and more specifically, Cambodia. (a film even Oliver Stone would be proud of)The acting, with the exception of Brando, is truly breathtaking, especially from Sheen as a man high on booze & drugs and who can flip is normally cool manner with acts of sudden violence & aggression (the machine gun attack on the boat)Brando, I feel, ruined the movie; more so when you read about his exploits off it. He really didn't give a s**t about the book or Coppola's vision, so the committment & acting you do finally see from him is really just bogus. The ending seemed like an afterthought and wasn't very well executed after such a long & dramatic beginning.You have to see this film time & time again because it is an insane vision seen from an insane mind during and insane war where drugs or bullets are the only true means of escape.If you want simplicity go see Platoon; if you want a guilty conscience on behalf of your own past Governments rent this and wonder how this could ever have been allowed to happen!*****/*****",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Good movie, but Redux had a hard time keeping my interest","What is clearly one of the greatest war epics on film, and an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's book Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now Redux has a gripping story, very inspired acting, and deep characters. The only problem, if any, is the length. Redux, you see, is wonderful and fast-paced for the entire first hour, after which seems to drop off. I realize that the mood of the movie is intended to make this shift, as the story gets darker, but it doesn't seem as exciting. The movie begins with such promise of the satire and dark comedy of war films, and then becomes straight-faced drama. Still, this is a wonderful movie, with amazing acting and a compelling story, just don't expect it to be the same throughout.If you've read Heart of Darkness, or are supposed to read it, don't expect this movie to follow it any further than general plot.Apocalypse Now Redux gets an A for being an amazing movie, with many parts that stick in the viewer's mind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Masterpiece!,"This is, quite simply, one of the finest motion pictures ever. The acting, the atmosphere, the setting, the acting performances. This is truly one of the finest films. Virtually every scene is breathtaking, and portrays the horror and inhumanity of Vietnam extremely well.I thought Martin Sheen's portrayal was simply perfect. His is a subdued character, almost in a daze most of the time. For whatever reasons, he has virtually become almost a killing machine, and has learned to cope by coldly calculating everything around him. There is a sense of uneasiness about him, though, as you feel this is someone who used to believe in the idealistic notions of being a soldier, and fighting wars, and who has come to understand that his idealistic notions will never be realized. This conflict is played out in the now-famous hotel room scenes near the beginning of the movie. There is a sense of sickness and mental derangement, as he goes through the motions of behaving like a real military officer. You understand, though, that all he is is an assassin. That's all his leaders want him for, and if his damaged psyche and mind allow him to carry out his missions, so be it. Martin Sheen is simply superb in the role. I believe he has been somewhat underrated as an actor, but he has done some fine character work, and he simply shines in this.This is a coldly dysfunctional military. You wonder who the real madmen are, Colonel Kurtz, or the men who seek his death. This is a theme explored by Captain Willard as he travels up the river. All the while he wonders the same thing, he knows his mission, what is expected of him, is to carry out the assassination of Kurtz. He knows, for all the unfairness of singling out a man of Kurtz's character and ability, Kurtz simply cannot be allowed to carry on. Kurtz is mentally deranged, and there is no hope for his recovery. As long as he is operating freely in a combat zone, he is a serious threat to the military effort, and to military forces, in Vietnam.The movie leaves you feeling disturbed, and wondering about the men who lived through these circumstances and, eventually, returned to life at home.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A 'road movie' war film that incorporates just about everything you'd want in both genres and much more.,"Apocalypse Now is a great film full of great things. People compare it to Saving Private Ryan as the best war film of all time and although I probably prefer Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now is still up there amongst it. A reoccurring quote from Apocalypse Now towards its dramatic concluding twenty minutes is 'the horror' and what a great thematic quote to use, not only as the film's tagline but also as a statement to sum up what goes on in Apocalypse Now and to sum up the Vietnam War in general. Apocalypse Now has a theme already and thus; scores points with me before it's even begun.Apocalypse Now is just full of the basics done brilliantly. The cinematography, the mise-en-scene, the atmosphere, the voiceovers powered by the screenplay  they all combine in pretty much every scene and deliver on such a level, it's so very difficult not to like. It truly sucks you into the film and into Vietnam. What the backbone of Apocalypse Now is that makes it so great is that its story is that of a single line journey; Apocalypse Now is a war based 'road movie' since it takes place down one stretch of track (a river) and involves the protagonist Benjamin Willard (Sheen) and his 'crew' getting into all sorts of conflict and adventures which is something that these sorts of films have that I just love.When people think of Vietnam films, they think of the jungle and jungle warfare. Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and We Were Soldiers are all acclaimed in their own right but Apocalypse Now moves away from the jungle in a way that feels so refreshing and new, it makes for fantastic viewing. There is so much to read out of this film, it's incredible. The first 'taste' of warfare we get is presented to us much like it is in Saving Private Ryan although it doesn't come as soon: it's presented in a state of absolute chaos. We have several choppers flying along, music blaring out, cut to the village they're about to attack: calm and peaceful until the American's arrive: more chaos, shouting, gunfire, orders being passed down, destroyed buildings bridges and cars as well as distressed villagers. What makes them even greater then what they actually start out as is when the American's actually start to struggle in their fight as a chopper is destroyed and someone is brutally injured in the fire fight. Epic, truly epic and a fantastic introduction to the warfare to expect.The journey not only of discovery but of self discovery Willard undergoes in fascinating in its own right. The numerous incidences involving things like: the supply boat they search, the bridge checkpoint they reach and the trench encounter as well as the ambush from the jungle they suffer and the scene after that when someone is lying there dead whilst a tape from home plays over a shot of their corpse  it's all ingenious film-making. One such scene I loved was following the girlie show the Americans have that descends into chaos, Willard states that the Vietcong's idea of nightly entertainment probably consists of 'a bowl of rice and something nice and simple'. I feel this is a statement of how something that should have gone so straightforward (a girlie show and the winning of the Vietnam war) can quickly get really out of hand and thus, turn into a mess.If there is a criticism, then it occurs during the final act of Apocalypse Now. The film goes from a war film with a mission and a plan to a much darker, more disturbing display of a character gone mad (Kurtz  Brando) in a dystopia full of strange characters, disorientating settings and a cow getting hacked up but this is in no way a major criticism. The film does slow down slightly when Willard is caged and spoken to through the character of a photojournalist (Hopper) and Kurtz just seems to be on the brink of a philosophical breakthrough one minute but spouting rubbish the next in almost all of his scenes. The payoff, however, as the mission reaches its climax is superb.There's no doubt that I really enjoyed Apocalypse Now and although Kramer vs. Kramer is still great; how this and Saving Private Ryan lost out on the best picture awards in their respective years is still beyond me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Peek into the Heart of Darkness,"I actually went and saw the movie again (had seen it a long time ago when I was too young to make up a valid opinion) because I read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the inspiration for the film.The film is good and of course criticizing the movie for not following the book would be missing the point as we're not dealing with a film adaptation. What struck me was how deeper and more terrible the book was, being a clearer look into the minds of darkness, thus getting it's point better across.There are points the movie gets very well across, such as how alien everything is to the young American servicemen and how different their war is to the war the Viet Cong fight. Maybe Coppola is just trying to get too much across in the movie. It sometimes feels a bit schizophrenic, switching from realism(?) to almost absurdity with people tripping over to madness in one act. Of course, there are valid stylistic/artistic reasons for doing that but I'm not thoroughly convinced straight after seeing the movie.Still, the movie is for the most parts visually well made, even stunning at time, and the story is interesting enough.

Thoughtful and Compelling,"Director of Photography Vittorio Storaro and Production Designer Dean Tavoularis are the real stars of Francis Ford Coppola's epic rumination on the nature of battle. Tavoularis has fashioned a convincing replica of Vietnam with an eye towards the shifting landscapes both of the terrain and the American infiltration of it; and Storaro's deep focus tracking camera captures all the verdancy of the land and the orange explosions that come to describe the sky above. The remainder is also impressive: Coppola, along with co-scriptwriter John Milius, has written a thoughtful, compelling visualization of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"" and the conclusions they reach (that adherence to innate rules of combat is more moral than the civility of organized war) make sense in the context of Vietnam. The visuals don't capture the heartbreak of assault as fully as one would like (Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" would surpass it on that level) but it remains compulsively watchable even as it grows increasingly moody and reserved.

COPPOLA'S VISUALLY STUNNING CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE IS WITHOUT PEER,"Francis Ford Coppola's controversial, visual stunning, and dramatically charged classic Vietnam War epic is one of the most important cinematic achievements of the 20th century. It concerns a U.S. Army assassin Captain Benjamin Willard, remarkably played by Martin Sheen in a haunting tour-de-force performance, who is given a hazardous mission upriver into Cambodia to track down and terminate with ""extreme prejudice,' a renegade officer who has gone insane, Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in superbly effective performance, who leads his legion of Montaghard tribesmen on random genocide missions. The trip upriver becomes a mesmerizing odyssey full of surreal encounters. This brilliant film has some of the most amazing scenes ever filmed, like the famous Huey helicopter gunship attack on a Vietcong village led by Robert Duvall as Lt. Col. Kilgore in an monumental Oscar nominated performance for Best Supporting Actor. Kilgore loves to play Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as his fleet of helicopter gunships bombards the villagers. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Coppola that truly captures the hellishness and insanity of the Vietnam War, with staggering Oscar winning cinematography by Vittorio Storer, and a wonderfully eerie original score by Carmine Coppola and Francis Ford Coppola, and magnificent production design by Dean Tavoularis. Impeccable supporting performances by Fredric Forrest, Dennis Hopper, Albert Hall, Lawrence Fishburne, Samuel Bottoms, Harrison Ford, and G.D. Sprain. An unforgettable and hallucinogenic cinematic experience that was nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture.

comment,"""Apocalypse Now"" could very well be considered Francis Ford Coppola's ""Hells Angels."" Quite possibly anything that could have prevented the film to continue shooting happened. In the jungles of the Philippines, people got sick, people got hurt, and people got sent home. The story of ""Apocalypse Now"" is that of pure insanity. In the beginning of the film when Martin Sheen (Captain Willard) is dispatched by some higher ups in the army to go on a secret mission to assassinate a renegade Colonel everyone is relatively sane. As Coppola's epic film progresses and grows, so does the insanity of everyone on the boat taking Martin Sheen's character up river. Deeper and deeper into the jungle they go, the further away from ""society"" they get and the more primitive things become to them. Starting out with modern warfare such as napalm, planes, and machine guns quickly turn into rocks, arrows and spears. Willard narrates most of the movie as he reads his mission briefs or scouts upcoming bends in the river. Set on his mission Willard keeps in mind what he is after, thus making him more immune to the disease of insanity, whereas, his shipmates have no idea why they are going up river and what they are getting themselves into, hence why they start to lose it before Captain Willard. When they finally reach the camp of Colonel Kurtz, they find that the natives love him and his wisdom. Mostly because they probably haven't been subjected to such power before he came along. By the time the deed is done, Willard has become so immersed into his character of this guy who is suppose to kill this other guy, that he is completely unfazed by what he does and walks slowly back to his boat and goes home.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
My greatest movie experience!,"Diane and I watched this movie last night many years after our first viewing when it was initially released and we both were almost incredulous at the complexity, power and brilliance of the movie. I had thought that Deer Hunter was the most important and powerful movie to originate from the Vietnam War but after last night I realise that I was badly mistaken. In a way I did not understand that it was possible to make a movie as powerful as Apocalypse Now; I did not realise that one person could assemble the actors and the script and select the camera shots that could produce what we watched last night.Beyond the superb movie making, there is the consideration about the film's alleged anti-Americanism because of the surreal overview of the war. Personally, from my reading and absorption of war visuals, I found the movie all too real. Of course Coppolla exaggerated, massively, but this exaggeration was based on the truth of this extraordinarily nasty war. As crazy as he made events look, read a book called ""Bloods-An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans"" and I am sure you will finish it thinking that Apocalypse Now was almost a fairy tale. Maybe many veterans do not want to admit to themselves the horrors that America inflicted on an innocent people but it did happen.I am not a complete neophyte with cinema although I do confess to a huge lack regarding the technicalities and subtleties of the movie making process; however, after having said this even I was amazed at the quality of each individual scene which, under a lesser hand, could have constituted an entire movie project on its own.

Remember the weird beauty of the massed helicopters lifting over the trees in the long shot, and the insane power of Wagner's music, played loudly during the attack, and you feel what Coppola was getting at: Those moments as common in life as art, when the whole huge grand mystery of the world, so terrible, so beautiful, seems to hang in the balance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Some of the imagery he uses in this film is very powerful and yet in many occasions it can be almost subliminal.Divine!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Truly Amazing Film and One of My Favorites,"Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic stands out as one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. I regret that it wasn't until 2005 that I finally made an effort to see this film but I'm eternally grateful that I eventually did. I am personally a fan of the 2001 extended REDUX re-release though the original is still an amazing piece of work. The film follows Captain Benjamin Willard as he embarks on a classified mission into the jungles of Cambodia to hunt down the estranged Colonel Walter Kurtz, who has broken off from the military and embedded himself deep in the jungle. He has established himself as a deity over a native tribe and the military has deemed his methods ""unsound"". Over the course of the journey down the river, we witness how the horrors of the war affect Captain Willard and the crew of the PBR Street Gang.I've seen this film countless times at this point and, even at it's over three hour run-time (for the REDUX version), it never ceases to amaze me. I really can't say enough about this film, as I truly loved everything about it: the perfect casting, the beautiful cinematography, the interesting characters, and the feeling it gives as I watch these characters slowly change over the course of the movie. Vittorio Storaro did an amazing job with this film; I loved his use of light and shadow (especially in the final act) and his use of color throughout the film. His Academy Award for this film was well-deserved. Coppola shot this entire film in the Philippines and the story of the film's creation is just as enthralling as the film itself; if you are able, I highly recommend listening to Coppola's commentary on the DVD or, if you can find it, do yourself a favor and watch his wife's documentary HEART OF DARKNESS.The heart of this film lies in the intriguing characters. From the start, the character of Willard (Martin Sheen) has had his life ruined by Vietnam. His wife divorced him and all he can focus on is the next mission. As he traverses the river, reading Kurtz's dossier and witnessing travesty after travesty of the war, we witness changes in him and we begin to wonder if he's beginning to understand the ""madness"" of Kurtz. Colonel Kurtz is infamously portrayed by Marlon Brando and, despite the notorious problems on-set with the actor, I loved the cold, strong demeanor Brando brings to the character. We see what Kurtz has become through his time in the jungle and we may even begin to sympathize with him (or at least see what he meant to accomplish).The supporting characters in the film are equally as impressive as the main players with Dennis Hopper as the tripped-out photo-journalist at Kurtz's compound (one of my favorite characters) and Robert Duvall's Oscar-nominated performance as surf-enthusiast Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore of the Air Cavalry in one of the film's most memorable (and often imitated) sequences. Accompanying Willard on his mission is the crew of the PBR Street Gang, including a young Laurence Fishburne his first major film role. I loved the character of Lance Johnson (Sam Bottoms), California surf pro turn Vietnam soldier. He starts the film as your average young soldier but drugs and stress nearly make him a jungle native by the end.I truly adore this film and I hope the negativity surrounding it from some won't affect the decisions of those who may not have seen the film yet. I do recommend starting with the original theatrical and, if you find yourself wanting more, move on to the REDUX version. Every time I watch the film, I'm blown away and I hope those who are just now watching it for the first time feel the same. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Classic,"Yes, we all know that it's a classic, and we all know that it's based on ""The Heart of Darkness"" by Conrad, but there is more to it than that.  I get the sense that the director has taken the story and translated it into the context of his life, then translated that into a collective modern context that would make the connection comprehensible for us.  Ultimately it is an exploration of that hidden secret connection between good and evil.  Is evil really opposed to good, or does it just think it is?  Is evil, ultimately, merely a part of good, something that acts to produce it, test it, bring it out?  What is the PURPOSE of evil in the world?  How many of us have recoiled from the horrors of the world and asked, ""If there is a God, how can there be such a thing as evil?!""  This movie explores this question, in a quiet, persistent way that stirs us to our very souls.  Not for the feint of heart, but only for those who truly ask themselves deep questions and seek even deeper answers!-T",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
REDUX reward ! !,"I was amazed at just how good the new footage was.  Premiering at Cannes early in 2001, Coppola introduced us to a three hour plus version entitled 'Apocalypse Now Redux'.  I wasn't disappointed with any of it and actually prefer the new footage added to the old version.  It basically gives us a more towering introduction to Kilgore's character, his surfing antics gone awry, the mission boat's passengers meeting up with the Playboy bunnies later on down the river when their helicopter runs out of fuel and a scene of war politics discussed at a French plantation where Willard and his men land.  Little extra pieces appear at other points as well and 'Apocalypse Now', the most surreal film about Vietnam ever made, shows that with the problems that plagued its production, it probably turned out better since the people involved in the production went through hell, just as the men who fought there did.  Truly one of the top five war films of the 20th century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
an excellent film War with an epic scene of the helicopter.,"Apocalypse Now is considered the best war film of all time, and it really is a great movie, starting with the great direction of Francis Ford Coppola (trilogy The Godfather, The Conversation and Bram Stoker's Dracula), the cast is incredible, Martin Sheen this great (the cool thing is that years later his son, Charlie Sheen, would make another film about the Vietnam War, Platoon), the great Marlon Brando, which unfortunately does not appear so much more when it appears steals, Frederic Forest, Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, and etc., a strong cast, the action scenes are great, and has the epic scene that helicopter attack the village in Ride Sound of the Valkyries, incredible scene, the film has heavy scenes, as at the end when they sacrificed the ox, I found the very heavy scene, and the script of the film is good, Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece of war movies, epic scenes, great soundtrack, good photography, fine cast, most do not get to be my favorite movie of War, I think Platoon and Saving Private Ryan a little higher.

Madness always and everywhere,"In this movie everybody is insane and not only Colonel Kurtz because any war is insane in itself and can only produce insanity. Values are so much degraded that we cannot distinguish between right and wrong anymore. It's the story of a captain who during the Vietnam war is sent on a special mission aimed at killing a former American colonel who went insane and left the army to go into the jungle in Cambodia where he formed a private army with local tribesmen and went on fighting the war on his own making lots of atrocities. Horror is more or less his motto and his obsession. Besides that he is also a poet and a philosopher and this feature of his discourse fits well in his behaviour. The movie develops itself by showing the course of the captain on his way to colonel Kurz's stronghold on a small Navy boat up a river through the jungle. During that course he and the crew of the boat find themselves involved in several happenings showing the true face of war, some violent and some delirious like for instance in the beginning the attack of helicopters against a Vietcong position by the sea, accompanied by Wagner's ""The Valkyria"" commanded by a crazy Cavalry colonel insisting of surfing on the sea while bombs explode everywhere around; another delirious scene is when the boat on its course arrives to an army post where there is a musical show for the soldiers performed by a few Playboy bunnies coming from USA who in the end have to seek sudden refuge in the helicopter that had brought them to avoid being molested if not raped. Another curious but full of meaning sequence is when the boat arrives to an old plantation owned by a French family who refuses to leave despite the war. The conversation at dinner between the family members and the captain is rather interesting to follow showing how differently French and Americans faced the war going on there. The movie is well directed and well performed by the whole cast and Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurz who appears only in the end is not better than the rest. Most sequences are really moving and touching and composed by impressive images. Perhaps the only flaw of the movie are the last scenes, a bit too theatrical in relation to its general atmosphere.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Editing Achievement,"Whether or not you like the ""short"" version, you owe it to yourself to see the long version, i.e., ""Apocalpyse Now--Redux,"" to appreciate the amazing editing that went into the film to produce the short version.  It was not only brilliant, it was courageous.  I cannot imagine what was going through Coppola's head when he axed the sumptuous plantation scene, but he did it, and, in the final analysis, the scene WAS superfluous and unnecessary to the story.  The encounter with the USO Playboy Bunnies was also dropped, mercifully so.There were other more subtle edits that worked out well.  For example, in the long version, the Sam Bottoms character steals Robert Duvall's character's surf board.  This little bit of mischief, and Duvall's reaction to it, diminish Duvall's stature as the uber warrior, and dilute the impression he has made on us, the viewers.  Both are fully restored in the short version.The longer version does explain, however, what happened to little Larry Fishburne.  And the longer version also connects Sam Bottoms' drugged out, zoned out character to the fatalities that occur among the crew before the party reaches Kurtz and his command.  I got to where I despised the Bottoms character.  In the short version, he's just plain old ""Surfer Joe.""The two versions of this movie have given me a greater understanding of the painstaking process behind editing.As for the movie, it is a masterpiece, I think, but with a less than fully satisfactory ending, not unlike the United States' 13-year involvement in Viet Nam.  Maybe that was Coppola's point.The short version is not kind to Brando, but the long version restores some luster (but not much) to Brando's reputation.  The long version does help to develop Brando's character (Kurtz), which is needed.  Even so, Kurtz is a murky guy, just like the world he lives in, and I would have to think that they are the deliberate creations of Coppola.""Apocalypse Now"" is a superb depiction of war and all of its many ambiguities.  For a much earlier treatment, see Milestone's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1930).  Bravo, Mr. Coppola!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The most important Epic of the Baby Boomer Generation,"Apocalypse Now is not a Vietnam movie, its not even a war movie.  It is a modern-day Epic using the classical conventions of Homer to tell its story. From the opening chords of The Doors ""The End"" (which is a miniature version of ""Oedipus"" amongst other myths) we are given clues of the films epic aspirations.  All the elements are here:  The feeling that we enter a story in progress, like the Odyssey which begins on the journey home after the ten year war, helps to create a sense that Willard (Martin Sheen) has fought his physical war and is ready to move on to war with his self.  The unmistakable sense of journey which is snowballing toward an inevitable conclusion. And the obstacles faced by Willard on his journey, his nervous breakdown in the beginning of the film is like a battle of the Gods within himself preparing him for the next step of his life's journey, Kilgore (Robert Duvall) is the Cyclopse, the Playboy Bunnies are the Sirens, and the Dolong bridge is like the River Styx, the entrance to Hades, the point of no return, the screams from the fog are the Furies always in chaotic flux voicing their alienation, and Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is the insane (sane?) collective unconscious of the Gods.Apocalypse Now is not only an Epic it is THE Epic of its generation, the WWII Generation had Gone With the Wind, the Rock n'Roll Generation has Apocalypse Now.  The other important Epic of this Generation is the Star Wars Trilogy which fails in its rather conventional views on morality, its too tight, its too clean, the lines are too clearly drawn, what Star Wars gains in scope with its 3 films is lost in its lack of complexity.  The best film of the trilogy The Empire Strikes Back succeeds in being such due to its obvious relation to Greek Tragedy (afterall it does contain one of the greatest reversals in film history).  There is an inherent danger in reducing the inner conflict of good and evil down to something as simple as black vs. white, like the Star Wars films do.  Lets face it, nothing in life is that simple, and the minute we start believing they are is the minute we start coming apart.  Apocalypse Now succeeds precisely because it does come apart, it shows what happens to men in desperate situations and consequently warns us of the dangers of these situations.  By the end of the film we aren't sure who is right and who is wrong.  When Willard kills Kurtz we don't feel a burden lifted, instead we feel uneasy, because we know there is a little Kurtz in all of us.  Any movie that attempts to get an audience to confront these feelings, is no longer just a movie, it transcends to Myth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The plot is moving super slowly, many scenes are long and unnecessary, you learn nothing about the Vietnam war and if the point was to show the horror of war god damn there are ton of movies that do it better and evoke much stronger feelings to the viewer. The only interesting part in this movie was to see Martin Sheen perform in what is supposed to be his best acting movie but that alone couldn't save this absolute borefest, although I have to admit he did a good job.

Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen between animal and god,"With ""Apocalypse Now"" Francis Ford Coppola transfers Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" tale into the 20th century and makes it part of the horrors of the Vietnam war. The result is a beautifully shot, highly suspenseful and entertaining movie, which can be labeled THE war movie with all bells and whistles in a scope rarely seen before in similar productions. Staggering cinematography, an excellent script, a crisp and vivid tapestry of sound and musical ambiance, the perfect use of location and of course the cast - with bit players like Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne or Harrison Ford -, all contribute to a cinematic event of the grand scale.Most remarkable of course are the performances of the two main characters - for one protagonist Martin Sheen (who plays Captain Willard) and the one he's searching for deep in the Cambodian jungles, the decorated US commander gone mad, Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando). The build-up to the encounter alone already keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat, and the pay-off is condensed in the intense and unnerving final minutes of the film. While we get there more and more questions are raised about the nature of the war that is being fought, as madness isn't only waiting on that other end of the journey, but becomes a principle in itself on the way - thus questioning the mission, the causes and the means: Man's position between animal and god is uncertain, but as self-assigned master over life and death his decline into madness only seems like a natural reaction...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

This film is a masterpiece. I have to disagree with some reviewers who thought that the French plantation scene was unnecessary. I thought that to have a French perspective on the war (after all, they'd been there, done that ! )  added a lot to the story. Superb in every way. My only other comment, if you are in your twenties, for instance, make a date for yourself to see it again in whatever format will be around in 20 years time.

this is a twice-told tale,"Perhaps I missed this in other comments, but I have not seen anyone recognize the fact that this movie is a film version a novel. Titled Heart of Darkness, it is set in Dutch-controlled Colonial Africa. The book was written in the late 1800's, I think. Most of the characters are the same, just tweaked a little bit. Thought you all would enjoy this bit of trivia.Kurz is in the book, too. He even says ""The horror...the horror."" Coppolla's work is awesome, considering that he has fantastically translated that book into a Vietnam-war movie. The fact that he was able to use the same characters, and some of the same words is amazing, and that he completely switched the time and place from traveling up the Congo in the 1800's to Vietnam is a phenomenal piece of work.Apocalyse Now proves that a director who follows his own instinct will make a masterpiece, rather than a director who will kneel down to voices from the big studio.

what an amazing movie !,"Apocalypse Now was made in 1979 by Francis Ford Coppola. This film takes place during the Vietnam war. Captain Willard is sent by his superiors to Cambodia for a secret mission that « does not exist ». During this undercover operation, Willard has to find and assassinate Colonel Kurtz , a highly decorated Green Beret who has gone insane during the war. Kurtz is now in the jungle in Cambodia where a local tribe worships him and obeys to his orders. Willard and his crew go up the river which will lead them to Kurtz in a US patrol boat. Along the way, they encounter several interesting characters such as Captain Kilgore who is more concerned with surfing the waves than with the death of the soldiers and the outcome of the war. This movie shows how Willard confronts the horrors of human brutality, hypocrisy and the violence of war that drove Kurtz into insanity. During the whole film, Willard details his thoughts and discovers the darkness of his own heart. Usually I am not a fan of war films. However I really liked this one, mostly because it is not only about men on a battlefield, gunshots and blood but it also focuses on the psychological consequences that war has on soldiers.On top of that, I was surprised by the amount of aspects of war that are treated in this movie : the use of drugs in the US army, the mentality of destruction that Captain Kilgore embodies etc.I won't forget Apocalypse Now because it delivers a reflexion about moral issues : there are not good and bad guys but men lost into the madness of war.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The madness and insanity inside us, on screen","Movie visuals are something of an elusive art. Sometimes you see them sometimes you don't. In this movie, I don't really see much. But I guess when the movie was made (1979) it was on a class of its own.It is about Lt. Willard's (Sheen) hunt for the mysterious renegade Special Forces officer Col. Kurtz (Brando). The journey that Willard had to trek was an arduous and dangerous one. And very mental too. As the journey to Kurtz got closer, the more we can see what kind of madness reside in him (Kurtz). And it all ends in a very satisfying finale.This is one of those movies that portrays war in its true colors. Black, that is. The blackest black that creeps every soldiers' footsteps, ready to take them over once they cross their own respective limits. We all have limits, different only in terms of threshold.I wasn't even born when the Vietnam war was waged. But after seeing this movie, I had some perspective of the mental ordeal that each soldier had to put up to.Brando's character Kurtz is brilliant, so brilliant that he lost his sanity when witnessing the violence of the Vietcong. Sheen's character Willard was a man that had almost gone insane, but in carrying this mission he learned about what is up over there, over his mental threshold that he almost crossed, and decided not to.Good performance by both Brando and Sheen. The supporting cast were also terrific. The 'Chef' character was super, 'Lance' and 'Clean' was good too. The Air Cavalry commander superbly played by Duvall was really psycho, waging war and surfing at the same time.As for the music it adds to the atmosphere, but not by much.In the end you will have seen a good movie, and if you haven't it's highly recommended that you see it.

A masterpiece,"My youngest daughter met Martin Sheen today, which prompted me to file this review of one of Hollywood's greatest movies. Based on Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, APOCALYPSE NOW follows Army captain Martin Sheen into the jungles of Southeast Asia as he searches for renegade colonel Marlon Brando, who has gone native and frankly stark raving mad. Sheen gets far more than he bargained for when he finally finds Brando. Along the way, Sheen encounters a real cowboy of a lieutenant colonel played by a young Robert Duvall, who utters the film's classic line, ""How I love the smell of napalm in the morning."" Sheen had a heart attack while filming this massive epic in the Philippines. Frederic Forrest, a great character actor perhaps best known as the crazy military goods store owner in FALLING DOWN, has a plum role as the doomed ""Chef."" The film is absolutely amazing and can never be duplicated or equaled. Brando was in his glory as a larger-than-life madman, and Sheen justifiably became one of Hollywood's biggest stars after this.

daora,"That Redux was going to be anything less than brilliant was never in doubt: it was never going to be so different from the original that it would destroy or significantly damage the reputation or impact that the film has. What was in question to my mind was whether or not Coppola should have just left well enough alone. I have seen the documentary about the making of the original film, wherein Coppola derides many of his scenes and decides to cut them out of his movie even as he finishes shooting them - the plantation scene being one of the key ones that he felt just didn't work. It was for this reason that I was interested to see what the additions and rejigging of scenes had done to the film.The strengths of Redux is that Apocalypse Now was never about the straight story, it was more about the journey Willard undertakes rather than a build up to a traditional conclusion - while the ending is big, it is no more or less important that anything that has gone before it.

With a great secondary cast which contains great modern day actors including Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, and Frederic Forrest. Each actor in this movie shows outstanding talent, I was simply awed by the performance in this. Mainly what this movie portrays is the insanity war can make you experience. This film captures this in the best way possible, each character shows this in a different way, some of the minor characters such as the playboy models even show how insanity effects them. But the effects used in the film and the music in the background play a an important role in creating a certain tone for the movie, in which Jim Morrison does an amazing job at. The Doors song, The End, showed insanity and brutal mentality in it which played great in the film. Even as an opening song saying The End was a very clever and very entertaining aspect of the video.

The score of ""This is the End"" by the doors tells a story of a man who is at war within himself and believes that time for him may in fact be coming to an end. The Fading in and out of the character as you sink into his mind and thoughts is maginificent. Coppola does an amazing job with the fades of showing you the thoughts and aspirations or fears of a man in a war, he really doesn't enjoy being in. All of this is shown in one scene. Showing just how far of the lengths Coppola went to show the pain and endearing it took a person during the war in Vietnam. Coppola wanted you to be aware of the sense of the horror, madness and the overall moral dilemma of soldiers in the Vietnam war. The film depicts a group of U.S assassins and soldiers that need to clear out a former Colonel of the AWOL and while doing this they deal with the trials and tribulations of being a soldier at the same time. I feel that at times Coppola made the movie the way it is to not only show you what was happening in Vietnam but to have you visually absorb the feelings of the people as they forego on one of the most physically and mentally challenging mission anyone could imagine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I have absolutely no idea...,...what this film is trying to tell me. The 3 stars are for one or the other beautiful photograph.,3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Coppola at his finest,"I recently watched and reviewed 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and thought it would be a good idea to watch another big-name movie from the following decade. I knew it was big but I never understood how big it actually is until I watched it myself. From the cultural impact, it's similar to Psycho (1960), which I reviewed last September too. The ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" quote has a life of its own and I even encountered it during multiple quiz shows I participated in; Richard Wagner's ""The Ride of Valkyries"" was etched into our brains forever as both the composition and the scene was referenced multiple times in the following decades; ""The horror... the horror..."", both the quote and the way it was said can be found throughout multiple media. It wouldn't be far from the truth if I said that the movie is quotable as hell and each one of them is amazing.The beginning of the movie sets of a really good tone. On paper, starting a movie with a song called ""This End"" by The Doors might look bizarre and would leave you shaking your head but once the napalm storms the beach, everything is set ablaze and you hear the voice of Mr. Mojo Rising himself, you know that this decision is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola is a director I always admired but I never got the chance to explore his work. ""Youth Without Youth"" by Mircea Eliade is one of my favorite books and I first got to know Coppola when I watched the adaptation of it on the big screen. I really liked it as it created a situation where the book and the movie are fillers for each other, sort of like the manga and the anime movie of Akira. I soon got introduced to The Godfather trilogy (to be honest, I still haven't watched the 3rd installment) and my appreciation for him just grew. Not that I got all the filler information out of the way, let's continue with the movie review and I want to do that by mentioning the great usage of transparent shots. The most memorable ones came with the same intro sequence but blending multiple shots was a common technique here as you can see numerous uses of it throughout the almost-150-minute runtime. It's a simple technique but it was used in an innovative way here. That whole section of transparent images, still accompanied by ""The End"", is enough to be memorable and stick in our head but the whole monologue about Saigon straight after it is just a cherry on top. I'd like to think that as the second part of the intro and the briefing of captain Willard's, our main protagonist's, mission as the third part of the intro, all hell breaks loose after that.I'll say it now that I didn't know that Charlie was slang for Vietnamese Cong soldiers until I watched this movie. It took mine like 12 years to understand what ""Charlie Don't Surf"" by The Clash actually implied. The lyric that goes ""Charlie's going to be a napalm star"" hits way different now. Though I must also say, that whole section of the movie where the American soldiers stormed the beach in Vietnam, the colonel gave a speech about how he loves the smell of napalm in the morning and asserted that Charlie don't surf was the highlight of the film, it was just the most memorable and the most iconic part of the film. That doesn't mean the rest of the film was bad, it even picked up some similar vibes at the latter parts of the movie. Though I have to say that the intensity of this movie can be described as a motion of throwing a grenade and what follows after it. The grenade his is concentrated awesomeness as you know something good is coming when it is thrown - that's the beginning of the movie. As it explodes and wreaks havoc, it creates a momentary leap of beauty, you could quote Deidara from Naruto here by saying ""art is an explosion"" - this chaotic boom is the section where colonel Kilgore and his men stormed the beach. After the explosion, the only thing that's left is the shrapnel, flying around in every direction. Although it's still deadly and devastating, it's only has a fracture of the whole grenade, which we called awesomeness early - the shrapnel here is pretty much the rest of the movie. Even though the climax of the movie was reached quite early and the rest of the movie is overshadowed by one great and memorable set of sequences that went down in history with countless parodies and references, there's still a lot to take from this film. Just to mention a few - it touched stuff like people not wanting that war; people being sent into wars against their own wishes; people lacking proper training to be soldiers; the horrendous acts committed when given power you can't handle. And when mentioning everything, I guess this movie is realistic in a way that the action-filled parts of the war are usually the minority of the moves taking place during such conflicts and there are a lot of little moves being made, little acts of misconducts being made on every side of the battlefield and those little parts take up the majority of wars durations. If my realization makes any sense, then it's pretty clever only giving us one huge battle sequence with a bunch of soldiers on both sides and then taking us to a small group that gets in minor conflicts along the way throughout the rest of the runtime. Also, I could be completely wrong and this is just a lightbulb moment I have and I decided to go with. Either way, that's a nice touch.The last thing I want to talk about is Martin freaking Sheen. He portrayed Captain Benjamin L. Willard here and here portrayed him to perfection. Just his voice alone is enough to get my ears to tingle and he had some of the most badass monologues and dialogues out there. Just from this movie alone, I'd like to rank him with the Al Pacino's and Samuel L. Jackson's in the list of actors who play badass roles. I don't know what does it for me but from the very second he said ""Saigon"", I was just in love with his voice. Weirdly, I haven't encountered any other of his work, even weirder seeing his long filmography. I really hope he's not a one-hit-wonder as I'm really interested to look up other movies where he starred just from this performance.So after letting my mind go in all directions, what do I actually think about Apocalypse Now? I liked it. Quite much. It had some of the best scenes I've witnessed in recent memory and also provided a killer soundtrack. What did this movie lack? I guess drama, as it was pretty straightforward. I expected some sort of a twist but I've got a surreal experience towards the end, which isn't bad, just not as enjoyable as it could be. Even since the crew reached Cambodia, it all felt a bit out of place, I at least expected captain Willard to showcase his skills in stealth or marksmanship but instead it went for a more psychological approach to him and Kurz. I appreciate the effort Coppola put into the ending and his intentions were commendable but the resolution just didn't feel like it's the best possible outcome. I guess that they blew too much of the budget on the scene where they stormed the beach but you could also feel like the plot is going straight with a few stops ever since then. Still, it never felt not enjoyable and I'm happy I decided to watch this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"superb emotional journey, visually stunning, impeccable acting from everyone except Brando.","A truly exceptional film, not only on the topic of the Vietnam war but also about the duality of man and how dynamic human behavior can be. What always draws me into the film is how epic it is and the long emotional journeys the characters undergo. Copola said that his film wasn't about Vietnam, it was Vietnam, and that the whole thing was crazy. I have to agree with that, as a student of Psychology and as a member of the human race.As for technical aspects, the film looks great, beautiful shots of Hueys and the Phillipeens really sell this tale of the Vietnam war. The acting of the boat crew and all the other suporting cast is outstanding, with Martin Shean's blending in perfectly. The only gripe I have is in regards to Marlon Brando's performance, it was lack luster right up until the last ten minutes of the film. When watching this at home I often wonder why he didn't just phone in his dialogue and let them use a body double. I know this is an unpopular view, but it is how I feel, even though I am a big Brando fan. All in all, one of my favorite films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Excellent movie, but a bit long.","I'll tell ya' straight up that I'm not a big fan of war movies, but this Francis-Ford endeavor is absolutely fantastic. The craziness, the confusion, and the entire ""Who's in charge?"" attitude probably provide one of the best fictionalized accounts of what it was like to be in the Viet Nam war. It already appears to be a bit dated, and the journey up the river and meeting with Kurtz do seem to drag on a bit, but it's still an excellent movie all the way around and still does a good job at pointing out how senseless war really is.Like I said, I'm not a big war-movie buff, but this enthralling movie is one of my all-time favorite films. It also helped revive the music of The Doors, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself.Once you've seen it, make sure to check out ""Hearts of Darkness,"" a documentary about the making of ""Apocalypse Now"" that will make ""AN"" all the more interesting and perhaps inspire you to even watch it a second time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
'The horror...The horror...',"Apocalypse Now is a 1979 Vietnam war film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall. Coppola having previously made a name for himself with The Godfather and The Godfather Part II takes us into war torn Vietnam and follows the story Captain Willard (Sheen) after he is assigned a mission to hunt down a former war hero now insane madman Colonel Walter Kurtz (Brando). Apocalypse Now in reality is a story of two halves and with many different themes throughout, the first being an insight into the horrors and brutality of Vietnam, the second a psychological journey of wits and strength to find and terminate the erratic colonel. Throughout the film we are introduced to a cast of interesting and realistic characters all affected by war in their own ways. Coppola presents his film on a grand scale with masterful visuals, stunning presentation and phenomenal special affects, with possibly one of the greatest soundtracks in film history. The Doors- The End fits the opening and closing scenes perfectly with both having similarly themed lyrics and music, as well as its beautifully haunting, primitive and climactic start, middle and end. Apocalypse Now also extends beyond a regular action-filled war movie with a huge change of pace during the middle and end of the second act, with even more interesting back stories, characters and themes. Apocalypse Now has a thrilling ending perfectly completing the picture and bringing a satisfying and conclusive end to an already spectacular film. The only flaws with the film are some relatively slow moments that do little to advance the plot and some minute comedy moments that take a way slightly from the scene and distract from the atmosphere. Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest movies of all time. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
bad,"I have to say that I did not enjoy the film Apocalypse Now, maybe because I'm not a fan of war movies. This film was awful, it was boring it had no theme in my opinion. It was just dragging on and on and on. The acting was HORRIBLE, I thought silent films were 100 percent better then this. I think this had to be a low budget movie, because the special effects were something from the 1920s, I thought the camera work were choppy and the sounds were delayed in some of the scenes. I strongly do NOT recommend this movie to anyone, unless you enjoy low budget war movies, that you like to sleep through. It was confusing as well, i have no idea what half the stuff they were talking about.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Vietnam as Hallucinatory Nightmare,"This is a classic that has one of the more storied histories of any film.

And, I just got to see the ""Redux"" version at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria Queens, New York.The film has the all-time best Sound Design, thanks to the great Walter Murch. It is so immersive to hear the soundscape he constructed in excellent-quality sound once again!Everything else works from the original version very well. The ""Redux"" version, at 3 hours, 22 minutes, is quite a bit to sit through! But, there are many parts that are interesting for fans of the original version to see.I know lots of people went through lots of torment making this great film. But, I'm glad they did!What was achieved is a hallucinatory vision of the Vietnam War that takes on that conflict in a nightmarish, compelling way.

A psychedelic masterpiece,"Bookended by firestorms, and featuring some of the most outlandish, unforgettable set-pieces in cinema at all points between - see the air cavalry attack to the strains of Wagner - Apocalypse Now is usually cited (with the usual dispensations for M.A.S.H. and Catch 22), as the film that most accurately portrays the utter insanity of war. Within this moral vacuum, to impose any kind of morality seems absurd, but that's the hypocrisy exposed here by Brando's doomed renegade Colonel Kurtz.

A timeless masterpiece,"""Apocalypse Now"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of traditional war films, offering viewers a profound and thought-provoking journey into the heart of darkness. Directed by the visionary Francis Ford Coppola, this film is a mesmerizing exploration of the human psyche amidst the chaos of war.Set during the Vietnam War, ""Apocalypse Now"" follows Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) as he embarks on a harrowing mission to assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a once-decorated officer who has gone rogue and established his own kingdom deep in the Cambodian jungle. As Willard navigates the treacherous waters of the Nung River, he encounters a series of unforgettable characters and experiences that challenge his understanding of morality, sanity, and the nature of warfare itself.One of the most striking aspects of ""Apocalypse Now"" is its stunning visual imagery, which captures the surreal and hallucinatory atmosphere of war. From the iconic helicopter attack set to Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" to the eerie silence of the jungle at night, Coppola's use of cinematography creates an immersive and hauntingly beautiful world that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.In addition to its visual brilliance, ""Apocalypse Now"" boasts a stellar cast delivering powerhouse performances. Martin Sheen's portrayal of Captain Willard is captivating, conveying both the character's inner turmoil and his steely determination with nuance and depth. Marlon Brando's enigmatic presence as Colonel Kurtz is equally mesmerizing, offering a chilling glimpse into the abyss of madness and obsession.Beyond its technical and artistic achievements, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a profoundly philosophical film that raises important questions about the nature of war, power, and the human condition. Through its exploration of themes such as morality, imperialism, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world, the film invites viewers to reflect on their own beliefs and values, challenging them to confront the darkness within themselves.In conclusion, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a cinematic tour de force that deserves its place among the greatest films ever made. With its stunning visuals, powerhouse performances, and thought-provoking themes, it is a timeless classic that continues to captivate and inspire audiences around the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Slow and confusing but a landmark in War films with sheer reality.,"Short Review :-Watched Apocalypse Now (1979)Quite slow and confusing but if you get it then there's no limit. A landmark in War epic films with tough frozen reality like never before. I don't know how it fares with the historical accuracies but i will just talk about a cinema or a feature film and this is something hallucinating on human nature and it's effects. Francis Coppola's visionary film on Vietnam War could feel bore and quite confusing at the end but there's something most realistic that we haven't seen before. Either you understand it and love or you hate it completely, it's that much unpredictable. If someone really knows about this scenario already then there would more to judge rather than just a movie buff (like me). Apocalypse Now is an remarkable achievement in Cinematography, Sound and Production design and those 2 Oscars dolls came for the deserving guys. I personally found it slow but many times slow poison works more than the Normal one, let's see if i can love it more after the probable repeat watch. At the moment, this got everything in all fields of a Classic filmmaking.

It'll blow you away (based on the Redux version)!,"""Apocalypse Now"" is as powerful a war film as you're ever likely to see. The film is basically a mad-house of powerful imagery, sounds, and moody atmosphere - all this is done at the highly capable hands of director Francis Ford Coppola (working from the novella ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad). Coppola is not one of my favorite filmmakers, but ""Apocalypse Now"" is the one film of his I've always admired and had a deep fondness for. The film works on a base level that seems to appeal to your worst feelings. ""Apocalypse Now"" is a dark, violent, visually disturbing motion picture. Set during the Vietnam War, the film concerns the covert mission of Captain Benjamin L. Willard (the great Martin Sheen, in my favorite performance of his), a military assassin, to kill the rogue Colonel Kurtz (the late Marlon Brando), who has proclaimed himself god in a heavily fortified fortress located deep in the heart of Vietnam. Willard accompanies a small Army boat crew to take him up a river for him to complete his mission. ""Apocalypse Now"" is a war film that does not play around in the visually disturbing imagery category, including the graphic combat violence and the (reportedly) live slaughter of a live a water buffalo for a ritualistic sacrifice by Vietnamese villagers. Kurtz's powerful final words signify the meaning of the whole picture - the utter ""horror,"" and the utter insanity of war.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The best war story ever made,"Just that, the best depiction of the madness of war in the modern era ever conceived and put in a can.War has always been what it has always been, horrifying, terrifying, exhilarating, lucrative, and all the other crap humans deal in and with during any period of societally condoned slaughter, counter slaughter, plunder, and material destruction. Most of us only know by here say what that is, and almost all of it has been brought to us in film art. Some of us read, and have gotten accounts from literature. Regardless, there can be a demarcation between modern humanity and all the rest of humanity. That line might actually be moving pictures shown in a dark room,the medium of motion pictures. The human psyche has never in history been raised in consciousness as a species by a single medium, accessible to all, literate, not, ignorant, not, rich, not, in whatever language handy. Those who made, make, and control this media know it's power. Motion pictures has changed how humans relate to the world more than any other factor in our existence. Even religion has had less effect on how humans think. This is why perhaps there is a real difference in BM(before movies), and AM(yup).Apocalypse is the madness AM humankind enters into when faced with war.

a tale of a world teetering on the edge of Darkness,"In film it's a very rare occurrence – thus highly sort after, that a film can possess the holy trinity of a combination of a; great script, a legendary director and an almost god like actor. But such is the elusive nature of this endeavour, it never has quite has been attained in the history of film – well that's before a certain masterpiece going by the name of Apocalypse now graced our screens with this almost mythical alliance of this magnitude. The director: Francis Ford Coppola (Godfather trilogy). The story: a tale of a world teetering on the edge of Darkness almost ready to descent into primal madness, as Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) has to navigate his way through hell on earth to find and kill AWOL Col. Kurtz (The actor:) Marlon Brando (On the Waterfront and Godfather 1) - whose very name is translated into greatness in almost every language known to man. The epic tale of this coming together will probably never happen again or would even have another three components assembled that will ever parallel it. So it something to be marvelled at, as you sits down in your comfortable chair to watch such a spectacle.It has been widely reported from a variety of different sources about the hardship endured by the production team. Such as shooting in a country notorious for typhoons, even at one time the place they were story the film burnt down, but luckily it remained safe, and the little fact that the main character Martin sheen was a supposed alcoholic, and would turn up on set with hangovers. All this helps to perpetuate the legend that is apocalypse now, and the irony that they were facing their own war, just at the same time they were filming it.But what I love most in film, is when bold story and director hold up a mirror to society, penetrating through the shards and illusions of morality and believing that we are able to distinguish between good vs. Evil as if it was between black and white, that we like to delude ourselves with every day, but then when we enter the battlefield it seems our civilised selves gets left behind as lines get blurred. And that is what Apocalypse now does best, it blurs the line. And with lines blurred it not a surprised that the main characters go insane, pretty much anyone would, in the face of a world that turns the world you lived and knew upside down.But my only criticism of film, is the focus of the film, I feel it waved far too much into the obsession of Martin Sheen's character as he tries to find Marlon Brando, when I feel that they could have taken time aside to explore the war from the perspective of the other men accompanying him on his journey, particularly Laurence Fishbuornes character who was just 17, so it would have been interesting to hear things from a black boy fighting in a white man's war.It obvious my stance on the film, that I believe is must see for all, but if the first paragraph wasn't enough to persuade you into watching Apocalypse now, here is another, I would go as far as to say that Vittorio Storaro cinematography was as if watching a walking and talking Picasso piece, such was the extent of the visual art mastery he conjured up in Apocalypse Now, as if he were the offspring of Gandalf and Dumbledore. The final few scenes with Marlon Brando were simply captivating, short but sweet. Vittorio Storaro's blending of darkness and shimmers of light streaking across Brando's face was simply breathtaking, giving Brando an almost god like aura. The scene itself probably belongs hanged up on a wall in the Tate Modern as much as it deserves to be on a film screen. The benchmark for all to follow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Memorable Scenes and a Fat Brando,"I saw ""Apocalypse Now"" when it was first released and I have returned to it now and then. I have always considered it a movie with some terrific and memorable scenes, beginning with the Doors sequence at the beginning and perhaps most notably including the Robert Duvall espisode which culminates with the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" helicopter attack on the Viet Cong occupied village. I recently watched it again, and it occurred to me that the movie usually worked best when it stayed in the vicinity of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" which served to inspire the script. For me the weakest element of the film is the ending. Instead of finding a physically wasted Kurtz, as Conrad's narrator does, the movie's Willard finds a bloated Marlin Brando who appears nothing like a former special forces officer or native chieftain. The sacrifice symbolism at the conclusion does not cohere with the rest of the story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
flawless,"This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious.This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Awful, unnecessarily graphic & brutal, painful to watch","How this could rank in the top 50 in the IMDB top 250 movies I don't know. It was extremely difficult for me to watch this film, because I was so disturbed by the graphic deaths/murders of innocent Vietnamese. No doubt that scenes such as that were very realistic, and probably US soldiers did that and worse, knowing how much disregard they have for human lives in real life (i.e. The Gulf War, WW2, Korean and Vietnam Wars). I am extremely disapproving of war in general, and there is a lot of pain left over from these unnecessary battles that are lasting, for the innocent victims. If there should be a movie at all about how horrifying war is, it should not be graphic, intensely disturbing displays of mass murder; but a thorough examination at the psychological aspect of those involved with the war: the soldiers figbting against each other, the families of those who leave for war, the emotional scars of those who have lost a loved one. This is truly an awful movie, to say the least.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The 2000 Redux Release makes this the Greatest Movie of all time,"This review refers to the Redux (Director's Cut).A great film is now better. Why? The up-river plot is extended in important ways. The growth of the insanity as the boat pushes up-stream is an important part of the plot - essential to the shock of the final horror of Kurtz. Key here are both the new bunny girls scene - powerful and moving - and the brilliant break with the french expatriates. Anyone who has lived overseas (as I have in Conrad's Congo!) must realise that this gorgeous addition provides a vital counter-balance to American foreign policy methods.The ending is now much much better. We close with 'the horror, the horror' not some silly Hollywood pyrotechnic display.Lighting and photography remain unsurpassed in cinema history.The film is extremely long, and I am very glad that there are few films like this - how could we cope?!I think this is the greatest movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A CLASSIC EPIC WAR MOVIE.,"Regardless of how you interpret this movie, or what you think it says, or doesn't say about war in general, or the Vietnam war in particular doesn't really matter, this is simply one of the most compelling film ever made. A classic movie about losing yourself, getting sucked in and not being able to pull out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Classic,"This movie is most definitely a classic piece of film. It is universal in it's appeal. It is one of the best directed films of all time. The images and sounds conveyed through the movie (especially the Redux) depict the madness of war to a level I've never seen in other war films. Furthermore, the characters in the film illustrate all aspects of humanity. From the innocent kids on the boat to the dying madness of Colonel Kurz.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Best War Movie.........Ever!!!!,"This is a masterpiece film. Awsome cast, Awsome director, Awsome cinematography (some of the best ever). Besides The Godfather I & II, this is Francis Ford Coppela's finest flick. The begining seemed very similar to Saving Private Ryan. Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper are the two best actors in this movie. Although Marlon Brando gives an unusual performace as seeming like a psycho. ""I love the smell of napong in the morning."" said by Robert Duvall and ""Arresting someone for murder in this place, is like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500."" said by Martin Sheen are the two best quotes from the movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Vastly Overrated Droll,"""Heart of Darkness"", the novel for which this movie was based was no picnic. It was boring and quite uneventful until the very end.  The good thing about it was that it was short (the movie is not)  Some of the themes in it are good, but the novel itself is very lacking.  Apocalypse Now can't really decide what it really is. I saw it at film school, I along with many others was not impressed.  It is an action movie at sometimes, then it turns into some sort of half-brained morality pic.  Although some of the lines are good (namely Robert Duvall's Napalm Rant) and the cinematography is superb, the movie dabbles in too much other things to get to its point.  If one wants to really explore Vietnam in cinema, go see Platoon, for Apocalypse Now is too long to be enjoyable and too corny to be real.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"This film is not simply a war movie, it takes the audience on a psychological journey.","Apocalypse Now"" was originally 200 hours of footage shot in the Philippines over the course of 16 months. Director Francis Ford Coppola was responsible for funding several million dollars for the film during financially difficult times. On the set, the cast faced many set backs, including the destruction of sets during the monsoon season and the fact that helicopters that they were using to film with were called back by the government to be used in actual combat. Marlon Brando appeared on the set overweight to play a character written as noticeably underweight. Brando also had not read the script or the novella that it was based on and after receiving a million dollar advance, he at first refused to film. Martin Sheen was an alcoholic during shooting and during an opening scene of intoxication he is actually inebriated and his actions were improvised. He also suffered a life-threatening heart attack on set. During the filming of the movie, Coppola faced financial difficulty, marital strain and mental deterioration. Throughout filming, he threatened to commit suicide on three occasions and lost 100 pounds. Following the completion of shooting the movie took an additional year to edit. However, despite setbacks upon release the film grossed over 100 million dollars at the box office and earned two academy awards for best cinematography and score along with six other Oscar nominations.The dictionary gives two definitions of apocalypse ""a prophetic revelation, especially concerning a cataclysm in which the forces of good permanently triumph over the forces of evil"" and ""any universal or widespread destruction or disaster: the apocalypse of nuclear war"". ""Apocalypse Now"" shows the viewer not only the ugliness and chaos of war but also the darkness of the human heart. It leaves the viewer to question did good truly triumph over evil? Captain Willard is a special agent ordered to ""exterminate with extreme prejudice"". He is told to assassinate Colonel Kurtz who has countered the American army and is a murderer. The movie follows Willard's character further and further down the river with four others on the boat each trying to deal with the horrors of a questionable war. As the film progresses you see senseless killing and the deterioration of the mental health of soldiers in an unimaginable situation. The characters travel further and further from regular civilization and deeper into the heart of darkness.""Apocalypse Now"" begins with the haunting voice of Jim Morrison ""All the children are insane, waiting for the summer rain"" while featuring images of senseless destruction the Vietnam War. This film is an artistic triumph, featuring gripping, unforgettable sequences and incredible cinematography. The film has hallucinatory images of a wasteland created by violence coupled with a lack of light, which truly takes you into the heart of darkness. It not only shows the violence and absurdity of war but also is a study of man. The film is intended for interpretation with subtext and metaphors, which leave the audience thinking when the credits roll.I would recommend this movie, and consider it well worth the time. ""Apocalypse Now"" is of historical importance and features great characters. This movie greatly captured the descent of man into madness, and the horrors of war. This film was hard hitting, with scenes that were not easy to watch, in fact, at times, the viewer may wish to look away, but it is this that adds to the film and makes it more of a cinematic accomplishment. As Francis Ford Coppola said ""this film isn't about Vietnam, this film is Vietnam.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
No other war movies compare,"Apocalypse Now is one of the rare treats of the war film genre. Not only does Francis Ford Coppola's dazzling direction realistically portray the atmosphere of Vietnam, but this film above all is very cerebral and profound, qualities that the vast majority of war movies lack.  Instead of the constant and often monotonous war action scenes depicted in films like Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now strives to utilize these scenes as a backdrop for the engaging and complex characters that are of much greater importance to the film.The two most significant characters of the movie are played by Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando.  Sheen plays a Vietnam war captain who has been ordered by the military to kill Brando, a former colonel who has strayed from the military's commands and has formed his own band of warriors in Cambodia. Also, Robert Duvall turns in a brilliant performance as an American general in Vietnam who seems oblivious to the effects of the war and more interested in having fun than seriously fighting the war.  Besides these main characters, the rest of the film's personas do not critically influence the movie.  However, all of them serve to underscore the chaotic and almost insane nature of American involvement in Vietnam, which seems to be the underlying message that Coppola and co-writer John Milius attempt to convey.Much of the brilliance of this movie can be attributed to its many ironies, such as how the military branded Brando as a lunatic, although it was the military who played a large role in influencing his condition.  However, the greatest irony of all in the movie lies in its conclusion.  This atmosphere of recklessness is also very important to Sheen's character because it shows him to be a man of contempt for the military's actions and policies in Vietnam but simultaneously a man who is indifferent to them.  His persona is still more complex because he in a way wants to stay in Vietnam despite its horrors because he has no one back home who cares for him anymore.  But probably the most complicated character is Brando's, as he attributes his ruthlessness to the deception of the military of unfairly judging their enemies as well as themselves in the war.Apocalypse Now gives an extremely radical perspective of the Vietnam War, but in my opinion, the film comments more on the nature of war in general. It demonstrates how the different conceptions of morality and compassion in a war setting can change the individual that seriously ponders them.  Four stars out of four.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
a descent into madness,I watched this film on T.V. and it is simply amazing! I truly can't find any words to describe this brilliant film. Sure there's not much of a plot but this movie is like being in Vietnam and all the performances are good. It's just one of those films that's hard to classify. It shows you everyonewas a hypocrite in Vietnam. Willard's mission was to kill Kurt but when he met Colonel Kilgore he seemed  nearly as crazy as Kurtz.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Probably the best!,"In my opinion the best movie ever created. Something never can reached. Especially in our new, conscientiously (movie-) society. Great soundtrack! Great story!

"War has never felt so real, fear has never felt so vivid, filmmaking at its proudest","Apocalypse Now is a poem of human nature, a reflection of what we are achieving of doing from a good vs evil perspective; its production qualities are the pinnacle of artistic achievements (good), its story and content the pinnacle of human depravity (evil).Considering this is Coppola film, you just can't expect to see something poor or average, as Coppola has taught us what good filmmaking is.Apocalypse Now is not an action movie, as many would expect considering its setting, but it needs not to have flashy action sequences or epic battles, for its flashy action sequences are translated into beautiful cinematography, and its epic battles into profound and complex dialogue.The plot is without a doubt an embodiment of genius, inspiration and storytelling. The portrayal of Vietnam and its horrors, the development of its characters, the scope of its content, the essence of its dialogue, all of these things are woven together like a grandmother's sweater: impeccable.Everything in this film works perfectly, which leads me to highlight the villain, the source of conflict and malice found in every minute of this masterpiece. The villain is without a doubt one of the best Hollywood has ever seen, and getting to understand his reasoning, the motivations for his actions, is truly an exercise of the mind, a questioning of how life can come falling down when one is placed in the wrong moment and place. The villain is majestic, a mad genius.The production design is superb, it just feels vivid and fresh, and it never fails to be consistent throughout the entirety of the film. The cinematography just works in every shot, and the story unfolds in beautiful ways one could think could never be topped. The performance of Marlon Brando shines brightly in the few minutes of screen time he receives, and that is satisfying enough, even for so little time, and the renowned dialogue only makes everything even more satisfying.I cannot find anything bad to say about this film, except the evil it represents. It is truly the best adaptation Conrad could have hoped for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Didn't Live Up to the Hype for Me,"Note: This review is based on the Apocalypse Now Redux edition, I have not seen the original version.I'm going to start off by saying that I didn't enjoy Apocalypse Now. Is it a great and very well done film that deserves its place in film history? Yes it is, but am I in a hurry to see it again? No, I'm not. I liked it well enough but I guess it's one of those movies that I will be content only seeing once, well at least the Redux. I need to check out the original because I hear it's much better.Martin Sheen is awesome and so is everybody else, especially Laurence Fishburne who I was surprised to see. I haven't seen a ton of Coppolla's films but I will try to catch up one his work, he did a great job directing this movie. I liked the story as I loved Heart of Darkness and I really like what it has to say about war. It also shows how absurd war can be at times, I'm talking about the playboy bunny scene and the surfers. I'm glad I saw it but I don't know if I will again.Everybody should see this movies because of its status in the film world. But don't make the mistake I did, see the theatrical version first.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"The insanity of war, the struggle between barbarism and humanism","I've seen Apocalypse Now (Redux) a few times. The first viewing, I knew I had seen a great movie, but was less sure what to make of it. The second and third viewing with a decent span of time in between, gave me a better appreciation for the film's meaning, plus greater enjoyment of its amazing cinematography.This movie is insane, that much is clear. It's insane and terrifying. The atmosphere of each scene draws you in and masterfully highlights one absurdity after another. Scenes such as a soldier laying dead as a tape plays of his family wishing him a safe return home. Some scenes are almost funny if they weren't so sad. ""I love to smell of napalm in the morning"" being one of its more famous lines. Eerie music and dark, looming shots as you watch a lifestyle of complete insanity could out-terrify many horror films in my opinion.So what else is it about? Well, although I do have my own interpretation, I think an intellectual analysis is not necessarily required. The movie sort of speaks for itself, and I think that's the intended takeaway for the majority of the viewing audience. That being said, the film is clearly inspired by dialectical philosophy. No, not the nonsense that Dennis Hopper's character was spewing in that one scene. I don't know what that was. Dialectics is the study of contradiction, two opposing, mutually exclusive forces. Those contradicting forces affect the world in the push and pull between them, as they ""fight"" for each of their ultimate ends. One simple example of a contradiction is good and evil, or light and darkness.Contradictions are referenced quite often throughout the film, just not with that overt dialectical language. Some examples:""There are two of you, one that kills and one that loves"" -Roxanne Sarrault.""There's a conflict in every human heart between the rational and the irrational and good does not always triumph."" -General R. Corman.It becomes clear that the river is a metaphor for getting closer to that dark side within us. Col. Kurtz represents the furthest extreme into barbarism and savagery. As Martin Sheen says, Kurtz is as far up the river as you can get.And war brings that dark side out of people. One impression you get amidst all the insane actions of these characters is that they're not crazy or evil themselves. It's the environment that's evil. They're just living in it.I often hear criticism of the Redux version. I haven't seen the theatrical version so I can't comment on the differences. But I can say that, whatever additions were made in the Redux, very few of them seem to have been wasted. I feel like every scene and almost every line of dialogue was worthwhile. The French planation dinner scene is one exception, but even that scene wasn't totally meaningless and it was pretty short relative to the length of the whole movie. I think these criticisms of the Redux are very overstated.I could go on, but I'll just summarize by saying that this is not my favorite movie. It explores a lifestyle that I don't personally relate to, and the emotions it invokes in me are mostly negative by design. It's hard for me to regard such a movie as my personal favorite. But I recognize the film for the masterpiece it is, and it will have an impact on you, I promise you that.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
