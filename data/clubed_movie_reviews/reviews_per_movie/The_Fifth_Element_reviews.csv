"Simply put, this movie is FUN!!!","I really believe that they billed this movie wrong.  Many folks came in expecting the next Star Wars and were disappointed, to say the least.  It's not like Star Wars.  It's kinda like a live action comic book.  Visually stunning, awesome use of color that just jumps out at you, and non-stop action, lots of it done with tongue firmly in cheek. Plot?  Well forget the plot, it's the weak point of the film.  But hey who ever said comic books had to have strong plots? Willis, Jovovich, and the rest do a fine job.  I especially like the casting of Jovovich, she exudes innocence, vulnerability, sex, exotica, intelligence, and kung fu machismo all at the same time. So turn off the cynicism sign as you watch and just enjoy the ride.  Great stuff!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Korben, my man.","One of the greatest sci-fi movies ever, wrapped up in one of the most subtle love stories ever. The characters are well cast and well acted. The creature costumes and effects are amazing for their time. The story is unique and dynamic. A true classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Multi Pass.,"Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich star in this wonderful sci-fi tale. Chock full of killer performances and excellent effects.Korben Dallas is your average ordinary New York taxi driver. Fresh out of the military, unlucky in love and this close to losing his job. One day the ultimate fare literally falls into his lap as Leeloo enters his life via the roof of his cab. Leeloo it seems was genetically manipulated to be the ultimate weapon against pure evil but her beauty and butt-kicking hide a more fragile nature that Dallas and a host of others will have to step up and help her save humanity.This amazing sci-fi adventure from Luc (Leon) Besson has a little something for everyone. Beauty (the gorgeous Jovovich with orange hair even), action and gun-play, excellent acting, amazing visual effects, romance, creative sets and costume design, dynamic and interesting music and a mildly annoying but funny Chris Tucker. You name itthis film has it in spades. 5th Element is hands down one of the best science fiction films ever.I've seen it many times and always want more. I highly recommended it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A wonderful action movie to see over and over again,"I think The Fifth Element is the movie I have seen the most... It is a perfect mixture of action and comedy, science-fiction, suspense and romance. Set in a not so far future, the eternal battle between good and evil is shown to us in an extravagant setting. Flying cars, aeroplanes that go at the speed of light, weird creatures and ugly aliens are only a few things that are present during this film. The story has never been seen before : Good has only one weapon to defeat evil; it is composed of four stones representing the four element (water, earth, fire and air) and a perfect creature. These five elements have to be united before the forces of evil arrive to earth. But evil has found help and the stones have disappeared. Bruce Willis (one of the best action actors of our time), Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm and Gary Oldman make the suspense even more intense. Chris Tucker is incredibly funny and ads a lot to the comic side of the film. The story is extremely imaginative and is, in my opinion, one of Luc Besson's best. I have never seen anything else like it. The costumes, designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, are unbelievably imaginative and fun. They are a big part of the extravagance and originality of the movie. The score, by Eric Serra (one of my favourites) is simply a work of art. And last but not least, the special effects are absolutely excellent, adding to the quality of the movie. If you are looking for action and a good laugh, this is the film to see. But the actors are not the only things that make this film worth seeing. Click here",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A great change of pace,"Most sci-fi films try to break new ground with special effects and visual eye candy, but The Fifth Element created a whole new concept in the genre: the art-action science fiction.While this film has many flaws, particularly in the flow of the plot, visually, it surpasses most sci-fi films I have ever seen. Not even Planet of the Apes (2001) could compete with this film's cinematography. I firmly believe 1997 was a great year for this concept of film, considering the highly visual Alien Resurrection came out the same year. Hopefully, some of the more modern sci-fi films will encompass some of the visual ideals this film set forth.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Legendary film that has stood the test of time.,"22 years later and this film is still next level compared to the best films today, even today it still plays like a new blockbuster and is excellent entertainment.
Comedy, action and sci-fi are regularly overlaid on top of each other, the volume of content this film manages to squeezes into ~120 minutes is totally amazing and waste scenes are non-existent. The comedy is actually unique and funny and it mixes well with the action. The sci-fi is great and the view of the future is still intriguing (sleeper cells in airplanes, apartments with vertical storage and reconfiguration, instant makeup devices, instant food devices, flying cars, trains that ride vertically up super tall skyscrapers, smart rifles, nuclear powered jetliners, medical devices that can reconstruct human bodies, etc). The acting is great and the characters really come across as real. The action is excellent and is greatly enriched by the previously mentioned overlays.This should really be taught as an example in film school of how to do movies right.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Negative, I am a meat popsicleThe Fifth Element","After making heavy movies like La Femme Nikita and Leon, it is somewhat of a departure for Luc Besson to do this comic, pulp, sci-fi film The Fifth Element. Looking at his work now, with such high-octane humor as the Transporter series, among others, (written by Besson, but not directed), it doesn't seem that out of place. He just must have decided to only direct his more serious fare and leave the fun stuff to others. However, The Fifth Element is by no means a slight film without a fan base. As far as sci-fi goes, this is a very capable installment. With its mythology, creatures, action, and special effects, the movie has everything going for it. The humor that's infused just makes it better, vaulting it through genres and making it accessible to almost everyone who gives it a try.Like most of its ilk, the story revolves around an evil force about to devour Earth and the rest of life itself as it increases in size and power with each influx of destruction and hate thrown at it. Every opportunity to blow it up only makes it stronger. Through a series of fortunate/ unfortunate happenings, (depending on who you are aligning with), we have the paths crossing of a priest who holds the answers for survival, an ex-military, cab driver bent on having some fun and excitement, a strange woman from another place at the center of it all, an evil mercenary out for money, and the government of the galaxy trying to save face in front of inevitable extermination. It is good versus evil traveling through space in order to either shed light or death out to the universe as victory.In what is a nice little introduction to the myth of the fifth element that will unite with the more common four to wipe out evil, we learn of those who keep the secret of its location. We don't quite know if these aliens are good or not until later, but we do find out the impetus for their coming to the temple on display. A cut forward in time introduces us to the president of the galaxies, (played in what would seem to be horrible casting, but ends up being pretty good with Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister, Jr.), and our head priest in the guarding of the truth, Ian Holm. Holm explains what the dark force coming after them is and goes on the quest to find the fifth element and her four stones needed to combat it. This supreme being, played wonderfully by Milla Jovovich with a childlike glee and discovery, falls into the unwitting hands of cabbie Korben DallasBruce Willis at his sarcastic bad-ass best. Willis must join with Holm and Jovovich on a mission to recover the stones and find a way to save the world.A lot of the success lies with the man behind it all, Luc Besson. His script is made up of a pretty solid plot line as far as the world destruction goes. Everything makes sense and is explained in a way to not bore us, but instead in tidbits culled from the numerous characters running about it this singularly unique landscape. The art direction is spectacular and for being a decade old, still has some nice special effects that stand up. I've always been a proponent for prosthetics, when able, at the expense of computer graphics. Reactions are always better from actors who have something real to play off of and the lighting and environments just become more realistic. Even so, when computers are used, the effects are more subtle than flashy and never take away from the story that is being told. No matter what spectacle is on display, the script is what is important.All the personalities on display also lead to much of the greatness that The Fifth Element has to offer. Bruce Willis is the king of this kind of role. His quips and rapport with those around him are priceless. Other standouts are Chris Tucker, in an early role for him, and the great Gary Oldman. Tucker takes loud and obnoxious to a whole new level, but it works flawlessly. His radio DJ has no shame when it comes to working a crowd or chasing the ladies, but his utter fear of danger is hilarious. As for Oldman, I have to believe Besson just said create something fresh. This villain is a pastiche of so many crazy components. His futuristic hair, complete with plastic half shield, is plain weird; the southern accent and buck teeth look is just the right amount of hillbilly; and the disposition of greed and ambivalence is perfect for a bad guy. When he explains how destruction allows all the little machines that man created to finally have work cleaning up the mess, it's fantastic. The real beauty, though, is that no matter how many strong lead roles are here, the little guys steal scenes as well. Singer Tricky is great as Oldman's ""Right Arm"" and Mathieu Kassovitz partakes in one of the best scenes in the film when he attempts to mug Willis at his apartment.Even with all its camp and fun, Besson keeps it all grounded in drama as any fantasy tale does. He has a real vision for aesthetics and has changed his scope often as he goes from film to film. From the mobster/corrupt cop world of New York, to the countryside of war with Joan of Arc, he never pigeonholes himself in a style. I am still holding out hope that his newest, Angel-A, with all its black and white, stylish noir feel, will hit the big screens here in Buffalo. It will be a real shame if the rumors are true and the completion of his children tale, Arthur and the Minimoys, will be the final work by him as a director.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Super fun, super weird, super Besson","The Fifth Element is weird, wacky, creative and cheesy as hell. It has one of the most ham fisted love stories I've ever seen, a truly ridiculous lore and over acting out the wazzoo.But this film's boundless creativity, art direction, costumes and performances really sell it. I wanted to know more about this film every second.

Excellent Fantasy Movie,"This is a great movie. It isn't your typical same alien vs. human movie where there is blood everywhere, and the humans win right before they've thought it was the end. It is much more interesting. The story has love vs. evil in a whole new way, and there's a lesson to be learned through it.Honestly, I didn't really care about the plot all that much. The imagination and creativity is awesome! I love the colors and the ideas they came up with, especially how the design of the city. The futuristic clothing is cool too. The only thing I was disappointed in was the enemy aliens. They looked a little too artificial.My favorite thing about the whole movie was the music. It went from techno to opera to jazz, and to all over. I loved the music, partially because they used Engima and Vangelis. Many people are like, ""what the heck was that?"" when they hear the music, but it fits the movie perfectly and leaves you with a feeling more than a theme. I like the randomness of the music, it works well with the quirkiness of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better With Age?,"In the colorful future, a cab driver (Bruce Willis) unwittingly becomes the central figure in the search for a legendary cosmic weapon to keep Evil and Mr Zorg (Gary Oldman) at bay.Does this film get better with age? I recall seeing it around the time it came out, and while not necessarily disliking it, thinking it was a rather stupid movie. But seeing it again now (April 2015), it seems to me much more clever than I initially thought (though still with a high degree of stupidity).Some of this just should not exist. The clothing and hairstyles are silly and distract from the film's strengths. The aspect of the mother could also be removed. But really, there is a very clever script under all this. The alliances and connections between the military, the cab company, the bad guys, the religion... it is surprisingly complex and yet still rather simple. Quite clever.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Such a shame as the character is completely unnecessary to the plot and without his ever present shrill campness that only a teeny mind would find amusing, and then surely for only 60 seconds, the film would be much better.Plus points, Bruce Willis in laconic form, nice glimpses into the future, like the Chinese Takeaway, Milla Jovovich and Ian Holm are also well cast and add to the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""That's ma favorite!""  (Gary Oldman)","THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a complex film....if you WANT it to be! It offers varying levels of analysis depending on the tools you have to dig with! On the surface, a ""leave your brain in the cloakroom"" sci-fi yarn, you may well find wanting!  As far removed from STAR WARS as Austin Powers is from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. this film is pitched uniquely at those who can laugh at life but who have deep down an unquenchable desire for adventure and the romantic.Set on a futuristic earth, where really nothing has changed except the technology, Bruce Willis is STILL John McLane, a has-been stormtrooper reduced now to driving air-cabs for a living...same old premise for him - nothing's changed much since STRIKING DISTANCE, except maybe the yellow hair-rinse. Now, legend has it that in a time long long ago, the forces of darkness visited earth and were repelled by the unification in close proximity, of four stones representing the four elements. earth, wind, fire and water together with a fifth ""element"" of unknown origin.Dear old Ian Holm is Priest Cornelius, an expert authority on the five elements and keeper of all knowledge on things magical and mysterious. Gary Oldman in arguably his most way-put role is General Zorg who has done a deal with ""The Dark Side"" and whose sole purpose is to take possession of the elemental stones. The scene wherein he demonstrates the new weaponry to his alien henchman (from which the one-line ""summary quote"" above is taken) is an absolute classic of cinema. Milla Jovovich (Married to Besson at the time of the flick) is absolutely rivetting as Leeloo, the cloned/unzipped humanised fifth element. She must have practised long and hard perfecting her ancient language dialog....it's amazing. She strikes exactly the right note as a being of purity, femininity and warrior woman. As the film progresses she assumes the identitiy of the perfect girl any man would wish for and want to protect.The comedy angle is hysterical, the action sequences in your face, and the fx generally impressive if not mega weird at times. Color and visuals play a major role in this pro-European production, the continent where not surprisingly it was most successful. The outcome naturally is predictable and in the best traditions of ""will love save the day?"" as if it wasn't always going to???So, there u have it. Watch it one-dimensionally and that's what you'll get back. let it flow, immerse yourself in IT and you couldn't fail to have a good time, unless of course you are clinically dead or devoid of any sense of fun or fantasy ....but in that case you'd be wasting your time anyway, it wasn't MADE for you!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A mainstream-cult classic?,"I remember when 'The Fifth Element' first came out in the cinema in 1997. I saw it twice. It was awesome. It was only really after its release did the narrative begin breaking through (the ways thing did prior to the internet!) that it wasn't 'very good.' And yet everyone I spoke to loved it. I worked in a video rental store in 1998. It was still a major title and the public seemed to love it, too.Over time I realised that, despite critics seemingly delighting in pulling it apart, the general public thought it was great. They say there are only about ten different story types and that every film is just a variation on the way each is told. With that in mind, 'The Fifth Element' isn't anything particularly original in terms of the actual story - in the distant future, a giant planet of 'pure evil' is hurtling towards the Earth preparing to wipe all us humans out. The only thing that can destroy it is a being of pure goodness (Milla Jovovich before she hit the big time in the 'Resident Evil' franchise), who just so happens to be in the care of a wise-cracking New York taxi driver (Bruce Willis when he still put effort into his performances). However, what makes the film stand out is the way its presented.If ever a film 'built a world' it was here. The special effects may look just ever-so-slightly dated today, they were amazing for the time and I think most people will still enjoy them for what they are. You'll see New York in the future with mile high skyscrapers and flying queues of cars gridlocked around their peaks (beating the 'Star Wars' prequels by a few years!). You'll see a variety of futuristic settings and technology, presented as if they are just everyday items that everyone uses. I hear fashion designer Jean Paul Gauteur (spelling!) personally designed every costume - right from the stars' own wardrobe to the background characters to give every person that 'space-age feel.'I've already said that Bruce Willis was still an A-list star when he made this. His once natural charm and endearing smirk, mixed with wise-cracks and macho heroics worked well here with Milla Jovovich's faux naive persona which underlies her true mystical powers. But they're just the icing on the cake. 'The Fifth Element' is practically an ensemble cast with villainous Gary Oldman as the bad-guy and Ian Holm as the well-meaning priest who's on hand to help out. Maybe the reason there was a certain amount of hate directed towards the film was down to Chris Rock. If you ever see some online list of 'Most Annoying Characters in Films' you'll probably find him as 'Number 2' (only pipped by Jar Jar Binks from 'Star Wars'). Yes, he's pretty obnoxious - but he's supposed to be! You're supposed to be irritated by his antics and he only comes into the story in the last third, so - personally - if you really can't stand him that much, I'm sure he should ruin the whole film for you.Basically, 'The Fifth Element' has everything an enduring film should have. It has action, romance, sci-fi (if you're into that!), adventure, sets, special effects, costumes, humour, brilliant direction (the way characters in one scene answer a seemingly unrelated question a different character had just posed is very nice and adds to the quirky feel very well) and - perhaps most importantly - if has all that without needing to be 'adult' in content. It was rated 'PG' here in the UK and I think it's a film that all the family can enjoy together. Better still... it never received a sequel or remake (to date, 2020!), therefore leaving this as a perfectly self-contained little gem of sci-fi brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertainment,"There is so much entertainment in this movie it would be almost stupid to write about its flaws. Especially the story is not the best thing here, but who cares. I liked every scene, every moment in this movie. The movie opens in Egypt, 1914, and we meet some strange creatures. From here on we know this is not going to be a normal or very serious sci-fi action movie. The creatures tell a priest that the stones are no longer save on earth and they take some things. They tell the priest they will return in 300 years, when evil arrives.300 years later. The strange creatures return but they are attacked by other strange creatures. The only thing that survives is reconstructed and turns out to be Lee Loo (Milla Jovovich). She is the fifth element, the ultimate weapon against evil. Evil here looks like a great ball of fire. Lee Loo escapes from the authorities, and in an astonishing shot we see how a city looks like now. She jumps of a building and ends up in the flying cab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). He saves her from the police, she asks for priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), he brings her there.We learn a little more about Lee Loo here. She needs four stones, the four other elements, to save the world. The stones are on a vacation resort where we meet DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker). He has some funny scenes as well. We have also met Zorg, who is played by Gary Oldman in a great way. The attack on the strange creatures early in the movie was planned by him. He wants the stones as well, he is offered a lot of money for them. How the story develops from here I will not reveal.The story doesn't even matter. In every scene we have something to like. Beautiful settings, great visual effects, Gary Oldman, the beautiful Jovovich or the funny moments from Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker and Ian Holm.

Hugely imaginative and enjoyable,"This sci-fi fantasy had a lot of ingredients to be great, a wonderful concept, Luc Besson who directed the brilliant Leon:The Professional and Gary Oldman who is one of the best underrated actors working today being just a few.The Fifth Element is a hugely imaginative and enjoyable film, with only Chris Tucker's annoying character and performance and the occasional lack of flow in the plot being its sole drawbacks. I adored the concept and the story even with the lack of flow never failed to intrigue.The script and satire are fun and slick, the visuals are breathtaking and unusual especially the amazing Big Apple effects with honourable mention to the camp trip to the resort planet Fhoston Paradise and there are plenty of thrills and imagination in the atmosphere to be had.Besson's direction is excellent, Eric Serra's music is atmospheric and jaunty and the characters are fun.

Tucker Ruins An Otherwise-Fun Film,"This is one wild science-fiction ride that is generally fun to watch until Chris Tucker enters the film near the end. It's fun, in large part, because of the great special-effects, excellent 5.1surround sound and likable hero.Storywise, it's a little too far out for my theological tastes but you can't take anything of this seriously. However, calling Milla Jovovich's character (""Leeloo"") a ""supreme being"" is not only blasphemous but just plain annoying.However, if you enjoy wild effects, strange characters and a very fast-moving, action-packed film you'll like this, even if the story is stupid.Bruce Willis does a nice job with his low-key role of ""Korben Dallas,"" an average type of Joe who drives a cab in futuristic New York City. Jovovich looks a little like Uma Thurman, facially. She's interesting to watch with hr looks, strange dress and strange language. Gary Oldman plays his normal wacked-out character.

Armageddon with irony,"A friend of mine once observed that the real problem with The Fifth Element is that it wasn't in French; that had Luc Besson opted to make it in his native tongue all would have been well. He may have a point, but it's still a terribly overoptimistic analysis.The Fifth Element has to be one of the silliest films ever made: the barking mad plot, the comedy villain, the comedy ""bad race"" of Org, the crazy costumes, the crazy music, the Blade Runner with laughs script, the sci-fi icons (like Ian Holm and Brion James). It should be terrible; it is terrible! But it's also marvellous. Marvellously camp, marvellously entertaining and great fun. The difference between this and Big Bruce's Armageddon is that Fifth Element is in on the joke  in a very in-your-face way, but it is. Contrast near-identical Bruce lines in each film (the ""why d'ya call me"" line). In Armageddon, the question is taken seriously, in Fifth Element they play it for the joke it is ""firstly, out of all of your unit, you're the only one qualified to fly all these space-craft"" - cue the unrolling of an improbably long list - ""secondly, of all of your unit, you're the only one still alive"".This is The Mummy in Space  two hours of almost unrelenting silliness punctuated with some wonderful pastiches  the best and the most hilarious being Chris Tucker's Ruby Rhod  if you didn't realise he's supposed to be Prince it might be classified as ridiculous (what am I saying? It is ridiculous, but it's also bloody marvellous).The genius in this film is really in the casting. Butch Bruce, when left to his own devices, is capable of producing high grade camembert, and once again delivers on that. It's just that here it's so perfect. Ian Holm seems to be rehashing his role in the borrowers rather than Alien. Gary Oldman seems to have been pinching ideas (and costumes) from Max Von Sydow in Flash Gordon. And then there is LeeLoo, the films one original creation, who is played majestically by Milla Jovovich.If it strikes you that I like this film rather too much; well, I agree. I mean, I know this film is trash but it is, nevertheless, the kind of trash people put in a gallery and call art. Surprisingly re-watchable. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

From the mind of a teenager,"About 250 years in the future, ex-soldier Korben Dallas (Willis) is working as a taxi driver when a woman comes crashing through his roof. It turns out that this woman, Leeloo (Jovovich) is actually the Fifth Element, a supreme being who, when joined with four ancient sacred stones representing wind, fire, water and earth, can fight evil. Which is lucky, since Evil is coming their way in the form of a big pulsating planet, assisted by the impossibly rich tycoon Zorg (Oldman), who is trying to locate the four stones so that Evil can prevail. After teaming up with a priest named Father Vito Cornelius (Holm) to find the stones, they travel to another planet on behalf of the Federation of the United States, where they meet up with various alien life forms who want to help or harm them, and their most frightening encounter of all, radio DJ Ruby Rhod. (Tucker)Truthfully, I am conflicted when it comes to my ultimate outlook on this film. Visually, it was completely captivating. The set designs, (layers of air traffic in the streets of New York, going up hundreds of stories, a floating Central Park) the costumes (Gaultier, with his usual S&M-looking couture) and the colorful hair and makeup were fantastic. A lot of the contraptions (a mask that instantly does your makeup, a cigarette machine that dispenses cigarettes with increasingly longer filters for those who are trying to quit smoking) were clever and entertaining, and the overall style of the film was impressive. There were certainly some things that were really odd to me that don't really warrant explanation, I still scratched my head about, (like what was the deal with Gary Oldman sounding exactly like Billy Bob Thornton>) but ultimately chalked up to eccentricity.There wasn't even anything universally wrong with the script; I thought that it was a very basic, but fun story, and I liked the fact that notorious badass Willis wasn't so much living up to his reputation until we approached the end of the film. Unfortunately, I became more and more irritated with some of the ""humor"" (mostly slapstick type things; people saying, ""W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-what do you mean, a BOMB?!"" and the like I think I heard ""W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w"" at least thirty times throughout the film) that was being presented. After viewing the film, I discovered that Besson had actually written this screenplay when he was in high school, something that is slightly impressive, but actually explains a lot in terms of the goofiness, I think. The other major irritant was Chris Tucker. I completely understand that his character was supposed to be way out there (kind of a cross between Prince and Grace Jones) but I think that the weird costumes, hair and mannerisms could have sufficed. Instead I had flashbacks to sitting in the theater watching ""Star Wars: Episode I"" and literally wanting to get up and hit something after listening to Jar-Jar Binks screech and prattle on. Tucker's high-pitched voice and utter lack of charm did not win any points with me, and if anything, he made the film lose at least one point on my ratings scale. Other than the aforementioned things, there wasn't a whole lot to dislike about ""The Fifth Element"" but there wasn't really anything to get excited about either. If this film didn't have the obnoxious Chris Tucker in it, I would consider it to be a great popcorn flick. Instead, even while just mentally flashing back to some of his scenes, I begin to feel like a drill is nearing my ear. However, because the film was fairly enjoyable other than his scenes, I give it a 5/10.--Shelly",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another Fine Luc Besson Film.,"The Fifth Element is another fine example of the filmmaking talents of Luc Besson. Luc Besson, a creative genius and the director of classic films such as The Big Blue, Nikita and Leon (The Professional) has returned to the genre that started his filmmaking career, sci-fi. In The Fifth Element Luc Besson realises his life long ambition to make a film based on a story he thought of while still at school, Zaltman Bleros. Writing and directing the film, he skillfully mixes humour with action and amazing visual effects that put The Fifth Element in a class of it's own. Stunning performances are put forward by Milla Jovovich, Bruce Willis, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman, who returns to work with Luc Besson after playing Norman Stansfield in Leon. The Fifth Element show us how well comedy, action and romance can be put together. Overlooked at the Academy Awards, Luc Besson won the Cesar for Best Director at Cannes in 1998 for The Fifth Element. Simply, an excellent film, 10/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Luc Besson in front (crazy as a loon but boy can he write scripts) and Willis/Oldman in front.For the day, the special effects were top notch.There a joyful innocence about the film which was rare at the time, and even rarer today.See it once.

I thought it was good..,It sounds to me like people either like the movie or hate the movie; no middle of the road.  I liked it.  I know there were some unbelievable situations but nearly every movie I see has something that wouldn't happen in real life.  Besides the movie takes place in the future.  Who knows what can happen.

"Very fun, but not meant to be taken seriously","At first, I didn't know what to make of THE FIFTH ELEMENT. Much of it was corny; some of it was just stupid. But when I stopped taking the movie so serious, I really started to enjoy it. I thought it was a very fun movie.THE FIFTH ELEMENT is about an evil force coming to destroy the world. Five elements are needed to destroy the evil force and save the Earth. Four of them are stones and one of them is a beautiful woman named Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), who is absolutely ""perfect"". A priest named Cornelius (Ian Holm) seeks the elements to try to save the world while the military sends a the retired Major Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) to find the elements and stop a bunch of alien bounty hunter-like bad guys and a very evil man (and of course very rich) man who is under the employment of the evil force named Zorg (Gary Oldman).And of course, there is the insane but loved radio DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) who gets trapped in the middle of this whole thing and becomes the comic relief of the movie, even though this movie really does not need comic relief. At first you will probably find him annoying, but he will grow on you. At least, this happened to me.The acting is fair, but nothing special. Chris Tucker does a good job as the nutcase radioman, and Ian Holm does a pretty good job as the priest set out to save the planet. This was a very different type of role for Gary Oldman. He was still a bad guy, of course, but it was a much more comical part. It surely wasn't his best work, but it was still OK. Bruce Willis did a great job playing his part, and Milla Jovovich was excellent as the sexy but strong fifth element.The special effects were fantastic. The story to this movie is nothing big, but like I said the main purpose of this movie is for the viewer to have fun. Don't expect to do much thinking and just enjoy yourself and I'm sure you'll like this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining sci-fi with a well-chosen star,"""The Fifth Element"" really seems like something only a crazy French guy could come up wit. Smash ""Blade Runner"" into ""Heavy Metal"", fill it with guns and Henson Creature Shop rejects, put MTV in charge of the music and find a hair stylist that's tripping balls on acid.Oy, the French.Anyhoo, there's still fun to be had here. Sue, the narrative's not as smooth as it could be, but the movie's colorful, it moves, and it's wildly imaginative. The effects hold up surprisingly well, especially the flying cars. And the actors (Willis, James and the unhinged Oldman) seemed to be enjoying themselves.

The Fifth Element(1997)-Movie review,"The Fifth Element tells the story about five central elements, and the quest to find the last one to save the universe.
The Fifth Element is pretty much a crazy, funny, exciting and extravagant movie.
From a storytelling standpoint the script is not that original, however it is relatively well developed. The creation of the universe is amazing, the style of the creatures, the sets, the clothes. Its beautiful to look at.
The directing is also good, Besson has an eye for the big action pieces and to mix these inventive visuals and ideas into the movie. He's a really talented visual director, and you can see that he's having a great time.
The cast is also worth mention, Willis is good playing Corben Dallas, but Gary Oldman steals the show playing Zorg.
The movie has a big sense of fun, It's very entertainning.
In terms of negative aspects, it's problably a little too long and the script like I said before it's not that original.
Overall the Fifth Element is a visually stunning movie filled with a decent script, good directing, ideas, and it has above all a huge sense of fun.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Luc Besson creates fun sci-fi,"It's 300 years after the previous visit, a Mondoshawan spaceship is bringing the Fifth Element back to Earth to defeat a coming great evil. However it is destroyed by the evil Mangalores on the behest of the greedy Zorg (Gary Oldman). A team of scientists use the DNA found at the crash site to recreate the Fifth Element, a perfect warrior called Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). She escapes from the laboratory and drops in on taxi driver Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). He helps her find Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) to bring the five elements together to defeat the evil.This is a great looking sci-fi movie from director Luc Besson. It proves that big sci-fi production is not just an American domain. Luc Besson brings an entirely different sense and visual look to the genre. It is artistic and wonderful. The fashion from Jean-Paul Gaultier really sets this apart. Bruce Willis does his John McClane persona once again. Milla Jovovich makes the best entrance, and Chris Tucker is wacky funny. It is visual candy coated fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tries To Show Off Too Much,"I'd always had the impression that THE FIFTH ELEMENT had been set in the far flung future which caused by the oft shown clip of the heroine crashing through the taxi roof ( Very similar to the scene in PULP FICTION also starring Bruce Willis ) so imagine my surprise when this movie starts of in the deserts of North Africa in 1914 . It's an opening scene that has featured in many movies and TV shows and while it's not very original it is a beautiful location , but not as beautiful as what happens next when the aliens land and make their first appearance in a very memorable scene that had me thinking I'd be watching a great movieOh dear . The problem with having a superb opening is that it's difficult to keep up the consistency and I think this is where the rest of the movie fails . Before too long we jump 300 years into the future where the Earth is in danger from pig faced aliens . I am not xenophobic and have no prejudice about mankind being threatened by pig faced aliens any more that mankind being threatened by mutants in a metallic shell screeching "" EX-TER-MIN-NATE "" or aliens disguised as showroom dummies . No my problem is that director Luc Besson seems to frequently forget all about pig faced aliens and impresses us with set design and special effects thereby sacrificing narrative drive . We see a machine that reminds characters to stop smoking , we see a pod that turns itself into a machine gun/cross bow / flame thrower / rocket launcher , in fact there's hardly a scene in the whole movie in which the plot isn't held up without the urge to show us what a great job the guys and gals at the prop and FX departments have done . Oh bravo - but this is superfluous to the plot and nobody likes to see a show offOne curious aspect Besson has done is to bring one of the most uneven casts ever assembled for a movie . No doubt Besson will claim it's an eclectic mix but I have to stick to my guns and say it's uneven . Ian Holm is totally convincing as is the late John Bennet who played Holm's predecessor at the start of the movie and as you might expect most of the best performances come from British equity members . Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis but was no doubt cast in order to make the movie appeal to an American audience . Tricky is a strange casting choice but holds his own while Oldman's accent is very irritating , I don't mean unconvincing I mean irritating . Without doubt the worst performance belongs to Chris Tucker who nearly brings the fim downLike the cast THE FIFTH ELEMENT is very uneven . It has a great opening 15 minutes then becomes just another flashy overblown futuristic fantasy and long before the final credits rolled I wished that the producers had developed the opening into a 100 minute feature film set in North Africa circa 1914",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I'm sorry, but this is a horrible movie.","I find it hilarious that most of the people that have left comments on this movie either HATE the film or LOVE the film.  There's only a few people that say ""It's alright"".I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters and hadn't bothered seeing it again till last night, and I'd have to say that I liked it even less this time around.To be perfectly honest, I thought it was a HORRIBLE movie!  I don't really get why anyone would like it.  The story is horrible, the music terribly mis-placed, the comedy is just dumb and the characters are lame.Ok, so the ""Fifth Element"" is this alleged ""perfect being"" (Milla Jovovich)? I'm sorry...but STUPID!!!  And while I'm on the subject, why does everyone like Milla so much?  Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress and an ok looker, but for this ""perfect being"" couldn't they get someone more-perfect than Milla, I guess I just wasn't terribly impressed with her looks.  Ok, back to what I was saying about the plot...there is this big ball of ""evil"" coming towards the earth?  Again...STUPID!!!  They didn't even attempt to explain what the HELL this big ball of evil is or where it came from or why it was headed toward earth.  Maybe I just missed something in the film, but it didn't make any sense to me.Ok, I have to mention this now, How on earth can anyone say that Chris Tucker's character was interesting...no wait...tolerable?  Chris' character was GOD-AWFUL!!!  Screaming like a little whiny bitch every 5 seconds!  His character was utterly useless, his character could have EASILY been cut out of the film and it would have made a MUCH better film.The only other character that I hated just as much as Chris Tucker's was the president of the federation.  The casting person should be shot!  Why did they choose Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as the president?  He looks like a cross-eyed retarded thug!  I just couldn't accept that this guy was the president, ANYONE else would have fit-the-mold better than this guy.As for Gary Oldman, I thought he did a fine job with the character he played, but what was with all that lame-ass wardrobe?  What was with that stupid plastic thing on the one side of his head.  I just couldn't buy it, I thought it was dumb looking.  And while I'm thinking of it, what the HELL was up with that stupid looking animal thing that Gary Oldman had in his office when he almost choked near the beginning of the film?  It looked like something you'd see in a Flintstones movie (no disrespect to the Flintstones).  I just thought it was SO out of place and SO un-needed.Also, I couldn't stand those aliens that had the egg shaped ship in the beginning of the film.  I couldn't stand their little heads, their enormous shoulders, and how slow they moved.  I didn't get it, were they aliens or robots or aliens in robotic suits or what?I didn't really have any problem with the Ian Holm character or Bruce Willis', but those were the only two that I could easily tolerate.I WILL give some kudos to the special effects department, IMPRESSIVE!!!  In fact, I'm actually considering buying this movie just for the special effects, they're really quite good.  But sadly, that's the only thing it's got going for it.You know, I like just about every sci-fi movie that comes along and I'm not kidding, I like just about everything, but I really DIDN'T like this film. It had a few good ideas, but it just seemed like they gave a 5 year-old a whole lot of money to make a movie.  Overall, I'm not going to stop you from seeing this movie, come to your own conclusion, but it was just dumb.  I hope you enjoy the film more than I did.

"Plot wise it is weak and rather silly but, for all its weak points it is great fun with a good sense of energy and wonderful design","Three hundred years ago, the powerful weapon of the fifth element was removed from Earth. Three hundred years later and pure evil has stirred in the far reaches of space  and is heading straight for Earth, with traditional weapons unable to stop it. When the Fifth Element is returned, the ship is attacked and seemingly lost  but scientists are able to recreate the fifth element and are surprised to find it is a beautiful young woman, Leeloo. When Leeloo escapes custody she is helped by ex-army taxi driver Korben Dallas. Korben takes her to the priest she names, but he finds that everyone wants her for one reason or another  then he finds that both the army and the priest need him to go on a mission to reclaim the missing four stones and save the Earth from evil.I have seen this film several times and will usually come back to it if I find myself in the mood  but yet I also find myself thinking of its flaws whenever anyone asks me about it. I can't understand why I do this because I really do enjoy this film even though there is much I sort of dislike about it. The plot is one of the weak points; generally it is quite good as an idea but it has many weak points that make it seem rather silly and overly busy. While this is not enough to really damage the film I know that it has put some people off in some audiences, but for me it was only a minor problem as these rather silly bits were all part of a film that had a great sense of fun running through it. Some of it didn't make much sense and at times I got the feeling that the film had more ideas than it really knew what to do with, but the majority of it worked well. The action is good but you should be prepared for the fact that, like much of the film, it is done with a certain amount of tongue in cheek humour. Suffice to say I never found it dull and it has plenty going on for the majority of the filmVisually is the area where the film is strongest and I could watch it for this alone. The effects are great and are full of imagination as well as looking very impressive. The design work of Dan Weil is very well used and compliments the effects used  the film looks lavish and rich all the way through and matches the wonderful costumes from Jean-Paul Gaultier. Of course much of the praise goes to Luc Besson who has managed to pull this together really well to produce an endlessly impressive film, which manages to be a fun and exciting sci-fi.The casting also backs this idea up and features many performances that are spot on with tongue in cheek performances that match the tone of the film perfectly. Bruce Willis delivers the same, great mocking performance that he tried in Hudson Hawk but here he does it in a film that is better structured and less silly than that one and it works a lot better. He still delivers the goods as an action lead but he puts his tongue just far enough in his cheek so as to be there without hurting the film! I don't want to overdo it (after all  he is Bruce Willis!) but I thought he was very well cast here. Oldman is very hammy but this also works as it matches the humour of the piece. Jovovich had a very difficult role and it is easy to laugh at her baby talk etc but I think she made it work well and gave a good performance against the odds. Holm is pretty good and brings humour to his role as well. Tucker, sadly, fails to do the same as these and his overblown performance doesn't even fit well within this film (god knows where it WOULD fit!) and he only succeeds in being shrill and very annoying throughout  not all his fault, his character is a wholly unnecessary part of the film. The support cast is roundly good and features a raft of famous faces in minor roles including Lee Evans, Brion James, Tricky, Luke Perry and Kim Chan. Generally the cast seem to be right on the same page as their director and compliment the material and tone perfectly.Overall this is far from a perfect film and some may find the humour to be at odds with the sci-fi action; but for my money the fact that most of the film backed up this tongue in cheek tone made it all work. Some of the plot has too many ideas or unnecessary elements but most of it is really good and, combined with mostly good performances and stunning designs and effects make for a film that I will watch many times even if I cannot help but see the weaknesses that many others cannot get past.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Flawed Fun.,"This film is one of my favorites but decidedly NOT because of the directing. Luc Besson had a story with a central theme in it (the emotional progress of Korben Dallas, and how the fate of the world hinges on it), but totally failed to put enough into the film to fill that theme out. The climax of the film is greatly deflated because of this.The rest of it is marvelous fun, with excellent acting from all the major characters, uniquely entertaining side characterizations, a well filled-out future society, and an understandable and involving storyline. Had Mr Besson properly set up the climactic scene, it would have been an outstanding five star winner, instead of the three and a half star light watching that it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Okay...,"I'm going to give this a 7/10 for a few fantastic scenes, including an awesome gunfight scene at the end. Bruce Willis was great in this scene, and it would be his best gun-play scene had he not done last man standing. But other than a few great scenes, and when I say great- I mean just that, this movie had stupid cartoon dialog and some hall of shame-worthy over acting.The plot is kind of hard to swallow at times. It can be complex, but can also be shortened for those of whom don't like to think very much during a film. The basic plot is as follows; Bruce Willis plays a bad motherf*cker named Corben Dallas, who has lost his wife and is slumming it in futuristic Brooklyn. He is a former pilot who worked for the government- now, well... not so much. He is a taxi driver who, up until the first day you meet him, has a license with 3 marks on it I believe. After that day though, he ends up with the supreme being falling through the roof of his cab, his 3 marks being taken away along with his license and his job, and to top it all off- this chick can't speak a word of English. Now he goes to a priest, the priest that the chick keeps talking about- yelling out his name and so forth. This priest is an expert on the matter, and until Corben Dallas and his supreme being friend came knocking on his door, he thought mankind was doomed. Corben signs up, unwillingly, to do one last mission for the government, seeing as how he already was knee deep in it, and is set up to win a contest- putting him on a ship with some sacred stones that he has to retrieve. You know, it is not as complicated as it sounds, in fact it's quite an easy film to follow, but on paper... not so much.So anyway, this film was very entertaining, and seeing as how I just watched total recall this morning- I felt the need to go out and rent the fifth element. They remind me of each other for some reason. I heard through the grapevine that the first draft of this film was written by Luc Besson in the 10th grade. Now I'm not sure if this is true or not, and I am way too lazy to check on the IMDb.com trivia section- if it's even there. But anyway, if you're bored and want a cool film that is very, very sci-fi- then you should definitely rent this. I'd say it redeems itself for all the cartoonish dialog and over-acting when they reach the Oprah, but then again- I liked the film as a whole. Bruce Willis is excellent, as is Gary Oldman, but Milla Jovovich (spelling?) is phenomenal. Excellent to say the least. Too bad she went on and did resident evil.This was worth a 7/10. Just about as good as Total Recall, although I forget what I gave total recall.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Science fiction comedy which becomes tedious at points. Not very funny, but still quite entertaining. Great acting by Gary Oldman.","This complicated story is way too long for a comedy. Half an hour could have easily been cut out of it, to improve the flow. The scifi story is bizarre and doesnt really matter, because it is just an excuse for Bruce Willis to save someone, to fight someone and to save someone again etc. Director Luc Besson has more often made movies with stories that just make no sense whatsoever, but you soon realise that when you start watching it. And because one knows it isnt meant to be taken seriously, one can just relax and go with the wild flow of this bizarre science fiction comedy in which Milla Jovovich is an alien that must save the earth from an attack. Bruce Willis is there to protect her. And the ever evil Gary Oldman is out to kill them both.Complicated yet dumb story, but the action and the jokes are good enough to get entertained. Kids would love it. Most adults could love it too if they are into Bruce Willis and have an affection for other weird movies of Luc Besson.

High-style garbage,"There's Bruce Willis, who can act but, except for Die Hard, Sixth Sense and maybe a couple of others, has never chosen his starring vehicles wisely.

"Oddly appealing, but pulled down by too many annoying elements","I've seen The Fifth Element several times now, at least four or five, and I still can't say what it is find strangely appealing about it; I just can't bring myself to say that it's bad, though I don't consider it a spectacular(or even mediocre) achievement in cinema. The film is carried by an insurmountable amount of mix-ups between the various characters, and almost nothing else, which can be considered a strong argument both for and against the movie's quality; for, since it's somewhat of an achievement, against, since it should(arguably) be a more worthwhile line of situations that keep a movie going. The characters are almost all clichés, especially the main characters, and there is nothing in the movie to outweigh that; however, somehow, it didn't matter too much, much like the plot being carried by mix-ups. The dialog is no crowning achievement either; neither is the action. So what is it exactly that draws people to this film, and works on so many levels, and is liked by so many? Frankly, I have no idea. It just does. Perhaps Luc Besson took a degree in psychology, and is somehow affecting our subconscious with the film; who knows. The acting is mostly good. Bruce Willis is good enough as Dallas, though his character(and acting) is mostly derived from all of the other smart, wise-cracking, well-trained and skilled characters he's played in the past. The science fiction elements of the film are sometimes spectacular, sometimes a little weird, but mostly entirely unbelievable; and I'm almost certain that's how Besson wanted it. What carries the film is the humor in it; every single scene has some humor in it, and it overshadows everything else. This is mostly a good thing, though, as it works, most of the time. The timing and gags are great, not tired, worn out, or forced, as they are with plenty of Hollywood productions. I thoroughly enjoyed the cross-cutting segments of the film, they were some of the best parts of the film, and delivered some of the best laughs. One thing that thoroughly annoyed me, was Chris Tucker's character; he was constantly irritating, and obviously(like many of the other main characters) he was mainly there to contribute to the mix-ups and the humor. I would've liked the film more, had there been something more...what's the word... ""Hollywood"", I guess. It's just annoying when there aren't really any characters that we truly care about, and just about all of the main characters mainly are there to make us laugh. All in all, an oddly appealing film, but too many shortcomings and distractions to be entirely enjoyable. I recommend this to... hmmm... that's a tough one; I can't really say who'll enjoy the film, actually. I suppose fans of Besson and his earlier work might enjoy it, but pretty much everybody should give it a try. It's hard to tell who'll like it and who won't. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The action sequences are more successful and occasionally become involving.The idea of leavening the mix with humour was appealing in concept but, in execution dissolved into stupidity on too many occasions (especially with respect to a very camp talk show host), and jarred with the rest of the movie.Overall, an average movie, although fans of Bruce Willis may rate it slightly higher.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie has all the right elements!,"Last night I watched ""The Fifth Element"" (1997) written /directed by Luc Besson for the first time - somehow I missed it and not being a huge fan of sci-fi, I did not search for it. Better later then never - the movie is pure and marvelous fun. It smiles at itself, does not take itself seriously and it is outrageously beautiful. It is a perfect mixture of Action / Adventure / Romance / Sci-Fi / Thriller/ with the comedy and the funny one, too. It seems to me that Steven Spielberg might have used some ideas of ""The Fifth Element"" in his great ""Minority Report"". The story's five elements, four stones that represent water, earth, fire and air, and a perfect human creature - a girl, must together fight the absolute evil. Bruce Willis is as good as ever doing what he does best -fighting the bad guys (ugly scary aliens and very bad Gary Oldman with a hairdo you have to see to believe) and saving not just a hotel or one big city or even the great country but the Life as we know it. Luc Besson, the director, also wrote the story and the screenplay and I read that he had written it when he was 13. I think it is great that he adapted his own early writings because there is so much joy in it, the joy and happiness that only can be felt in one's childhood. The visuals, the sound, and the music to the film are terrific. The costumes created by another boy-genius, ""enfant terrible"" of Paris haute couture Jean-Paul Gaultier will grab your eye and attention - so shockingly creative and unforgettable they are - the garment Milla was wearing in her first scene, for example. Who would think the wide band-aids can look so sexy yet innocent yet crazy when wrapped around a beautiful girl? Bruce Willis's orange top that matches Milla's blinding red hair, absolutely hilarious outfits DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) was proudly wearing? I am smiling now when I just think of them. Milla Yovovich possesses a rare exotic unusual beauty and the eyes, radiant and green like a new spring grass - she was a perfect choice for a perfect creature, the Mankind's only hope for survival in the eternal ferocious struggle between Good and Evil, Creativity and Destruction, Life and Death, Love and Hatred.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of the best sci-fi movies of the 90's and our generation.,"Seriously, this movie was very ahead of its time. I don't know what sprung in the director, but this movie was pure genius. There's so much originality in this and a lot of creativity. You know how when you watch a James Cameron movie and at the end of it you're like ""holy crap, this movie feels as if it came out this year"". Well, this is exactly how I felt about this movie. It's just like a James Cameron movie, way ahead of its time, well, the 90's.The city with the flying cars, floating Chinese take-out, and cigarettes that have the filter backwards, I love this film! I can watch this movie over and over again and it would still feel new to me. Thanks to blu-ray technology, I can see it in beautiful high definition followed by some nice surround sound system.The visuals and special effects were very amazing for a 90's movie. And this is 1997, you wouldn't expect much from movies in the 90's in terms of nice special effects, with the exception of T2. But this movie delivered on a massive scale.Gary Oldman is the villain. Not the brightest villain, but he's cool. We have cameo appearances from trip hop artist, Tricky, as Gary Oldman's sidekick I guess? Bruce Willis, one of my favorite actors plays the role of the sarcastic action hero. He pairs up with the hot and sexy Milla Jonovich. That scene where she was created by the machines got me a little excited cause she's just so sexy. Chris Tucker is in it and he's just such a goof. It's kinda hard to tell whether he's straight or gay because of weird fashion the world of the Fifth Element serves its citizens, but nonetheless, it fit the world, because it needed something new.The plot is another save the world from the bad guy scenario, with a twist. You have this deadly planet coming for earth, which looks like an asteroid, but apparently the planet speaks because it's alien, and the main group of hero's must gather all the stones which would be placed in a temple in Egypt to stop the impending attack on earth. You have a gang of mercenary-type aliens who can shape-shift into humans and use any means of violence to accomplish their goals.The main group of hero's are also joined by a priest by British actor, Sir Ian Holm, who does a phenomenal job on his part. The worlds and locations in this film are just stunning and beautiful, it's like you wish the world looked like that today, but sadly it doesn't look anything close to what the Fifth Element looked like.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 for originality, creativity, and stunning visuals. If you haven't seen this, then you should, because this should be on the list of movies you should watch before you die. Buy this movie, it's worth every penny. I look at other sci-films today that involve a similar plot and I can't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed this movie. I wish the director had the ambition to make a sequel for this, because it's under-rated. Long live the Fifth Element.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pure fun,"I've seen this movie a bunch of times. I can't recommend it enough. It's fun, funny, kinetic, amazing looking and has one of Gary Oldman's most enjoyable performances (even if Oldman himself hates the film).A lot of the fun comes from the bizarre cast of characters. The Laconic Korben Dallas, the beautiful and mysterious Leeloo, the ADHD poster child Ruby Rhod (seriously, who thought of Chris Tucker for this? That was brilliant and unexpected), the dour priest, the evil industrialist and his alien buddies, a blue opera singer... Who comes up with this stuff?My favorite part is Gary Oldman's character Jean Baptiste Emanuel Zorg. Supposedly, Oldman took this role out of loyalty to his friend, Besson, and didn't like the film at all. I was sad to read this, because to me, Zorg is one of the most entertaining characters ever put on screen. His monologue about the virtues of destruction is a classic, and his description of the gun he's selling to the aliens should be shown back to back with any ""Q"" scene from a 007 film. (In the same way that This Is Spina Tap should be shown back to back with The Kids Are All Right.)All of this is wrapped up in a truly unique visual style and slick special effects that never seem forced.Sometimes what you really want from a movie is pure escapist entertainment, and that's what you get from The Fifth Element.The cherry on top: Korben's mother, voiced by Jill Mullan who literally phoned her part in.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Lots of fun,"When The Fifth Element was released in 1997, it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was selected as the opening film. By the end of the year, the movie grossed over $263,920,180, making it the 9th highest-grossing film of the year. After seeing The Fifth Element, I was surprised to realize that the entire story and ideas came from an teenage boy. Who's that teenage boy you might ask? It came from the film's director and writer, Luc Besson. Besson came up with the story while he was in high school. As a movie, it is more than meet the eye.The story begins with a text, saying, ""Egypt, 1914."" Aliens called Mondoshawans come to Earth to collect a weapon that can be use to defeat a Great Evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones. Each has its classification of elements. All four stones revolved around a fifth element, which is represented in the form of a human. Before leaving Earth, the aliens promise that they will return the four stones in time to stop the Great Evil.The movie then fast forwards to the 23rd century, in the year 2263, where New York City cab driver, Korben Dallas, (Bruce Willis), is an ordinary everyday man that sort of like the kind of guy Willis played in Die Hard, sort to think. Anyway, the Great Evil appears space in the form of a giant black ball of fire. Vito Cornelius, (Ian Holm), informs the president the background history of the Great Evil. As the Mandoshawans head to Earth, another race of aliens, the bad kind, the Mangalores, who work for Zorg, (Gary Oldman), decides to shoot down the Mandoshawans' ship. Even though the stones weren't on board, there is one thing that does survive. The hand of the fifth element. Scientists then create an beautiful alien named Leeloo, (Milla Jovovich). But Leeloo escapes and finds herself falling into Dallas' cab. After a rocky start, Dallas realizes that he must protect Leeloo from danger because she is the fifth element, as we learn later on in the movie.Now, you might think that The Fifth Element is a very bad science- fiction movie, right? Well, it isn't. In fact, I really enjoyed this movie because of the film's amazing and dazzling special effects. In fact, I like to point out that this the first science-fiction movie I've seen where the future is not at all depressing or screwed up in any way. I like this kind of future. I would definitely get lost in this kind of world. The way the colors are used in the movie and the way different shapes are used is something stunning. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie had time to stop for humor because there are a number of funny moments that are in this movie. Most of them come from Chris Tucker, who plays an radio DJ, who is very very eccentric. He really generates much of the movie's funny moments. At certain times, the gears do shift once in awhile. But, it did worked. The cinematography of the movie is very good and I also admired the costume design, which was done by Jean Paul Gaultier.However, even though I'm given a lot of credit to the technical aspects of the movie and to the story, the movie does run on a little too long. Clocking in at 2 hours and 7 minutes, the movie shouldn't been edited into a more tighter time space. I would definitely cut back on some of the opening scene of the movie because I felt it did go on for a little while. But that aside, I did have a good time watching this movie. I believed in the story that Besson had to offered although the most interesting thing about his story is that it isn't like Star Wars. When I mean is that in the Star Wars movies, there are a lot of ideas and pieces that are burrowed from other movies. In a way, those pictures are like puzzles. However, The Fifth Element isn't like Star Wars. There isn't anything burrowed from other movies in this film, but what we have is an original idea and story that comes from an man who grew up to become an very well-detailed virtuoso. There's a lot of money that was spend on the making of this movie, but Besson sure knows how to spend it. This is one ride that you would like to take again. ★★★ 3 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Negative, I am a meat Popsicle.","It's 2259 and the Earth is in mortal danger from pure evil. The only hope Earth has is something called the fifth element, which comes in the form of the newly cloned Leeloo. Along with an ex forces cab driver and a priest called Cornellius, Leeloo must piece it together before the end of mankind arrives.Depending on which side of the fence you sit on, The Fifth Element is either a child fantasy made by an adult, or an adult fantasy made by a child! Here in lies the problem that many critics and movie watchers can't agree on. Just what does Luc Besson's film want to be? Having conceived the concept for his film at a very early age, Besson I think waited until he was comfortable with his adult eyes, and armed with the technological advancements in the late 90s, to realise his vision. With the result being a beautiful piece of science fiction that is, yes- cartoonish in every other frame.Crucial though is that Besson's futuristic vision of New York dominates proceedings, not even a villain overdrive from Gary Oldman can detract from the colourful vistas that Besson has crafted. The sea has dropped and New York is awash with flying cars, there are no take aways anymore, the Chinese junks fly to your front door to serve you food, how cool is that? Shape shifting aliens are amongst us, who in the context of this Jean-Paul Gautier clothed universe, blend in effortlessly, and opera divas are strangely beautiful and blue creatures. In short, the film is an art direction treat, a feast for the eyes, even as the comedy and action take control in the final third.Bruce Willis quickly leaves behind his successful trip to harder edged roles (Twelve Monkeys) to play super cabbie Korben Dallas. Gun toting and with a quip at every turn, this is the Willis that the MTV generation loves and adores. Oldman, for better or worse as Zorg, gives a memorable performance (oh my, is that a Southern American accent?), but it's with Mila Jovovich (Leeloo) that the film gets its acting spurs. A pure revelation, it begs the question on why Jovovich has failed to progress in the acting world? (stop doing tripe like Resident ""will work for food"" Evil films would be a good start).Sci-fi fans will obviously get the point that the support cast features Ian Holm (Alien) and Brion James (Blade Runner), which off sets the annoying and painful turn from Chris Tucker as zany, insecure DJ Ruby Rhod (is Besson having a pop at world DJs here I wonder?). To leave us with what? A film that mildly suffers from its director giving way to his heart over his head, but hey baby, it's one groovy and enjoyable romp from start to finish regardless. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Bruce Willis does an outstanding job as the main lead.The only real problem I have with the film is the main character's motivation. I never really understood why he decided to be part of this conflict, and in my opinion, that is something that takes you out of the film.

"""Does anybody else want to negotiate?""","The Fifth Element, years ago it now seems (and was), played a lot of TV and I usually watched it many times when it was on. It's not really a 'great' film, or one that should be seen by all serious genre fans like Leon- The Professional was for crime films. But it's probably one of the most watchable science fiction adventures put to the screen in the late 90s, a kind of techno-punk version of Star Wars meant more for the late teens crowd than for everyone. It's story is simple enough- trying to retrieve some missing stones that will help save the world from a meteor or other about to collide and destroy everything, and the group of people who can stop it- that its the colorful, strange supporting performances and imaginative visuals can steal the show. Milla Jovovich, more than anyone, makes her mark as a real kind of 'breakthrough' role (i.e. I never really heard of her before the movie and for a while I thought of her as the '5th element' chick in high school). Her role doesn't require too much dialog- as she barely speaks English throughout most of the film. She's got the sexy look (PG-13 with nudity for the boys), lots of power in the fight scenes, and she can even work the emotional scenes to. I would probably take her work in this film over her other Besson collaboration in Joan of Arc, as here she takes herself seriously for what she is, and it still ranks as one of her very best performances so far in her decade long career playing roles like this.The rest of the cast, however, is a bit more hit or miss, though a little more hit than miss. Bruce Willis is his usually cynical, hard-edged self with remnants of John McClaine kicking around as an ex-officer turned cab driver who's recruited to take the '5th element' (Jovovoich) to get the stones and to the temple. Gary Oldman is very bizarre (see the 'blood' or 'sweat' or whatever trickle down his forehead during a tense phone conversation) as a villain who is a kind of pawn for the enemy, while also supplying weapon for a bunch of ugly creatures. Some of his scenes are the funniest, while being very creepy the whole while. Others like Tony Lister and Ian Holm are dependable as always in uncomplicated 2-dimensional roles. Only Chris Tucker gets pestering in his most flamboyant role to date (if that's possible) as the 'comic relief' in the form of a celeb host. I don't know if whether the character is really the problem or Tucker's interpretation, but I still feel those scenes are kind of distracting and below Tucker's comic skills.But as a pure action spectacle, you could do worse than the 5th Element, where it's a kind of future world with weird gadgets and items, all in a more Earth-bound perspective. The main battle scene in the opera is also on par with some of the better sequences in The Professional. Sometimes the themes are hit a little too often, repetitive if you will, like with Jovovich getting over-emotional (though her little lesson on the history of the world via computer is amazing). So it's not really as fantastic as Besson might think it is, yet every time it was on I didn't change the channel much; it's got that comic-book appeal where you know what will happen- of course in repeat viewings- but you want to stay tuned for the really nifty sequences and rewarding unconventional moments and lines.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A feast for the eyes,"On the continuum between form and substance 'The fifth element"" stands firmly on the side of ""form"". Something not to be surprised of by a a director (the most successful director) of the ""Cinema du look"" movement.The plot is paperthin but the images are terrific. The visual language looks very much like a comic book (""Kuifje"" or ""TinTin), and I later read that this is indeed one of the sources of inspiration for director Luc Besson. The, often very strange, costumes were designed by the famous French couturier Jean Paul Gaultier. This was not the first time that this fashion designer contributed to a movie. Earlier examples are ""The cook, the thief, his wife & her lover"" (1989, Peter Greenaway) and ""The city of lost children"" (1995, Jean Pierre Jeunet).The film has hints of classic science fiction films such as ""Metropolis"" (1927, Fritz Lang) and ""Blade runner"" (1982, Ridley Scott), but takes itself less seriously. There are comic characters that in my opinion are a little silly (certainly after a while). Brilliant are the visual gags such as McDonalds and the Chinese take-away in the 23th century.According to Rogert Ebert the film is a bit to long, and I agree with him. To avoid this is in principle the job of the editor. One can imagine however the objections of director Besson when she cuts away very expensive scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Futuristic quest of good versus evil,"This film is satisfying on many levels. A beautiful movie to watch with regards to both color and direction. The tasty blue-orange combination may linger in your thoughts for some time. Plenty of action but not overloaded. The futuristic metropolis is loaded with visual effects that are excellent, so you'll have to look hard to point out inconsistencies. But I'm glad the special effects stop with spaceships and scenery and do not continue with the making of the alien characters. There is a plethora of costumes and make-up, which gives the movie life. However, you can load a movie with art and still suffer by way of plot, dialog, and acting. But this is where The Fifth Element excels. The story is simply one of good versus evil but along the way there's a dose of unpredictability as far as where the good guys are headed and who they'll encounter. Just add in the sci-fi flavor and you get a tale of wonderment which doesn't let up. Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Milla Jovovich, and Ian Holm all produce the necessary passion for their deep characters and the splendid dialog. My appreciation for all of this has increased since when I first saw it at the theater in '97. There was a lot for me to process so it took me several views to fully absorb this fine experience. Action/adventure, comedy, love, and drama have been intertwined into this mesmerizing work of art for the eyes and ears. Do enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Korben is a retired special forces major who unknowingly takers this mysterious vandal in without realizing that she maybe earth's Saviour along with 4 peculiar stones otherwise known as classical elements.While head of the Zorg corporation, Jean-Baptiste Zorg(Oldman)wants these for something else And that's all I'm saying watch it you to find out what happens....if you like Sci-fi films might enjoy it or not. The story is quite unusual and Intriguing and the film tries not to take it self to serious which I enjoyed and also helped with it's humor. The Production design is mad and queer and almost looks psychedelic which left a feel to the eyes which made me want to see more of the utopia for the future.The characters were acted well but I felt they weren't developed well to actual care for them enough.Gary Oldman's Jean-baptiste Emanuel Zorg was,Superbly acted as was Willi's Korben. Some funny dialogue and over the top action Kept Me entertained for the most of the film.My Biggest Problem is that the pace is very inconsistent and some seem feel forced and tend drag on when there no need and it looses your focus and also Chris Tucker's super gay TV anchorman is probably More irritating then Star wars' Jar-Jar Binks being he has much more screen time and that the character is completely unnecessary to the plot,I was considering turning it off it he annoyed me so much .What Will say is don't watch this film with high expectations as you might disappointed but it warrants a watch for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"STYLiSH SCi-Fi, FRoM LuC BeSSoN","This is one of the 3 movies that Luc Besson sent most of his life plotting, besides Leon, and Nikita.The story is set on eath in some 300 years hence, and involves a priest and a would-be 1000-and something year old supreme being (Milla Jovovich), from retreving 5 elements, which when alighened, will desroy a large demonic-death star that will bring eternal evil to earth, if not stopped within 48 hours...///along the lines, Gunh-Ho ex-military Jck-thel lad Bruce Willis gets mixed up in things, and trevels half-way across the solar system to get off with Milla Jovovich...The Bruce Willis' character plays kind of corny into the story, and is typical of a an American low-base Superman hero.

The costume and fashion designs are pretty orgional too, along with garry Oldman's psychotic, and Chris Trucker's lady-king preformances to take you on a roller coaster spins of action and adventure.Overall, it's not bad for a watch, and can be watched again at regular intervals of the year. Definately not one for the Oscars, but definately one of the best modern sci-fi's to date besides Men In Black and Star Wars. 5/10***",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Spiffy sci-fi action pic, severely diminished by Chris Turner's degrading performance","Willis and Jovovich get a great start on a rousing sci-fi adventure (with excellent effects). Oldman's sufficiently over-the-top villain adds to the cliché-ridden suspense...But then Chris Turner's overly limp-wristed, flamboyant performance pushes it over into cardboard silliness.When Willis tries to ""protect"" Turner from the bad guys' weapon blasts it feels like Clint Eastwood is sheltering a cartoon - Missy Piggy, perhaps. A tragic conclusion (the last third of the film) to what might otherwise be a Grade A-minus sci-fi thriller/adventure classic. Unfortunately, Turner's interpretation plunges the film into the C-minus zone.(What was Director Besson thinking? For a compassionate and enjoyable - even realistic - look at Male Effeminism, enjoy Nathan Lane in ""The Birdcage"", released the previous year.)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Movie With All the Necessary ELEMENTS!,"The Fifth Element is in a category all its own!!! Just take a careful look at the IMDb info for the film.... Country: FRANCE, Director: Luc Besson, Filming Locations: Pinewood Studios, UK (Mostly), an International Cast, and most certainly, a rather International feel to many aspects of the production. As an avid, lifelong film buff, it seems that as the years pass, the more I watch ELEMENT, the more I really come to appreciate practically every exquisite detail!Oddly, after my first viewing, I wasn't really all that impressed. I suppose it wasn't at all apparent to me just how much of an ""onion"" ELEMENT really was.From the onset, labeled 1914, exquisite design, costume and set elements are obvious! Analyze the external appearance of the alien ""protectors""...Quite artistic, indeed. The same can be said of their spacecraft. The music, by Eric Serra, has won awards and quite deservedly, I would say. It adds delicious depth and an International flavor and texture to most of its scenes.There is really something for everyone in ELEMENT. If you want straightforward action/comedy/entertainment, that really doesn't require much in the way of analysis, there is plenty. If you're a bit of a romantic, you, too, should be satisfied. And if you are looking for a ""Message"" or some sort of philosophical moral, if you look, I'm sure you will encounter quite a bit.IMDb lists it as Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi...To which I would certainly add Comedy, among other elements.Not that ELEMENT is perfect...It does have a few minor flaws. Gary Oldman, for example, is frequently over-the-top, (but then again, when ISN'T he?) But, I must say, these moments add to the overall entertainment, all-in-good-fun, quality of the movie! Pretty much everything in ELEMENT honestly ""Works""...Which, in the total scheme of things, is what really matters, isn't it?.....

Weird and wonderful!,"Visionary director Luc Besson brings us an action-packed fantasy adventure in the vein of 'Total Recall'. Oh, I so miss Bruce Willis making good movies!!We're all familiar with the four elements Earth, Air, Fire and Water. In 'The Fifth Element', the fifth element in question is a superior being called Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). The film starts in Egypt in 1914 with a discovery foretelling the coming of evil. Friendly aliens, Mondoshawans, take a weapon - consisting of four engraved stones - that could destroy the evil, with them and promise to return it when the evil arrives.300 Years later, this evil arrives in the form of a giant fireball, threating Earth. On their way to Earth, the Mondoshawans are ambushed by the film's antagonist, Zorg (very well portrayed by Gary Oldman), who wants the stones for himself.Bruce Willis stars as ex-starfighter Korben Dallas, now a cab driver. When Leeloo literally lands in his cab, this sets of a domino effect of events that were as weird as they were wonderful.'The Fifth Element' has the age-old premise of an artifact of great power being sought by a villain for his own use (or should that be abuse?). The film takes many turns and does get a bit complicated, but the lighthearted narration makes it entertaining. Although the film is slightly weird and the comic elements edging towards slapstick, it nevertheless remained exciting throughout and I wasn't annoyed with the humour as I often am.Most of the humour comes in the form of Ruby Rhod, a flamboyant entertainer. Chris Tucker was just fabulous as Ruby!! All hell breaks loose during the final act on a super luxury space ship (and I mean ship as in cruise liner, flying in space!). The final act has PLENTY of action, gunfire, and explosions and its stunning! The production design is simply incredible.'The Fifth Element' might not be for everyone, but if you enjoy sci-fi, you're bound to love this film!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The kind of tripe that passes for a feast these days,"So this is what the art of visual spectacle has come to.  ""Fantasia"" (1940), ""Black Narcissus"" (1947), ""2001"" (1968), ""Star Wars"" (1977) - I could add many other examples - were all thrilling in various ways.  ""The Fifth Element"" merely induces a headache.  I'll give Besson his due for having the right kind of general idea.  He wants to give us a guided tour of the rainbow, and he has a good deal of success, in individual scenes.  He knows that computers alone won't do the trick.  The perfect lighting combines with set and costume design to serve up some lovely colour-cocktails: president's purple throne room, the villain standing in a corridor of weed-tinted green, the blue soprano singing in front of a dark indigo arches framing a ripe blue planet.  But it doesn't always work.  Sometimes Besson's sense of colour fails him and the result is a mess.  And apart from his sense of colour he has nothing to fall back on.  The design of the future - it's all visual design - is mostly a compendium of clichés, mixed in with a souped-up vision of the 1990s: an empty, hip, MTV flashiness.  Some of the computer images work, but most of them - the traffic shots in particular - feature the kind of cheesy rendering and animation that will forever be the industry standard, if we're not careful.Hipness - that's Besson's guiding star.  He doesn't even care what his film looks like so long as he can convince us that he's up-to-the-minute and with it.  I suppose that's why the action sequences are all underscored (and undercut) by ghastly techno-trash for which, as is so often the case, Eric Serra is to blame.Apart from the look and the feel there's nothing to talk about without being overcome by deep weariness.  The plot isn't hard to understand.  At least, it's as easy to understand on the first viewing as it's ever going to get. It will never make any sense.  Here's the central idea: once every five thousand years comes a great evil that will destroy all life, ALL life, if a magic ceremony isn't performed.  The villain wants to stop the ceremony from being performed.  The phrase ""obscure motivation"" doesn't even begin to describe this situation.  Does the villain want to die?  No.  Is he acting in ignorance?  No.  Is there ANY way of making sense of his psychology? No.If Besson had been content with a simple high-wire act of implausibility, if he'd been willing to let his central conceit rest unexplained, it MIGHT have worked.  But he tries to explain things and makes matters worse.  He can't even come up with some decent sophistry.  Watch the first confrontation between the priest and the villain while bearing in mind that both players know that the future of all life is at stake.  The advanced student who can salvage some kind of point from this scene should then turn his attention to the mysterious actions performed by the priest (a different priest) in the opening scene.  It's no use: there's no making sense of any of it.So far I've been kind.  It's despicable as well as bad.  Anything so soulless, that tries so hard to be hip and cynical, has no RIGHT to attempt such blatant emotional manipulation at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The epitome of emptiness,"I hate this movie with a passion. If there ever was a pretentious movie about nothing, but which tried recklessly to cover up its lack of meaning with overelaborate sets and costumes, this is it right here.

Willis, Jovovich, Besson (for direction and script), and perhaps Tucker (and Ian Holm), all deserved Oscars for this.Perhaps some day Pedro Almodovar will make a screwball sci-fi comedy, or maybe Stanley Kubrick will come back from the grave and direct a Star Wars sequel as a dead-on comedy.

Must see for science fiction lovers!,"I saw the film and I found it wonderful, both story, and acting, especially Milla Jovovich'.

However, Milla's performance was not the only one demonstrating competence and brilliance: all of the actors were excellent and credible! Aside from the, at times, excessive violence, I encountered the film essentially delightful, including among other aspects the creative and unique futuristic imaginations of which the film was well-endowed.

Flash Gordon in the late 1990s!,"For the first few minutes of this film, you may believe you are watching an earnest, but desperately hammy, sci-fi thriller.  Thankfully, this impression is soon dispelled. 'The Fifth Element' is simply the most pure comic-book creation on celluloid since Flash Gordon, taking from that medium not just the tedious plotting and flimsy scenarios of most examples of this genre, but also a spirit of vivid, and visual, comic imagination.  This is not a serious movie.  But it is inventive, frequently funny and has a sly satirical sense reminiscent of 'The Hitch Hikers' Guide to the Galaxy'.

"Love it or hate it, it's guaranteed to entertain your face off","I'll admit, I despised this the first time I saw it. I found it cheesy, over-the-top, and incredibly annoying. But after a couple viewings, it has gradually become one of my favorites.I think the thing about this movie is that you have to be in the right frame of mind before you see it. If you're looking for something emotionally moving,intellectual, or powerful, put this down immediately and watchShawshank Redemption instead. However, if you're looking for somegiggles and action-packed creative fun, this is the one for you.It's bright, colorful, quirky, and fast-paced. The characters are all charming in their own unique ways. Even the doofy looking wart-faced aliens have their endearing moments. I also love how memorable everything about it is - For better or for worse.

Classic,"As a kid I watched this, I wouldn't even know how many times, long time since a saw this and recently gave it a watch. And I have to say, it holds up, almost even better then I remembered and as the movie this time unfolded before me, I realized I remember every scene, but also that so much time had passed, that it still felt new while at the same time I remembered all of it, kind of a strange feeling actually but a good one.It's not flawless movie, it's very silly at times and the plot makes little sense and kind of follows one of the most basic story lines there ever been in storytelling. But it works, beacuse the film is filled to the brime with so much more then the basic core element of the basic plot.A stylistic cyberpunk masterpiece. With great performances all around. And also really funny, not a comedy per say, but the jokes do come at a steady flow and the humor works, this movie is actually filled with jokes and has a humorous tone as a whole over all, but in a way that really works for its benefit, because it becomes a part of the artistic style and vibe of this a bit wacky fantasy universe, that still very much represents our society and the human race, even if all in all a bit cartoonish and crazy here. This was also the movie were Chris Tucker were introduced to later become the Rush Hour star and Mila Jovovich was introduced, that later carried the whole Resident Evil movie franchise on her own, poor girl (just kidding). And this is to me Bruce Willis greatest film that he stars in (and he have made many good films) and Gary Oldman portrays a great cartoonish villian here that won't soon be forgotten.Now, what truly makes this movie so great is the sci-fi setting combined with Luc Besons artistic flare, here it creates magic (sadley I think Beson tried to do this aging in Valarian and The City of Thousand Planets but it really didn't work that time, mostly because the actors sucked but also because some misstakes from Beson).I think The Fifth Element is a cultural classic and actually had a cultural impact. It had a lot of imaginative ideas that has been used in other successful franchises today. Even though it perhaps wasn't the first on all of these ideas, for example we already had a strong femma fatale cyberpunk women in the Ghost In The Shell anime from 1995, but we still had never seen this before in a live action movie. Then we have the thing that she can use a computer to learn things that takes years to learn in merely seconds, later used by the Wachowisky brothers in Matrix. Then off course the big metropolitan with the insane traffic of flying cars (later used in the Star Wars prequels), is perhaps the biggest character of the movie. The city really benifited from being made with combination of miniatures and cgi, because that gives it an artistic and authentic look, that still holds up today.There are some iconic shots in this movie, for example the scene when Leeloo jumps from the building wall with an over head view as she jumps out into the traffic of flying cars, is just fantastic, what a great shot. And the whole scene with the blue tentacle-head opera singer is a masterpiece, who ever knows about this movie knows about that, seeing that was the first time in my life I thought ""hey, maybe opera is not that horrible as I have previously believed."" And there are so many more moments in this movie, that at least to me is iconic, like Chris Tuckes character introduction as he does his monolog to his radio show, the Asian flying street restaurant and many more scenes and moments.This movie also tries to get serious at one point and carry a deeper more sentimental message and it does not come of cheesy to me, it's beautiful. This entire movie works perfectly. The action scenes are a bit silly, or very extremely silly, but this is how action was made in the 90s and it's a comforting nostalgic expirence to me.Sure, the story is very basic in the most simplest of forms. We have a big evil thing that wants to destroy all life. We have a somewhat antihero of a guy that's a bit lost in life but still unmistakably a good guy. We have the damsel in distress. And we have the mcmuffin thingys that the heros of the story needs get to certain place to destroy the evil. Has this story been told before? Yes, countless of times. But in The Fifth Element it's all the other things around it that makes the movie. And as a crasy-cyberpunk-futer movie goes, this is one of the absolut best. It's a masterpiece. And a classic. I personally just love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The film envolves the viewer both in its visual madness and in its fast pace of editing that compensates for the flaws and makes the experience as unique. A classic of 1990s!,"In sci-fi, we find many examples of films with the courage to be original in their concepts and to have an auteur stamp from the filmmakers who directed them. It was like that with Blade Runner; Ghost in the Shell; Matrix; The Planet of the Apes; City of shadows; films that took hold of the genre's rich concepts and explored it in ways that the general public perhaps did not expect, and enjoyed the profit of being recognized today by legions of fans, even if it took some critics to swallow their egos and accept something new and original.A film like that could easily come from a director with a solidly renowned name like Luc Besson. Recognized today by many for being perhaps the greatest French director of the action genre, but who never stuck to just that genre and has always shown himself to be someone creative in the use of escapist cinematographic language, but with a refined European polish as his signature. Author. If today, Besson is ahead of forgettable films like Taken 3, Colombian and The Transporter 3, we see in ""The Fifth Element"" a perfect reminder of his past promising phase, a reminder of how highly original and creative the director could be in its script conception and creation of a universe of its own with its own rich mythology, and without any fear of having its somewhat bizarre quirks.When an alien ship of the peaceful people of the Mondoshawans is attacked, a mysterious artifact is used to reconstruct a humanoid woman, ""Leeloo"" (Milla Jovovich), who is described as the ""perfect being"". Afraid of her unknown captors, she escapes the compound and finds herself with Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a divorced taxi driver and former major in the special forces. That later discovers that Leloo is a living weapon known as the Fifth Element, a being capable of uniting the four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the great evil, a planet in the form of fire that threatens to destroy the entire universe.Perhaps an almost fantasy plot with epic ambitions worthy of a true science fiction film. No wonder its level of detail, which reflects the expansive futuristic utopian universe that forms this world, carries with it immense originality. Besson had already envisioned Fifth Element since his adolescence as a dreamy young filmmaker, and he shows on screen the fulfillment of a dream actually coming true. And yet it is remarkable to see how he manages to conceive in the main narrative certain bizarre and interesting traits of familiarity with great films of the genre such as 2001 - A Space Odyssey itself, with regard to the scientific and ethical questioning of human creation present in its brief between lines of the plot that deals with the origins of the creation and the search of the salvation of the galactic universe when we leave in the dazzling and exciting journey of Dallas to save its new beloved one and the whole universe.Furthermore, the screenplay by Besson (who wrote it at age 16) and by Robert Mark Kamen (from Relentless Quest) is a lesson in daring and creative cinema. Not only does he walk the threshold of utopia and cynicism, he also adds visionary elements. With familiar concepts similar in a way to Ridley Scott's own Blade Runner, in what refers mainly to the creation of a utopian future that reflects multi-urbanization in its immense megalopolis, and the intense dependence on technology. Concepts that are always presented in a very subtle way in the characterization of the city and the characters' environments, such as the narrow cubicle in which Dallas lives, or the countless technological devices that Gary Oldman's villain Zorg has in his office, for no apparent reason.The production is accurate in everything that composes it, without wasting time with so much explanatory exposition and knowing how to balance everything in an always fluid and perfect rhythm. And still bring with it this humorous and bizarre tone so gaudy that, surprisingly, it never crosses the line of silly caricature, but instead proves to be constantly funny and highly entertaining filled with a cast that is nothing less than highly charismatic where clearly everyone is having fun, counting with an always great Iam Holm with his unshakable faith and seriousness, convincing yet as golden comic relief. We still have Chris Tucker as the famous presenter who just screams for help when chaos sets in. But he manages to get some good laughs too. And having Gary Oldman as the villain is just an invitation to be someone memorable and intimidating, and that's exactly what you get here.Since ""Die Hard"" Bruce Willis has shown that he knows how to mix action with comedy at the right moments, and this role fit him like a glove. The great chemistry between him and Milla Jovovich makes the relationship between the two protagonists delightful to follow. The actress, by the way, is the best thing about the film. His Leeloo is abundantly captivating and shows an innocence, before the world in which it was played, that convinces and conquers the spectators. Besson invented a language for the Leeloo race and Jovovich quickly learned it. To practice, they wrote each other letters in the language and had entire conversations in the new language. This resulted in an enriching element to the scene where Leeloo and Korben meet for the first time, Willis didn't know what he was hearing, so his reactions were improvised. Not to mention the stunning beauty of the then young actress, who more than anyone could embody the person created to be ""perfect"" in every way. Jovovich mesmerizes the entire audience from the moment she appears on screen.The plot is staged as a bizarre action thriller, which ironically has almost no action so to speak. There's a good, and inventive, initial chase between buildings, and the big gunfight in the opera complete with an iconic brief Kung Fu fight interspersed with an extremely entertaining pop sonnet. This is Besson's irony, he rarely delivers action scenes in his films, but when he does, he manages to be a spectacle. Few are the directors who manage to achieve a visual refinement as rich and conceptual as he is. Even in his weakest films, the visuals are always a big standout apart from everything else.Cinematographer Thierry Arbogast gives the film a scenic format worthy of the best epics ever made. Where every mill metric space of scenery, big or small, has this 70mm level immersion capable of bringing the viewer into the film. It's not even a Lusophone need to want to captivate or impress, just something that is part of the director's visual style in wanting to immerse his audience into the universe he creates. Comics artists Moebius and Jean-Claude Mézières (artist of the ""Valerian"" comic, also adapted by Besson for the cinema) worked on the production design of the film and they were worth every penny. The feature is an explosion of colors, all well exalted by the director, who insisted that much of the story took place during the day, delivering a clearer, happier, eccentric, caricatured and even magical look.The cartoonish air is in the characters themselves, from the way they were conceived to their costumes (signed by Jean Paul Gaultier), which fit organically with the film's production design. The actors embody eccentric people and create a great atmosphere for comedy, which is enhanced by the courage of the script to embrace its playful proposal without the slightest hesitation, resulting in one of the funniest features of the 90s. Scene in which one character tells another that he has 20 seconds of his attention, and the other starts talking for exactly this period.The Fifth Element, which seems a far cry from all of Besson's filmography, is the one that punctuates and creates a milestone in his career. Without expecting more from someone who developed this story during his adolescence, there are numerous holes in the script, a questionable timeline and an antagonist that sometimes does not seem to make sense to exist in the plot. However, the film is unbeatable for involving the viewer both in its visual madness and in its fast pace of editing that compensates for the flaws and makes the experience a unique fun. ""The Fifth Element"" is easily one of the funniest works of 1990s cinema. A film that reminds us of a good time when we could see original, creative, and extraordinarily entertaining films with that admirable European polish, realizing a rich entertainment so cleverly conceived and sorely lacking in today's mundane world.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"The Epitome Of A ""90s Time Capsule"" Film","""The Fifth Element"" is a movie made at the perfect time (late-1990s) and seen by this reviewer at the perfect age (12). Does it hold up 25+ years later? Not really. Is it still entertaining enough to be watchable? For sure!For a very basic overview, ""The Fifth Element"" tells an alien invasion story between warring factions over planet Earth. Somehow, futuristic cab drive Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) gets caught up in the mayhem when mysterious stranger LeeLoo (Mila Jovovich) literally and figuratively falls into his lap, prompting a universe-hopping action/adventure extravaganza.If you come to the cinema for tight plotting, ""The Fifth Element"" probably won't be for you (or at very least have a short ceiling). Very little about the plot machinations make even the slightest lick of sense, bounding from one ridiculous contrivance to another and using an entire year's worth of deus ex machina in the process!But for a flick like ""The Fifth Element"", such plot failings almost do no matter in the long run. Why? Because it has so many other things that worked at time-of-release (1997) or are interesting/nostalgic anachronisms today. Some examples...-Willis was just finishing his run as action-adventure hero of Stallone and Schwarzenegger ilk and couldn't have been more in-demand at that moment.-Jovovich was the epitome of 1990s chic sexuality.-Character actors like Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and Chris Tucker are given meaty--if utterly over-the-top--scenery-chewing roles.-Director Luc Besson somehow ropes all this nonsense together by allowing the chutzpah of the moment/era to override traditional plot elements and still construct an entertaining film.All told, I am quite confident that ""The Fifth Element"" will never make the sort of impression on me again that it did in '97. But at least I have that experience, and it is baseline entertaining/watchable if only for the 90s time capsule nature and the wild performances and set pieces.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Simply the best.. Tongue in cheek, action sci-fi made in the 90's.","Man I love this film. I was 12 when it came out at the cinema and I watched it with my Dad in Hammersmith. We both came out of there saying what a fun film it was and that is exactly what it was then. A fun film. However watching it again 15 years later, I realise it was a little bit more intricate than that. It's such an engaging, beautiful, quirky and strikingly shot sci-fi extravaganza and definitely chock full of humor and zany performances. Yet there is a deep chord struck when I saw this film again, at its core it tells a story of romance, humanity and courage. I defy audiences not to love this film - if only they could take the leap of faith to see it. Don't rely on that minority of scathing critics who panned this film - they are all pompous snobs who would rather watch art films in black and white. Yes the Fifth Element at times may have a few plot holes and hasn't perhaps the most complex of plots, but it makes up in character and style. Great acting from Willis, Oldman and Jovovich. The soundtrack is stunning, created by the brilliant Eric Serra, who worked on previous Besson films such as 'Leon' and 'Nikita'. All that's left for me to say is watch it and make up your own mind but I reckon u won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining Sci-Fi,"The Fifth Element is one of Luc Besson's earlier science fiction films, which is considered one of his better films in his filmography. While watching the film, we will notice Milla Jovovich in a very early role as a career starter. Within we realize that she is what the title of the film represents. Meaning, she is the fifth element, she's the sum total of our hope for survival, but she's way down the cast list and she can't get around town without Bruce Willis.The Fifth Element is an entertaining and visually stunning sci-fi piece but at times the film somewhat drags on. Not as high on the film as it has been praised, it is mindless fun. What makes the film great is the presence of Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, as well as the portrayal of Bruce Willis' character. There is chemistry there and it shows as the film progresses.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Luc Besson did it again 7/10,"""The Fifth Element"" is a fun, enjoyable and action packed movie. The first half of the movie feels like a really long exposition. Nothing much happens until the cruiser in space is being attacked. Only then you feel the story is moving. Bruce Willis nailes his performance by playing a badass character as he does always. Milla Jovovich is perfect and vital as leeloo. Gary Oldman portrays the villain once again, and does a fantastic work once again. Overall a fun ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Currently my worst movie-going experience ever.,"I saw this at the cinema when it first came out, but the memory is still fresh as the day I watched it. This is the first review I write, as a public service to those who may be thinking about seeing it. Unless you really like flashy sci-fi films regardless of content, then avoid. Like the plague. To its credit, Luc Besson has done a spectacular job with the effects and costume. At the start, at Bruce Willis' apartment, there were some good Blade Runner-ish moments, but they are really wasted on this film. Oh, and the ending is really tacky. The film lacks any kind of plot direction, half the time I was wondering what the whole point was. Ian Holm tries his best to do Cadfael, but doesn't really convince. Bruce Willis puts a good effort in too however this is not to be his finest hour. In the end I just found the storyline to be tacky and irritating. The costumes just got more and more bizarre (golden ducks and a blue lycra male diva anyone?). Luc Besson has done far better films (Nikita, Leon) and you should see these instead - he must have been on some weird trip to concoct this.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of the most overrated movies ever,"Well, THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a movie by Luc Besson. Only that is a big expectation. However, THE FIFTH ELEMENT has got the same problem as even more overrated THE MATRIX. It has got effects of all kind, but nothing more. From that, it's empty. I saw this movie at it's release and didn't like it. I've seen it again, and I still don't like it. I've also kind of ""imagined"" the effects away, and found a big hole.The acting is terrible. Except for Gary Oldman, who were hysteric and hilarious and Ian Holm, God he's great! Even though, I can't believe what he's doing in this trash. He's a quality-actor for God's sake! Well now. Bruce Willis was ok, but poor Milla what-ever-her-name-is was totaly awful.I believe Chris Rock, oh, I mean Chris Tucker (they are like twins) is in this movie. Seeing him, and thinking that it's really a movie by Luc Besson, who's got style, is sickening. This movie is plastic, folks! Not the usual Besson-style as in ""Nikita"", ""Leon"" and ""Le grand bleu"".Besson's worst. 6/10 (and a six is pretty poor for a movie like this)",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Nice visuals and aestestic aside (hello Jean Giraud!), this surely has aged badly","The plot not only doesn't make much sense to begin with but it's also a bit convoluted, chris tucker is funny but in the end he was completely unnecessary, and the philosophy behind the movie is pretty much laughable. Not only because of the focus on looooove that solves everything (I generally hate that deus-ex machina) but also because the aliens at the beginning of the movie take away Leelo to fight in a galactic war...and all of the sudden, while typing the word ""war"" on a computer, she realizes that war is wrong. Excuse me, my dear...I understand that 99% of the time you're completely passive in the hands of other people, BUT WHAT THE HELL YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING WHILE UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE MONDOSHAWAN?

Quirky sci-fi from Besson,"I think you've got to forget the story when attempting to appreciate the merits of The Fifth Element. Its narrative is really a load of nonsense. What makes this film interesting is its aesthetics. Luc Besson has always been a director famed for his stylish action films, and this one is no exception. The only major difference of course is that this is science-fiction, and it is unusual to see such a big-budget film of that genre coming out of Europe. Its French origins do show too, with its elegantly attired characters and slightly strange sense of humour. It isn't a film without faults though, as its story about love against evil isn't exactly a strong point.But in terms of imaginative design, The Fifth Element is definitely a success. The streets of the future metropolis are full of life and crazed visual ideas. Bright primary colours abound everywhere and the overall look is certainly very well-conceived. I wouldn't necessarily say that this extends to the characters, as none of them are especially memorable. Even Milla Jovovich in the central role of Leeloo isn't all that well utilized in my opinion. She only gets to flex her muscles on the rarest of occasions and is in the main just a victim to be protected. Bruce Willis is of course her saviour, with Gary Oldman pitching in with a strange accented villain. For me the best character was the alien opera singer, her scene where she sings an aria while Leeloo engages in a fight with the bad guys is definitely the highlight of the movie.The tone of the film is almost that of a comedy. This is not a film that is taking itself in the least bit seriously. This playfulness of approach may be perhaps a bit jarring to some and might take a bit of getting used to. I guess though because of this it's easier to ignore the deficiencies in the story-line department. The Fifth Element is a silly but beautifully presented science fiction action flick and is recommended for those who gravitate to the quirkier side of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I want to hurt this movie.,"""The Fifth Element"" is bad beyond all possible levels of badness.

"Funny, stylish, creative sci-fi for the 90's","What can I say about this film? Well, for starters, IT WAS GREAT! Of course, there were some plot holes and things that could've been left out the final cut, but it was just too good to let little things get out of the way. This movie still is a great topic of conversation between friends and myself.The special effects were something to look at. Dozens of flying cars zooming by in traffic hell, and when Willis dives through them it's just spectacular. It was the best mid-air car chase I'd ever seen, and the scene where Leeloo is reconstructed from just DNA was an excellent way to introduce a main character.And for the record, for all those people who think Chris Tucker's character (Ruby Rode) was gay, I want to say that he wasn't. I would guess that Besson was thinking of how so many things would change in 3 hundred years. Just think now. There were no computers in the 1800's. Hell, there wasn't even a telephone (I don't think, but if there was it wasn't touch-tone).The haircuts were weird. So were the clothes. So were the rooms inside the apartments. But this came from the mind of a 13 year-old French boy in boarding school and revised into a movie. Besson's got a good and creative imagination. And if he is really helming the Tomb Raider movie, I'm sure it'll just add to the list.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Big dumb movie -- so what?,"Yes, I recognize that this is a big, dumb movie, but I love it for what it is. Some of the things I love about it:1.

The fact that the 3-D car chase scene is accompanied by ""Alech Taadi"" by rai star Khaled -- I tripped out when I recognized the song! I just can't imagine that scene succeeding with any other music now.3. The huge, unexplained pile of garbage in the spaceport. This IS what the future will be like if we're not careful.4. That bizarre, buggy dance that the hopped-up mugger kid does after Korben Dallas takes his gun away for him for the umpteenth time. It's about five seconds of the movie that could have been cut perfectly easily, and other people probably think it would have been an improvement to do so, but for me it just adds to the glorious lunacy.5. The flying sampan-shaped noodle stand.6. The second alphabet in which everything is labeled. (You've just gotta be impressed with the detail of the art direction.)7.

A terrible movie anyway you look at it!,"'The Fifth Element' is one of a very small handful of movies that no matter how many times I try to watch all the way through uninterrupted, I never quite succeed. I treasure the surreal movies of Lynch, Jodorowsky and Jess Franco, and closer to home, will watch 'Zardoz' at the drop of a hat. I can usually handle incoherent plot-lines, over the top characters, and movies with style over substance, but I draw the line at this self-indulgent mess. Ever tried to read a book when drunk? That's how I feel whenever I try and watch 'The Fifth Element'. There's something about this movie that I just can't get into. It often seems like you're watching an unreleased sequel to 'Buckaroo Banzai'. Except without the fun and energy of that cult classic. I really don't know what Luc Besson was trying to achieve here, but whatever it was, unless it was to make a cinematic migraine, it didn't work. The only thing of note about this movie is its eccentric supporting cast (Tiny Lister as the President?!) of comedians, Brits, musicians, Luke Perry and b-grade King, the late, great Brion James.

Like a rainbow,"Probably, the rating of the movie is such low, because it is not a serious science fiction, otherwise, it is one of the most enjoyable and colorful science fiction movies ever made and if you ask me, humor in it is not uneven. By the way, Fifth Element is one of my all time favorite science fiction movies. However, it is clearly seen that almost many people don't appreciate it and some find it ridiculous. The science fiction movies that made after 2000 were mostly disappointing such as Mission to Mars, Red Planet, Sunshine etc. As for Pitch Black, it was good, but forgettable. What I am trying to say is that to make a successful science fiction movie is not that easy. The plot of the movie is not deep may be, but creative and not childish. There are a few scenes I love and watched hundreds of times, because never felt enough. The first one is the scene which Leeloo jumps over, the following part is extremely enjoyable. Willis's car is one of my favorite engines in movies and the blue ones also, the design of them is very appealing like some other designs. My second favorite is the song part, in my opinion legendary, the song was reposeful and the scene was inventive. The third one is the best action scene of the movie, the gunfight scene at the saloon of the ship. Lots of people hate the character Ruby Rhod, almost everyone who has seen the movie talks about him like he ruined the movie, I liked the movie except for Ruby Rhod etc. This is really sad. He was an extremely funny and amusing character and Chris Tucker does not look superficial and his best performance so far as well. Therefore, I LIKED him. By the way, the movie is sometimes called Die Hard in space, I agree. Some designs in the movie seem childish, kitsch or flimsy like the gun of Zorg, his 'toys' in his office, the head of Diva or the monsters, but it is great fun, does not ruin the movie somehow and also it is made consciously that's the point. As mentioned, some say what a fake movie! No it is not. In contrast, visual effects of the space ships and the planets are first class. By the way, the creatures are also interesting characters and so fun to watch. The afro American guy who changes his face was a so popular and unforgettable image, still it is, if you ask me. Milla Jovovich is really a talented actress and her best performance is in this movie like Chris Tucker. As many people haven't done, I haven't forgotten ''multi-pass''. The laboratory scene is brilliant, so is her performance and every time, I bother so that her waist will broke. The city in the movie is extremely dazzling, one of the most well created cities in cinema. This is a rare thing that in a movie, every actor makes one of their bests, some of them make their best, but completely different characters from each other. As for Gary Oldman, he is one of the actors who can play every kind of character. He is almost as funny as Rhod and very interesting, amusing character, especially his accent.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Awful. Jerry Lewis does outer space....,"This was an abysmal film.I'm glad I saw it in a second-run theater, where it cost me all of two dollars to barely hang through.This isn't s.f., it's not fantasy, the action is unconvincing, and it's not very funny. I can't object too much to Bruce Willis' effort in this film, even though I can not praise it either. But that god-forsaken Ruby Rhod character is beyond annoying. I actually might have been able to enjoy the camp design of this flick had that character been completely omitted. The childish sexual innuendo and flamboyant flaming homosexuality of Rhod was tiresome after the first five minutes.I was saddened to see Ian Holm in this film.

Overrated Oddity,"The Fifth Element has long been hailed as a cult classic, but I find its reputation somewhat overstated. While the film certainly stands out for its eccentricity and bold visual style, it doesn't always translate into a fully satisfying experience. The movie's quirky aesthetics and imaginative design are undeniably unique, featuring a colorful, futuristic world that's visually striking. The direction is full of inventive flair, and the costumes and set designs are undeniably memorable.However, the film's plot feels disappointingly familiar and lacks the depth that might have elevated it beyond its visual spectacle. The story, involving a quest to save the world from an impending evil, follows a well-worn narrative path without adding much originality or complexity. The plot twists are predictable, and the overarching narrative lacks the substance needed to keep the viewer fully engaged.Additionally, the film's eccentricities, while initially intriguing, can become overwhelming and somewhat grating. The blend of humor and high-energy action often feels uneven, with some elements of the film coming across as more bizarre than captivating. The characters, despite being played by a talented cast, don't always resonate as deeply as one might hope.

The Fifth Element,"I wonder how many taxi drivers get a fare they wish they's just driven past! Well I think poor ""Dallas"" (Bruce Willis) might have wished he had done that with the almost mannequin-esque ""Leeloo"" (Milla Jovovich) as he finds himself embroiled in a plot to conquer the planet. She speaks in syllables that wouldn't have been out of place in an edition of ""The Clangers"" but still manages to convey the sense of peril to mankind well enough for him to try to track down the priest ""Cornelius"" (Ian Holm) who might be able to locate some sacred stones that belong to the benign ""Fifth Element"" in time to save us from ""Mangalores"" and his evil henchman ""Mr. Zorg"" (Gary Oldman). Of course, we soon learn that ""Dallas"" is no ordinary, pie-eating, cabbie. He is a former special forces ninja who is no stranger to an Uzi 9mm or to some nimble fisticuffs. Luc Besson manages to integrate some engaging comedy threat into a decent sci-fi adventure that raises a smile. Willis offers his usual style of charismatic, slightly sarcastic, delivery and Oldman (well, more his hairdo, really) camps up nicely as the baddie in charge of an army of alien soldiers who couldn't hit a cow on the tit with a tin cup. There's loads of action pretty much from the start as somehow we just know that Bruce is going to come through for us.

You know something is a masterpiece if you still enjoy watching it 26 years later!,"This movie simplistically watched outside seems an enjoyable bit bizarre funny action and scifi film. But below its initial packaging, it is so much more... .1) It is (still despite all the cultural changes, cool, plus has many artistic flavors (costumes, music, the total look)2) beneath this packaging shows moral dilemmas of its main characters, self sacrifice, do the right thing (even the bad guys with the honor thing)3) its comedy contain moments that are really epic, compared to the stupid forced fun moments that we see in today movies (see the ""negotiation"" scene).4) It has so much both hidden as well as blatant critique on politics, society, humanity. Cheesy, yes, predictable, yes, others said the same thing multiple times yes, but this delivers it in a nice and funny and enjoyable way that remains with you so much after.This movie could be more serious, more scientific, more many other things, but preferred it to be delivered in a package with a perfect blend of fun (hilarious sometimes), fast pace, light hearted, beauty, styliing, together with heroism, ethical choices, moral messages to younger audicnce. Most today's movies do not offer all this in one package.Movies today tend to be only either action and FX packed, with lots of attempts to make a cold joke and driven and when they try to do a bit more, become very serious and do not attract audience that want to see a pop corn flick. This did it all.I think that the fact that 26 years have passed, was seen numerous times and still we enjoy seeing it says it all. It is not inception, it is not a non scifi serious masterpiece, but eg young teens would not like much the first and would have few moral lessons, while others that would have moral lessons would be too serious for them to watch. This does it all, and this is its art. After many movies (even some I consider great ones, greater than this) after a couple of years I don't remember even a scene or message, from this I remember various points, not to mention that Mila Jojovits as Lilou Gary Oldman (his one liners in this are extremely underrated) and Bruce Williis are at their best, while Jean Paul Gaultier delivered a masterclass with the costumes (especially of Lilou)And one irrelevant with the movie comment. In the past, many movies had a strong one liner moral lesson, which I feel that tends to vanish. From the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and similar ones, I feel that all such messages have vanished. Last time I have seen one was in Alita battle Angel (""I do not stand by in the presence of evil"" some years ago. Todays messages are more focused on specific social groups rather on society as a whole.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Positively one of the worst movie blunders of all time.,"First things first: the only reason I am writing this review is because of the overwhelming amount of high ratings given this film, and its 7.0 average star rating.  Given this information I have no choice but to assume the people seeing this film have never seen any science fiction, comedy, or in fact any movie of any weight at all ever in their life.  Lets address the issues:Plot: Abysmal The plot of this movie is something like what you wrote in 5th grade for the composition part of the day, complete with that cool gun you always wanted. I read a review describing it as too complicated; that's a bit like saying a lego is complicated... No, this movie's 'plot' is simple, derivative, juvenile and eventually unnecessary.  Whomever commented that it is a little better than Dark City, I urge you to go soak your head and maybe watch the 5th Element sober this time.Acting: Laughable Bruce Willis plays himself.  Beautiful Milla Jovovich speaks gibberish...how hard is that? Gary Oldman terribly directed, it looks like it physically pains him to say each line with that ridiculous accent. Chris Tucker is obnoxious and unnecessary.  Everyone else is as well, I suppose.Special effects/style: They blew it If I were to give this movie any credit, it would be in this category--there was a monumental effort to get me to like this film by the director, costumer, cinematographer, etc etc, but none of them could do their job well.  I was sad to see this movie so badly directed after seeing Leon (The Professional in the USA), which is on my top 10.  The costumes were not over the top, they were ridiculous, we'll leave it at that.  Everything in the movie was exaggerated to the point of absurdity.  Now I'm a fan of action, SF, comedy, and everything this film tries to be, and I can't think of one film that has done ANYTHING as badly as any given part of this movie.  The special effects were a mixed bag--the city was decent, but not visionary as some of you have put it, just fun for a moment, which was soon lost.  In the first scene, I actually thought the animatronic alien things were a joke until they turned out to be an 'important' part of the movie's 'plot.' When this was made clear to me I nearly died laughing.  For those of you who haven't seen it, you'll know what I mean when you do.  There's no real style to the cinematography, directing, or editing; it was all done on the fly, I think, resulting in some shabby and excessive shots.Overall: just too bad to even consider I realize that some of you will say this movie doesn't take itself seriously, but I disagree; no 16-year old kid writes something like this to be a self-parody, not even Luc Besson.  Some will say it's just mindless fun.  Mindless yes, fun.....well, the gags weren't funny, the action was melodramatic, hideously overdone, and gimmicky all over.  That cool gun? It plays no part in the movie at all, and it takes up about 5 min of screen time.  Same for Christ Tucker's character.Bottom line: If the producers of this movie intended it to be this bad, I sincerely applaud them, because they succeeded marvelously in creating such an abominally bad piece of cinema (even popcorn cinema) that I actually thought it was made to be a serious hollywood movie.  The ONLY reasons to rent this are 1:an overdone version of the do's and don'ts of movies, minus the don'ts.  see it if you want to make movies--this isn't what you want to do. And 2:Milla Jovovich does the only good job at anything in this movie, being beautiful...and she doesn't even have to try.  Thus concludes the panning.And for all of you who sincerely enjoyed this movie..... never mind.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"THE FIFTH ELEMENT (Luc Besson, 1997) **1/2","While I had missed out on this on initial release and various TV airings over the years, it now ended up being my second BluRay viewing! It was Bruce Willis' second of 3 sci-fi epics made in the space of as many years – the others being the superior TWELVE MONKEYS (1995) and the even lesser Armageddon (1998). Luc Besson often dabbled in fantasy and, though re-united with Gary Oldman from LEON (1994), this proved the French director's first real brush with Hollywood.The film is redolent of two earlier genre landmarks, namely STAR WARS (1977; in its plethora of monstrous characters) and BLADE RUNNER (1982; the 'chaotic' look); plot-wise, it owes a bit to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981) given the danger-fraught odyssey relating to an archaeological find. Casting, too, channels famous (musical/film) personalities with Oldman's campy villain evoking David Bowie, while Chris Tucker's outrageous but irrelevant TV show host brings to mind Prince!; in a similar key, actors from earlier classic sci-fi titles have been recruited: Ian Holm from ALIEN (1979), Brion James from BLADE RUNNER itself and John Neville who, though best-known for THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN (1989), was also the lead of the low-budgeted but superb UNEARTHLY STRANGER (1963).As expected, the film looks great (showcasing imaginative production/costume design and special effects) and, while the central theme is interesting (if hardly original), the ending is a disappointment: Oldman is dispatched before the climax and by his own volatile 'thugs' to boot, whereas a super alien promising a showdown with the Forces of Good is conveniently dealt with by the ray of light unleashed when the mythic five elements come together in Egypt (some form of direct confrontation would not have been amiss at this point)! Incidentally, the ruse of forcing Willis (here sporting blond hair) to admit his love for heroine Milla Jovovich obviously rips-off the finale of Howard Hawks' RIO BRAVO (1959) – just as the couple's lovemaking being interrupted by suddenly adulating authority figures smacks of the James Bond movies! By the way, Besson would probably be deemed a visionary now, not so much for his futuristic films, but for daring to make the American President a black man (though DEEP IMPACT {1998} soon after employed the very same device)!The film, then, is action-packed, thus reasonably entertaining, but it also contains a number of flaws – mainly Tucker's embarrassing and overbearing character and the supreme silliness of having an alien for a singing operatic diva (actually, the whole over-the-top section on the flying cruise-liner was a mistake)! On the other hand, Jovovich and Oldman (helped in no small measure by their respectively sparse and gaudy attire) are a delight throughout and the main reason for watching this...",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Star Wars + Indiana Jones + Austin Powers = Fifth Element,"S K E T C H Y  and  O V E R THE  H E A DThis movie seems to be more of an experiment than a great movie.  And perhaps that is what makes it unique and worth watching. Picture the hybrid of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and (double-YUCK) Austin powers.  Think about it.  Intrigued?An ordinary guy with an extraordinary past meets up with the perfect girl and a priest of an ancient order, to defeat the essence of darkness intangible, set on a collision course for their world to destroy all life. All the characters in this movie fill in a niche resulting in defeating evil.  Like life, the individuals do not work together, but in the end everything works out (or does it) in a way in which one would wonder could it have been done any other way.  It seems that fate directs humanity (it's evils, lusts, carnage, greed, anger, and most of all innocence) too defeat evil as a whole, even though most are not working towards that goal, and even oblivious to the ramifications.The problem with this movie is that the producers tried to cram in too many elements; comedy, action, love, thought provoking concepts, wacky spin, and Wild West type hero...  Instead of being a top 10 movie with just a few elements, what resulted was a C movie in a class all it's own.  Although, after watching it two nights in a row, I admit I am disappointed in how it turned out.  It could have been in league with 12 Monkeys, yet it is worth watching despite it's bane just to try to understand the effort at genius.Simple plot, carried out with taste, remarkably enter twined from different angles.  Although it falls short of the mark, respect the effort at genius. Watch this movie of simple entertainment, good special effects, and a coy attitude between the lines that makes me think...

Personally I loved the fact that the extras did a great job level with big names like Bruce Willis & Garry Oldman.My only complaint which to be fair is a legally big one is the movie's absurd editing and lack of a genuine soundtrack, which despite all its positive features blew away the entire project and failed to shed light on and draw attention to its foremost important scenes to tag along the viewer.Could have been a 9/10 but..",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

We meet a high-energy entertainer (Chris Tucker) who gives a funny (and prescient) glimpse into the future, but the character is carried along too far into the battle scenes, where he becomes a little like Jar Jar Binks. Meanwhile, the savior for humanity, the fifth element character, goes from assuring the taxi driver that she will protect him to needing to be saved by him, and really not doing much of anything other than being placed like an object in the ancient formation.

An enjoyably bizarre movie experience,"Luc Besson's follow-up to his 1994 masterpiece Léon is as camp as a British cross-dresser and features one of the least convincing of Gary Oldman's more or less overacted 1990s maniacs, but still manages to turn out as an enjoyably bizarre movie experience, largely thanks to striking and often creative visuals, a free-spirited tone, and delightful avant-garde music by Eric Serra. Besson purportedly wrote the script while in his teens, which helps explain the larger-than-life, starwarsish characters and factions populating this dystopian power struggle, but the 38-year-old director also manages to create some moments of true inspiration, such as the brilliant opera house scene, or the creation of the Leeloo character (played with outlandish innovation by Milla Jovovich), whose magical appearance out of an incubator is just about as touching and incredible as those little people who usually appear before us in incubators.

"Aside from Chris Tucker, I loved this film!","Okay, I must first point out that Chris Tucker in this film was like a walking and talking migraine. I know to some extent that is EXACTLY what the producers and director wanted, but he was so whiny and nasal I wanted to see him hit by a laser! That's out of my system, so I can go on with my review. This is perhaps the strangest sci-fi movie to come out of Hollywood and starring a first-tier American actor (though the director is French). I might have expected something this strange and risky to come from an independent producer, but for the ""big boys"" to finance such an odd film is quite ""odd"" in itself.Aside from Bruce Willis, whose character seems like just a guy taken out of the 20th century, all other actors in the film seemed strange and other-worldly. This was true for the female lead, Milla Jovovich, who looks a lot like an 80s punk rocker but who speaks a strange foreign language no one other than Willis can understand. But, this strangeness was even more apparent by all the odd creatures that inhabit the film--ranging from a blue-skinned woman with a very odd-shaped head who sings in a sort of alien operatic style to Gary Oldman's thugs who look a lot like,....nothing I have even dreamed of before! The worlds, too, are very very strange and look nothing like the Star Trek or Star Wars worlds--having their own unique look and charm that shows that the film must have cost a ton to make and had a strong commitment by the studio for its completion as the writers had envisioned it.The plot is too difficult to adequately describe in the space I have here. In fact, it would probably be best to just leave that all up to you. Watch it if you are a lover of sci-fi or you are willing to see something VERY unconventional.

Fine, the production design is eye-catching, but at it's best, it's merely a rip-off of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"". At it's worst, it looks like Bob Fosse tried to direct a musical version of ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"". Luc Besson could not direct a five year-old to the bathroom.

Gorgeous visuals but annoying story and a certain character.,"The film looks amazing and the visuals are fantastic but I couldn't wait for the film to get over. Plus someone needs to tell Chris Tucker to get off my screen as he is incredibly annoying. The Fifth Element uses one of the newest tricks in the science fiction motion picture handbook: perform a visual and aural assault on viewers in the vain hope that they won't notice the lack of substance, logic, and intelligence. For a few recent examples of where this tactic has been employed, check out Stargate and Independence Day. The Fifth Element, the summer of 1997's first big-budget disappointment, is right at home in such company. A lot of money was spent on this film, but $100 million doesn't guarantee a good product. Maybe someone should have thought of spending a few more dollars on a better script. Once The Fifth Element's assault on the senses starts to wear off, it's easy to become restless.

And truth be told, this is a movie that you can watch again and again.Writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, with the former also directing the movie, put together a rather unique, enjoyable and memorable script and storyline. Yeah, ""Le Cinquième Élément"" is one of those movies that helped define the late 1990s in cinema history.The acting performances in the movie are great, but of course they would be with the likes of Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker, Luke Perry, Brion James, Tom Lister Jr., Lee Evans, John Neville and others. I have always been enjoying the performance of Gary Oldman in this movie, because it is simply just phenomenal, and he totally steals the scenes that he is in.There are lots and lots of impressive visuals throughout the course of the movie, which makes it well-worth sitting through a second time. The first time watch the movie for the storyline, and the second time to take in all the visual and details you might have missed the first time.The special effects in the movie are great and still hold up today in 2024. So thumbs up to the effects team for that accomplishment. And the wardrobe department definitely also deserve praise for their accomplishment with this movie.There is a good amount of action in the movie, which definitely helped spruce up the already good storyline. And the action is nicely executed on the screen.If you haven't already seen ""Le Cinquième Élément"" from director Luc Besson, then you most definitely have to do so, should you get the chance.My rating of ""Le Cinquième Élément"" lands on a well-deserved and solid seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"That's no moon, that's the ultimate evil","Every five thousand years, the ultimate evil comes to Earth to destroy all life. There is no reason for this, nor for the amount of time that passes between visits. The only thing capable of stopping the ultimate evil is the supreme being, or fifth element. This, along with four stones that activate the fifth element into being the ultimate weapon are protected by a friendly alien race. The time has come and it is up to former military specialist Korben Dallas to help get Leeloo, the fifthe element, to a resort to regain the stones, and then back to Earth to defeat the ultimate evil. Of course there is the greedy human known as Zorg, that aligns himself with the ultimate evil in hopes of monetary gain.

Easily one of  Bruce Willis best action sci-fi fllm of all time!,"The Fifth Element (1997) is one of the best sci-fi movies in my mind! This movie never gets old to watch no matter how many times I see it. In my opinion it is Bruce Willis best sci-fi action flick. I always loved this sci-fi action packed flick and I always will. I watch it more than 20.times in the row. This movie is amazing. I realized this year I think that the protagonist and antagonist never meet, and I think that's awesome. This movie has too many awesome aspects to list, and it's one of those movies where I get sad when the end credits come on. And it makes me angry that a movie so awesome doesn't get talked about. I got to look up the screenwriter and see what else they have done because movies this awesome are rare. I just love the look (cinematography), the cast, the special effects, the acting, the costumes (Jean-Paul Gaultier...just excellent stuff), the humor, the score. I remember that everybody in the movie theatre was completely silent when the blue alien was singing:)The Fifth Element will always be my favorite Sci-Fi movie, I will always enjoy this movie, it is gun and Entertaining. Movies like this one they aren't today anymore. I also love the film. It's a lot of fun. Love the cast, effects and music. It is a dam good movie. It has very well-made CGI effects that looks so breathtaking, great story, good characters especially Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. The use of miniatures, and prosthetics, then the added layer of CGI is what creates a more believable image. This movie was shot more than 18 years ago and still looks good and better than the films coming out today!A surprisingly awesome action scenes, funny dialogue, everything! I was amazed how this film was gonna turn out back then, considering the comparison with ""Star Wars"". Luc Besson also gave us such classics as The Professional. Fifth Element sees Bruce Willis as the reluctant hero who is thrust into protecting Milla Jovovich who happens to be such the 5th element before the evil Zorg played by Gary Oldman finds her for his own master purposes. Filled with stunning visual effects and some good old fashioned adventure this one is still as fun to watch now as it was back in '97. Luc Besson really stood out from the trend. It has to be said that back in 1997 it was all about the Fifth Element, an amazing French blockbuster which people eventually got tired of... Strangely enough, it was coldly received in the US. It's so different in many ways, the visual aspect is brilliant, the cast is great (featuring bigwigs Maïwenn and Mathieu Kassovitz as the robber) and too few Sci-Fi movies can claim to be funny and entertaining.The Things I have enjoyed was a wonderful humor, great special effects and memorable characters who create a brilliant tongue in cheek a Sci- Fi flick! That you will find worth watching the fifth time as much as the first. I love about everything that is in this film./: Before Milla Jovovich became Alice in Resident Evil Series she was Leeloo The Fifth Element. The action is very gore I am surprised that this movie was rated PG-13. Gary Oldman as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg did an outstanding acting performance in the movie I have ever seen. Gary Oldman also played in The Professional (1994) action thriller flick with Jean Reno. Timeless: Good versus Evil, with a little romance and ass-kicking thrown in for good measure! Set design and costumes are awesome, the characters are priceless (Chris Tucker!), this movie is just a lot of fun to watch! Sadly Luc Besson does not make any good movies today like is this one The Fifth Element.New York cab driver Korben Dallas didn't mean to be a hero, but he just picked up the kind of fare that only comes along every five thousand years: A perfect beauty, a perfect being, a perfect weapon. Now, together, they must save the world. Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman star in acclaimed director Luc Besson's outrageous sci-fi adventure, an extravagantly styled tale of good against evil set in an unbelievable twenty-third century world. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.The Fifth Element (French: Le Cinquième Élément) is a 1997 English-language French science fiction action film directed and co-written by Luc Besson.

Milla Jovovich: Savior Of The Universe...,"With the world under threat of annihilation by Ultimate Evil, an ancient prophecy is realized in Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), who must fulfill her destiny.THE FIFTH ELEMENT is the perfect sci-fi, action, adventure movie. It features a futuristic civilization rivaling / surpassing that found in most films of its type. It also boasts a cornucopia of interesting and bizarre characters, creatures, and futuristic fashions.Bruce Willis, in one of his best roles ever, is cab driver Korben Dallas, who is enlisted by fate to assist Leeloo on her mission. They're up against the odious tycoon J. B. E. Zorg (Gary Oldman), who has made a deal with the Evil to usher in global destruction in exchange for incredible wealth.With this movie, Director Luc Besson takes a very basic ""good vs. Evil"" story and blasts it into the stratosphere, resulting in a classic tale of mind-boggling entertainment. Everyone is great, including Chris Tucker as the hilariously annoying personage known as Ruby Rhod!As for Ms. Jovovich herself, she embodies the titular character so well it's scary! Her innocence is matched only by her ability to defend herself when necessary.BEST BITS AND BOBS: #1- The flying car traffic! #2- the multi-layered / multi-leveled city! #3- The cruise ship! #4- The Mangalores! #5- The astonishing weapons! #6- Leeloo's resurrection! #7- The Diva!This is a stellar achievement on this or any other planet...",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't ask Besson for a moral lesson...,"...he'll give it to you and waste 90 million bucks doing it.It was a highly anticipated, over-hyped blockbuster from Luc Besson of ""Nikita"" and ""Leon"" fame, featuring Bruce Willis still sitting on laurels from his performance in wonderful ""12 Monkeys"" just a year before. What I was expecting was nothing short of a miracle in film- making, thinking how European cinematography can only outdo Hollywood once it lays its hands on similarly high budget.Yes, my expectations were pretty much slaughtered once the film started rolling. What I got in for was a mere charade of clichés, goofy acting and unwanted moral lessons garnished with the music of the hour. Nothing in it had any meaning or weight to it. I tried to watch it as a silly comedy but nothing really did it for me back then (and the guy laughing hysterically in the seat behind me certainly didn't help). Then I expected at least some point to all that and indeed it was laid heavy handedly upon the audience in the end when, out of the blue, the movie detoured into dead serious. Of course, by that point, I gave up and made sure not to take anything in it seriously. Goes especially for Besson's teenage naiveté in making his case against war and human nature (one has to wonder about him - the man was closing 40 at the time). I was probably just as naive as him expecting something else.Nowadays, however, I try not to miss ""The 5th element"" whenever they air it on TV. Once you go past the pretentious BS you can find in it precious gems that redeem the movie. One of those is certainly Chris Tucker and his outlandish performance (the only thing I could acknowledge as quality even back then). Too bad his character was conceived as a strictly sidekick - there were opportunities for him to develop into a really meaningful protagonist. Many of supporting characters and lines are also funny (although majority still isn't - I classify it under ""the French humor""). The cinematography and art design are lovely in their colorfulness and, in retrospect, it's a treat to watch Bruce Willis from the era while he still had some hair to his head.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dystopian Futures make's really excellent movies..,"This movie was superb in a sense of credibility of the human interactions in this movie, related what you can do or not do in modern society, the work involving the Police, the driving of the futurist cars, or simply the design of mega cities.

"""The Fifth Element"" - Earth, Fire, Water, Wind, and FUN!","In ""The Fifth Element,"" we learn that every 5000 years evil returns from the deepest reaches of outer space to try to wipe out all life in the universe. Only the Four Classic Greek Elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind) plus a ""fifth"" element - the ""supreme being"" - can ward off this evil presence.And so begins ""The Fifth Element,"" French filmmaker Luc Besson's (""La Femme Nikita,"" ""The Professional"") lavish nod to the sci-fi genre. I contend that not a whole lot of science fiction is high on intelligence, but Besson's film is not only high on intelligence, but imagination. With plenty of beautiful special effects, sights, sounds, story, perfectly chosen actors and Eric Serra's fitting score, ""The Fifth Element"" is pure sci-fi fun at the movies, the likes of which haven't been seen in a long time.""The Fifth Element"" is simply an extravagant tale of good vs. evil in the realm of the science fiction genre. Besson began work on the screenplay while in high school, and the self-contained universe he creates is brought to life here flawlessly. Most filmmakers when trying to bring an outrageous fantasy to life on the screen tend to get lost in the fantasy, short-changing actors and story for special effects. For the most part, the actors chosen - Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and others - are alive & kicking, and not cardboard cut-outs. I'm not saying that they're contenders for the Oscars, but you get my assertion that they are far better (and smarter) than most of the characters you typically find in most science fiction adventure fantasies, and are not stock or background to special effects and pulse-pounding action sequences.As I stated earlier, in New York City 300 years into the future (the 23rd century, I believe), evil - a great, big fireball named (named!) ""Mr. Shadow"" - is on its way to wipe out all life in the universe. So it's up to his Earthbound lackey Zorg (Oldman, over-the-top, as usual) and his alien-warrior minions to track down and obtain four stones representing the elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind). But before that happens, we learn that cab driver Korben Dallas (Willis) has obtained the fare of a lifetime - the perfectly beautiful and perfectly dangerous redhead Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) - who literally crash-lands in the back of his cab after she was first regenerated from a scratch of alien DNA in a laboratory. It's love at first sight, but their relationship troubles are hampered by the fact that she's wanted by the police after escaping from said lab and the fact that she speaks an unknown extraterrestrial language.After eluding the cops, Dallas, a former soldier-of-fortune, takes Leeloo to Priest Cornelius (Holm), who realizes exactly who (and what) Leeloo is and what her role in saving the world is - she's the supreme being, the fifth element. So now Korben, under the guise of winning a contest to the outer-world Phloston Paradise, along with Cornelius and Leeloo, sets out to - what else is there to do? - save the world, with Zorg and his minions in hot pursuit.""The Fifth Element,"" considering its production and the outrageousness of the story, should not be as good as it is. This is a beautiful-looking picture, eschewing the usual post-apocalyptic gloominess that's associated with futuristic science fiction movies for a marvelously shiny (and remarkably clean!) future-world New York. But Besson is a great storyteller, and knows what he wants on his picture. His script (co-authored with Robert Mark Kamen) is intelligently and expertly written, with strong, believable characters and perfectly composed dialogue that doesn't lose itself in meaningless diatribe and ludicrous explanations of trying to figure out what's going on. And it also contains enough action, humor (provided mostly in the second half by comedian Chris Tucker as flamboyant radio personality Ruby Rhod), intelligence, a performance by a blue-skinned alien opera singer named Diva Plavalaguna, and romance (yes, romance, and you thought it was just another brainless sci-fi picture) to ensure that it remains accessible even to those who don't care much for this science fiction/fantasy stuff.The film flies through its plot, arriving at a climax that is action-packed and shows off the same European action-chic that made Besson a household name with his earlier ""Nikita"" and ""Professional."" In these action sequences on-board the Phloston Paradise cruise ship, there are explosions, gunfights with alien beasts, martial arts, and a special effects finale that has to be seen to be believed, but at the same time may be a little bit of a disappointment for those expecting a bigger payoff. And while the humor can draw in those uninterested in this sci-fi/fantasy stuff, it can at times be a little silly and inappropriate and take away from the adventure.""The Fifth Element"" is certainly one of the best and most imaginative pieces of original science fiction fanfare produced in a long time. That a sharp director such as Luc Besson was able to get behind the camera of his own little world and not lose himself in it shows that he's a capable filmmaker who's perfectly in control of his film-making elements.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A film that after 8 years, still doesn't get boring for me.","I remember seeing The fifth Element around a friends house December 1997. I had heard of the film and wanted to watch it at the cinema, but being 12, I was always poor, but fortunately, my friend had borrowed it from an uncle, and both being sci-fi geeks, decided to watch it.. I was absolutely blown away by the overall presentation of the film, and fell in love with it immediately. It focuses on the stereotypical sci-fi action thriller, where an evil from outer space is set to destroy the universe, and the hero(s) have to stop it. There is definitely a cult status around this film, and it still doesn't get boring for me. There are several of my favourite actors in this film, especially a very diverse villain played by Gary Oldman, an absolutely stunning heroine who in my view, started the revolution of the female hero, rather than the 'damsel in distress' that we have seen for many years, played by Milla Jovovich. and a really anti-hero like hero played by Bruce Willis. Luc Besson has directed several of my favourite films, and seeing an interview that he had during the release of the film, it seems that he had been working on the main storyline as a child. I'm glad to see that somebody could come up with one of their own ideas for a film in Hollywood, rather than releasing a very poor re-vamp of an old classic, as we have come to see nowadays. I love the effects that were used in the film, regardless of whether people say they are dated, and there is one of the best movie-score soundtracks to this film.

Movies are pretty cool sometimes.,"Chris Tucker's performance as the radio host Ruby Rhod is a lot for the mind to deal with. His manner of speech, appearance, mannerisms, and personality add up to a great deal of mental stimulation. The signal coming off of Ruby Rhod is so high it may be subject to the conceptual equivalent of audio clipping. One might think about a normal person, ""Oh, there they are. I know who that is. I know what they are saying to me. I know why they are moving their body in that fashion."" With Ruby Rhod, one thinks, ""Ahhh! Oh my God, what is that? Turn it off! Is that a person? What's going on? Someone stop that!""It is also strange that a radio personality plays such a big part in the plot. If you or I were to make a movie about people in the future meeting aliens and saving the world and so forth we might not think to include a hilarious shrieking gay stereotype.With Gary Oldman's performance as Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg, similar problems occur, though constrained to his accent and the manner in which Jean-Paul Gaultier has dressed him. Some English people, like Mr. Oldman, have an unsophisticated understanding of the English language as it is spoken by Americans.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A beautiful mess,"The Fifth Element is a very creative and colorful movie with lots of in-your-face humor, flashy special effects and goofy, outrageous performances. It is a real sci-fi ride to enjoy, but perhaps not for everyone. When I first saw it, I made a point to check out all Luc Besson movies in the future because his unique style really impressed me. Unfortunately, it appears that The Fifth Element was not very representative of his directing style at all and more of a ""one time thing"".I'm having trouble recalling the plot of the movie as well as the manner in which it unfolded because The Fifth Element is a beautiful mess of people, aliens and events. It's set in the future. It's something about Bruce Willis (very John McClane-like) as a jaded cab driver and Milla Jovovich as the ultimate element of good versus invading alien forces of evil threatening to destroy the earth. That is one absurd plot outline, but it works well in the film and it is miles more complex if you want it to be. The reason it is so ""out there"" is because Luc Besson devised it as a teenager. If that doesn't promise an awesome movie, nothing does.Ian Holm, Gary Oldman (with a brand-new accent fit for the part, of course), Luke Perry and Chris Tucker all have parts in this film and both Holm and Oldman are excellent as ever. Many people found Tucker's over-the-top performance as an effeminate gay radio personality unbearably annoying, and I see where they are coming from. What I love about Milla Jovovich is that she doesn't seem to care what people think about her, but continues to take on ridiculous roles in even more ridiculous films (Ultraviolent, Resident Evil). In The Fifth Element, she certainly plays a colourful character but she does it very well because it calls for over-acting.To summarize, The Fifth Element is mostly goofy and fun. But sometimesin the midst of all actionit actually manages to be very touching and beautiful. The sci-fi elements are extremely well-handled by Luc Besson and unusually imaginative for its genre. I highly recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The aliens in the film (The Mondoshawans, Mangalores and Diva Plavalaguna) are brilliantly realised and the action scenes such as the flying car chase and the all-out gun battle in the space hotel are staged brilliantly.I will never get tired of this movie.

One of the Coolest Sci-fi films Ever Made,"This movie is a fun and pleasant ride! Sure, the plot is not too complex, there's an evil thing that wants to destroy the world and we have heroes to stop it, but there is a lot this movie offers that I feel many miss out on. The world of this film is so vibrant and alive thanks to the performances, set design, soundtrack, and the director's french expressionist touch, which oddly came across more like a live-action anime. I guess I haven't seen enough French cinema. Bruce Willis plays your typical reluctant protagonist and it fits him well. Milla Jovivich plays Leeloo, an alien tasked with protecting the world, who can kick a** when she needs too, but is not invincible. Milla does a great job with the character and gives her so much life, creating many memorable moments. Gary Oldman is also entertaining as the industrialist, Zorg, who has his own part to play in the story. Supporting cast all around does a decent job, although, Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod may be bit too much for some people. All in all, this is a great movie that is highly rewatchable and one that shouldn't be slept on. Final verdict: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fifty elements of greatness that the film's campiness never conceal, in fact, it justifies them...","2257: the future of humanity is in jeopardy: powerful evil forces are menacing the overpopulated planet, only a congregation of priests anticipated that (gruesome) eventuality since 1914 when aliens took away stones representing the four elements. Where else than an Egyptian temple would a legitimate fantasy/sci-fi epic start? Only a fifth element in the form of a supreme being would liberate the stones' power to save humanity.Now, give that premise to Ridley Scott or Denis Villeneuve and they'd turn it into a grand and bicolor voyage into the hearts of interstellar darkness... with mystical undertones. But Luc Besson decided to make the whole thing totally bonkers. Indeed, when the aliens meet the Egyptologist (John Bluthal), his question is ""are you Germans?"" the tone is set. Poor man hasn't time to see the light (not from Aziz anyway), he is put into eternal sleep, his assistant (Luke Perry) can't oppose any effective resistance either. A three-century leap and a quick battle between the cosmic enemy and the Federation army later, the one survivor is technologically revived: it's a young androgynous woman with orange hair.All indicate that she is the fifth element. She has super fighting skills and manages to escape and fall in the taxicab belonging to Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). What else, do we have? A President (Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister Jr.) talking like Marcellus Wallace on valium, an over-the-top and sassy deejay, a blue Opera-singing creature ... ""The Fifth Element"" contains at least fifty elements of awesomeness with the set-design and practical effects of a legitimate sci-fi film, making it a unique and epic space opera... with rock'n'roll. It is weird, funny, but never nonsensical.It was Luc Besson's baby, and yes, only a mind high on excessive imagination could conceive such a crazy story, but after a dreadfully slow 'serious' Golden palm winner, I was craving for that. I had fun following ""The Fifth Element"" and all the campiness of the world can't conceal its greatness, in fact it justifies it. Sci-fi has become the canvas for so many dark and gloomy films that I'm glad Besson put colors in them, made it fast-paced, spectacular and entertaining, almost dwarfing the 'classics'. Ian Holm as the priest and his cowardly assistant (Charlie Creed-Miles). Milla Jovovich as the lovely Lee-Loo, every character is fun and strangely endearing.In a French TV show, Yann Moix paid tribute to Jean-Claude Van Damme saying that ""B-movie is an art"". There is no proud cinephile who can't indulge to these little guilty pleasures, and just because the product is junk doesn't mean the package isn't worth the attention. And of course Luc Besson, one of the 'bad boys' of 'cinema du look', along with Beinex or Carax, was among those who put the final nail of the Nouvelle Vague when it was agonizing in its own pretentiousness. A 'Star Wars' alumni milked with American blockbusters and figuring some day ""why can't France do that?"". Besson crystallized the intelligentsia anger, accusing him of making Hollywood ersatz. Besson hated artsy films and figured there was more merit to make big-budgeted spectacles than two hours of people talking in the kitchen. Was he wrong?But if Besson made commercial films, he never considered the seriousness of a subject as antidotes against action or fun. His style was vibrant, exuberant at times but there was a heart at the right place. Still, ""Fifth Element"" is the result of a totally different mindset, this is a film he claimed to have designed in his teens, he had the vision but as an insecure French boy, he would have felt lucky to make it beyond comic-level. In a way, the film is a comic-strip, each vignette has a purpose, a background event, a capability to surprise you with what comes after. The bad guy finds his box empty, cut to the heroine laughing. The timing is awkward but we get the point: she's explaining why it is and so we're never one step ahead of the characters. Or just take the entrance of Ruby Rhodes (Christ Tucker), by the time you wonder 'what the hell is that?', he's already in in the adventure.Each scene is like Besson tapping your shoulder and telling you, wait you haven't seen anything yet. It's a continuous treat to the eyes, a sort of ""Blade Runner"" made out of ecstasy where you can tell everyone has fun doing it, from director to the actor to even Gary Oldman who said he didn't want to do the film but accepted because financed his ""Nil by Mouth"". As Zorg (a name so cliché it's meta-hilarious) Oldman delivers one of these performances so ludicrous that it takes a certain genius to never make them badly laughable. As Dallas, Bruce Willis is perfect as the straight guy to the whole comedy, not exactly a loner with a secret past, when LeeLoo falls on his car, he's obviously smitten by her and when he hears that hypnotic voice from the Opera singer (Maïwenn), his expression contains his best silent acting.The scope if epic, stakes are high and Besson just pushes the envelope to the max, keeping many great momentums in the film, opera intercut with fighting against the Mangalores (extra-terrestrial bounty hunters with limited cognitive abilities who could have belonged to a Star-Trek film), a climax reminding of Captain Planet, Besson finds an element of unpredictability in predictable situation and even something as mundane as boarding in an airport had me repeating ""Multipass"". Multipass, I like that word, it fits the film, it's an extended MTV Video clip but with a delightful self-awareness, breathtaking visuals, spectacular effects... and a good story.In a way, it encapsulates the best that cinema can offer you, and this is why I dedicated it my IMDb 2000th review.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unrelentingly Terrible,"The only proper analogy I can think of for the experience of watching ""The Fifth Element"" is of being locked into a small room with several very good-looking but mind-bendingly stupid people who are screaming at the top of their lungs at each other.  For two hours straight.Make no mistake: ""T5E"" is very pretty, and VERY stupid.  The post-release publicity for the film made a great deal of hay out of the fact that the film's story, by director Luc Besson, was one that he had dreamed up when he was a 14-year-old boy.  Unfortunately, that appears to have been literally true, and Besson apparently did not feel the need to edit or update the plot or dialogue in the intervening decades.  Once you strip away the (admittedly stunning) visual effects and set design, you are left with the sort of script that you can very easily imagine a 7th-grader writing after seeing ""Star Wars"" for the first time.Virtually no sci fi movie cliche is left untouched, and it's all presented with Deep Earnest Seriousness.  There's the grizzled, Han Solo-esque hero (Bruce Willis, faxing in his performance from whatever island vacation this paycheck bought him), check.   There's the Beautiful Alien Princess (Milla Jovavich, trying hard but failing to distract from her near-nudity with strenuous overacting), check.  There's the Obi-Wan-esque doddering mentor (Ian Holm, looking properly embarrassed about the whole thing), check. There's the Goofy Black Sidekick (Chris Tucker, channelling Liberace, Superfly and Stepin Fetchit simultaneously, an achievement that's jawdropping for all of the wrong reasons), check.  Maniacal villian?  Sure, Besson has Gary Oldman's number on his speed-dial for that part, check. Unstoppable alien menace?  Check.  Love conquers all in the end?  Stop, that was a rhetorical question.  (But the film insists on answering it.)Apologists for this film insist that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously, which would be to mistake narrative laziness for intentional satire even if it didn't reek of post-debacle spin.  It's quite possible to tell a feather-light and even silly story without insulting your audience at every turn, a task accomplished by films as diverse as ""Babe"",  ""There's Something About Mary"", and even ""Star Wars"", which T5E apes shamelessly without ever displaying any awareness about why it worked as a film.Just about the only redeeming factors in The Fifth Element are the stunning visual effects by Digital Domain, and the gleefully outre costume design by Jean-Paul Gaultier.  But they in no way make up for the cringeworthy dialogue, the terrible acting, the overbearing soundtrack and the stunningly contrived plot.  About the only way to derive any real enjoyment out of this film is to turn the volume down to zero, and at that point why bother?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The fifth element - Science fiction à la française,"Luc Besson wrote the story of what would become ""The fifth element"" when he was sixteen years old. This teenage enthusiasm is evident in every aspect of the film, from its glamorous visuals, to its comedy with its often preposterous character. Although the film is in English, it is French from head to toe. ""The fifth element"" is, simply, science fiction à la française.Every five thousand years, evil threatens the universe. The only way to stop it is though five elements: the classic four known to anyone who has watched ""Avatar:The Last Airbender"" (by this I mean fire, water, air and earth, here represented by four stones), and one fifth, that is so rare one has to rely on utter luck to find it. This is what happens to Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), former army Major and taxi driver extraordinaire. This fifth element is an alien being called Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), that escapes from the laboratory she is held captive and jumps into the void, only to be saved by landing on the taxi's roof.When combined with the other four, this fifth element can prevent evil from destroying the Earth. This is something that the authorities know, and charge Dallas with saving it. It sounds simple, but it is not, when you have an evil megalomaniac, Mr. Zorg (Gary Oldman) chasing you for the stones, while some egoistic alien merchants, the Mangalores, want them as their own and are after him. This is the perfect recipe for what will be a succession of misunderstandings, surprises, and lavish spectacles, that even include a dance show starring a DJ.""The fifth element"" is surely not a comedy, rather a tongue-in-cheek action film. The action sequences are thrilling, with Willis shining due to both his physical and his acting performance, his reserved, serious attitude coming in stark contrast to the takes he has to fulfill. The chase for the famed fifth element catches the viewer's attention from the first scenes, and the excellent Milla Jovovich as Leeloo serves the film perfectly, evolving from an innocent alien being to an experienced, capable heroine that occupies the screen and overshadows all others in her presence. Willis and her make a memorable pair, that combines the former's distant, cold rational nature and her more sentimental personality.Gary Oldman as the villain is the definition of kitsch, always dressed in luxurious outfits, visible from meters away, and his portrayal of Mr. Zorg transcends the limits of caricature and becomes rather a parody of classic science fiction nemeses. The comical aspect of the film is further reinforced through the hilarious Tom Lister Jr. Incarnating the President of this world, who doesn't only offer some great comedic scenes involving his ever-present family, but also is Besson's way of relentlessly satirising modern political leaders. That all this happens in a science fiction film just goes on to show the director's many aspects.The comedic and ironic characteristic of ""The fifth element"" contribute in giving it a human side, which is what makes it resoundingly European. Even better, the film is dominated by its cinéma du look nature: magnificent scenery, Gaultier costumes conceived in another planet, and plenty of colour. The universe is like a canvas, which Besson has painted in the best way possible with his cinematic palette, a quality that he had already shown in his ""Le grand bleu"" nine years ago. But here it is not the sea that is explored in its preexistent beauty: Everything we see is a product of Besson's imagination, one that truly amazes sometimes.""The fifth element"" is there to see, not to analyse. It is mostly a feast for the eyes, replacing with visual excellence what is lacking in substance. Besson has, with films like that, abandoned his auteur beginnings and become one of the most commercial French directors. But his way of going commercial often transcends his compatriots' one and becomes something unique. ""The fifth element"" is such a case, something that renders it all the more better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Luc Besson delivers again ....,".....to begin with, as usual, then like two of his other best known movies, Léon (AKA The Professional) and Nikita (AKA La Femme Nikita) - The Fifth Element fizzles out towards the end with astonishing predictability. It seems he got bored around the same point while working on these three movies and handed the reins to somebody else. Putting Chris Tucker's character in the movie is like having the ring-tone The Annoying Thing (AKA Crazy Frog) play on the soundtrack of Schindler's List or Titanic when the ship ...Anyway, Luc Besson has improved his directorial skills markedly, The Messenger:The Story of Joan of Arc was amazing - and it's the one film which show's Milla Jovovich can really act when she wants to. In Fifth Element she does what the role demands of her, but when you see the exact character reprised in two seriously inferior movies (The Resident Evil ones) then it demeans her performance in this movie. Especially if, like me, you see those movies before this one.I gave the movie a 7/10 which is high, and had it not introduced the very, very, very annoying Chris Tucker character, it would certainly have been on my Top 10 list of Si-Fi movies ... but unfortunately it did, and it will continue to do so every time I watch the movie - so I'll never watch it again. For comparison, think of the screechy character which spoilt the later additions of the Police Academy series of movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Eccentrically Original and Incredibly Fun,"With incredible sets and outstanding CGI, 'The Fifth Element' is an amazing creation by talented director Luc Besson and is one of the best Sci Fi movies ever made.With a huge degree of interesting ideas, the movie is extremely pleasant to the eye and is sumptuous in its visuals and set designs, with incredible detail throughout.Bruce Willis has never been an outstanding actor, but the director brings the best of his humourful and cool qualities. Milla Jovovich portrays a true and sincere caring character that brings a tear to my eye. Gary Oldman successfully embodies a truly insane antagonist in one of his best roles. Chris Tucker is mad as a fish and is the type of actor more modern films need.

Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman, and Chris Tucker star in the sci-fi hit of 1997 with dazzling special effects, action, comedy, and romance set in a colorful, extravagant future where good has fought evil every 5,000 years. Everyone aboard gives great performances hands-down throughout. I could tell everyone had fun working on this film, especially with creativity put into the costumes, sets, creatures, the futuristic weaponry, the works. The visuals are dated compared to today's standards and the film is a tad cartoonish but that gives it charm and style and it's still good nonetheless.

"Wild, Giddy Space Opera...","The story goes that director Luc Besson began writing THE FIFTH ELEMENT in his teens, incorporating all the Sci-Fi elements he loved into one over-the-top, grand space opera...sort of an ""E.E. 'Doc' Smith 'Skylark' Meets Flash Gordon and Barbarella"" hybrid with sex, intergalactic action, and even some pseudo-religious overtones tossed in...in other words, a teenage daydream come true! Critics panned the end result for this very reason, sneering at Bruce Willis' Earth-saving (yet again!) Korben Dallas, and Besson's then-girlfriend, clothing-optional Milla Jovovich, as the innocent demigod, Leeloo.The critics were wrong!THE FIFTH ELEMENT is, in the best sense of the word, a classic 'B' movie, a space opera where a prologue vaguely similar to STARGATE leads to a future Earth where traffic jams occur thirty stories above the ground, humanity is ruled by beefy 'Tiny' Lister Jr., and where the Ultimate Evil is served by everyone's favorite villain, Gary Oldman, sporting a Southern accent! If this DOESN'T convince you that this is a 'popcorn' flick, not to be taken too seriously, there is Chris Tucker, sporting a blond hairdo, as the Galaxy's favorite media personality, promoting himself as he hits on his adoring female fans; Ian Holm, as the monk who knows 'the Secret', forced, despite himself, to become an active participant in the adventure; and some of the most butt-ugly alien mercenaries you'll ever see, terrorizing a space resort, until they meet their match in Bruce Willis' 'DIE HARD in Space' protagonist! Yippee-Ki-Yay, indeed!The FX are astonishing, the comedy, broad and sly, the heroics, macho, and as Leeloo, sent to save Earth, Jovovich manages to be both naive and sexy, with broken English and a gymnast's grace.Bruce Willis is a joy, as always, to watch, and he carries the film with charm and self-depreciating humor, whether dealing with endless phone calls from his mother, driving his sky taxi recklessly (cabbies change very little in the future!), taking on terrorists single-handed, or falling for the exotic Leeloo. When he blows away a roomful of hostage-holding aliens, then asks, ""Does anyone else want to negotiate?"", you KNOW Besson picked the right guy for the lead!If you want Profound Science Fiction, watch 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY again...but if you want to kick back and just have fun, look not further...THE FIFTH ELEMENT delivers!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I was blown away by the sheer entertainment value of this movie.The story is basic sci-fi mumbo jumbo, but who cares? Anytime you get Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman in the same movie, I couldn't care less about the plot. Bruce Willis once again does his tough-guy persona, and he shows that he's still got the goods to kick butt and crack jokes. Gary Oldman, in a strange idea, has a Texas drawl and he gives another over-the-top bad guy performance (he also has the worst hairstyle known to man). Ian Holm exudes dignity, Chris Tucker is annoying and funny at the same time (scary), and Milla Jovovich kicks even more butt.The action ROCKS. I have not seen shootouts this cool in a long time.

"brilliant, but ruined","Basically this film can be split into two parts; A bloody brilliant on-a-par-with-star-wars first half. And A bloody awful pointless plotless second half.I had been told this film was awful.  During the first hour, i thought, no this is ace. the sixties b-movie sort of futuristic look was done perfectly, the comedy moments were there, some blinding special effects sequences.  There was loads of imagination, such as the chinese food stall/flying boat thingy, the weapons etc... But what tied it all together was the plot.  OK, I didn't know why this big ball of fire came from that was threatening the Earth, i did not care, i was enjoying the film too much to really think about this.  And while not amazing, the plot wa interesting - i wanted to know what happened.  I honestly expected it to be one of my favourite films ever at this point.But no.  If you have not seen the film as yet, then when they Earth on this mission, turn it off.  Please.  You would be better just imagine what happens.  It would be better than the reality.In short, there is a fight lasting 40 odd minutes, a totally corny ending where 'love' saves the Earth, the most unsubtle point about war ever (ie. lass sits in front of some images of war, then cries).  I had no idea at all what was going on in the fight sequence, and when the big evil alien geezer got killed, i thought 'is that it? Shouldnt it be a bit more dramatic when a important character is killed?' The plot has been utterly forgotten to fit in special effects.  They took away the quality scenery of the first half, replacing it with tripe. There is even an annoying bloke like Jar-Jar Binks (in fact i think it is the same bloke) chucked in for good measure, as if it wasn't bad enough at this point.I was utterly peeved off with this film.

Utter nonsense but entertaining,"The best thing about The Fifth Element is Milla Jovovich speaking the Divine Language. With her Eastern European background, she actually manages to make it sound like a real language, unlike some Santa Monica bimbo who got a C in Spanish and couldn't find Europe on a map. This movie is pure nonsense and is almost certainly nothing like what life will really be like 250 years from now, but it has bright, Life Saver candy colors and lots of action. It has some imaginative special effects and futuristic devices that someone actually put some thought into. Several human races and a few alien ones are represented on the screen, rather than a uniform cast of bland Americans. What is most entertaining is its vision of the far future: Gaudy, raucous, colorful, and anarchic. The look of the film borrows a bit from the Italian cinema, the Sixties, Blade Runner, and Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil,"" although it is not as inspired as any of its sources. This is in stark contrast to the dour, Germanic futures we saw in sci-fi flicks from the Fifties through the Seventies and that only started to change with Star Wars, which of course was not in the future but in the futuristic past. Bruce Willis uses his quiet persona to great effect in this film; he is the still point around which all the noisy action revolves; as Korben Dallas, he is carried along by the full-tilt action until the climactic last act, when he finally takes charge.

"Howard Carter opened King Tut's tomb on February 16th, 1923","The Fifth Element was another one of those mid-late 90s films that helped usher in the age of digital technology. The special effects are dead-on, even for a film that is over 25 years old now. It helps bring to light the Digital Modern Age of filmmaking and paved the way to the CGI intensive Hollywood that we have today. Some would say that is a good thing and some may say that is a bad thing. But, if you can understand the drive of filmmakers, especially SPFX wizards and technical artists, whose challenge is to make things as real as possible, then this needs to happen. If you want your audience to really believe something is real, these advances in technology need to evolve in order to feed a starving audience, looking for next-to-reality, in their stories. The Fifth Element (1997), was one of the pioneers in modern CGI.This is a dark comedy of sorts. It starts out in Egypt in the early 1900s, then heads to a galaxy not too far away. It takes us to a future earth and the life of flying Taxi-Cab driver, Korben Dallas (Willis), as he becomes entrenched in a situation that could save or destroy the world. Along the way, he runs into a beautiful, fiery, mysterious, young woman (Jovovich), with orange-flamed hair, who is involved with something called the fifth element. Many other, strange characters abound in the film.It is an exciting and fun film to look at and has a smattering of comedy, sprinkled throughout. Also, keep an eye on the ever-present color of ORANGE. It represents the ever important aura of the fifth element, as the key ingredient to this film. Also, fresh off of 90210 is Luke Perry as Billy and Chris Tucker gives a head-scratching, but very important performance, as an alien TV personality. This film has it all.

Luc Besson's strange sci-fi is audacious and uneven in tone but very enjoyable,"Luc Besson's sci-fi opus is an enjoyable, flamboyant, strange and imaginative romp that tends to divide audiences from those who embrace the comedic elements, the over the top performance of Chris Tucker and the excesses of Jean Paul Gaultier's costume designs and those who are completely turned off by it's audacious and uneven tone.Bruce Willis is on hand to keep the film falling from imploding playing an unwitting action hero cab driver who picks up a mysterious being called Leeloo who turns out to be the Fifth Element that can save the planet from the evil destruction of Zorg. Set in the 23rd century he gets embroiled in an exotic adventure.Besson devised the story when he was just 16 years old and finally realised his vision 22 years later as a labour of love project. It was the most expensive European film made at that time and was a box office success thanks to a great cast, imaginative set design, impressive special effects and an original and playful script.Besson believed that the future would be colourful and decadent rather than dark and gloomy like so many other sci-fi movies and he certainly achieves that here. It's a lot of fun, pleasing on the eye and engages from the start if you are willing to go along for the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awful movie,This is one of the worst and most insulting sci fi movies I've ever seen. The movie has no plot. It tries to me cute but miserably fails. This movie would have made more sense as a crazy comedy/sci fi satire than a movie that prents to be a sci fi movie.,1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great great movie! Very courageous director.,"This is a great example why I dislike most of today's movies. Movies back then (80 ~ 90 and some of 00's) where more courageous, directors weren't afraid of craziness and nonsense. More art could be expressed, more challenging scenes! I miss this! This movie shows this things clearly, actors are very into this whole new universe and the universe itself is well developed. As a Isaac Asimov reader I approve this science fiction. Now lets talk specifics... I always write for you guys to help choosing this movie to watch, so this is why and when I think you should get this one: If you are into Sci-Fi get this movie, no matter what. It has some plot issues like things happening too fast and some weak comedy in scenes that don't need or match the requirements... but still this is a great Sci-Fi. You'll be able to enjoy even the lifestyle of the universe, the clothes, the environment, the mores. Just do it. As for any other, you should watch to experience a movie that doesn't work on the character development or on the people interactions but it develops an entire new universe so you can enjoy thinking of it. It may be your intro to Sci-Fi since it is a light Sci-Fi with easy to understand rules.Finally for the bads... This movie has some problems. Some times the scenes go too fast and it is somewhat hard to understand why somethings are to be that way. The movie doesn't end well too because of that, for some reason in the end near the climax, things start to solve really fast for idiotic reasons. That doesn't ruin the movie but instead shows how much potential it have if those were to be fixed. It deserves the 7 it has.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Possibly my favorite sci-fi film of the 90s,"I've heard more than one person compare this film to Blade Runner (one [out of several] of my favorite sci-fi films of the 80s), despite the somewhat similar settings, it's hard to imagine two more different films.  This colorful sci-fi action spoof is also a marked contrast to Besson's previous films La Femme Nikita and Leon (known as The Professional here in the States), but does share some similarities with them.  Much like Nikita and Leon have a distinctive French style to them (even though the latter is set in the U.S.), The Fifth Element takes a lot of stylistic cues from French and Japanese comic books, both of which I'm a fan of, particularly Moebius (who contributed some designs to The Fifth Element) and Shirow Masamune (speaking of which, watch for a volume of the excellent Yakuza (Japanese for gangster) comic Sanctuary in Korben Dallas' apartment).The film isn't set so much in the future, more of a futurized comic book version of the world that Nikita and Leon are set in.  I always find futuristic worlds that are still grappling with contemporary problems more interesting, maybe that's part of why I've never found the utopian world of Star Trek very interesting.From my understanding, Besson wrote an early draft of the story in high school (along with an early draft of the under-appreciated The Big Blue), which I think is cool, since I can relate, because in school, I had (as of yet, unrealized) dreams of being a filmmaker, and I would often draw cartoons or write stories to help relieve the tedium of high school.  Of course, most of them were crap, and have no chance in hell of ever being made into a film.Besson has a wonderful visual style, here, it's very interesting to see him apply that style to a sci-fi world rather than a contemporary world (as in his films from Subway to Leon) or a bleak post-apocalypse world (as in the lesser known than it should be Le Dernier Combat).  Of course, credit is also due to production designer Dan Weil and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (Arbogast's cinematography was one of the few redeeming features of the dismal Wing Commander).  Along with John Woo, Luc Besson is my favorite action director (they may have a three-way tie with the Wachowski brothers if they make more films like The Matrix). Eric Serra's excellent musical score is also worth mentioning.  I really enjoyed seeing Gary Oldman repeat his villain role from Leon, although in this film, his character is more cartoonish than evil.  I also really like a lot of the visual humor Besson included, like the cigarettes that are 3/4ths filter, and the well-edited sequence when the jet is taking of for Flosthon Paradise.A couple of complaints though, I would've liked to see Jean Reno play Korben Dallas, not that Bruce Willis did a bad job.  I wonder if Reno was originally cast for the part, but backed out.  Reno is one of my favorite actors, I could really imagine him in the role.  Another thing, I've never found Milla Jovovich's fight scene very believable, maybe I'm just spoiled from having seen so many kung fu movies, particularly the newer ones, like with Jet Li.  There are also a few plot holes and lapses in logic, but I choose not to worry about them too much, this isn't a film to take seriously or over-analyze.  I say if you can't enjoy the occasional silly action flick (like this one, which succeeds admirably on that level), you're taking life too seriously.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Fifth Element, Funny yet a little too slow to get funny.","The first 20 minutes of this movie almost put me to sleep. I wasn't expecting the type of caliber I seen in Leon(The Professional) though. Overall this movie sets out to be what it's meant to be. Yet it starts off too slow for me to rank the movie as a whole highly. Eric Serra's soundtrack as usual is pretty well suited to the movie. I never took this movie seriously to begin with. It's like a comedy basically. It's pretty funny once it picks up. I feel if I'm going to re-watch this film though that... I'll have to fast forward 20 minutes in.If you want to see Luc Besson's best work in my opinion, I suggest you check out the movie Leon.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Love Will Save The Earth,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Fifth Element"" (1997) is a superb escapism. Saw this movie many times in my life, and the last one just recently on 4K UHD release by Studio Canal, so i can safely say - this is a pure escapism and never looked and sounded better than nowm. Performances were fun by all involved - but it's a Chris Tucker who steals the show. Speciall effects are truly special, while sound, music (great stuff), art design, costumes are great as well. While this movie still drags a bit in it's second act (at Korben Dalla's apartment) by the time the third act begins and Chris Tucker steps in - it is a blast till the very last second.Overall, if ""The Fifth Element"" would have been created in now, this is probably would have been one the worst movies of the year. But as it was done back in 1997 - it is (and was) a helluva escapism. Great vision, superb effects, great acting and pure energy of it creators still makes this movie a must see.

Bad but Great!!  Great Fun for those who can appreciate it.,"Very B-Movie-esquire, and it was obviously intentional. If you allow yourself not to be too critical, this movie is a blast as it was definitely made to be light and entertaining. And I love it for it. It's a great SciFi to pop in at bed time to let your mind unwind. It's very visual and it's kind of fun to play ""name that influence"" with all of the sources it rips off. It's kind of a ""Heavy Metal""-esquire thing (think of the cabbie sequence from that movie) mixed with a ton of other influences. I like that it kind of borrows a lot of it's world view from blade runner (in a less dark way, mainly the technology and griminess). This includes the actor who played Leon in that movie playing the military goon come to inform Bruce Willis's character of his re-activation. A great, fun, kind of stupid watch(I mean this in the best possible way) You will find yourself coming back to again and again. I kind of group this with Demolition Man and Judge Dredd (the last one not quite measuring up to the other two).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
the perfect element for a perfect movie,"It's probably Luc Besson's best movie (with ""le grand bleu""). In his movie, he takes back a trendy subject which is to save the world. On this subject that many directors would have surely taken seriously as it was the case with ""Independance day"", Besson introduces a lot of humor into his film. This humor is unexpected, involuntary and  the movie's got funny scenes that are most of the time based on the stroke (like the moment when Bruce Willis is taking Milla Jovovich (the fifth and perfect element) to the priest( Ian Holm) and the last one  thought that the fifth element had vanished forever. So you can imagine his reaction. Not only are some scenes funny but the dialogs are often zany. These comical elements enable to overlook the dramatic side of the situation. On another hand, Besson controls perfectly his movie: almost all the scenes (especially the action scenes) are meticulously well-ordered at the level of the making, the light, the costumes etc... So the movie doesn't neglect any point. Moreover,  Besson's making is inventive, clever ( besides the movie won an Oscar in France in 1998 for the best director). The screenplay is remarkably well put together and is boosting the spectator's attention by the apparition of new facts in common with the plot, even if it's a little manichean. The film is a pleasant surprise thanks to its actors too. Bruce Willis is simple, just, he doesn't ham it up and doesn't play the he-man. Gary Oldman is a wicked who never falls into the caricature; he's even fanciful and ridiculous. Let's add that the other actors are all excellent. At last , a sustained rythm not spoiled by the special effects, some extraordinaries sceneries; it seems that everything in this movie (which looks like a comic strip), was designed to charm the spectator. So it's not surprising that it was enormously successful in France.A remark: here, the president's got a neutral role unlike ""Independance day"" in which the president pilots a fighter plane.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Horribly smug Bruce Willis, wretched acting everywhere else.

Just for those who don't want to use the brain,"If there's something beyond science is how a brainless movie like this has been consider better than Battlefield Earth. The main idea is good but is treated in a way very shallow. Bruce Willis is great as the action hero, but the rest of the characters are horrible, a group pathetic of freaks in a battle to save the Earth with something that they don't even understand. There's no drama, just a dead intent to make comedy in a world created by the shallow mind of a famous designer. Science Fiction mixed with the fashion world, can only work if there's some respect for the deep side of the scifi (I mean some scientific theme or logic concept), but in this case it's just a freak universe with anything less a real piece of brain.

The Final Element,"From the vast timeless desert expanse of Egypt, then reaching far out into space, touching the future of Earth, comes an extraordinary story of how a race of beings have come to protect the planet Earth from ultimate oblivion. In order to do that, the powerful Mondoshawan race entrusted four very special elemental stones within a crept to be used in conjunction with The Fifth Element which morphs them into an unimaginable power of cosmic proportions. The story itself is fantastic in it's inception, wondrous in it's creation, explosive in it's delivery and dynamic in it's projected outcome. The film advances rapidly through the masterful and exciting talents of Bruce Willis as taxi driving Korben Dallas and Gary Oldman as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg. He is devilishly crafty as the servant of the Great Evil. Ian Holm is religiously mysterious as Father Vito Cornelius and Milla Jovovich is excitingly sexy as Leeloo. All in all, with the great spectrum of colorful characters, weapons and special effects, writer, director Luc Besson blends drama, tragedy and comedy to create a superior film which evolves quietly into a classic. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Science fiction worthy of imagination that gets too silly.,"Showing you how fun saving the world can be is judged by having a chance to see THE FIFTH ELEMENT. It's a wild fantasy ride 300 years into the future that makes this one enjoyably satisfying, but the imagination gets clearly overstated by making itself too obnoxious. Of course, the visuals are as good as any recent sci-fi outing and there is some appropriate meaning about a female life-form while staying alive to prevent the end of the world from coming. The big beef is that its futuristic setting gets over-exaggerated for its strange behavior. Part of this factor is Chris Tucker, who is downright annoying as a radio freak on hyperwarp. I like how science fiction is vigorously refined for the 90s and beyond. I wish the film crews and directors would find better alternatives in not forging over the top on excess junk material. Pray that STAR WARS - EPISODE ONE doesn't fall into the sleaze trap where STARSHIP TROOPERS and this film landed in.Sony, your formula is greatly showing.

Great Euro Sci-fi,"Science fiction is supposed to include meeting strange creatures from other worlds and seeing events in the future but most of the characters in Sci-fi films sound and act like they live in California and just walked on the set. The Fifth Element is refreshing because it was made in Europe, with mostly European actors. Also, the costuming has a French fashion over substance look. All of this makes every scene seem out of the ordinary.Now with this different background the plot is pretty routine, evil is going to destroy the world with a few more religious overtones added than usual. Bruce Willis turns in an expectedly good performance. Milla Jovovich plays a very off beat heroine well. Gary Oldman is an equally unusual villain. The special effects are good. There is plenty of humor throughout the movie and even though sometimes a joke misses (for instance with the mother of the Willis character) I found the movie fun. On top of all this there is plenty of shooting and explosions.Now there is something about obnoxious characters. They don't bother me so much in a sci-fi movie. Hey, this is supposed to be different so why not weird characters. The Fifth Element has plenty of them including one named Ruby Rhod who makes over the top seem tame. I figure the circus is in town so I enjoyed the freak show.The Fifth Element shows that sci-fi can be stretched in unusual directions. I recommend it for those who truly want to go to different place and time.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Weird and dumb fun,"The Fifth Element is a 1997 sci fi movie starring Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman. This movie has a simple story, some nice characters... but it's really weird. I'll start off talking about the plot of the film. The beginning of this movie isn't confusing, but it jumps around between a lot of time periods/plot lines and it's kind of annoying. I think the entire opening scene probably could've been cut. For the most part, the general story and themes aren't anything new but it's presented in a very unique way. The characters are honestly pretty interesting with some great relationships within here. The visuals here look great a lot of times, but other times some costumes look clunky and the CGI isn't very good. The performances are all solid with some, once again, very weird things going on. The soundtrack can be a bit much at times but most of the time everything sounds good and matches the setting.

Light Hearted Sci Fi Movie,"This is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously. It is more in the adventure movie category than a Sci fi movie. It doesn't make you think much and it is pretty much a good date movie which can appeal to a large audience. Still the twists and turns are quite interesting enough to make this an entertaining sci-fi adventure movie ala Star wars.A cab driver in the future(in the 23rd century) has the job of protecting a woman who is the only hope against the destruction of the earth. This woman is actually an alien from another planet. The cab driver Korben Dallas(Bruce Willis) who is heartbroken from a previous marriage slowly falls in love with her. The President of the world and a priest Father cornelius are also interested in the girl in order to save the world. There is no great twist towards the end but the many twists and turns in the plot are quite entertaining and are not jarring to the central plot. There is also a villain Jean Baptiste Zorg(Gary Oldman) who wants to get the items from the girl in order to destroy them to enable the destruction of the earth. Most of the scenes have a sort of wry humour which is common in these types of adventure films. The villain himself is a character with some funny lines. There are also other characters to add more hilarity to the plot.The special effects are the first thing that can be noticed about this movie. It can be seen why this movie was so expensive. The special effects are ahead of its time and the special effects don't seem overdone. Milla jovovich as the woman Leeloo has given an adequate performance. Gary Oldman's performance was my favourite in this movie as he shows no hint of the over the top performance that he did in Leon. Here he is perfect as the villain who will do anything to create chaos in the world. The many scenes he appears in are quite light hearted. Even the scene towards the end with the bomb is also quite hilarious. The only irritant in this movie is Chris tucker who has given a really over the top performance as the anchor Ruby Rhod. At some points, his voice is grating and his presence seems jarring. His comic scenes with the air hostesses are not all that funny and are quite an irritant. The role of the priest has also been done in a more restrained funny manner. The makeup of the aliens has also been done excellently.Overall you won't be disappointed as it has some good action scenes and great special effects. And of course Milla Jovovich's costume.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I've heard some people excuse the lack of any logic or reason in the plot by saying, ""Well, it's a sci-fi film, you know?!""  My response is that the best science-fiction novels and films have their basis in physics, biology, etc... and are usually meticulously structured and well thought out.  Besson seems to have based ""The Fifth Element"" in his typical sophomoric tendency of making style tantamount to substance.

I guess, since this is sci-fi, we're just supposed to laugh and fill in the gaps ourselves, but I found it rather annoying.

I'm keeping this synopsis vague mainly because the premise is one that's difficult to describe in just a few words.The movie attracted an interesting cast, to say the least. Bruce Willis, in prime 'working man's action hero' mode, was the top-billed star and he didn't disappoint. However, Milla Jovovich had probably the film's most memorable performance as perfect human being Leeloo. That's not to take anything away from the always intriguing Gary Oldman, whose outlandish portrayal of an arms dealer was something to behold. Also memorably outlandish was Chris Tucker as entertainment personality Ruby Rhod. I haven't even touched on Sir Ian Holm or notable appearances by the likes of Luke Perry, Mathieu Kassovitz & trip-hop pioneer Tricky. As I said, definitely an interesting cast.Visually, the movie is a treat. Luc Besson went for a style inspired by French comics artists Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud & Jean-Claude Mézières, even going so far as to hire them to contribute to the production design. The result was a vibrant, fully realized world of the future that isn't just a retread of tired genre tropes. Meanwhile, Besson's direction is nicely handled and keeps the action flowing smoothly.All in all, ""The Fifth Element"" is a memorable science fiction movie that managed to separate itself from the pack by presenting a unique vision. A varied and well-assembled cast helped to bring the movie to life, as did a fast-moving storyline that's full of twists and turns.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's just a tarted up action movie,"At it's core, it's another action movie. An above average one, to be sure. But it's dressed up to be as bizarre as possible. But only the details are bizarre, like Gary Oldman's southern accent or Luke Perry showing up in a bit part. The trouble I have with it is that it's deliberately strange.

"Yes, big ba-da-boom","So I waited 21 years to write this to let it all sink in. ;) This may just be my favorite go-to film of all time. Yeah, it's not CItizen Kane, or the Godfather, but, for me, it has all the elements, ha ha, I love. Adventure, humor, science fiction, fantasy...
Luc Besson has directed some of my favorite films, and his vision of this one is just amazing. As is the casting. Bruce Willis as Korben Dalls is at his prime here, a wise-ass cab driver who unwittingly has to save the world. How can anyone NOT be in love with Milla Jovovich as Leeloo? Gary Oldman is splendid as yet another psycho and ... is Chris Tucker playing... Prince? Well, RIP purple one, let's not even go there. But he's hysterically obnoxious.

A Visual Feast: Revisiting The Fifth Element,"Luc Besson's 1997 sci-fi masterpiece, ""The Fifth Element,"" is a wild, hilarious, and visually stunning ride through a futuristic world on the brink of destruction. Bruce Willis plays Korben Dallas, a cab driver who becomes the unlikely hero tasked with saving humanity. His journey leads him to Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), a mysterious and powerful being who may be the key to stopping the impending apocalypse.The movie is a visual feast, with stunning sets, costumes, and special effects that still hold up today. The humor is both witty and slapstick, with Chris Tucker's Ruby Rhod stealing every scene he's in. The action sequences are thrilling and inventive, and the romance between Korben and Leeloo is surprisingly sweet amidst the chaos.While some may find the plot a bit convoluted, the sheer energy and creativity of ""The Fifth Element"" are undeniable. It's a film that embraces its own absurdity and delivers a truly unique and unforgettable cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Imaginative sci-fi with a comedic twist,"This is a lot goofier than you might expect a seemingly straightforward sci-fi film to be. The cheesy elements kind of work though and give the film more personality to stand out among a crowded slate of similar films. Eric Serra's unique score fits perfectly in this bizarre and wacky future. Bruce Willis is rock solid as the lead and Milla Jovovich bursts onto the Hollywood scene in stunning fashion. The oddest role by far goes to Chris Tucker, who is absolutely bonkers in this movie. The production is ultimately the real standout though, as some real imaginative and innovative designs are utilized brilliantly.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's campy and better than Star Wars,"While I'm a big SW fan, I have found the Fifth Element far more enjoyable to watch.

Anyone could possess it, unlike the Force of the SW triolgies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The Fifth Element""- Inventive and entertaining start-to-finish!","Good old popcorn movies. They never go out of style! They're the perfect remedy to pop on after a long week at work or on a boring rainy afternoon. Something to sit back, relax and enjoy. And director Luc Besson's 1997 sci-fi action/comedy epic ""The Fifth Element"" may just be one of the all-time greats! A film that is endlessly inventive and entertaining from the first frame to the last.In the distant future of 2263, a dark and mysterious force emerges that threatens to destroy all life as we know it. And the only thing that can stop it is an ancient weapon that combines the elements of fire, wind, water and earth with a living being- a ""fifth element""- to channel them. And that fifth element? A peculiar and beautiful alien clone called ""Leeloo"" (Milla Jovovich), who must team up with a special-forces-agent-turned-cab-driver (Bruce Willis), a sagely monk (Ian Holm) and a fast-talking talk-show host (Christ Tucker) to save the universe!It's hard to believe that ""The Fifth Element"" will soon be going on twenty-five years old. Because for all intents and purpose... it's as refreshing and fun as it ever has been. The film benefits from a wonderful cast, a great tone and a deliciously over-the-top style that sets it apart from others that came both before and after.While Bruce Willis is definitely the headliner in the cast, there isn't enough that can be said about how wonderful Milla Jovovich is in the part of Leeloo. She is the beating heart of the film. She is fearless and charming, and can also kick some serious butt when needed. This is the film that made her a star, and she's just fabulous. Not that it takes anything away from the rest of the cast, though. Because they're just as good. Willis is a blast as usual, with his smart-alec nature and penchant for action, and he lends a lot to the proceedings. Holm brings a sense of class and dignity, and even gets some sharp comedic moments to sink his teeth into. And I know he's divisive in this film... but I friggin' love Chris Tucker as the obnoxious and hilarious Ruby Rhod. He's just a ton of fun. Special props also go to the always-reliable Gary Oldman as Zorg, one of the film's main villains. He's great in the part and brings a lot of life to the proceedings.I also really love the tone Besson establishes in the film. There's a lot of big, archetypal ideas at play, and in lesser hands, it could have turned out much more dour. But Besson wisely injects the film with some wonderful humor and a light, breezy quality. In a way, I would almost favorably compare it to a cartoon. Albeit, a cartoon for grown-ups. It never takes itself too seriously, and has a massive fun-factor. It's just such a joy to watch this movie.And then there's the style. And that's where the film really turns itself up to eleven! This is such a strange and unique film. There are so many wonderful details, eye-popping designs, wild costumes... you haven't seen anything quite like it! It's bold and vibrant and wondrous. Even sexy at times. This film is widely known for its insane visuals, and it's for a good reason. From the strange and otherworldly aliens to the hilariously revealing clothing to the vibrant pastel colors... Besson and his design team bring their A-game to the visuals. It's stunning.The only place where the film sometimes falters is in the pacing. The movie moves quite fast, and as a result, you do get the odd bit of tonal whiplash. Silly scenes don't always flow well into the more serious plot-driven moments. But I'd be lying if I said that this was a major problem. It's just a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent package.""The Fifth Element"" is one of the definitive popcorn movies. It's loud. It's vibrant. And it's a ton of fun! This is not only one of best popcorn flicks of the 90's. It's one of the best popcorn flicks ever made. Period. It's hard to be objective in a case such as this, but there's no other way around it. I gotta give ""The Fifth Element"" a 10. Is it a perfect film? No. But it is perfect fun? Yes. Most certainly, yes.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Basically a cult classic with perhaps not original ideas but a brilliant and fun execution,"Granted the story might not be the most original of the genre, granted the costume, setting, props and character designs might reminisce very uncannily to other masterpieces like Star Wars, Blade runner and Die Hard; granted the story might have plot holes and inconsistencies opting for the most flashy, aesthetically-pleasing action or set up scene; but the movie is sort of self-aware of it and once you realise this was the idea of a 16 year-old, actually impressive in execution.There's really nothing else to discuss, the movie is fun, very creatively designed and with engaging characters. The movie draws from genres of sci-fi in its world, spaceship and props designs; a bit of western in terms of show-downs, dialogue and character subplots; and finally the second half of the movie is a buddy cop movie with John Mclaine and his 90s-stapled african-american funny side kick. THe movie is pure entertainment and might lack a little more depth to its backstory as it does an incredible time jump at the beginning without explaining anything that happened in between. It seemed as a half-baked idea that deserved more development but it was ready enough to make a first splashing blockbuster with an engaging story and surprising CGI and practical effects that hold well the test of time.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Willis with hair is something you don't see often but playing a guy that becomes a hero was good. Tucker was quirky and cool and I liked the prince vibe he had.

France's greatest Sci-Fi creation.,"France's most expensive and highest grossing film for a whopping fifteen years, this masterpiece by Luc Besson gained its fame and fortune mostly off the back of poking fun at itself. This movie has a wonderful, to-the-point script, with an excellent pace and adorable, lively characters. It's ability to create setting thru stunning sets, props and amazing wardrobe is only surpassed by its charming wit and playful attitude. Such a pity, then, for Besson to have not learnt his lesson: when everything mattered most, (at the inception of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets) he chose a wordy, toothless script, a pompous, show-off screenplay, and no sense of levity in the film whatsoever. His choice to try and intrigue visually without employing meaning or depth, cost him his entire fortune and his future as a producer (remember that even Avatar had an engaging plot and a unique mythology).This Sci-Fi Opera Comedy (a genre created by the late and wonderful Douglas Adams) was heavily criticized by radical feminists for flat and sexist portrayals of women, despite the protagonist being THE prototype flawless female, ""key to everything"" that is so prevalent in today's political and social rhetoric. ""The Fifth Element"" transcends typical dramas by juggling spectacle, humor and heartfelt emotion, and thru its morale: men and women need each other, we can support one another, and by presenting the incredible value of being loved.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It is also worth mentioning about many of the rofl moments. They dilute the atmosphere. As far as the acting is concerned, it is pretty good. I think about Bruce Willis a lot of writing is not worth it because he is, as always, on top. What about others? Milla perfectly portrayed the role of Leeloo with all the emotions. But I want to highlight the Chris Tucker played Ruby. THIS IS THE BEST CHARACTER !! Damn, I don't even know how to describe my emotions about Ruby. Is it enough that he's just the best ok?))
but there is no such film where everything is fine right? (although I'm not sure lol) in the film, as I think, the aliens were absurd (?) in terms of not their very presence, but how they look. Although do not forget that the film was filmed in 97 so it's not surprising. By the way, the last scene with Leeloo and Korben was very unexpected and cool (whoever disagrees, agree))

"The Fifth Element, or How to Save the Universe with a Taxi and a Girl in Bandages","Luc Besson completely lost it by giving us a movie that feels like an acid trip at Comic Con. We're in the 23rd century, where humanity is in danger, and guess who has to save the day? Bruce Willis, space cabbie version, with less hair but even more attitude. You've got evil incarnate showing up, and they hand you a chick in bandages to take it down. Makes total sense, right?Besson lined up a killer cast. Bruce Willis in full ""Yippee-ki-yay"" mode, Milla Jovovich spouting incomprehensible lines while still looking stunning, and Gary Oldman... seriously, this guy could play a toothbrush and still seem menacing. It's heavy stuff, real heavy. The mix works - you laugh, you're glued to the screen, and you feel like shouting, ""Corben Dallas, multipass!""It's like Star Wars took a hefty dose of Mad Max and sprinkled in some Monty Python.

A nice hit turns to an infield out.,"A friend wrote this: I liked Fifth Element only because of its excess.  A good comparison is Water World.  When the French blow 200 million dollars, you get a crappy film with a lot of style (great clothes), beautiful expansive scnenery and some kind of cool music.  When the American blow 200 million, you get Kevin Costner.My reply: I actually liked Fifth Element until around Jovavitch's big fight scene. Suddenly the film took a left turn, lost whatever focus on style it had, and became an embarrassment on the level of Tank Girl.Chris Tucker was fine for his first scene. But to keep him on screen for more than five minutes was a huge mistake that derailed the movie. Father of the Bride did it right with Martin Short as the wedding planner -- five minutes then out. If the performance sucks then no harm no foul. Every second past that is unpaid overtime.That whole last third from the departure to the fantasy planet onwards was as though Besson said "" I can't make up my mind between sci fi and forced camp."" If there's a hell below intentional camp I'd like to know what it is. It began subtly with the jewish mother jokes and the General's crew stuffed in the freezer, by the fight scene it was outta control. Bruce Willis had a great action sequence, overshadowed by Tucker's shrill-bitch running commentary. He's not saving the world anymore, he's saving the girly-man from burping aliens.Like fake boobs, you get less pleasure staring at them right after watching the operation. Not only is it false advertising, but now you know you're being taken for a sucker.

CULT CLASSIC THAT ONLY SOME WILL UNDERSTAND,"Do not watch this movie if you hate any of the following movies: The Labyrinth, The Princess Bride, Pulp Fiction, The Big Lebowski, Donnie Darko, Kill Bill, The Goonies, or any other random but fantastic movie.
Also, do not watch this movie if you are unable to understand that the graphics were great for the time and still decent considering how long it has been.This movie has campy humor, an interesting story line, romance, action, and it never takes itself too seriously. All of these things, packed into one film, make it difficult to feel as if the film was ""missing"" something. The back and forth between a very serious Bruce Willis and a way overly flamboyant Chris Tucker is priceless. For those saying Chris Tucker was ""annoying"" or ""too much"" missed the point of his character. He was meant to be all those things to the extreme - that's how the humor comes in. Furthermore, Milla Jovovich's character brings a nice light unknowing, strong, and gentle female character almost any girl could look up to.In a weird way (because of the dynamics of these characters) the movie has an unusual amount of replay value as well. You catch new things each time and the world they depict becomes more fascinating/fun.

Ridiculous - with the utmost intention,"I know how difficult it is to read long, laborious reviews so I'll keep this brief (except it has to be 10 lines!). The film is an extraordinary feat - camp, ridiculous, lavishly over-the-top and blessed with a crazy storyline, but insanely entertaining!The characters, though entirely unbelievable, are perfectly cast and brilliantly written. From Bruce Willis' wonderful attempt at a 'low-key' performance as the textbook reluctant hero, to Chris Tucker's simply indescribable 'Ruby Rhod', laughs are more than aplenty.I challenge you to watch this and complain about its ridiculousness without saying you could easily go back and watch it again, and again... and again. Also, even if you defeat my challenge - surely you can't deny the sheer spectacle of the mind-blowing opera performance in the middle - a scene worthy of any great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Besides the unfamiliar elements, it's a great movie for die-hard scifi fans.","This movie is one of the greatest scifi movies I've seen.  For first-time watchers, it seems really odd.  After you watch it at least one more time, the movie seems to get better.  It's pretty obvious that great time and care was taken to make sure the movie had little or no continuity errors, and making certain rediculous scenes were extremely realistic.  The storyline could use a little help to make it flow a bit faster.  Overall, the movie is well thought out and seems entertaining and logical, once you get past some distracting oddities. For first-time viewers, my advice would be to watch it without interruptions and listen closely.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Max your life...,"The cast is a delight, what an attempt, and what a work of the imagination. The Fifth Element' will change the look of science fiction and will probably be imitated for years. The movie unreels like a depressive in a manic phase, a frenzy of lightning-fast cuts. The action is fast, furious, and as wacky as science fantasy gets. As a yammering, swishy talk show host, Chris Tucker is flat-out incomprehensible, while Mr. Oldman preens evilly enough to leave tooth marks on the scenery. It may be the first perfect ""the worst"" movie ever made, & it is one of the most unhinged. Admiration to all cast & crew.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Awesome sci-fi action movie,"This is one of the best sci-fi action movies in the last 20 years. It This was one of Bruce Willis best action roles since Die Hard. Gary Oldman is a brilliant actor and truly excelled at being a bad guy. This was also the beginning of Milla Jovovich's action movie career. Even the supporting cast was fantastic even the over the top Criss Tucker. Movie watches like a comic book on screen, it was written by Luc Besson which is the same guy who wrote Femme Nikita and Point of no Return.This movie is so good that you can watch it over and over again. The story is solid and moves at a good pace. The special effects are well done without being too over the top. And even though this DVD was made in 1998 sound brilliant. There is plenty of gun fighting and explosions...and as a added bonus Leeloo has some impressive fighting scenes.Willis plays Korbin Dallas who is a Taxi driver in the future who happens to be some retired special forces guy. He ends up giving a ride to Leeloo and saving her from people who do not understand who she is. She is there to save the world.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Favorite,"One of my all time favorite movies. I watch them all. From silent to up to date. This is stunning in it's presentation. Beautifully photographed and I've seen it 12 times and will watch whenever it comes on. Milla Was breath taking as Leelo. Bruce Willis was Bruce Willis. Ian Holm was a great character in Father or the priest.Others were just as good. Great make-up and great costumes. You could really believe it was 300 years in the future. An excellent movie, I highly recommend it. I rarely buy movies, but I bought this one. I would do it again. When it comes on TV again I'll be there to watch it again. I would love to see a sequel.

Passable opening dissolves into retardation with the appearance of Chris Tucker,"I was intrigued to watch this movie, checked the IMDb score beforehand and was looking forward to a good Bruce Willis sci-fi.Unfortunately, what i got was a passable opening ~40 minutes which dissolved into complete utter stupidity soon as Chris Tucker appeared on the scene. I could not believe the direction thought giving his character such a large role was a good idea. He takes over the movie and craps all over it. I hoped he would have a five minute side role, but no, he becomes a main character, given even more screen time than the interesting and attractive leeloo, and Bruce Willis. He is not funny, just fecking stupid and i wanted to shoot him and if i am honest i still do. How anyone can find this kind of humour funny is completely beyond me. Do you like screaming obnoxious loud uneducated black women that never shut their effing mouth? No? So why is it ""funny"", when a man portrays the same character? It isn't.If you are an intelligent person, don't listen to the majority score, the majority of people have 90IQ.

Absolutely stunning! A true work of art.,"The 5th Element left me stunned with surprise. It's witty, funny script put together with action packed screenplay made for an excellent film. Luc Besson directed the world's best sci-fi farse. And a brilliant one at that. The movie's seriousness almost makes fun of all the sci-fi's of the past. Add to this the excellent acting of Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich and, of course Gary Oldman, my favourite, and the result is the best movie ever made. It makes you laugh, jump up and down on your seat, eat popcorn like never before and feel like you're actually a part of the film.There is definitely no future without it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Such an adorable action comedy,"For someone who doesn't normally like science fiction movies, it's pretty funny that one of the movies I was raised on was The Fifth Element. This was such a beloved movie in our household, we frequently quoted one-liners and even named one of our cats after Milla Jovovich's character. Because we couldn't resist the little kitten, even though we hadn't intended to come home with one, and because she had a bit of orange poking through her Abyssinian fur, we thought she was ""the supreme being"". The Fifth Element might not be your favorite action flick, but I'm sure you understand that it's one of mine.In a hilarious, wacky future with flying cars, robot bartenders, clunky guns, and devices that change one's nail polish instantly, Bruce Willis stars as a scruffy, recently fired cab driver who gets drawn into a mission to save the world. On accident, a beautiful, scantily-clad woman falls into his cab, and he helps her escape from the bad guys chasing her. She speaks no English and has no identification, but Bruce quickly learns that Milla is ""the supreme being"" destined to save the world. She's so adorable! As he helps her learn English and information about the modern world, they also fall in love. Ian Holm and Chris Tucker join the ""save the world gang"", playing a by-the-rules religious figure and an over-the-top gameshow host, respectively. The head bad guy, who's far more hilarious than evil, is Gary Oldman. Every scene of his is memorable, with delightful humor and a quotable line to take with you after the credits roll. Then again, the same can be said for everyone else's scenes; it's just that type of a movie.Much like the plot to save the world, everyone in the cast presents his or her own element, combining to create perfection. If you've never seen this movie, give it a chance. You might not name your cat after it, but you'll certainly be entertained and come away with some new household phrases. ""I don't want an incident!"" ""Mul-ti-pass."" ""Think he's gonna be okay?"" ""Do-you-want-some-more?"" ""Aziz, lights!"" ""If you want something done, do it yourself!"" If those quotes don't bring a smile to your face, you've either never seen the movie or haven't seen it in a long time. Rent it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Almost perfect combo of scifi, action & comedy","Nothing is ever perfect, but this movie is about as close as you can get. Very original, fast-paced and entertaining story, covers a lot of ground, great special effects. They did an excellent job of creating a future world and alien species and technology. I have a few tiny issues with some of the more touchy feely parts, but those are truly no big deal. The Ruby Rod (Chris Tucker) character was at first time of watching pretty obnoxious, but now I truly feel like it was very prescient and accurate at how streaming personalities are trending, more and more outrageous.

Master class in creativity,"The Fifth Element shines in its execution. The story itself is riddled with clichés, tired and old as time itself and it doesn't make the least amount of sense. And yet it's a ton of fun to watch and feels brand new, because of the talents of its makers.It's a film that feels like a classic. It has that feel of uniqueness to it, like it knows exactly what it's doing, even if it's completely random. And sure, it uses the technique of throwing every single weird and random thing at the screen and watching what will stick. But the thing is, most of it does stick. Everything from the weird weapon designs to clothing to random little details like a yard long list of weapon proficiencies to the whole mythos of the fifth element.It's also features some real acting talent in Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman, both hamming it up to eleven, Oldman especially, and having the time of their lives. Milla Jovovich as Leeloo is not in their league, truth be told, but she plays a delightful oddball with suitable skill to convince and intrigue.The rest you really need to go and experience yourself. It's a thrilling, never-stopping ride of adventures, science fiction gizmos, unhinged humour, cool visuals and special effects, bizarre characters and even more bizarre circumstances and so much more. One of the most enjoyable scifi films ever made and well worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Fun, colourful, action-packed sci-fi","This science - fiction action - romance film uses incredibly innovative special effects, which make it a visual treat. It's totally watchable, with frequent landscape changes, comedy and action sequences, as well as appealing aliens, that all of the above make for a lighthearted pick for a popcorn-friendly movie night. Although not a masterpiece, it has lush set design, a nice soundtrack and decent performances from the leading trio, (Bruce Willis as the two-fisted cab driver Korben Dallas, Milla Jovovich and Gary Oldman), good direction which offers us thrilling enough battle sequences, the aura of classic adventures (like ""Indiana Jones"") and sci-fi films (sometimes seems like a mix of ""Alien"" and ""Star Wars"", not irritatingly though), and an underlying anti-war message near the end of the movie. It -briefly- raises moral issues as the worth of the human race, the power of love, which add a layer of sophistication to the motion picture, but above all succeeds as an entertaining, lighthearted and gleeful blockbuster, that delivers laughs and occasionally over-the-top action. It is recommended to everyone who needs an enjoyable 2-hour escape from reality and it could be ""used"" as an introduction to sci-fi comedy (obviously, it's not at all better than George Lucas's ""Star Wars""). A scene from this motion picture, though, will leave you wondering why female pleasure is acceptable in a film of this genre (which was rated PG-13), while it's considered offensive in a drama film like ""Boys Don't Cry"" from 1999, which was slapped with an NC-17 rating due to a scene of such nature and needed to be censored in order to ensure a more commercially lucrative rating.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A sorely misunderstood original and visually stunning romp,"Most critics approached the Fifth Element unable to understand exactly what the movie was trying to do. The Fifth Element is not the second-coming of Star Wars or something like Serenity, Blade Runner, etc.The Fifth Element instead is a tongue-in-cheek celebration of classic comic book science fiction that is done with class and finesse. The plot, the dialogue, the visuals, everything is done in a zany vein of both humor an style. The movie is equally adept at poking fun at the conventions of its subject matter while simultaneously appreciating it with the love of a 10-year old engrossed in a thrilling science fiction tale.In terms of visuals, Besson's flourishes are stunning and nigh-perfect in their matching the parodic/celebratory tone of the movie. The flashy colors, special effects, wonderfully performed action sequences, strange, indescribable moments of sheer wonder and overall bombast all combine well and fit the plot and dialogue like a glove.Most of all, the movie is just plain fun. The pacing is quick but not so quick as to make everything completely incoherent. The plot can be convoluded but once again this is a misunderstood element--the convolutions of the story are a deliberate play on the convolutions of classical sci-fi comic books and literature. Some might want to dispute me there, saying I'm giving the film too much credit, but Besson is not an idiotic director, and he didn't take transcribe the plot of a story he wrote in 10th grade just because he thought it would be a complicated tale of human triumph; he did it to be parodic, while never losing sight of the fun and color that makes sci-fi as enjoyable as it is.People will always say that 'The Fifth Element' is guilty of style over substance. I contend that the substance is there, it's merely that it is not the substance that those looking for the next uber-serious 'Blade Runner' want to praise. It is a substance as pulpy as can be, but like 'Pulp Fiction' it raises the 'low' art of such substance to the level of 'high' art. It's only problem is that most critics today aren't willing to accept this ""low-art-made-high"" and will discard any movie that embraces it as 'empty-headed.' But, then again, they don't get called 'snooty' for nothing.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unique Sci Fi eye & brain candy,"""The Fifth Element"" from 1997, is a thrilling and visually stunning sci-fi fantasy film that stands out for its bold creativity, unique storytelling, and unforgettable characters. Written and directed by Luc Besson, the film effortlessly oresents action, humor, and philosophical musings within a vibrant, colorful futuristic world. Milla Jovovich's portrayal of Leeloo, the mysterious ""fifth element,"" is a captivating mix of innocence, strength, and otherworldly grace, while Bruce Willis delivers a standout performance as Korben Dallas, the gruff but endearing hero. The film's world-building is an eye-candy feast, with its eclectic and imaginative set designs, from the neon-lit streets of a futuristic New York City to stunning alien landscapes. The brilliant costumes, including Jean-Paul Gaultier's iconic designs, add a layer of style and eccentricity that sets this movie apart from similar films. What truly elevates the film however, is its perfect blend of action and heart, with a story that combines a race against time to save the universe with deeper themes of love, sacrifice, and human connection. The dynamic between the quirky supporting characters, such as Chris Tucker's over-the-top Ruby Rhod, adds levity and charm, making the film as much fun as it is thought-provoking. A fine supporting cast also includes Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Luke Perry, and Sophia Goth. The pulsating, eclectic score by Eric Serra amplifies the surreal, high-energy atmosphere, creating a truly immersive experience. A little bit of everything, including some fine comic touches, made this an instant cult classic, and it still remains a unique and very entertaining ride from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A tight, fast paced romp","The Fifth Element is a light hearted Sci-Fi adventure featuring Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. Directed by Luc Besson, it takes us through a story that blends faith, comedy and lots of things blowing up. The plot is simple: evil has been kept at bay by a mysterious priesthood for centuries. Now, that evil force has returned and the world must be protected. Evil, however, has other plans; with the greedy interference of a self-centred entrepreneur (played by Gary Oldman), Evil manages to all but destroy humanities only hope. In response, humanity sends in retired soldier Bruce Willis. The rest of the movie involves Bruce seeking out the Five Elements that will destroy evil and the assorted troubles and misadventures that result. Moving quickly, cleverly and with brilliant cohesion under Besson's capable direction, The Fifth Element is a great and vastly underrated film.

Sick Flick,"OK, this is overdone, stuff, but visually very attractive (not only because of Milla Jovovich), plus the story is OK and there is a lot of action and also there are a few laughs.

I wonder why she got a razzie nomination, those people who vote for that are really stupid. If anyone should get it it is that president. Oldman was OK as the villain, but not too great.

"Science fiction, action and comedy with Bruce Willis and a young Milla Jovavich.","This film is a bit of a curiosity in terms of movies in the last twenty years or so. Why you ask? Because everything indicates that this movie should have been a rather big box office hit, and while it did rather good overall when you factor in the whole world, here in the United States it kind of had a lackluster showing. Makes no sense as it seems to be liked by a good many people and it had Bruce Willis at his best and introduced two relative newcomers to the screen in Milla Jovavich and Chris Tucker (though I believe Tucker was in ""Friday"" before this one). It also had really good special effects, especially in the city. So good in fact I often feel George Lucas really liked those city scenes as he seemed to add a place just like it in his second Star Wars movie ""Attack of the Clones"". The plot is pretty good, though it gets to be a bit much in areas as there are multiple bad guys here and there for our hero to overcome including time as the longer things go on the more likely it is for the Earth to be destroyed. Yes, an ordinary cabbie gets to be a hero, though he is an ex-soldier, as a young and mysterious girl comes crashing through the roof of his flying cab. On with some nice chases and such and a trip to a cruise ship in space for a bizarre operatic fight scene. The movie has a bunch of stuff going on though like I said at times to much as poor Gary Oldman's character just does not get enough screen time and he factors almost not at all in the final showdown. Still, overall this movie is a fun watch even though there is a lot going on and the ending was a tad anti-climatic.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Multipass!""","FILM: 7.5
On my recent rewatch of The Fifth Element, it's clear that Luc Besson took a delightful detour from his usual serious fare and dove headfirst into the wacky world of sci-fi - and boy, does it pay off. This film is a wild ride where nothing is off-limits, from overstated performances to cheesy dialogue and over-the-top visuals.Bruce Willis may not be stretching his acting chops to the limit here, but it's evident that he's enjoying himself in the role. As the film's protagonist, he brings a sense of laid-back charm that fits perfectly with the absurdity of the plot.Milla Jovovich shines in her challenging role as Leeloo, managing to convey the character's complexity without veering into annoyance territory. She brings a captivating energy to the screen that keeps you invested in her journey.But the real scene-stealers are Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker, who fully embrace the film's over-the-top nature and deliver performances that are as entertaining as they are eccentric. Oldman's villainous Zorg and Tucker's flamboyant Ruby Rhod inject a healthy dose of charisma and comedy into the mix, making every scene they're in a joy to watch.While The Fifth Element may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's undeniably a fun and visually stunning sci-fi romp that doesn't take itself too seriously. Sure, it has its flaws - the plot can be a bit convoluted at times, and some of the CGI hasn't aged well - but these minor quibbles are easily overlooked in the grand scheme of things.Overall, The Fifth Element is a quirky and enjoyable film that's worth revisiting for its sheer entertainment value.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

Science Fiction at its most satisfying,"The Fifth Element shows that a bond between comedy and serious dramatic science fiction can work miracles, as can a marriage of action and comedy (as shown by the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie 'True Lies'). The Fifth Element is witty, smooth and impressive all at the same time.The film's wide array of characters colour the science fiction adventure with some stereotypes, but also some genuinely interesting characters who turn the film into a comic-book type affair which is only enhanced by the scenes of multiple events occurring simultaneously.Despite the fact that costumes, sets and CGI work in a balanced union the film still does suffer from an occasional rigidness in some of its spliced editing, especially during the beginning. As the film goes on, however, this works in the films favour.Luc Besson shows what comes of a standard sci-fi action-flick once you add a hint of character and colour.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This one, despite getting an ""A"" for effort, just doesn't make the cut.  The direction is too frenetic and frantic. The director seemed afraid to take his time and establish a rhythm.

Lee Loo (played by Milla Jovovich) is the fifth element, the supreme being who was designed as a weapon against the dark shadow. Every five thousand years there is a battle between Lee Loo and the dark shadow over mankind. The dark shadow wants to kill all humans, and Lee Loo saves them form his destruction.The guardians of the fifth element are being Lee Loo to earth to protect it for the dark shadow, when all of a sudden they are attacked, and the ship is destroyed. They believe they have killed Lee Loo and the Dark Shadow can prevail in killing the humans, but she survived through a single living limb. Scientist reconstructs her body, and she escapes the lab. Only to land in Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) cab. Korben Dalls helps Lee Loo find her way to the priest (Ian Holm). Together, all three set out on an adventure to save the world.The central theme of ""The Fifth Element"" surrounds the truth of human nature. Lee Loo is referred to several times in the movie as being ""perfect"" As if the existing mankind that is alive today is unless than being perfect. That only a perfect specimen is worthy of saved all mankind. Lee Loo can also be looked at as a symbolic metaphor. When it is time for Lee Loo to active the weapon and obliterates the dark shadow, she mentions to Korben that she was only built to save the world. She is reluctant though because all mankind does is destroy each other. Korben reassures her that there are things worth saving like love, and tells Lee Loo he loves her. When the stones are opened by all the basic elements (Fire, water, earth, and wind), she unleashes a white light from her mouth to freeze the dark shadow. At this point Lee Loo becomes a visual metaphor as a beacon of light; that there is good in the world. Love conquers all and will defeat any evil.Many motifs play throughout the film for saving mankind, and the destruction of the human race. In one scene we see Lee Loo watching how mankind kills each other through a series of war clips see saw on the internet. She begins to become very emotional, and loses hope to save the world. This parallel coincidence was similar to clips in the movie Prometheus. We as humans are so quick to ask for help when we need it, but we also need help from ourselves with all of the self-destruction we inflict on each other. We can save the world by saving it from war on one another.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A feast for the eyes and ears,"Luc Besson's Fifth Element is definitely a feast for the eyes and ears. Whether it has to do with the wonderfully 'sloppy' sci-fi (not so shiningly perfect as US productions like Star Trek), the tongue-in-cheek humor (Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker at their best), Jean-Paul Gaultier's hilarious costumes (the policemen...) or the relaxed acting - every time one sees the movie new aspects come alive.The basic storyline - good vs. evil where a pretty couple try to save all - is treated as a given by Besson & Co., while the setting, music and imagery get all the attention they deserve. The spine-chilling opera/dance sequence in the middle of the film is just 'one of those' surprises in the movie.Bruce Willis adds another excellent title to his palmares - together with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"" - and makes good for his horrible action flicks. And of course watch out for Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, who has a memorable pronounciation of the word ""multipass'...Besides all of this, there is a quote which should be in the top-10 of movie history's all-time favorites (like ""I'll be back"" or ""Here's looking at you, kid""):""Are you German?""",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An excellent mix of comedy, action and romance!","Milla does a great job as the sweet, unexperienced Leeloo, and Bruce (as most of the time) runs his own race as the disillusioned and only ""normal"" person in the world, someone to identify yourself with in a scenario as bizarre as this. I can understand why some people dislike the ""how-future-will-become-vision"" of The Fifth Element, when seeing it as non-realistic sci-fi, but i think the creators parodic touch in this movie is excellent; the exaggeration of the city itself, zorgs management, ruby, the paradise planet, etc. I gave it 10/10, its like sweets for both my heart and soul in the average gray weekday.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci-Fi Extravaganza! ...by Luc Besson,"""The Fifth Element"" has always been one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies, and I reckon the same goes for many people in my age category. You can somewhat refer to it as the ""Star Wars"" for kids growing up in the 1990's, what with its imaginatively flamboyant & colorful characters, set-pieces, costumes, special effects, etc...If you analyze the film in detail, you can only conclude it's preposterous and totally senseless! A giant fireball from outer space that is considered the Ultimate Evil, friendly aliens shaped like oversized steel armadillos, Willis as a starfighter turned cabdriver, a feisty redhead girl as the savior of the universe, Oldman as a sort of futuristic Adolf Hitler with the little mustache below the lips instead of above, a blue intergalactic opera singer hiding stones in her stomach, and Tom ""Tiny"" Lister Jr. Cast as the President?! Writer/director Luc Besson simply must have been taking seriously wicked drugs at the time!Logic, structure, plausibility, ... it doesn't matter. Entertainment does! ""The Fifth Element"" has plenty of entertainment and plain old-fashioned fun to offer in all departments, with as highlights the costume designs of Jean-Paul Gauthier, and the little gimmicks about life in the 23rd century. For instance, we'll still have McDonald's and cigarettes (although it's ¾ filter)",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bruce saved the world,"The first time I watched this movie was on pay per view. I had no idea what it was about, I just thought, what the hell. I had nothing better to do. After I saw it I called my girlfriend and I couldn't stop talking about it. Sometimes its better to watch a movie you know nothing about because most movies just don't live up to the hype. This movie is your basic save the world/love story. This movie has tons of action, some comedy, and great visuals. I am a Bruce Willis fan and he does not disappoint in this. Milla Jovovich is great in this movie. For someone who does not have much dialog, you always feel like she is always communicating with you. Is their a better bad guy than Gary Oldman? Maybe Walken, but Oldman makes a case for himself in this film. Who is Luc Besson? I never heard of him before until I watched this movie. After this I researched him a little and found that he has many other good films that I have checked out since. I'm not a fan of fantasy movies, but this is more than just fantasy.

Awful 1 out of 10,"I know that there are many who love this movie. My view is that it is one of the worst movies ever made. To be fair, the visual effects are stunning and the soundtrack is quite interesting. However, the point of movies, after all, is to tell stories. The story in this is more contrived that even most science fiction or fantasy. During the entire movie, I did not care what happened, I did not care about the characters and I did not particularly care if I got to the end. The only reason I finished it was it was a movie link download and I wanted to see if I was missing something. Oh yes, there were lots of predicable boring explosions and lots of high tech gun fights. Bruce Willis was OK, Gary Olman was camp. Its not really worth it to bother with the rest.

Awful beyond belief...a new benchmark for bad filmmaking,"The truest expression of what Ed Wood would've done with a big budget. There are so many lapses in logic and so many plot holes that the film borders on the incomprehensible at times. Anyone else notice the third group of aliens in the big climactic firefight, y'know, the ones that never appeared before or after? Or, where did the big mechanical duck alien trapped in the tomb go--that is, where was his body when Bruce & Co. show up? If Milla Jovovich was such a perfect specimen of humanity, how come she gets her butt kicked not once but TWICE by aliens, once completely obliterated when her spaceship is blown up (besides, with 300 years head start technologically, you'd think the mechanical ducks would be able to avoid having their ships destroyed so easily) and again when she evokes Bruce Lee, gets her butt promptly kicked, and spends the rest of the film doing her impression of Sharon Stone on painkillers in Casino so Bruce has to carry her around. How were they supposed to get the necessary item from the Big Blue Diva (suppose circumstances had been more pleasant?)? Other ludicrousness: Gary Oldman's hair and accent, not to mention having the Evil Planet on his speed-dial; way too much stuttering; what was that stuff on Gary Oldman's forehead (if blood, where was the wound?)?; the duck aliens taking away the artifact because WE couldn't take care of it...and the list is endless...

Creativity like no other film,"Anyone expecting Star Wars or Star Trek from ""The Fifth Element"" is wrong. This movie is different from the franchises in so many ways. The movie tells such an important and exciting story for the world with a lightness that is incredibly fun without neglecting serious moments. The uniquely drawn future and the special soundtrack make the world seem so different but also so real. There are no lengths and every cut is perfectly placed in my eyes. Despite the fact that the movie is a bit older, the pictures it shows are fascinating. What you can criticize in my eyes is that the characters don't get any real depth and have no character development, which doesn't bother me because the movie gets by without it. But the characters are insanely fun, which is why Bruce Willis gives one of my favorite performances of him here. Sometimes the movie makes it too easy for me and solves a plot too simply. That's why I would have liked the movie to be a bit longer and maybe expand the ending a bit without losing it's charm. Despite everything, I think the movie is a creative masterpiece. I would watch it again any time.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not the most amazing sci-fi adventure, but certainly fun enough to keep one's eyes on the screen","This is a popular sci-fi blockbuster from 1997, but I was a few months shy of eleven years old at the time of its release, and was totally unaware of its existence until several years later. I saw some of it at least twice during my high school years, but the first time I saw the entire film was in 2005 (shortly after finishing high school), and from what I remember, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I didn't exactly think it was bad, but it certainly didn't meet my expectations. After over four years, I finally watched it from start to finish a second time, and as I had hoped, it was definitely better this time. There were some things I couldn't remember from my first viewing, especially towards the end, but as well as being better, my second viewing was also more memorable.Every five thousand years, a great evil comes and threatens all life in the Universe! Four stones (representing fire, air, water, and earth) and a living being known as the Fifth Element together make the only weapon that can stop it! In 1914, three hundred years before this great evil is to return, an extraterrestrial group called the Mondoshawan come to Earth to take the Elements from an ancient tomb in Egypt and keep them safe. Three hundred years later, in an era of flying cars, the Mondoshawan attempt to return to Earth, but are killed by evil aliens called Mangalores! Scientists find a portion of the Fifth Element in the remains of the Mondoshawan ship, and use a machine to recreate it. It comes to life in the form of a human female named Leeloo, who escapes from the laboratory and falls into the backseat of a taxi driven by Korben Dallas, a former military man. He takes her to a priest named Father Vito Cornelius, who knows just who/what she is after he sees the mark on her arm! The priest is searching for the other four elements, but so is the evil Zorg, who has different plans for them!I may not have found this movie very suspenseful the first time I watched it all, but the same cannot be said about the second time. I found a lot of it suspenseful this time, with all the action, starting during the opening sequence, set in 1914 Egypt, and continuing for much of the rest of the film, set in the 23rd century. To add to the quality of ""The Fifth Element"", there are good performances here from Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, etc. The film also has some humour, sometimes funny and sometimes not so much. The ""bada boom"" part is pretty annoying, and Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod isn't a very good comic relief. I may not have found him nearly as annoying as some people probably have, but his antics can be pretty lame. However, there is some good humour, with Zorg (Oldman's character, a better comic relief), Korben hiding military personnel in his fridge, etc. I tend to really like the visuals in these modern sci-fi blockbusters, with the sets and special effects, and the visuals here are no exception. Finally, towards the end, there are some fairly moving scenes.This is not a film I've ever been able to describe as a masterpiece, but after watching it twice, I think it deserves a lot of praise. I'm not sure why I wasn't that impressed the first time. Maybe I wasn't exactly in the right mood, or maybe I had to see it again in order to understand its popularity. Well, whatever the reason was, it definitely improved with a second viewing, as some movies do, and I think I now understand why it's so popular, even if I don't like it as much as many others clearly do. Sure, some of the humour doesn't work (some Chris Tucker gags included), the romance between Korben and Leeloo is sometimes a little cheesy, and those may not be the only two flaws, but apart from that, there's not much I can criticize ""The Fifth Element"" for. If you like a good sci-fi adventure, many would obviously agree that this one is worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Outrageous sci-fi perfection,"Reviewed by Filmmining 101:Words will never be enough to describe in accuracy the lunacy of Luc Besson's extravagant action flick. ""The Fifth Element"" remains one of the most dazzling and original examples of outrageous science fiction, a bold artistic gamble that paid off which two and something decades later has aged quite well.Sporting a blonde Bruce Willis and some of the most ridiculous (and unpractical) costumes you will ever see, Besson's creation (owning much to French pioneering novels like ""Valerian"" and the works of Moebius), brings to the big screen a tonally and visually polar opposite future than that of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" (1982). Despite its restrictive (and quite atmospheric) prologue, once we reach 2263 (!), the French auteur put the pedal to the metal unleashing an orgy of color, music and sound (at some point, he even incorporates slapstick effects) with manic energy and Looney Tunes comedy.Yet, all these elements which could have led to a magnificent disaster across a thinly sketched plot, work together to deliver a wonderful inter-planetary adventure boasting a pseudo exploration of religious and technological themes that barely make it through the barrage of the film's flamboyant style. But you are not here to contemplate the existence of life but rather to take (excessive) pleasure from the on screen silliness. The 23rd century is as psychedelic and fluid as a Jim Morrison poem from the 1960s: aliens, priests, scientists, the army, space disc jockeys, dodgy physics and of course, the ultimate evil (and good) converge within gorgeously designed landscapes that since their onset in 1997, have become iconic.The most expensive production at the time of its release, its $90 million dollar budget allows ""The Fifth Element"" to present a vibrant and wacky futuristic world that excels in all forms of (good and bad) fashion. The spectacular production design (which has predicted most of our technology now) is complemented by the outrageous costumes of Jean-Paul Gaultier. This cinematic canvas of gleeful creativity offers in every shot the opportunity of seeing something original and unique even if it occasionally reaches a level of camp and could bother those who despite colorful palettes.The cast is clearly having a ball, all playing in different acting rhythms: Willis and Gary Oldman face the absurdity wearing a straight face, Ian Holm seems delighted to be there, Chris Tucker steals the show as an over exaggerated gay stereotype (who is straight!) while Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, the bright orange haired supreme being capable of ass-kickery, sweetness and naivety, her stunning looks and outfit have become synonymous with the (look of the) film.Despite a rather long running time, this love it or hate it French movie never feels too long due to a large variety of set pieces ranging from rap and space opera performances (!) to shoot outs, flying car chases and intriguing monologues about the usefulness of chaos amidst genre bending execution and gleeful joy. It demonstrates Besson's ability to adapt in different territories successfully and bringing forward an alternative voice on the mainstream cinema that was dominated by US productions. Frequent collaborator Eric Serra offers an equally scattered score, a compilation of techno opera, saxophone, middle eastern, reggae and electronic cues (among others) without a particular thematic cohesion because that is the way Besson wants it.This take it or leave it attitude puts ""The Fifth Element"" in the pantheon of classic fiction films. It might alienate those who seek deep and thought provoking ideas but not everything has to be made for gloomy discussion and analysis. It's visually distinct style and Jack Sparrow behaviour towards the execution of the genre's ideas is enough to propel this into cinema's most representative films. If all the above are not achievement worthy of praise, then what is?",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A big disappointment,Luc Besson had made some great films Leon being one the best film made. However what has happened to his directing skills on the 5th element.  The story is based in the future where only the 5th element can save the world from Evil forces destroying life. This has happens every five thousand years.  The film its self has some great special effects and the story line gets you're interested.  However the sad thing is Luc Besson insists on making the 5th element an action comedy which just does not work.  Chris Tucker who plays the DJ just spoils the film for me and the whole result is a waste of time.  If only Luc Besson based the project on a seriously format it could have been a classic but chose to do the old style of trying to make this film more of a action comedy  which just does not work.,,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not really my style, but well done enough, and funny and clever!","This movie reminded me a lot of the Total Recall movie from earlier in the 1990s which I didn't enjoy that much, however Bruce Willis's presence on the screen is always very likable and awesome and can always get you into a movie. While Chris Tucker and many other things were a bit over the top, I appreciated a lot of the humor and thought that the story/mythology was clever. The sci fi action was done quite well in many scenes too. Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lister Jr., Lee Evans, and Brion James were all noteworthy cast members as well, as they are in everything.

The theater experience...,"There is nothing about The Fifth Element I can say, that hasn't been said already.

Some friends and I went to see it here in the Los Angeles area on a 70mm screen, and in full surround sound. It is one of the older and larger 70mm screens... the theater seats easily 1500 people or more.During Leeloo's resurrection scene, you could hear a pin drop the audience was so quiet. Then as the resurrection was complete and you see the unveiling as a beautiful human woman... you could hear a collective GASP from every guy in the theater!Only a second later you could hear a collective thump of every woman in the theater smacking their husbands/boyfriends/etc.!!!That is one of those film-going experiences that comes only once in a very great while. :P",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome movie!,"Mystic mumbo jumbo in the 23 century...The Fifth Element is just that. The age old battle of Good and Evil is played out once again, this time to the tune of hovercraft, light-speed travel, and aliens. And the only thing stopping Earth from being consumed by destruction is Milla Jonovich and 4 old rocks. Sounds like we're in trouble, huh? Watch the seen where Leeloo (Milla) takes on a small army of baddies and wins, and you'll agree it's a good thing she's on our side.And of course Bruce Willis is there too, blowing things up and gunning down the baddies like only he can. In true Willis style, he snaps wisecracks left and right and also has the perfect line. Only Willis can shoot an alien in the head and crack a joke three seconds later. Chris Tucker also comes on board as a Radio DJ in a skin-tight leopard print bodysuit. The ladies in the film call Tucker's character 'Ruby Rhod' sexy and talented. Korben (Bruce Willis) holds him by the throat and tells him to keep his trap shut and leave him alone. Odds are that anyone who sees Tucker in this movie won't blame him. Surprisingly, even Tucker does his part to save the world. Although afterwards he whines and complains about it.Guiding Korben is an old priest and his apprentice. The priest wants to save the world. To do it, he stows away on a ship, knocks out Bruce Willis, and pretty much tells off the President (of Earth, not just the U.S.). This guy isn't your typical Sunday pastor! Also in the run for life are the President and the army. The President almost cries at the end, and the head of the army gets trapped in a freezer and frozen. Makes you wonder how they ever got into power...Opposing the Good are the Bad and the Ugly: Unlike many other movies, this one doesn't go overboard by featuring aliens left and right. But the Mangalores are fun, pig-like aliens that, like all good villains, are greedy, noisy, violent, and just far too easy to poke fun at. What's a movie without the incompetent henchmen? And Gary Oldman plays the part of Zorg, the cunning, intelligent and evil business man that doesn't realize he's helping to doom mankind. Hm, maybe he isn't that intelligent after all. Putting aside that tiny little flaw, Zorg carries a big gun, loves flamethrowers, and kills anyone who dares stand in his way- including his own employees. What more could you ask for in an evil villain? An outlandish costume? Zorg has it! Don't ask why he wears a piece of plastic that covers half his head, no one knows. But it looks silly, and actually fits in with Zorg's metallic green and orange get-up, so you'll get over it fairly fast. Or burst out laughing, one of the two.Overall, this movie is just plain fun! The villain's constant failures break him down to tears at one point, there's a giant fireball set to consume Earth, and every time we see Bruce Willis with a gun, it's a sure thing someone's gonna get shot. Ancient rituals, a perfect being, Bruce Willis and an all-you-can-kill buffet of explosions, gunfire and general mayhem.

Having fun with the sci-fi genre,"From the ecstatic mind of artistic visionary Luc Besson comes one of the most colorful and exciting science fiction adventures ever. The Fifth Element takes place 250 years in the future when humanity is threatened by the arrival of pure evil. The only way to stop this oncoming threat is by harnessing the power of four stones, each representing one of the four elements, through the fifth element which is in the form of a human being named Leeloo, who is played by Milla Jovovich in her breakthrough starring role. Bruce Willis plays Corbin Dallas, the cab driver who through being in the wrong place at the wrong time (or right place at the right time depending on how you look at it), meets Leeloo and must then protect her against those trying to prevent her from stopping evil. These opposing forces are led by the always incredible and over-the-top Gary Oldman. If everything else about this movie sucked, Oldman's incredible performance would still make it worth the watch. The whole film is a wildly fun ride that takes us to a futuristic world full of such vibrancy and adventure that allows us to set aside everything we know as reality, and escape into a whole new and exciting world. And that's what movies should be, right? Not only does The Fifth Element make a good fun escape film, it's simply just a well made film altogether. The story itself doesn't break new boundaries of storytelling, but it is prevalent, focused, and fun. There is however, an excellently weaved in use of comedy on the sci-fi backdrop. There are many elements of this film that are intelligently and appropriately over exaggerated for an effective blend of comedy and drama. Nothing is too overdone, or hammed up, or forced. Some of the dialouge itself might not be perfect, but everything works together very well, and all elements of the film compliment each other nicely. It's easy for a blending of genres to go horribly wrong, but The Fifth Element gets it just right, and a lot of this is due to great characters. The casting choices for this film were nothing short of excellent. I already emphasized it before, but I could not take my eyes off the screen while Gary Oldman was on it.Where The Fifth Element excels the most, however, would be its visuals. There are fantastic backdrops in this film with some great art direction that never leaves you feeling cheated out of seeing some sci-fi goodness. You get to see the facade of some wicked looking buildings, and then are also treated to the bizarre artsy contemporary sci-fi architecture on the inside. What makes this film the most artistically memorable would definitely be the colors. Instead of dwelling on the dark greys and blues that we commonly see in these futuristic urban settings, we have bright vibrant colors that flash, blink, and whir all around us in this fast paced world. But of course in such a beautifully designed world, we have to have a great director to show us this world in all its glory. And The Fifth Element has just the person to achieve this task, and it is Luc Besson. Besson's directing truly does bring this film to life. This is sort of a ""no duh"" statement but if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean. The man can shoot an action sequence like no other, and this film has no shortage of action. There are plenty of memorable scenes ranging from high above the ground in flying cars, to an opera house full of aliens (and a Prince clone). Besson can direct these electrifying scenes with such precise editing ability that you don't miss a thing, only sucking you into the action of this film even more. And as an added note I would have to say that The Fifth Element has one of the neatest portrayals of the flying car I have ever seen.It's fun, it's fast paced, it's bright, it's vivid, and it's incredibly well made. Why wouldn't you see The Fifth Element? This is definitely one of those films that is hard not to enjoy. From start to finish it's an exciting sci-fi adventure that grabs hold of mind and never lets go until the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Stunning Film.,"The Fifth Element, is a beautiful movie produced by the French director Luc Besson, featuring Milla Jovovich (Leeloo) and Bruce Willis (Korban Dallas). This film is possibly my most favoured, incorporating strange musical melodies such as tech-no;opera combined and an unusual, colourful atmosphere. Endevoured with unusual creatures and characters such as Zorg, his minions and plavalaguna ,they don't follow traditional appearances of aliens and personalities making it different. This film was considered to have the highest budget of its time in 1997, with 80 million spent, and more than 250 million earned. I'm not a particular fan of Sci-Fi movies, but this is one of a kind and my favourite and will remain so to me.

Very fun and uplifting movie Great for all ages,"While it has been nearly a score since I saw this movie for the first time but I believe the feelings remained the same. Very exciting and captivating. My main thing is I see an actor instead of the movie character I'm going to be upset. But every single cast member delivers hilariously and perfectly. Its definitely a great watch with a ton of rewatchability.Bruce Willis delivers as a scruffy no luck having retired veteran who is now driving a cab.Chris Tucker personality dazzles as his over the top character provides genuine and hearty laugh out loud moments.Cute story, plenty of action, drama, and suspense. If you haven't seen this movie please treat yourself on a random day or night. You will not be disappointed by the entertainment value.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Masterpiece,"Unique does not even begin to describe this sci-fi, action, drama, comedy. It is a fun film, keeps your attention to the end with a fast pace. Excellent cast. Gary Oldman should have received an Oscar for this one as the main antagonist. But acting was great by everyone, and i mean everyone, Chris Tucker really went all out, and Bruce Willis played his role perfectly. Considering when this was made, the production was fantastic. The religious element was a refreshing aspect with the Priest character and the 5th Element in the script (our creation entity is real) and the reference to 5000 years of earth history. More than enough action to qualify as an action film, particularly once they get on the cruise ship in the final chapter of the film. You have to go along for the ride in this one to enjoy it, amazing futuristic fantasy with even a few other worldly creatures (i loved the opera singer character, the vocals were phenomenal). The costumes were amazing, from the police uniforms to the flight attendants to the Mangalores. The comedic moments worked as intended. Kim Chan had a brief scene, he is made for movies. Luc Besson's masterpiece. I use that term for a movie i would not mind watching 50 times in my lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Where did he learn to negotiate like that?""","In the distant future, a dark force is approaching the Earth in order to destroy all life. The four stones which represent the four elements in combination with the perfect human being as the fifth element are the only defense of mankind against destruction. (I wonder how women look like in 300 years distant future if Milla Jovovich represents perfection...) The army, an order of priests, an alien race of warriors and some criminals, all trying to be the first to get hold of the five elements.The story combines SF, action, drama, romance, and comedy, in a way that is at times totally ridiculous, but this film should not be taken seriously, because its sole goal is to entertain and it does it more than well. Technically it is top-notch and at that time it was the most expensive film made outside Hollywood. The cast, besides Milla Jovovich, includes many well-known faces, such as Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Luke Perry, and Brion James, and although their performances are not Oscar material, the characters are diverse, original and very entertaining, and for this type of film, they are just right. The directing is great, there are some excellent cadres, and the special effects are amazing for that time. There are also aria unachievable for the human voice, performed by a singer whose name is in the Serbian language, the biggest explosion ever recorded indoors, the language invented especially for this film, creations by Jean-Paul Gautier and a multitude of ingenious details. Interestingly, Luc Besson began to write this script in the age of sixteen, but managed to finally film it twenty-two years later.8,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,"Our listings magazine gave this 4 stars out of a possible 5.... way too generous! Maybe 2... 3 or 4 on the IMDb scale Excellent design and costumes, good action sequences, but otherwise poor. Plot holes galore, and, if you are going to do Science Fiction, why not get your 'tech-sounding' chat right??? The temperatures have already been referred to, but there is also a mention of 'thermonuclear sensing'... what??? at least Star Trek makes stuff sound genuinely realistic. I think the poor soundtrack (at least as broadcast on UK TV last night) makes it hard to pick out much of what people say -- but then we'd be able to spot more holes and inaccuracies all over the place. A sloppy mishmash of 'Indiana Jones', Erich von Daniken, 'Die Hard' and sub-Star Wars",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
brilliant,"this movie is so perfectly over-the-top. the visuals are absolutely stunning, the music is exactly what i'd hope to hear in a dazzling techno-future, the script is both funny and extremely clever... but the part that really surprised me was the... editing? i don't think i've ever actually tried to pay attention to the editing of a film, and if i catch myself doing it, it's usually a bad sign. i enjoy watching the film and noting how they tie the scenes together with sly little hints here and there. i appreciate the diva's performance scene, as it cuts between the opera hall and her suite in the hotel, both with the imagery and music/dialogue. the way these hints are placed is very well done, never cheapening the next scene.let me also note that the characters these actors developed are marvelous. i know that some people dislike Chris Tucker's ""ruby rhod"", but what would you expect from a radio personality in the 23rd century? of COURSE it's going to be intense. and it's not just the main characters. i mean, Bruce Willis does his standard action hero wise-guy that you'd expect, which is a good thing. Milla Jovovich is fantastic, with her fluent ""divine language"" and smokin' hotness. Gary Oldman, ever the chameleon, plays a great villain even if i still can't figure out WHY his character is trying to antagonize the heroes. but the smaller role players practically steal the show. the priest and his assistant are hilarious, the Chinese food guy is funny, but the best performance by anyone in the whole flick is the mugger at korben's (Willis') apartment. it's one of those quick scenes that's memorable enough to become a great inside-joke type voicemail i can leave for any of my friends to make sure they laugh when they hear it.it's a must see. buy it or just never return it to netflix.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Comments mostly on acting,"Gary Oldman steals the show as the evil Zorg, and gives new life to an old saying: If you want something done, do it yourself. Jovovich shows that she has an acting talent(not just a pretty face), when she shows vulnerability as well as toughness in a convincing way. Bruce Willis shows himself as his more or less usual character, but in this movie it works. And the story is indeed remarkably good. It has the spices of a little ""fantasy-history"", a superhero which for once is a woman and the always money making end of the earth. But it is rarely well sewn together. As one might fear in an event like this, the authorities tries to take the show to the extent that it nearly causes disaster. very well acting on all parts, and a story for all lovers of fantasy or sci-fi. A movie I can watch over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
As usually .. Besson=masterpiece,"Besson´s previous flics, like Leon, Nikita or Atlantis were awesome and so is his newest piece 5 Element...I even think its his best movie. The universe Besson shows is breathtaking, even more than the one showed in Blade Runner. Milla Jovovich did a really great job. Gary Oldman is as great as in Leon. Bruce Willis managed to portrait an interesting character, so he did a good job as well (though nothing can beat his James Cole in 12 Monkeys). The visuals are marvelous...Gaultier´s costumes , Serra´s music...all of those things make this movie awesome...I read that this is a ""SCI-FI MOVIE OF THE DECADE"" ....I have to agree with that",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Big Badaboom!""","There is absolutely no one else in the world that could have played Korben Dallas. Not only is Bruce perfect in the role, but he is also very sexy too.
Mila is fantastic as well, how she speaks in what I assume is a completely made up language and still manages to show pain and emotion is superb.
In fact, every single actor does brilliantly in this film. Even as the irritating character of Ruby Rhod, you can appreciate Chris Rock for his acting.
Ian Holm and Gary Oldman deserve a mention too, they're just outstanding, but none of the actors are just background or supporting, every one of them has their own unique character and contributes to what makes this so good.
Luc Besson should be very proud of what he's achieved.A fantastic story, edited and directed with aplomb. The sets, props, make up and costumes are all fantastic too and although it's quite extreme, it's still all very believable, especially considering how much our world has changed in the 24 years since the film was made, and not for the better. It's easy to see a future that could turn out similarly to the less desirable elements of the one shown here.I actually think that the rubber masks and old school make up processes give a better look for films than a lot of the CGI characters we get today. There's something more imposing, more solid about them.The opera part of this film should go down in history as one of the greatest film scenes of all time. I must find it to add to my music library.The whole film is quick and witty and just explodes off of the screen to keep you entertained without dragging it out.I find it highly unlikely that this film will ever leave my top 100 films.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
True Classic IMO,"I love everything about this film. I like the look, the story,the pace, the action and the seamless ability all of the actors had in telling this story. It is made in such a way that it's a believable place,time and people. All the characters are three dimensional. Even the guy that Korben compliments on his hat choice is believable. I wanna go eat at that McDonald's. I wanna get some soup from that little oriental guy that offers to buy Korben his lunch. If I were to get a little teeny tiny bit picky, my only trouble was with the clothes. I don't think I would be able to pull off any of their outfits. Gosh, I even found Luke Perry interesting in this! And I don't much like Mr. Perry.

the worst Besson's movie,"After seeing ""The 5th element"" I felt like I had entered into the twilight zone. Indeed, a lot of people liked this movie (see the IMDB ratings), which I can 't understand at all ! It seemed I didn't see the same movie ! The plot is made for less than 4 years old kids, especially in the very end. If you know something about cinema and want to see a good Besson's film, then rent the ""Leon"" video !This one can't be compared to ""The 5th Element "" my opinion: 1/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The One Movie,"I lost count of how many times I have seen this movie since it was released in 1997. I watch this movie at least 5 times per year and I still don't get tire of it...I believe I never will. I have the DVD and the Soundtrack, which I listen to even more frequently than watch the movie. It's like I felt in love with this movie, of course exaggerating things. It is so perfectly done and I would say that is just as perfect as Leeloo (Milla Jovovich)is, the Fifth element itself. It is the colors, the situations, the picture, the amazing future that Luc Besson made up for us to see, the music (Eric Serra), the sounds, everything. It's like a dream (and I really mean a dream of those we have once in a while and makes us think we a going crazy) come true. It's like one of those works of art that will always have a place in a famous museum. At least that is was it comes to my mind when I think about The Fifth Element, and I know some of this days I'll find my self watching it again. Note: There is always something similar in Luc Besson's female characters, if you see some of his other movies you will know what I'm talking about. He makes all of his female characters appear to be wild regarding to their feelings, they are all very full of emotions, seems like they always feel twice as we do and that is really attractive.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
okay....,"i myself liked it, and if you're going to criticize something, maybe you should actually explain why you hated something, instead of just saying ""I hated it"".

How old are you, anyway? You must be old, not to be able to appreciate the movie for it's action and fun. Oh well, I'm done talking to you, whoever you are.

It's Elemental,"This movie was slated by the critics, why? Agreed it is not the greatest film in history, but it is still pretty good. The look into Willis' character is interesting to say the least, and has much more depth than any of the other gung ho people he has played. Gary Oldman is as usual brilliant as the films anti hero , no other actor can come close to his simplistic evil that oozes out of him in his films.

This movie was ruined by Chris Tucker!,"This movie could have been pretty good if Chris Tucker had been left out of it! For some unknown reason Chris Tucker was inserted into the movie as an extremely annoying and whining radio personality who follows the hero of the movie around for a very lengthy portion of the movie. Not only is Chris Tucker not funny but he is so loud and irritating that he actually kept me from enjoying the movie every time he screamed his ridiculously bad lines. If Chris Tucker had been in the movie just briefly then the movie might have survived his terrible performance.

"I sat down thinking this movie was a sci-fi drama, and rise up feeling acquainted with the sci-fi parody","Luc Besson is truly a very talented man. Even though he has some very high quality movies that contain drama, my mood towards the movie changed as soon as I saw his name in the credits because I knew him from the Wasabi and Taxi series. And the man did it again. The film surpasses most of today's sci-fi works with its comedic parts that are not disturbing at all, but well-placed, with stage designs that I think were made with a lot of effort and love, and with Bruce Willis' charismatic acting. Even those who have not watched this movie have heard of the famous diva scene and have come across its music somewhere. The scene really lives up to any expectation.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My favorite movie,"The 5th Element is my favorite movie of all time. There is not one aspect of the movie that I don't like. Every detail of the movie has been carefully constructed to form the most fun and entertaining movie possible. I understand that this movie is not The Godfather and does not embody some of the values that those who deem themselves movie critics appreciate. However, a lot of hard, smart, dedicated work went into this movie and I do not think that it gets the credit it deserves. Look at the trivia section that IMDb provides for a sampling of the detail that went into this movie. It has a great plot, especially considering that all of the action takes place in one day. The soundtrack is amazing, the characters are great. And how cool is it that throughout the entire movie, the bad guy (Zorg) and the hero (Korben Dallas) never meet? And the movie was edited in an amazing way. I have seen thousands of movies from every genre and have a favorite movies list from here to Timbuktu, and The 5th Element is at the top of my list.

Unbelievable,"Good Lord!

Gary Oldman who has some pointless, camp South American accent, overacts his way from one dreadful scene to the next.The only thing that Luc Besson has successfully done is to show, with a painful, two hour blow, that a big budget certainly does not ensure a decent film.Awful from start to finish.

Later the film 'Long Kiss Goodnight'overtook this role (together with Geena Davis other films like 'Cutthroat Island'). Movies that have made a great memory in my life.But they are all in the past.

A Sci-Fi Masterpiece Full of Heart and Imagination,"The Fifth Element, directed by Luc Besson, is a thrilling, visually stunning adventure that redefines the sci-fi genre with its boundless creativity and charm. From its vibrant world-building to its unforgettable characters, this 1997 classic remains an exhilarating ride that captivates audiences with every rewatch.A Unique and Engaging Story
At its core, The Fifth Element is a tale about love, courage, and the eternal fight between good and evil. The story follows Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a down-on-his-luck cab driver thrust into the role of a reluctant hero when Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), the mysterious and otherworldly ""fifth element,"" literally falls into his life. Together, they must prevent an ancient force of destruction from annihilating humanity. The plot is straightforward but brimming with unexpected humor, heartfelt moments, and exhilarating twists, keeping viewers thoroughly entertained.Spectacular Visuals and Design
The film's visual design is nothing short of breathtaking. Jean-Paul Gaultier's bold and eccentric costumes add a sense of whimsy, while the futuristic cityscapes, with their flying cars and neon glow, are meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in a vibrant and dynamic universe. The combination of practical effects and early CGI still holds up, creating a world that feels both fantastical and grounded.Memorable Performances
The cast delivers standout performances that elevate the film. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as the rugged yet endearing Korben, and Milla Jovovich brings a sense of vulnerability and strength to her role as Leeloo. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the villainous Zorg is deliciously over-the-top, while Chris Tucker's flamboyant and hilarious Ruby Rhod injects an infectious energy that keeps the film light and fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Excellent story Line,"Ere is so much entertainment in this movie it would be almost stupid to write about its flaws. Especially the story is not the best thing here, but who cares. I liked every scene, every moment in this movie. The movie opens in Egypt, 1914, and we meet some strange creatures. From here on we know this is not going to be a normal or very serious sci-fi action movie. The creatures tell a priest that the stones are no longer save on earth and they take some things. They tell the priest they will return in 300 years, when evil arrives.300 years later. The strange creatures return but they are attacked by other strange creatures. The only thing that survives is reconstructed and turns out to be Lee Loo (Milla Jovovich). She is the fifth element, the ultimate weapon against evil. Evil here looks like a great ball of fire. Lee Loo escapes from the authorities, and in an astonishing shot we see how a city looks like now. She jumps of a building and ends up in the flying cab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). He saves her from the police, she asks for priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), he brings her there.We learn a little more about Lee Loo here. She needs four stones, the four other elements, to save the world. The stones are on a vacation resort where we meet DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker). He has some funny scenes as well. We have also met Zorg, who is played by Gary Oldman in a great way. The attack on the strange creatures early in the movie was planned by him. He wants the stones as well, he is offered a lot of money for them. How the story develops from here I will not reveal.The story doesn't even matter. In every scene we have something to like. Beautiful settings, great visual effects, Gary Oldman, the beautiful Jovovich or the funny moments from Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker and Ian Holm.

Hey, Zorg (played with aplomb by a giddy Gary Oldman) even has a point about the constructive value of death and destruction.The sets are wonderful -- a future of excess population, traffic, noise, and riotous colour.

This movie was both.

Highly visually arresting.,"If nothing else, Luc Besson's big budget sci-fi bomb manages to look like no other film. The Frenchman succeeds in bringing a very European look in to a major Hollywood movie (visually, the film most resembles a certain breed of European comic book) and for that alone deserves considerable credit. The effects, production and costume design all have been thought through with considerable care and make a coherent and compelling world even if, individually, they don't always work. The story, concerning the embodiment of love being required to save the universe, is deeply silly, aiming for profundity and missing by a fair margin but that's beside the point. The ride is entertaining and it's worth arguing that no female actor has ever done better as an action hero than Mila Jovovich. Kathleen Turner bombed in V.I. Warshawski (such a comprehensive disaster that, to be fair, that she never stood a chance) and the much more physically appropriate Geena Davis failed repeatedly with scripts of varying quality. The multilingual and seriously smart Jovovich has proved to have a startling range. She can do a complex historical character in ""The Messenger"", a comic villain in ""Zoolander"" and then beat the bejeezus out of all-comers in something like this. Leeloo is the only role in the film that asks much of any of the actors (Gary Oldman, as usual, gives enormously more than he is asked) and Jovovich really responds pulling off some very difficult scenes. Accepted on its own terms and ""The Fifth Element"" is a unique experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of my favorite movies!!,"I have loved this film ever since I first saw it in theaters about four years ago. It is exciting and funny, with several great performances. I particularly liked Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich. Chris Tucker's character was unbelievably funny, and for those people who were annoyed by how loud and whiny he was, well, that's why so many people thought he was funny. He was such an obvious parody of Prince(wussy, worshiped by ladies) that viewers couldn't help cracking up. The special effects were great, and I can't believe it didn't get an Oscar for the visual effects. I loved the exciting flying-car chase. However, my favorite part of the film would have to be the awesome fight scene between Leeloo and the ugly Mangalore aliens.

The acting, especially by Milla Jovovich, was excellent, the music by Eric Serra was terrific, the cinematoprahy by Thierry Arbogast was brilliant, the story was great. I especially likes the ""over the top"" qualities of it. Every one else thought it was a standard story, full of cliches. But the fact that the story forms a parody on the genre it ""belongs"" to, made me enjoy the film even more. The most brilliant part of this film was, however, its editing.

Definitely One of the Decades 10 Best,"Polarization.  That's what this movie does.  People either hate it or love it.  Personally, I love it!

I don't know of any movie that doesn't. But if you create a movie that is visually stunning, witty, and can keep you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours, then plot holes seem to disappear. I was particularly impressed with the costumes.  Very futuristic, and appropriate considering the overall look of the film.  The music is top-notch.

Just take my word for it and give it a go. it's a marvelously clever sci-if epic.

It's got so many clever bits that you really have to watch it more than once to catch them all. The editing is unreal (spaceship launch is one) and the subtle pokes at popular culture are amazing.

Light!"" ; Lilu enjoying a second helping of turkey from the INSTANT - (made from a broth cube) microwave: "" Chicken GOOD!""; Dallas (Willis) to his cat as he leaves his apartment, and turns on the TV: ""Don't watch it all day sweetheart. It'll rot your brain."" And of course, his response to the security officer's question: ""Are you human?"" "" No, I am a Meat Popsicle."" ""OK.""

Has its moments but is deceiving in its premise,"At some point in the decade of the 1990s, almost every big name action star received the opportunity to play an action role in the science fiction genre. Bruce Willis was no different. After starring in three popular entries of the Die Hard (1988) franchise, it was time for Willis to step into the future. In the early 1900s, ancient guardians that had built a machine to protect humans from an evil force that destroys all life (kind of like Galactus) visited Earth. In order to make this weapon of protection work; four stones that represent the four elements must be placed in the temple of which it was created. At the center of it lies the fifth element. Skip 300 years later and viewers see Willis playing Korben Dallas, an ex-military man who currently works as a taxi-driver.It is in this lifetime that Dallas discovers that he will have to save the world by reuniting the five elements together back where they came from. Running parallel to Dallas is Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman) who also wants the stones and is in cahoots with the strange nameless evil force. From what was just told, the premise sounds awfully serious. Turns out though, almost nothing is taken zealously. This tone shift is brought on after the brief introduction and it may take some time for viewers to readjust. Adding to that is the writing, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. First, why does this mythical being want death and destruction to everything living? There has to be some kind of motive. Is it the same motive as Zorg's? That's the closest audiences get to one and it doesn't even come from the evil thing itself.Plus, of all things how did this evil force come into contact with Zorg and why did it choose to work with him personally? Surely there must be other chaotic death hungry villains in this universe. Another weird thing is that every time someone is near this force, they leak black fluid from their head? It doesn't make any sense. Writer/director Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have both made better works and it shows they weren't catching the mistakes here. Unusually, even though the writing isn't very good, most of the actors give their characters a good amount of quality. Willis makes Dallas very nonchalant and his ability to role off the piling issues, which is a likable trait. Oldman as the evil forces' henchman is comical in some ways due to the manner in which he speaks. Chris Tucker as a popular radio DJ wasn't needed but was funny. Depending on preference, he will either be funny or annoying. Tucker is a polarizing actor when it comes to comedy. Even the late Brion James has a number of funny moments dealing with Willis' role.Perplexing as it may be, Mila Jovovich is the only actor who doesn't have the most likable role. It's not because of her looks or acting ability but more on the development of her character. She speaks another language and can understand English yet can't speak English. With this, the charm of her character isn't very strong. Also, she claims that she exists to protect Dallas when that barely even happens. I don't know, but you'd think that if an actor plays one of the most important plot related roles, they need to be the most likable and developed. Well it doesn't feel that way here. The editing is another issue. The pacing drags frequently, yet editing is done in a way that simultaneously connects all plot threads so that everything collides at once. The beauty of convenience,...but the movie still drags. Sigh. Thankfully, there is some action,...some. When the action hits, it works well. Willis and Tucker produce a number of laughs as the explosions ensue. Even Jovovich has her own fight scene. She looks great but it doesn't last long unfortunately.The visual effects have plus and minuses too. The special/practical effects look well made and for 1997 don't look have bad today either. The best looking features are the futuristic technology in various rooms and the creature makeup. The CGI sequences do look a little shaky but not noticeably bad. However, the cinematography does nothing to visually help the movie. Aside from the futuristic gadgets looking cool, the camera-work is plain and uninteresting. Completing this is composer Eric Serra's music, which only impresses half way. When it came to comedy, Serra's tracks did occasionally improve the scene and make it funnier. Yet for the dramatic moments and other scenes, he continued to use odd sounding instruments and weird overtones. This may draw viewers out of the scene rather than into it. Serra is a very avant garde composer, perhaps a little too much. He didn't even stick to the sci-fi genre of music. Disappointing.It's not a total failure but the entertainment it grants is only half there. The majority of the actors make their characters fun to watch, the action is quick and lively and the comedy is decent. Yet the music is a peculiar audio mix, the pacing is slow and the writing has numerous holes that don't make much sense. It's not unwatchable but it's not that decent either.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Visually unique, content wise cheap","From a visual point of view, this film is one of the most impressive of my life, every second looks like a painting. The movie sets the colors the props everything is beautiful. Although I do not always like the costumes and I want to ask a few questions in some design decisions, I would say that the movie is a masterpiece. (From a visual point of view) But then he is pulled down by the fact that the script looks as if it had written a small child or comes from a children's book. The narrative style, the narrative structure everything is cooked really soft and fade the characters are quite okay but the dialogues are, please do not misunderstand, too stupid for science fiction. Especially during the climax I had the feeling that every moment ""Dora the Explorer"" shows up and asks for me help.However, I think Dora got lost in the plot holes, no plot caves. Not every story has to be infinitely complicated but if you make a movie out of it, we expect it to be a movie and if this movie has a PG-13, then I'll rate that as well. I am against the age restrictions, but even as a 13 year old boy would this cheap narrative + black and white representation of good and evil bother me tremendously.The story is the most important thing that makes a good movie and when I get such a ""My Little Pony Fanfiction"" that even my 5 year old cousin finds miserable mixed with costumes and furniture that belong in a museum, then I get headaches, depressions and gripes at the same time. I think it's a pity that all these wonderful set pieces and technological details are stuck between this crap of script. I'd rather have a movie with a fantastic script and awful flaws than the other way around.Bruce Willis is fantastic as always he could play a Nazi and I would still like the man. Chris Tucker is unbearable but Milla Jovovich has anything in this performance which just fills me with hate. I do not know what it is, whether it's her voice her costume or the way she talks like a baby, something annoys me so much that I always want to skip her parts because I'm afraid I'm going to go crazy. I like Gary Oldman but here he is totally wasted in this movie Zorg is a totally superfluous character that has no (major) impact on the course of the story.It's also really difficult to assign a fixed genre to this movie, what is it? Is this Comedy Action, SciFi Action, SciFi Comedy? Is it satire, is it serious or a costume orgy?PS: A lot of people like that the protagonist and antagonist never meet firstly Zorg is not the antagonist but only a lackey from the real villain, we never met our hero, Korben Dallas do not know about Zorg's existence or its influence the whole thing. That's why it's not worth mentioning. I like that the film has a theme of 5 that is a nice Easter Egg what I did not notice the first time.But on the other hand film has two TV troops I loathe as a solution to the problems.My conclusion: applause for Luc Besson ideas and cinematography but I can do without his films.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Watch it with your eyes and your heart.,"Watching `The Fifth Element' made me fall in love with Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and color.  The cast, costumes, sets, score, effects, and concepts are (eye) candy too beautiful to eat.  Some would find such a situation `too sweet,' but I consider it fun, especially because I don't believe that plot was sacrificed for the visual experience.  Instead, I maintain that there is a plot, but also posit that looking to `The Fifth Element' for plot is missing the point.  The film rejoices in itself.  Within the hypercolorful universe of the film, Willis is simultaneously *funny,* sexy, and lethal, and Jovovich is *cute,* sexy, and lethal.  Take the film too seriously and you'll miss that they (especially Willis) are not.  After my recent umpteenth viewing of the film, I realized that I also love it for its editing and framing, which add to the fun comic book feel already inspired by the color and plot, but which I was only recently able to pin down with words.

Luc Besson is the modern Kubrik,"Each of Luc Besson's previous two movies has been impressive, and each has stretched his visible skills at storytelling. This third of Luc Besson's movies is truly a French comic book broken free of its panels -- not to be taken even remotely, momentarily seriously, it is a wonderful mixture of a comic book's childish simplicity and a movie's visual animation. Although quite violent, it is filled with sharp, witty dialogue and quick characterization, with many visual jokes and puns subtly slipped in for additional humor (the cigarette, for example, that's 75% filter). Bruce Willis's casting as the beaten down Corbin Dallas is obvious, but perfect. Gary Oldman deliciously overplays the wickedly evil Zorg, Milla Jovovitch wonderfully bounces from vulnerable to superwarrior, and the rest of the casting is equally inspired, straight down to ""Tiny"" Lister as The President. The ""Mobius"" inspired cityscapes and visual elements fit perfectly into the comic-book nature of the movie.No question, it *does* suffer on the small screen -- try to catch it in wide screen on a large Home Theatre system if you cannot see it at a real theatre.

Luc Besson first became widely known after his fourth film became an instant hit; La Femme Nikita. This film was nominated for over 10 awards, and won over 5. Like Nikita, Luc Besson allowed his imagination to take flight when he took on becoming the director for this film. Helping his imagination came to life Besson had the help of Mark A. Mangini, who was nominated for an Oscar for best special effects. Mangini used the latest technology of the time to give the viewer what it would be like in a futuristic world. As Leeloo, the fifth element looks out unto New York we see just how good Mangini is at his job. We see trains that work like elevators driving vertically up buildings; we get a glimpse of what traffic is like in a world where there are no more lanes but instead flying cars driving at different levels and in different directions. Or when Corbin takes the police for a car chase throughout the city of New York ins and outs of the city's futuristic train system underground.Then you have the main characters that were great in their roles. We have Corbin Dallas played by the ever manly Bruce Willis, or the fifth element Leeloo, who challenged the idea of a man being the saver of the day. Then we have Gary Oldman, who had worked with Luc Besson a few years earlier in Leon, once again played the villain, with all the fun toys that comes with the role of the evil villain.Unlike most films where the hero is the man, once again Besson puts the women in the place of the hero who saves the day. Leeloo, a beautiful delicate woman was the true saver of the day. Yes, there was macho Corbin (Willis) who swoops in to save Leeloo from the police, but in reality it was really Leeloo that was the real hero of the Fifth Element. We also have the idea of not only world peace but peace between planets and galaxies. Is peace only 500 years away? This film gives us the idea that though not everyone will get along the majority of the galaxies will be able to come together and offer a time when not only do countries get along the universe does. As we see when the first troubles of the movie start and the President of the universe with power over the galaxy.The Fifth Element is a great movie to lose one self in with what the future may look like. The plot may have been done before but the technology of this movie was the best of its times. If you enjoy science fantasy with a bit of action the Fifth Element is a movie you will enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So promising; so disappointing,"It would be wonderful to see the same cast do the same film under different direction and with a somewhat improved script. There is so much potential here that it's positively maddening to see it wasted.The actors do a wonderful job overall, though Gary Oldman is so comic book character that it's almost embarrassing. Poor Chris Rock is stuck with screeching, ""Oh my god!"" about eight thousand times -- certainly someone could've come up with something more interesting than that to liven it up?Milla Jojovich is completely likable and does a great job shifting through the various shade of her character. Bruce Willis -- well, he's Bruce Willis. Ian Holm is brilliant, of course.Note to big-time movie makers: putting the bad guys in big rubber suits is not particularly intimidating for the viewer. It's distracting and downright silly at times.As high on my wish list: never ever ever cast a non-musician in a musician's role. The poor woman trying to play the diva was utterly ridiculous in her attempt to look like she was producing the exquisite tones coming out of her mouth. In addition, for all the hype about the diva, it was only a letdown when the makeup and costuming effects were so-so and her phenomenal voice was augmented, not by incredible and imaginative visuals, but by silly hand movements and very un-diva-like she-bopping.The sets were eye-poppingly real and then suddenly cartoonish. Big ideas walked right alongside trite ones, constantly bringing the picture down. Entirely too much time was spent on the opening sequence, and other pacing issues bog the film down. Unexpected plot surprises kept piquing my interest, only to disappear in completely predictable good guy/bad guy set-ups.Please, someone, remake this film with a coherent message and the ability to make it all hang together.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So glad to find the 'chosen',"Alas, I have searched far and wide among 'the knowing' aka critics to find supporters of this film....was I wrong to immediately purchase the video after only one viewing?...was my favourite, STAR WARS trilogy, to fall under the stones of the four elements with no-one to support me?...are the nuances of this movie as amazing as I see them (or was it that very special dry white wine?)....NOW I KNOW....I have found the chosen at this site, those with vision, childhood glee, and a true recognition that this is just the most amazing, well-dialogued, beautifully crafted and fun.....FUN...movie in a very long time. I recommend The Fifth Element to all of my friends as a test...if they like it, on any level, they remain friends....if not.....I am very disappointed..........",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Multipass!,"OK, for starters I never used to think that Bruce Willis was that good an actor, possibly because i loathe action films(big explosions, car chase, indestructable humans etc.). But this film changed my option on Willis. It made me think that behind the muscular fisique and the receding hairline (sorry Bruce but it's true), that there was a good actor in him. This movie made me believe that, and his ability was revealed again in ""The 6th Sense"". Well done Willis. For me this movie shows a future that come very well be possible, much like the of Ridley Scott in ""Blade Runner"", such as the cigarettes with huge filters, the sky-scraper McDonald's and a new religion. Gary Oldman seemed at home in his usually bad guy role, Milla Jokovich seemed, pardon the pun, perfect for Leelu and Willis was spot on as an ex-army boy as Kroben Dallas. All in all, well done Besson, you have created yet another masterpiece to go with ""LEON"" and ""La femme Nikita"". But one question, what was that transparent plastic thing on Gary Oldman's head?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
niceee,"Last time I watched this movie was about 10 years ago. I was a kid back then and remembered only few scenes - like the taxi chase in the beginning, the Plava Laguna show etc.. Now when I watched it again I couldn't believe how good this movie is. Clothing is kinda trashy (but in a fun way), it's full of humor, all the characters are perfect and very peculiar (Leeloo, Zorg, General Munro :D and Ruby Rhod :D:D).I even value life more after watching it. It's the part when Leeloo says that why should she even bother protecting life if we do with it what we do (accent on war and poverty). The fifth element is supposed to be ether - the perfect, creative life force that's all around us. I appreciate it more now.Great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unbearable!,"Bruce Willis's technicolour trash heap of a film, with Milla whatsername babbling incoherently gets the worst futuristic film gong ever. Combining hokey science fiction, quasi-religious sentiments, and a garish French new wave fashion sensibility, this mess has a bad plot that just has a lot of stupid things happening very, very fast. Although this movie is literally dripping with eye-popping special effects, they're all hung on a scatterbrained plot that is incomprehensible. This overblown cosmic comic book was boring, idiotic and an over-priced sham. ""The Fifth Element"" ends up being a major disappointment, not because it doesn't provide enough, but because it provides too much.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Earth, Fire, Air, Water...and coolness","Cool enjoyable sci-fi actioner that starts off in early 20th Century Egypt for the set up, the barrels through 300 years later for the main story. Bruce Willis is on great form as his atypical reluctant action hero, pretty much in the same mold as the ""Die Hard"" trilogy. The f/x are just amazing. The New York of the future alone is worth the price of the dvd.The tone of the film is lighter than the advertising would leave one to suppose - in my estimation the tone of the movie plays pretty much like a Bond film - staggering f/x, likeable hero, awesome action sequences, some comedy, and a lot of coolness.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A masterpiece of a movie,"Honestly look deep into this film, enjoy all the visuals and comedy and you will find a magnificent piece of art

Great High Camp Comedy Science Fiction,"Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman were fabulous in their roles. Chris Tucker turned in an over the top screamer of a performance as DJ Ruby Rhod, the epitome of a 25th century metrosexual. Milla Jovovich was convincing and sensually charming as Leeloo the surprise core character. The rest of the cast including the background support roles were wonderful. Sets were interesting and convincing. The special effects were some of the best of the 90s. The sight gags were well combined with the action. The staging of action sequences was carried out masterfully. The element of Techno Opera was was one of the most interesting vocal performances of the decade. Highly recommended with a bottle of good wine.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
just plain fun,"After the 'Ultimate weapon' Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) escapes from government captivity falling into the taxi of Corben Dallas (Bruce Willis), she pleads for his help, which he hesitantly gives. They're not only chased by the military but by Zorg (Gary Olman) who has linked himself with Evil and plans to get 4 stones that Leeloo needs to save the universe, but for less altruistic reasons then her. What follows is a great action packed movie. Chris Tucker as DJ Ruby Rhod is pretty annoying at times, but it isn't as much so as to aversely affect my accolades for the film. All the primary actors are great, the action set pieces are a blast and the computer generated scenery is much more appealing then the one's found in Star Wars: Episodes 1 and 2. While it may not be my favorite Luc Besson film (That high honor goes to Leon), it still is a fun ride.My Grade: B2-DVD set Extras: Disc 1) A fact trackDisc 2) 6 featurettes ( Visual, Digital, star, Alien, Fashion, and the Diva); visual Tests; Screen tests (including 4 for Milla Jovovich the second one with her in a great black see-thru number); Poster Gallery; and Trailers for ""the Forgotten"", ""Leon: The Professional"", & ""Mirrormask""Eye Candy: Milla Jovovich is briefly topless two times",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great refreshing Sci-Fi,"This is the most thrilling Sci-Fi I've ever seen. The couturier Jean-Paul Gaultier has done a great job: the costumes are really funny or just great. I suppose that in other Sci-Fi movies everybody shops in the same 'SF-soviet-haute-couture-1$'-store. The plot is actually straight-forward: bad forces try to conquer/destroy the world, our former-top-military good guy with gorgeous looking good girl do the rest. Please pay attention to the computer-animated special effects. This all makes the film very entertaining and extra-ordinary. Looks good at any film-curriculum.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just Fabulous!,"My husband and I stumbled onto this gem when it came out on HBO. We absolutely love it!  I think we've both seen it at least four times and our children, now that they're older, are getting into it as well.  As many have commented, the Diva music scene is especially entertaining, and it is definitely my most favorite. The music is almost haunting.  The combination of the visual (the actress, Maiwenn Le Besco) and the singing of Inva Mulla Tchako is truly compelling.

"Please, Do not waste your money","This movie is very boring and childish. You will hate yourself about your choice, when you finish watching this movie.

Amazed at Movie's Complete Ridiculousness,"Like many, I had high hopes for this film.  Then I saw it.  Then I couldn't believe how horrible of an experience it was.  ""Star Wars for the '90s"" indeed... whoever wrote that should be shot.  I hated this movie from the very first tired cliche, where Corbin Dallas suddenly bolts upright from a bad dream.  It was all downhill from there: the ""perfect"" specimen of a human (sorry, she wasn't), Ruby (COMPLETELY pointless.  It was as if this character was just thrown in there for the sole purpose of making this movie unbearable), Zorg's accent, the ""duck"" aliens, and the diva?  What the hell was that?  And to think that the movie instantly became TWICE as bad  in the final, laughably artificial emotional moments when we learn the 5th element is LOVE!  Love conquers all!  How profound!  Mr. Besson, I don't care if your other movies were good--.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Time is not important only life's important ... exactly!,"When I first saw TFE I was blended by the pictures, the colors and the sounds.

A Memory As To How Fun Sci-Fi Can Be!,"Having recently reviewed a number of Sci-Fi Movies, I had become increasingly bored of the senile story lines and lack of fun that is what a film lover such as myself requires on a regular basis. So, off i rummage through my movie catalogue and 'There it is!' - The Fifth Element. at the conclusion, i felt like a kid who had literally been spoilt in a candy store.For me, the Fifth Element is as crazy as it can be average. But PLEASE! do not let this sway you from a film that was written by Luc Besson when he was in school. The outfits are mad, Bruce Willis is (dare i say it...) lovable and the complete idea is ludicrous; yet it makes me want to watch over and over again. It is a feel good action movie that delights me every time and helps me to forget that recent movies are becoming quick money making marvels without any entertainment value.Luc Besson! this may not be your greatest work, but you sure know how to please your audience! And to me, thats what matters most. To my readers, understand that it is silly, and just sit back and enjoy this Jean-Paul Gaultier gun slinging sexy Sci-Fi.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Must See, and see again if you already have!","From the director Luc Besson, The Fifth Element was one of the ""coolest"" movie made this year.  The special effects were probably not the most amazing, but that's not all in this movie.  The colors, the complementry colors(blue/yellow, orange/red), look terrific.  The music by Eric Serra was also exciting, they fit the plot so well... listen to the part where Leeloo asks for Korben to drive on the cab, and the part before she jumped right off...  the music made the scence so much more intense! Watch the movie not for the action, but watch it more like a comedy.  It is more like a comic strip!  Chris Tucker did his character so well too, rock on!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
