For all I know you are the rat; and this might be the best heist homage movie ever?,"Reservoir Dogs is the debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.It feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly £6.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.Tarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.Yet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of ""ultra-violence,"" it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there's the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.And that's the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it's crammed packed full of memorable things. A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it's one of the very best. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You might need to watch it twice...,"... because the first time around I was somewhat disappointed. This was actually a commercial hit for Tarantino , and that usually means something that is appreciated on the first view.It is great nonlinear storytelling. You first meet these guys in a diner having breakfast. And you learn lots about their characters just from this very mundane setting and some arguing about the philosophy of tipping. And you wonder why they are wearing suits and thin lapels with white shirts and skinny ties, like they borrowed the Beatles' 1964 wardrobe. It is never explained. And there is all of this 70s music, again, never explained.Storywise it has been done a hundred times, maybe more. A heist gone wrong. But the gimmick is, you never SEE the heist. Most of the time I like for movie makers to show me not tell me, but this works brilliantly. You see this gang of people who do not know each other talk about the heist beforehand. You see the aftermath of the heist. You see the descriptions of the heist between this band of criminals not exactly matching up. And all of the scenes are mixed up chronologically. Where it shines is the crazy dialogue that happens between these hooligans. Their banter is ludicrous, villainous, and totally engaging. It's like Diner meets Dillinger.And speaking of Dillinger, a really great touch is having Lawrence Tierney in a supporting role as Joe, mastermind of the heist. Tierney was an actual star of film noirs in the 1940s, and he lost that career because in real life he was somebody who would probably have been quite at home with the characters in this film. He got into lots of bar fights and altercations with the police to the point that no studio wanted to deal with him anymore.I'd highly recommend this one, but you must pay attention to get the most out of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A stylish and excellent example of expert story-telling.,"After watching this half a dozen times with a biased, anti-Tarantino, ""what the heck is so great about this guy, anyway"" view(which, as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of self-knowledge will tell you, is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness... if you've decided you're not going to like it, there's very little reason to think that you will, no matter how good it is; you need an open mind), I finally decided to give it a fair hearing... and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film, at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent, and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget, the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel, Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well, let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course, of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk Till Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him act, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still, that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't name them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a ""regular"" film ever could. One of the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc. - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Quentin Tarantino begins his directing career with the first of several chronologically mixed, disturbingly violent, and incredibly powerful films.","Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that ""less is more."" This doesn't apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch.This is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen, you're looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors, there's no make-up to make them look pretty, there's little to no comic relief, and most important of all, there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in, a detrimental trademark of so many action films, as well as  virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films. Instead of all of that garbage, Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible, and by doing that he makes it seem that you're really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery.Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made, the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all, you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them, and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film.Make no mistake, Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made, and some scenes are really painful to watch, but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film. The violence is never glorified, nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
criminals with style,"From the opening moments of ""Reservoir Dogs"" you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama.  The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession.  Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal.  Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang.  The delight is in meeting these characters one by one.  The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up.  The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime.  Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked.  The director has included a number of very memorable scenes.  This is not a linear film.  The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing.  This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A timeless classic...seriously,"The first time I saw Reservoir Dogs, I was about 15, it had been banned in my country, and I heard it was extremely voilent. Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy, and when I finally did see it, I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying ""Wheres all the violence"", Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.This is one of the movies I don't get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: ""Are you gonna bark all day..."", ""I'll make you my dog's bitch"". Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don't know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there's a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino's best movie. I didn't care much for the ""Kill Bill"" movies, but who cares, I'm not reviewing them.If you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Neo-Violent Joy,"This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen and definately deserves its position on the Top 250. It's an acquired taste, but if you've been desensitised to violence (as i have), then you will want to watch this again from the minute it ends. Every single actor was perfectly fitted for its character. Steve Buscemi as the squirrely Mr. Pink, Harvey Keitel as the veteran Mr. White, and of course, Michael Madsen as the phsycotic Mr. Blonde. The list goes on and on.Some people said that the violence was unnecessary and didn't move the plot forward as it did with Pulp Fiction. I agree, but the violence was used to develop the character's personalities. It showed their disregard for human life and that our anti-heros saw killing a cop as being as stepping on a cockroach .I urge future viewers of this movie not to instantly compare it to Pulp Fiction and enjoy it as it's own film. An interesting thrill-ride crime drama from beginning to end, I give this film *****/*****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
really a great movie!,"I watched this movie for the first time without knowing what the movie was about. I remember hearing about how cool this movie was and I saw people wearing shirts and listening to the soundtrack, but I had never seen it. So when it first came out on DVD, I bought it without ever watching it before. In Tarantino I trust. For good reason. This is a classic movie, a throwback. A movie about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of working with strangers. This flick has a great cast, great script, and flawless direction. Taratino films are great because they stress the story more than anything else. In all of his movies, the script is strong enough to carry the movie. Now add good over the top acting and you have a hit. The realism of this movie is what grabs you. You really feel like you are in that abandoned warehouse. If felt privileged to have bought such a movie without watching it first. An instant classic. I love this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I am amazed by the high rating.,"Looking at the high rating of 8,4 and knowing that this is considered one of Quentin Tarantino's best movies i thought i was about to see a great masterpiece.I was absolutely shocked about how terribly boring this movie was. There is no progression in the plot at all, they didn't even show a second of the robbery the movie was about. For the first 50 minutes of the movie the viewer just sits through completely irrelevant and boring scenes, experiences next to no action and just gets bored, since nobody is presented with who is who in the first half of the film. It is impossible to be compassionate for the characters, since you don't even know who they are and all you see is just a bunch of useless drawn-out conversations, using a lot of useless sentences just to add to the screen time, which is only 99 minutes, by the way.The movie uses a lot of excessively drawn-out conversations, it is not necessarily a bad thing, but here it didn't fit, since the screen time is so short, leading into a very boring plot and irrelevant actions. I don't get what people see in this movie, yea the acting is OK, but otherwise, it is just garbage. Is it only because it is Tarantino? Is that everything people need to hear to give a positive review? I get that many people see this movie as ''different'' just to show others they enjoyed it, it would be awesome if everybody wasn't afraid of expressing their opinion and sticking to it.Overall a terrible movie, don't see that as a classic for sure, would not watch again nor recommend it to anybody else. Short, no action, zero plot progression, drawn-out irrelevant conversations, boring.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"It's not the pieces, it's the drive","A great creative insight is to take things that we think of as separate and contained (like 'art', 'genius', or 'ideas') and realize how they are fluid and inter-dependent, conditioned by factors. This is not to expose anything as little, deconstruction for its sake; it's to show them to be doable, that a road leads up to them. (It's also one of the three main areas of Buddhist practice)One obvious way to do this would be to take this and note the many influences. This has been done to death already, every bit that Tarantino hoped to keep packed or wanted us to find out has been laid out in the open. But this just gives us someone, genius or not, who stole from the right places.Another way would be to see that it doesn't work the same way as it did when new because it has all been made ordinary by slavish followers, gobbled up by familiarity. The moments of simple banter away from plot, the fooling round with edges of story without showing the main center-piece, bleeding on a floor, following Mr. Blonde outside to pick up a can of gasoline; Tarantino was probably proud that he was being ""real"", making a radical break from Bruckheimer's Hollywood.It's bits and pieces of Godard, Cassavetes, Altman, and others. To see it now shows how theatric it is, not ""real"" at all. (The least theatric acting is by the bound cop. Roth is just woeful.) It's The Killers, with the violence and gum pop visuals as typical to see as The Killers was typical without them in its own time.Me, I'd like to settle for something else that brings us to real influence of a more elusive kind.Everything you see here is coming from a young guy who was at the best possible time in his life, lifted from obscurity and everything was beginning to click into place beyond expectation. Can you imagine how giddy he must have been to hear yes from Keitel and here's a check?It's Tarantino coming in from the outside as someone young and eager to make a dream come true; it's bursting with energy but disciplined, kept in check by not having everything at your disposal, being the new kid on set. It would be nothing without this energy.And it's Tarantino being rooted in his own world as he brings the dream alive, suburban LA. None of the story has any outlet into real lives, it's all bounced around movie cutouts. Gangsters showing up before a heist for breakfast in tuxedos? But it's the video clerk's imagination cruising through his own world. He has guys exchange banter about a stripper from Palos Verdes, Roth improvise a story about buying weed the summer of '86.So this is the most vibrant sense I get; someone making it, not having to prove himself because he's there, making a movie with name actors around town, relaxed and fired up at the same time. See if you can feel this off his screen presence (and what a stark difference from his surly presence now).His next one would be the apogee of this path. It can also be traced to the 30 year old who had flown himself to Amsterdam to write away from home like a Hemingway, living the dream.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie,A group of men are having benign banter in a diner. They have color code names. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) brings a horribly wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) back to the hideout. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is ranting about the quick police response as a setup. Joe Cabot hired the crew for a diamond store holdup keeping their identities secret from each other. Calm and disturbed Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) shows up with a captured cop.Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie by concentrating on the in-between scenes. He peppers the scenes with sharp extraneous dialog. It makes for some really memorable scenes. The diner scene and the torture scene are unforgettable. The whole movie does drag as we wait for the actual robbery action scenes but this movie is something completely different.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A BLOODY classic!,"Reservoir Dogs will always go down as one of the most violent yet brilliant pieces of work ever to be shown on the silver screen. Tarrentino's script is brilliant and what is even more amazing is that it is his first movie. The acting is top grade , all the actors seem to come up with the performance of lives. There were calls when the film was released for it to be banned by the lilly livered liberals and while this is bloody and the language is coarse, for it to be banned would have deprived us of a classic Hollywood movie that oozes class as well as blood! 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"It ticks every box, one of Tarantino's finest.","A jewel robbery at a store should be a simple task for a gang if hardened criminals, but the plan goes horribly wrong, prompting the members to think that one of them is a Police informant.Where to even begin with this film, there's no doubt about it, it's one of Quentin Tarantino's best, it's exciting, thrilling, uncomfortable and funny, it really does offer something for everyone.It's quite a simple storyline when you think of it, but it's the incredible character play that makes it so incredible, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney and Tim Roth all fabulous.It's Michael Madsen who steals it for me, that dance scene is just incredible, that whole sequence is unnerving, unsettling, violent and just brilliant.It's loaded with classic scenes, the torture of that poor Policeman is the highlight, and of course that wonderful big reveal is terrific,The music is superb throughout, you'll be reaching for the tracklist after the credits roll.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Almost perfect,"As Tarantino as it gets. Reservoir Dogs is exactly what you'd expect from him. It's funny, it's gory, it's brutal and above all else, it's absolutely ridiculous. This movie could've been so incredible, but unfortunately, it slightly misses the mark.What I loved about this movie is, no doubt, what everyone else loved as well. Those scenes in the warehouse are spectacular. The fact that you can make conversations between people so intense and thrilling is remarkable. And this movie nails that. Every scene in the warehouse is perfect. You never know what is going to happen and you are constantly on the edge of your seat. Had this movie been entirely in the warehouse, I'm sure I would've liked it way more.As is though, the movie doesn't do that. It almost feels like Tarantino knew how intense those warehouse scenes were and decided that the viewer needed a break. As such, the film goes on to give introductions to some of the characters. These introductions, however, felt completely unnecessary to me. Not only did they break the pace and intensity of the film, but they also broke the mystery and intrigue of the characters. I would've been perfectly fine with never knowing anything but the made-up names that each character had. Especially the introduction of Mr. Orange felt unnecessarily long and added very little to the overall story.This movie could've been near perfect had it kept true to its intensity and the thrill of the post heist moments. Using that confined location and nothing else and pitting these characters against each other in an endless barrage of doubt and accusation would've truly been a sight to behold. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat the whole time, especially considering the relatively short runtime. Alas, I was forced to take breaks and breathe for a moment just be brought back into the excellence of the warehouse.With all that being said, it's still a great movie. It has all the characteristics you'd want from a Tarantino film and it is immensely entertaining even in the slower moments. It probably isn't a classic yet, but it undoubtedly will be one in the future. As far as I'm concerned, it wasn't as good as it could've been, but that's just my opinion. And based on most reviews that I've read many consider it to be as good as it could've ever been.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very Overrated,"A gang of thieves carry out an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse. The police are after them so quickly that they suspect they have a rat in their company. This film starts right after the robbery, with flashbacks to before the robbery, and to the planning of the crime.After reading this plot, you know this is not your average crime film. In fact, I thought this film was about the whole diamond heist and that there will be a twist ending on who's the rat. It's absolutely nothing like that.Although an original way to make this film, this film is mostly boring, with an exception on the prologue of the film which I found entertaining for some reason. This film is very violent and bloody with shooting here and there and yelling about this and that. That's about it with the film.There's nothing interesting with the ""boring"" characters and ""bad"" story. The actings were relatively decent and this film is nowhere near one of the best films ever, although many people said it was, which lead me to buy the film on DVD, which I found a complete waste of money. One good thing about this film is that it's unpredictable and has funny jokes, which in real life would be just the opposite.This film is decent but not a very good film. It has some originality and clever humor but all squished with a boring plot and uninteresting characters. This is just my opinion but I should say for those who want to see this film should rent it first before buying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
How is this a classic?,"After not finding a reason to watch this the past few decades, I decided to watch it since it was on Showtime and there was nothing else to watch. I couldn't believe how disappointed I was.I didn't particularly care for Pulp Fiction, but at least it was original and somewhat creative. There just wasn't anything entertaining about Reservoir Dogs. The only thing I was surprised by was Tarantino's appearance in it (which would have not happened had he not written & directed it - I'm not sure how many people realize he's a failed actor).I'd heard enough about the film that I was prepared for the violence and gore, and while I didn't enjoy that aspect, it wasn't the reason I disliked the film so much. Although some of the language was a bit abrasive (the rampant use of the word in an early 90's film does seem... odd to say the least). It was just plain boring. The plot was thin and barely held together, and the ending was just completely unsatisfying.I just don't see anything about this film that would make any true cinephile consider this a masterpiece. It doesn't lend anything to the cinematic landscape of the genre or decade or film in general. The only people who would like it would have to be Taratino buffs (who are a breed of their own) and love it because it was his first big film - which apparently is a rip-off of an Asian crime film.Honestly, unless you're a hardcore Tarantino fan (in which case you've probably already seen it) skip it!

"Simply brilliant; short, tight and taut","Crime boss Joe Cabot brings together a group of criminals to perform a big one-off job.  To protect each other, they all use colour coded names. However on the day of the job, the police ambush the gang and each makes their own getaway.  As the gang comes together at their warehouse meeting point they realise that someone within the gang must have tipped the police or be an undercover.  The accusations and suspicions escalate into violence in the confines of the warehouse.When this film came out in the UK it caused an absolute firestorm of controversy over it's violence, even to the point that it was banned in the UK for a while.  I still find this absurd and am very glad we have moved to a more tolerant society where generally the BBFC protect vulnerable groups but let adults decide for themselves.  Looking at the media's adoring welcome for the ultra violent Kill Bill one can't help but marvel at how things have changed.  Looking at Reservoir Dogs now (or even then!) it simply isn't THAT violent.  However what it is is very sudden and all the more powerful for it.Tarantino directs the film and writes the film in such a way that it was impossible to ignore him even if the film was only a cult hit.  The dialogue is both witty at points but, more importantly, very tough and loaded with testosterone.  It is the writing that makes us like these coffee shop jokers at the start before shocking us by suddenly throwing us into a backseat bloodbath.  The entire job happens off camera, and only occasionally do we actually see the immediate effect of violence - usually we get the aftermath.  It is incredibly tight and very tense throughout, I was about 16 when my father took me to see this film - it has stayed with me since and I still considered it to be one of the best `job gone wrong' films of my generation.  It may not be original (there's a thin line between a homage and a rip off) but it is certainly effectively done.The cast are excellent and turn the hardboiled dialogue into convincing scenes.  Keitel is wonderful.  His character is a father figure of sorts and he is wildly out of control at times and balanced at others.  Likewise Buscemi is wide-eyed and freaking out for much of the film, but he does it well.  Roth is more balanced but is still good for it; it is his job to carry the emotional weight of the film and he does it well, despite a wandering American accent at times.  Madsen is great, maybe not the best character but wildly out of control.  Tierney was a great piece of casting, as was Bunker.  Penn is good but not the best of the cast.Tarantino mercifully has little acting to do, but it is his film as writer and director.  The flashbacks during the film was a brave way to do it but it really works well - mixing stories with flashbacks and so on.  No matter what the time of the scene, it all keeps moving tensely towards the climax. It may be a homage and not as original as some films but so what - it is tight and tense, macho, violent, funny and very enjoyable.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A must see,"Definitely up there with Pulp Fiction as Tarantino's best. Reservoir Dogs is simply brilliant in all aspects. It is very brash, abrasive and unrelenting, but works tremendously with that sort of tone. The cinematography is very good I think, and the soundtrack is very appropriate and fitting. The story is wonderfully compelling, while the dialogue is very hard-boiled and attitude-laced with plenty of pop culture references, and references to TV shows and hip movies. Tarantino's direction is excellent, and so is the acting. Both Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth give performances that are among their best, while Michael Madson and Steve Buschemi are outstanding. Overall, I think it is a must. Maybe not for all, but I loved it and consider it one of Tarantino's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Reservoir Dogs is loud, bloody and constantly in your face.","In terms of directorial debuts, this is a solid entry that assured Tarantino as one of the best directors working today. Now, as most of you know, I'm not a big fan of Tarantino. Just not my cup of tea so to speak. Yet this was a good crime thriller. After a heist goes terribly wrong, the group of professional robbers make haste and convene at a remote warehouse. During this time, they try to find out who snitched on them to the police. In glorious (see what I did there...) Tarantino fashion, there is a bucket full of blood and a script full of profanity that infuses rather well with the story. Fortunately the narrative is not linear, so we're flipping back and forth between character introductions and the aftermath of the heist, to keep the plot's pace rapid and fresh. The characters themselves may not be completely memorable, but their names are. Mr White, Mr Brown, Mr Blonde, Mr Orange, Mr Pink and so on. With one humorous scene involving a small argument about the particular choice of ""Mr Pink"" (who was played excellently by Steve Buscemi). It's a story that is dialogue driven, like most of his films, so the wit and dark humour is conveyed through sharp exaggerative banter between these characters. It works, stupendously well actually. Harvey Keitel was the most enjoyable to watch, and finally we have a film with Tim Roth that I actually like. Hooray! Quentin himself should not act in his films. Why? Because he is abysmal. Makes me cringe every time I see him. The torture scene is filled with gore and is probably the most engaging scene in the film. Don't get me wrong, it's a compelling script. But I find the execution extremely, how to put this, noisy. I like subtlety. Sometimes less is more which is why I'm not his biggest fan. Atleast it's not 3 hours long, my brain would've been numbed if that were the case. However in saying that, I find this to be one of his better films (behind Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained) with a punchy script filled with plenty of violence. A damn good directorial debut.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Edgy, engrossing and still holds up well as a heist film over the years","""I feel like a director who has not yet directed, therefore I don't exist."" Said an idealist, enthusiastic Quentin Tarantino back when he was working at Video Archives in the early 1990s, eager to start climbing the directorial ladder in Hollywood. At this time he was just a screenplay-writer, penning early works such as Natural Born Killers (a baby of his he felt he stabbed in the heart when he gave up to Oliver Stone to rewrite), True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawnall initially fruitless fares that no one dared to green-light. Production companies were choosy, cliquish and wouldn't give an untested director like Tarantino a break. Not even for Reservoir Dogs.Growing increasingly frustrated at navigating the world of hard-to-please production corporations to OK his project and pass him the director's chair, Taratino approached producer Lawrence Benderarguably the best choice of his career (he's been working closely with him ever since). Bender loved the script of Reservoir Dogsand who wouldn't? It pours crime, gangsters and humour into an exquisite blender and sprinkles it with heavy doses of edgy style. Together the two of them set out to do this film, and soon caught the eye of Richard Gladstein at Live Entertainment in Van Nuys, who would later agree to finance the little project.It really was a ""little"" project, too, with a budget of a mere $1,200,000which meant that the '65 Yellow Cadillac that you see in the film is Michael Madsen's own. Yet breathless and excited at becoming a debut-director and finally getting to tend to his baby himself which this position now afforded him, Quentin Tarantino and Lawrence Bender began the process and the mega cult hit that is ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). Harvey Keitel was first approached to star as Mr. White and with his name on-board, he himself convinced several star-actors to grace the cast list along with him. He told them they wouldn't get much money for it, but that the script alone was worth jumping on-board for. They agreed.That's some basic back-story for you on how this film came to be, and I feel it is important to keep in mind the fervent enthusiasm and gratitude with which Quentin Tarantino embarked on his debut-director journey. It translates in the eager, rapid-fire dialogue between the characters, the clever pacing of the story and the fresh edge of the narrative. This is a man with a deeply-rooted love for films and who wanted nothing more than to make his own--and now that privilege had been granted, and not a minute too soon. Upon the release of ""Dogs"", Tarantino was rightly vaulted into the great directors' fame and, I imagine, became even more enthusiastic about film-making.The end product is a very good film that sees five anonymous hit men team up for a big heist  an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse that will be central to the wide variety of eccentrically quirky characters who all lend their skills to the job. The heat of the police clings onto them during this task because there's talk of a rat in their group... but who is it? The film starts at the end of the robbery, zooming in on a chaotic bloody state and then backtracks in flashbacksnon-chronologically and a bit babbling, but it still worksin an attempt to answer this question. Does it? Yes, but perhaps not in the way you think.Although this fare is devoid of any profound message, morals or statement and there's no discernible kind of symbolism, it is extremely enjoyable on a basic level. In fact, maybe its straightforward approach to a storybut with criminal diversions, twists and plot-devicesis what makes it so great. This is a clever heist, just take it or leave it. The interactions and actions between the characters are at focus, placing environment in the backseat; this means that Reservoir Dogs can proudly boast of having one of the greatest dialogue-driven scenes in film, and it takes place at the beginning at the diner when Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) explains to the other guys why he does not tip waitresses--the others are compassionate and argue that they are minimum-wage workers no rely on tip, but Mr. Pink is stern: ""Do you know what this is? Its the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses. ""The film is full of gems like these, full of great colourful gangster performances (in particular Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde--the most badass character in history) and full of clear-eyed and gory style. As far as heist films go, this is a grand accomplishment. If anything, it is a bit short (99 minutes). These characters are so interesting that we never feel as though we get to know them enough--it's a little rushed and a little dizzying at times. This is no surprise as Reservoir Dogs was originally written as a short film, barely stretching 20 minutes and with characters that weren't meant to be particularly developed or dimensional. They are more so in the final, long version, but it's still a little too rushed. Although I suppose is intentional on Tarantino's part to signify the hectic pace of the heist and the cops chasing them.Tarantino sported a modest wallet and a modest ego that had not yet swelled to a ""Cro-Magnon forehead""--as ex-friend and Natural Born Killers producer Don Murphy would describe it--when he wrote and directed this film. Indeed, this aspiring filmmaker loved films so much that he would make a lot of enemies and lose a lot of friends during the course of climbing the directorial ladder in Hollywood. No friends were harmed in the making of this film.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Rare Gold,"""Reservoir Dogs"" has great casting, an amazing script, awesome characters and a classic sound track. Perhaps Mr. Pink should move to Australia, a society that tips only when someone deserves it and not because they are doing their job.It is very rare that I give a movie a 10 out of 10, but this movie is just gold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pardon Me While I Bleed!,"I've been trying to see a lot of seminal films when possible. This is one that had me turning my head from time to time because of all the gore and disregard for human life. It starts with this great restaurant scene, Diner on steroids, where Steve Buscemi proves to be the selfish, cheap SOB that he plays throughout the film. I could watch this guy and his neurotic tics forever. I love films that put us at a point in time and then reconstruct the events leading up to it. Add to this, career criminals, some of whom are totally lacking in conscience. We have Harvey Keitel who is one of our greatest actors playing character with a little moral sense. He wants to find a little good. The characters all go by colors so they won't be able to identify each other if they are captured. Again, Buscemi gets into one of his gratuitous discussions when it is decided that he will be Mr. Pink. There is so much violence here, but the movie is at times funny and outrageous in a really insane way. Each guy is a powder keg and they maneuver for position. And, of course, there is ""the scene."" I really like the taut nature of this film, a mere 100 minutes. It moves neatly to its conclusion (well, perhaps, ""neatly"" isn't the best word), and things are tied up well in the end. Despite the huge amount of violence, I can see why people gravitate toward this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Decent film,"From the opening moments of ""Reservoir Dogs"" you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama. The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession. Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal. Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang. The delight is in meeting these characters one by one. The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up. The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime. Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked. The director has included a number of very memorable scenes. This is not a linear film. The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing. This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Tarantino Classic,"This film has me from the opening diner scene. The dialogue makes the characters feel real and intricate. Their actions are explained through their personality, keeping continuity. The film isn't too long to too short, at times conversation can feel a little drawn out. Although, it all makes sense in the end. The film is violent and but it isn't corny, no one is invincible. The weight of bullets and blood is heavy in the film. I'd recommend this flick to anyone that can stomach blood and especially to fans of crime dramas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"I don't mind the language, it's the beating I don't need","I know that this film is highly regarded and that my adverse view is a minority one, but I found Reservoir Dogs unsubtle and uninteresting.I don't really like violent movies, but I liked Pulp Fiction, which I found clever and compelling.  Reservoir Dogs shows some signs of similar flair, but only the odd flicker of it.The strong language I was promised was not particularly ripe - I learned no new ways of saying ""f*** you"" having experienced the entire canon in Glengarry Glen Ross.  Indeed, Mamet does foul language better.  The introduction of the prefix ""mother"" in Pulp Fiction took the language genre much further.  Mostly this film is distinguished only by the gratuitousness of its violence, which is disturbing at times, especially Mr Blonde's frenzy.What little plot there is (and boy, is there little) didn't quite stack up for me, nor did it bring out any real complexity in the characters.I enjoyed the opening scene in the diner, haggling over the morality of tipping, but it was downhill from there for me.Good performances by Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel in particular.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the most inane and dated movies of our time,"I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I did not know what to think. I mean, it was different. I could not remember seeing dialog like this before or a scene where a guy cuts another guy's ear off. It was unique in that regard. Mind you, it was different, but not really special. Moreover, some parts were very boring. Other parts were so ""talky"" and somewhat over the top, that they strained credibility. However, there were some funny lines as well. After having watched this again, some ten years later, I can say with all honesty, this film has not aged well. On second look, you see what looks like a first year film student project. It still has funny lines, but the story is paper thin. The actors tend to over act and the dialog is so full of Clint Eastwood wannabe one-liners, that you just roll your eyes. Michael Madsen cannot act, sorry. He is cool, but he cannot act. Tim Roth's attempt at an American accent makes him sound like Ralph Cramden from the HoneyMooners. I was just amazed at how bad this film really looked to a more mature person. The funny lines just don't cover that constant posturing of characters that have no real depth. The movie is cotton candy, it looks filling, but is far from it. Perhaps there will always be 14 year old boys around to give this ""cool film"" high marks, but I fear it will grow more ridiculous the older I get. However, Tarantino has this cult of personality going and I am sure the 10s will continue coming in for this film and a 10 might mean perfect in here, but that don't make it so.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Ten years on - still brilliant!,"It's hard to get your head around the fact that 'Reservoir Dogs' has been around for ten years. It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another ""dog"" movie from the same era that I saw, 'Man Bites Dog', that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'. Okay, I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - 'In The Soup'), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - 'Thelma & Louise'), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - 'At Close Range'), there is a lot of  depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal ""Tarantinoesque"" movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'. His imitators just simply don't have a clue!Simply brilliant cinema, and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Perfection.,"This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It has the perfect amount of mystery, suspense, comedy, action and witty dialogue. It also is not too short and not too long, in that it does not drag on with useless scenes. I feel that every bit of screen time is utilized to the max.Six men who know nothing about each other, and only identify each other by their assigned colours, plan to steal a shipment of diamonds from a diamond wholesaler's. The heist itself is not shown and we can only piece together what might have happened from the stories the men relay afterwards. This causes a bit of a Rashomon effect, in that we don't really know %100 what may have happened. It becomes increasingly apparent that there is an undercover cop lurking among the misters and they must find out who it is before it's too late. The resulting consequences will go down in cinematic history.I have seen this movie at least 10-15 times just in the past year. I definitely would recommend this movie to absolutely anybody. You don't necessarily have to be a movie lover to enjoy this movie. Just sit back, relax and allow Quentin Tarantino to take you away to his cinematic universe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Unmasking the Reservoir: A Dive into Tarantino's Timeless Crime Classic""","Quentin Tarantino's *Reservoir Dogs* is not merely a film, it's a gripping exploration of loyalty, betrayal, and the stark shadows of moral ambiguity that permeate the criminal underworld. Released in 1992, this independent gem astonished audiences with its clever non-linear storytelling, sharp dialogue, and a unique ensemble cast that breathes life into unforgettable characters.The film opens with a group of criminals, each given a color-coded nickname to protect their identities during a heist gone terribly wrong. The brilliance lies in how Tarantino constructs his narrative, flipping back and forth in time, unveiling character backstories alongside the unraveling events of the heist itself. This approach not only keeps viewers on the edge of their seats but also allows for a deep dive into the psychology of each character, from the enigmatic Mr. White to the volatile Mr. Pink.What sets *Reservoir Dogs* apart is its razor-sharp dialogue, infused with pop culture references and darkly humorous exchanges that add depth and distinction to the film's intensity. Tarantino's script features moments that oscillate seamlessly between light-hearted banter and nail-biting tension, making the interactions among the characters feel strikingly real - and painfully relatable.The performances in *Reservoir Dogs* are nothing short of exceptional, with a cast that includes Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi delivering portrayals that haunt and captivate. Their dynamic interplay invites the audience to question not only the characters' motives but also the nature of trust and survival when loyalty is put to the ultimate test.The film is a masterclass in minimalism. Tarantino's decision to focus on dialogue-driven scenes, rather than extravagant action sequences, magnifies the impact of each revelation and twist. The sparse settings emphasize the claustrophobia felt by the characters, further immersing the audience into this crime-laden tale. Coupled with an eclectic soundtrack that enhances the film's mood, *Reservoir Dogs* becomes an audio-visual symphony of tension and anticipation.In retrospect, its influence on the crime genre and independent cinema cannot be overstated. *Reservoir Dogs* redefined narrative structure and character development, paving the way for future filmmakers to explore the gray areas of morality and characterization with the same audacity.*Reservoir Dogs* isn't just a film about a heist, it's a profound commentary on human nature, underscored by Tarantino's signature style. It invites viewers into a world where the lines between good and evil blur, leaving them pondering the truths of loyalty and deception long after the credits roll. A true masterpiece that continues to resonate, challenging and thrilling audiences anew with each viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A simple story told in original way,"What is good about this movie? Probably the same things what makes other Tarantino's movies good: great soundtrack, good actors, stylish direction and of course - violence (actauly there was only one scene which I would call really violent). The plot is pretty simple but it's portrayed out of chronological order (just like in Pulp Fiction). Probably that is what makes this movie different. Also everything in a movie looked pretty realistic (like violence) and all characters acted very natural (there were many memorable dialogs, so you could know each character better). This movie is very original, stylish and worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A piece of movie history.,"By owning this movie you own a little piece of movie history.The absolute most fantastic thing about ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the brilliant dialog. The movie is one big memorable quote and it alone makes the movie more then worth to watch.Another wonderful thing about the movie are the characters. Rarely has there ever been so many great, cool and memorable characters in one movie. Maybe it's because of the amazing cast, everyone is perfect in their role I'm not going to especially mention a few because I feel I then won't do enough credit to the others and credit they deserve!The story is told in an unique way by using flashbacks from how they all got the assignment for the mission and flashbacks from after the robbery, not shown in the right order. And it works wonderful! It's a shear pleasure to watch from beginning till end.The hand held camera work gives the movie an extra cool feeling, it might look a bit unprofessional but it's nothing more then a brilliant addition to an already brilliant movie. The nice and cool ""Super sounds of the 70's"" soundtrack also adds to this, especially the now world famous thanks to the movie ""Little Green Bag"" from the George Baker Selection.The movie is full with memorable moments such as the fantastic opening, the cop torture sequence and the Mexican stand-off at the end. But between all those scene's there are lot's of other moments which you will never forget.Brilliant movie. An absolute must see!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best Tarantino-film,"Reservoir Dogs is easily the best film Quentin Tarantino has directed. Much better than Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown.

A crime classic? Very doubtful.,"I clicked the play button with huge expectations for this movie, alas 'Reservoir Dogs' did not show any evidence of being a classic one admired by most of the critics. The much-loved Quentin Tarantino impressed with his first work, which definitely shouldn't be considered as one of the best crime thrillers of all time. It would be a big mistake to think of it as one.'Reservoir Dogs' follows the story of a newly formed crew that has the simple, yet dangerous job, which eventually would go terribly wrong - a diamond robbery. The intriguing thing is that the 6 members (1 of them is an undercover cop) of the crew do not know anything about each other, and are given new names by the guy who hired them - Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney). The movie starts with a conversation between the members of the crew that of course has nothing to do with the film plot itself, reminiscent of a conversation between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in 'Pulp Fiction'. During the robbery (which is just described), when the alarm goes off, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) starts shooting at everyone like a psycho. That's the moment when the police officers arrive and things go nasty very quickly. The criminals should gather in a barn after the jewelry heist. Unfortunately there's only 5 left of them, the other 2 are shot dead.The best thing of this movie was definitely the acting of Steve Buscemi. In the role of Mr. Pink. Steve shows that he has the ability to give the needed color to a movie with his unique acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I still don't get it,"People sure love this movie.  I have a friend who says that it's good because of the ear-slicing scene; most directors would cut away from such violence entirely, but here, we get to see the aftermath of a maiming.  Well yeah, ""Reservoir Dogs"" does push the envelope - but towards what?  Should we really praise a movie just because it wallows in violence more willingly than its predecessors?My ex-girlfriend says this is a Greek tragedy.  If that were true, the violence would be entirely justified, because it would help elevate ""Reservior Dogs"" to the level of an enlightening commentary on human nature. Alas, none of the characters is particularly noble; they start off as low-lifes and have nowhere to fall.  So, that defense doesn't seem to work either.In short, people have long tried to convince me that this is really a masterpiece.  But even the best parts - such as the opening dialogue in the restaurant - seem artificial and engineered.  Tarantino is ripping off older, better films and directors wholesale.  There are shades of ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" here, and there's also a dash of ""The Omen"" at the end.  Hitchcock, Frankenheimer, and even John Carpenter did this kind of stuff before, and they did it better.  No doubt Tarantino was a breath of fresh air after the shallow era of 1980s action movies, but he was not much of an innovator, and I don't think that his super-cool style has stood even the shortest test of time; he has, after all, practically dropped off the face of the earth.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This is the classic indie film,"Tarantino's first film is perhaps the best. The dialogue is just people talking about normal stuff like music, TV, movies and random stories. The action has a realistic brutality to it which causes audiences to cringe and it has the best soundtrack a film has ever had. The cast is the stuff of indie film legend. Keitel, Madsen, Buscemi and Roth. Madsen shines above all these others due to his performance and the actions of his character. This film has been called overly violent but I didn't find it shocking to watch, entertaining but I grew up on Braveheart, Terminator and Pulp Fiction, three films I saw before I saw 'Reservoir Dogs'. This film is truly great, an instant classic and a must see film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Classic Tarantino Crime Caper,"Simply put, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. This 1992 predecessor to 1994's ""Pulp Fiction"" is truly in a class by itself.  This film has been a blueprint for basically every other wanna-be-like-Tarantino movie made in the last seven or so odd years.  The acting is truly superb.  Every one of the main characters turn in top-notch performances.  Harvey Keitel's turn as the o'er-the-hill criminal MR WHITE is perhaps his best ever.  Micheal Madsen's take as the psychopathic MR BLONDE is perhaps one of the most realistically frightening performances I've ever seen.  This was truly the role he was born to play.Rounding out the cast, you have the always enjoyable Steve Buscemi (MR PINK), Tarantino favorite Tim Roth (MR ORANGE), Tarantino favorite Quentin Tarantino (MR BROWN), Chris Penn as NICE GUY EDDIE and finally.....(whew)....Lawrence Tierney as the cranky mob boss JOE CABOT. The cast is utterly superb.One aspect of Tarantino's is his ability to say so much with so little.  Though the scene involving MR BLONDE'S shooting spree is never actually seen in the film, it is all too easy to picture Micheal Madsen in his JoeKool shtick, blasting holes into anything moving with eerie unemotional detachment.   Tarantino BUILDS his characters with amazing style. (see Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, etc...)  MR WHITE'S compassionate struggle to protect and save the life of MR ORANGE is gutwrenchingly moving. True ""honor among thieves"" type stuff here.All in all, this movie is a classic.  Be cool.....man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Practically tailor-made for a film buff (as well as for a viewer who watches occasionally), 'Dogs' is a picture loaded to the brim with terrific visceral energy","Whenever the name Quentin Tarantino is mentioned nowadays, people treat him with the same reverence as Scorsese, De Palma, and other directors as such who have fiddled around with the crime/gangster genre to create personal, heavy-duty masterworks.  However, at the time this film was first released, as was with his still best picture 'Pulp', he was regarded as a filmmaker who makes violent movies, filled with violence, chock full of violence, ""too violent"" (if there ever could or should be such a thing in movies), etc. This is unfair.  True, Tarantino writes and works his actors to such an intensity that the feelings that go with violent acts and violent tension is there, and true he shows the blood, he lets us hear the cries of agony and despair, and indeed there are times that bullets fired into people are shown as such right in frame.Yet he never exactly displays any truly violent acts (he decided to leave the shot of Masden slicing the ear on the editing floor, unlike a director like David Lynch who gets right inside the matter) - his technique is to evoke and strive for all of the emotions one would feel in such asituation, movie or in real life, to the most honest, near heart-wrenching limits, and thus to someone who may have even not even seen the film the images that appear in a trailer or on a video box bring the notion of this being an overly violent movie immediately.  That the images we see throughout the film, bloody or not, stay with us long after the credits roll, is a testament to his dedication, and obvious trust, to his craft being as it is.The plot, while lifted from a Chow-Yun Fat film from the mid-eighties, is the first one to include his trademark non-linear storytelling design. Sure, this is not uncommon in most films, but since each scene has a meaty quality to it, with line after line of (purposeful, to story as well as character) dialog is spoken, you really don't know what to expect.  A crime boss (Lawrence Tierny) assembles different criminals of different backgrounds, removes them of their given Christian names, and gives them pseudonym colors as the heist comes up.  The robbery itself has a big hitch- cops are alerted sooner than thought, shoot-outs occur, some colors are wiped away, and the remaining assemble in the rendezvous to sort out what went wrong and who's to blame.For most films with such an ambitious and grounded script, nearly every performance is a crucial asset to the film's success, and Tarantino knows this in his bones, as well as in the casting of the right parts (i.e. Steve Buscemi auditioned for Mr. White but got Mr. Pink, makes sense doesn't it): Keitel and Tierny are like old pros merely portraying old pros; Roth has a true breakout performance as Orange; Busemi himself proves why he's needed in film today; Chris Penn makes for a fine supporting role; Masden is one of the most convincing of the 90's psychos; even Tarantino makes a perfect monologue for himself in the opener.  Right away these actors give off the only impression they should - these are people that we can care about, despise, or watch in a lack of judgment as they float away in a flash - they've got to be human all the way.So, is Reservoir Dogs for everyone?  Not necessarily- children under the age of nine or ten, I'd suggest, should stay away even if they can understand and take the violence since it's really an film for maturer mindsets.  But, for the passionate movie-goer, or for thrill seeking screen nuts, it's worth the ride.  For one thing, I'll never think of ""Stuck in the Middle With You"", or Steven Wright for that matter, the same way again.  My opinion- Tarantino's 3rd best effort behind Pulp Fiction and From Dusk Till Dawn, and nearly superior over Jackie Brown.  A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Fun, amusing, and creative but doesn't really lead up to anything like it wants you to believe.","Reservoir Dogs is a crime thriller starring Oscar nominee Harvey Keitel (who also starred in Taxi Driver) and Tim Roth (from Rosencratz & Guildenstern Are Dead). It is directed by Quentin Tarantino, directing his first feature-length film. I've got to confess that I was disappointed. I thought it was going to be fun, creative, wonderfully weird, etc. The whole thing didn't really seem to have a point. And the fun dialogue got old after a couple minutes into it. And it just kept building up and I thought it was going to lead up to an amazing climax, but it didn't. The whole film leads up to nothing. Thus it being pointless.One thing I have to give the film is it is creatively directed by Tarantino. The use of music during the torture scene really lightens the mood, even though someone gets his ear cut off. It just would've been stupid without the music. And the opening scene where all the guys are at a restaurant talking about normal things is amusing and one of the best opening scenes in a movie ever.But it all goes downhill from there. Like I said before, Tarantino makes you think like this is going to be a great film but it ends up disappointing. I really wanted to love this movie because of its creativity but the script completely ruined it for me.I don't recommend this movie but I do recommend Tarantino's next film, Pulp Fiction. All of the positive aspects of this film that I mentioned above are in Pulp Fiction but ten times better. Plus, Pulp Fiction has a good story and actually leads up to something.

A timeless classic,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All CostsA film telling the tale of the after-math of a botched bank raid by a gang of professional thieves. The rapid alert of the police and word-of-mouth has also drawn the conclusion of an undercover police officer in their midst.Upon it's initial release, this flick caused the biggest stir in movies since The Exorcist. A generally violent, foul-mouthed movie at the best of times featuring the notorious ear-cutting scene. Although having seen it, I can't really see what all the fuss was about. The camera veers away from that shot, whereas in Robocop you saw a man get blasted to bits by a gang of crooks with guns (as well as seeing him writhing in agony whilst they laugh at and taunt him!) and another scene where you see a man's testicles apparently get blown off after an attempted rape, yet to the best of my knowledge that was never banned, or even Candyman 2 where you actually see a man's hand being severed off with a rusty blade whilst similar taunting is going on which was never banned. I suppose the graphic, real shot of the man who's been shot in the stomach at the beginning might have played a big part too, though (in a way, it's certainly a lot more shocking than that scene.)But all that controversy aside, we are dealing with a truly legendary film here. A small, low-budget, art-house production that leaves you more fulfilled than any big-budget, Hollywood production ever could. There is a genuinely impressive, shining quality to the writing, dialogue and story-telling at play here that no doubt cemented Tarantino's ascension to his current glory. Moreover, you can see what are probably the earliest hatchings of the 'reverse-plotting' trend starting here that lead to such films as Memento getting made.All of the cast are excellent, and it can only be the work of the hands of fate that while some went on to really make names for themselves (Tarantino, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi) others (Michael Madsen, Chris Penn) just got delegated to either supporting roles or straight-to-video roles. I suppose if I had to pick particular favourites, they would be Buscemi as the edgy, mechanical brains of the group, and Madsen, who has a quiet, un-nerving edge to him that seems typical of a genuine psychopath.It is basically a film driven by dialogue and atmosphere, with a cracking soundtrack from artists as diverse as Steeler's Wheel to Dolly Parton. It's controversy may have given it a helping hand and the name 'Reservoir Dogs' is never actually explained, but for far better reasons than that, this is a film that deserves never to be forgotten. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An incomplete heist in an incomplete movie.,"I was not satisfied with Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"". The movie starts off with some lighthearted comedy and then transitions into more serious events. It is a good way to engage and hook the audiences, but unfortunately, this hook only lasts so long. The twist is easy to predict, and the movie is extremely dull. I felt none of the characters were extremely fleshed out, so there is not really any reason to attach to any of them. The ending was decent, but left me feeling a little disappointed. With already mostly unlikeable and boring characters being the center of the movie, an ending like this doesn't work. If you take away the one or two likeable characters it really disconnects the audience. Overall not my favorite Tarantino movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Second-hand, second-rate cut-and-paste job.","To quote the great Terry Rossio:""There are many films with the goal 'to find your way home.' But there's only one film where a girl clicks together a pair of ruby slippers.""What that basically means is that the goal of many stories is essentially the same. The 'find your way home' example is used in films such as E.T., The Wizard of Oz, and Back To The Future, just to name a few. Only one of those has ruby slippers. Only one has a bicycle fly past the moon. Only one has a time-traveling Delorean.The goal of 'criminals getting together to pull off the perfect heist' has been used is such films as The Killing, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, and City on Fire...just to name a few. Only one had an un-chronological order to the events. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had the criminals use color-coded names to keep their identities anonymous. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had an undercover cop infiltrate a gang of crooks and befriend another crook, only to get shot during the process of the robbery, until he confesses the truth to his new friend. Until Reservoir Dogs.If you cannot see that this entire film is just a cut and paste job, then you have to be mentally impaired. And that is not an insult.As far as originality goes, Tarantino hasn't got to that point yet. The point where he creates something on his own. This is just a second hand, second rate cut and paste job that is only mildly entertaining on first viewing. Upon seeing the film subsequent times, it only gets worse, and it's (very many) flaws only stand out to an even more obvious extent. This is a bad movie even for someone who has never directed anything before in his life.The film starts with a discussion that might as well be about Jesus, pancake syrup, or the duties of the school crossing guard. None of these have anything to do with the story...much like the conversation we see before the opening credits roll. Which brings me to another discussion that takes place later on in the film...something about Lady E and a superglue incident. How is this any of our business? How does it advance the story? What do we get out of it besides a possible forced laugh of pity? It's not our business, it does not advance the story, and we get nothing out of that scene at all. You can literally remove it and be left with the same exact film, just without that scene. From the point before that scene started to after it finished, NOTHING HAS CHANGED AT ALL. It's complete filler. A total waste of time.This movie would have been pretty good without extraneous scenes floating around, popping up at random, and taking entirely too long to finish. The best example of this is the whole Tim Roth segment. It interrupts the flow of the story and it simply not fun to watch. It's a huge dead moment right before the climax of the movie and it's very easy to simply lose interest at that point. When the finale does come, it's more of a ""good, it's over"" point rather than any kind of realization. Tarantino couldn't even create a good third act when he literally just copied the third act from City on Fire, and in some cases...shot for shot!Resertvoir Dogs showed us nothing that we have not seen before...literally. The only positive thing about it is the cast, and that's even not so great. Most of the dialogue is just screaming and f-words being used like it's going out of style (and it has, thanks to films like this), and the ""infamous"" and ""extreme"" violence is about on par with The Lion King. So if you're thinking about watching this movie...just watch a good heist movie instead. I suggest:The Killing The Asphalt Jungle The Taking of Pelham One Two Three",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Tarantino's Only Interesting Movie,"I really find Tarantino totally overrated: He tries to make an impact by overwhelming his audience with unbelievably gory scenes, while his films lack any substantial and interesting element; the ""Kill Bill"" series are a prime example of this lame strategy. However, there is one single exception to the above: ""Reservoir Dogs"".To start with, ""Reservoir Dogs"" still has the necessary Tarantinesque blood galore and shocking scenes, although these are more limited compared to his other films. Moreover, blood is not what makes ""RD"" stand out: Instead, the film has a very distinct style, as it depicts the characters of the movie in a very ordinary, ""next-door-guy"" style, while they commit not-so-ordinary crimes. The dialogs, the setting, the suspense, everything is very simple and yet very different in its way, as the film has a structure which is elementary yet intriguing. The plot is also quite simple (five strangers perform a bank robbery and then try to find a rat among them), yet it achieves to keep our interest in high levels until the very end. The performances are good, with Harvey Kaitel being first among equals.Pity that Tarantino did not make any other movies like this one. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Bleak and Disturbing Film from a Treasured Director.,"** / **** Reservoir Dogs is an interesting beginning to one of America's finest filmmakers careers. I loved Pulp Fiction in so many ways but most of which came from the last 15 minutes of the film in which we understand Samuel L. Jackson's journey in the film. It is that quality that is missing in Reservoir Dogs that, in my opinion, is the film's failing. The film is nothing but graphic pain and violence. There is nothing to endear any of the characters to us (unless you are endeared to people that like to mutilate people to hip 70's tunes). The characters have no real journey. The dialog is inventive (as we expect from Tarantino) but the plot is not. It's about violence for the sake of shocking the audience. It's disturbing in the ways that a horror film is disturbing without the payoff in the end. The film is extremely popular and that disturbs me more than the film itself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Dialog Masterpiece,"This movie is awsome! The dialog is perfect from start to finish. The opening scene is one of my favourite opening scene in movies.

And the secrets of the plot are slowly told but once they are revealed its still has interresting. Each character have some very special aspects about them, and its probably the movie with the most different interresting characters. The ending is truly one of my favourite, and its very special because there is just a few writer that dare end their movie this way. The chronologic order is awsome also.

And then, there's the...well, let's just call it the ear scene. You will very likely squirm during that scene.If nothing else, we can say that Quentin Tarantino gave us a preview of his later films. Maybe his later films don't make your skin crawl, but but they all deal with lowlife culture. And you'd better believe that the characters in this movie are lowlifes.

Overrated,"It's official. I don't like Tarantino movies. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the most overrated movies I've seen in a long time. Even the awesome soundtrack couldn't salvage some level of enjoyment from me.Steve Buscemi was great as he usually is. But beyond that, there just wasn't much I liked here. I love some violence and swearing as much as the next person. But here, I can't help thinking Tarantino used it in such way as to draw attention away from the fact there isn't much below the surface of this film.People love over-indulgent, long guitar solos in songs - and Tarantino movies often feel like the film-making version of that. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is no exception. This felt like some end-of-year final assessment in film school or drama class. I don't watch films for their technical aspects. My attention waned numerous times throughout overly long scenes and lengthy dialogue that had no purpose. ""12 Angry Men"" is an excellent example of how to do that in a way that is both artistic and entertaining. This is not.The use of flashbacks and change in timelines didn't do anything to keep me engaged either. The bare resemblance of a storyline just felt soulless and depressing, with it seemingly going nowhere. Unfortunately, far too often people consider yelling to be acting at its finest and most dramatic. The love for this movie and Tarantino movies in general will forever be the big mystery of cinema for me.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino's first & best.,"Despite not being a high budget Tarantino film, it is my favorite one. I saw Pulp Fiction indeed, but there are some things:
1) The cinematography in Reservoir Dogs (for me) is slightly better, as it captures every moment perfectly.
2) Characters are more understandable.
3) Movie focuses on same characters who are connected to the same story which makes it easier to follow.I believe all of the actors did a pretty good job. Movie is violent no doubt so be careful if you're new to Tarantino. If you already know him and like his movies you've probably seen this but if you haven't, go see it. Also note that the gunplay is remarkably good.10/10 (Orginally a 9/10 but I had to give an extra point for the rewatchability factor)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A true classic on its own right...,"It seems that it was only yesterday when in 1992 the then unknown director Quentin Tarantino screened his debut film, ""Reservoir Dogs"", at Sundance with great success suddenly becoming the new star of independent cinema and an the most promising director of that ""class of 1992"". Of course, later came ""Pulp Fiction"" and what started as a phenomenon within the indie scene became a worldwide success starting a trend of imitators and making Tarantino a powerful figure in Hollywood. But despite the rights and wrongs of Tarantino's career, the groundbreaking ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a fine example of excellent cinema and a classic of the 90s on its own right.The plot begins with two criminals, codenamed Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), arriving to an abandoned mortuary. Orange is badly hurt, and soon we discover that they are members of a group of criminals hired to make a robbery, and that the crime went wrong when the police showed up ending in a shootout where the two of them barely escaped alive. After another survivor, Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), arrives, the group realizes that they were set up by an infiltrated agent, but since only their boss knows the details about them (including the real names), anybody in the room could be the traitor. Finally, the arrival of another member, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), complicates the plot, as the other three are sure that he is the one who betrayed them.Without a doubt, ""Reservoir Dogs""' greatest strength is in the remarkably well-written script by Tarantino himself. The four main characters are fleshed out in a way that makes them very real, very human; each of them with a distinct series of personal traits that one can't help to feel that you know really them (something ironic, considering they are supposed not to know each other). The whole situation, built as a heist film where the heist is never seen (only told via flashbacks), makes these four personalities collide and actually the relationships between them become the point of the film itself. It's not about the crime itself, but about the criminals who committed it.Tarantino's skill as a director is nowhere near his skill as a writer, but still he creates a very stylish film letting all his influences flourish, particularly the french new wave and classic noir heist films. Although it's safe to say that here they don't become as blatant as in this later ""genre tribute"" movies ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Kill Bill"". With very simple, but effective camera-work and a great use of incidental music as a soundtrack, Tarantino crafts a superb film despite its budgetary limitations shows a very promising talent with huge potential as a filmmaker.The four main characters are wonderfully played by a very effective cast of actors. Harvey Keitel (who also produced the film) shows off his talent as the experienced Mr. White, who becomes some kind of paternal figure to the newbie Mr. Orange, in another of Tim Roth's excellent performances. Steve Buscemi gives his usual high quality work and the cast is completed by a Michael Madsen with tremendous presence and total control of the screen. Supporting characters are played by the very effective Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney. Convict-turned-author Eddie Bunker and Tarantino himself appear in small roles with mixed-up results (Tarantino is not really a good actor).The film is remarkably well-done for its budget, and despite being set almost entirely in a single room, it never feels tiresome or boring. Tarantino's violent crime drama has hold up well and personally, it rivals his follow-up, ""Pulp Fiction"", and at times it surpasses it. Some minor flaws include Tarantino's own lack of acting skills and an use of violence (not graphic, but somehow disturbing) that may be excessive to some people (although it fits perfectly within the movie's theme and atmosphere). Almost a flawless film.Wheter one loves or hates Tarantino becomes meaningless at judging this film, its qualities makes it speak for itself as one of the best movies about crime ever made. It's hard to dismiss its raw power and creative craftsmanship. Maybe not a perfect film, but definitely the closest Tarantino has been to make one. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Anything For Attention!!!,"When viewing information about different movies, and their respective reviews on this website, officials posted that this movie was likened to the film ""Diner"". At first, I found this to be a very peculiar comparison!! The minute I popped this movie into the DVD player, I realized the similarity to both movies, particularly with regards to the introductory dialog... I like this type of opening scene, the gist of it being whereby the incongruity of conversation effectively depicts the twisted character portrayals of the pivotal actors in the film !! The camera angles to the coffee shop pontifications, as illustrated in ""Diner"" and in ""Resevoir Dogs"", were extremely poignant!! As was the case with ""Diner"", ""Resevoir Dogs"" depicted an overtly energetic camaraderie with everyone conversing at the coffee shop table. The film, ""Diner"" provided a succinct illustration of kindred spirits which were precocious, with ""Resevoir Dogs"" the bonds were rather macabre!! Focusing now on ""Resevoir Dogs"", that guy who was adamant about not tipping the waitress struck an intensely sensitive nerve cord with me, as I used to be in the food and beverage industry. How did I feel about that guy? Put it this way, if he thinks his manner of killing someone is gruesome and sickening, once a bunch of bartenders get a hold of him, he ain't seen nothing yet... While I detest the term ""ain't"" as it is a colloquialism for the illiterate, it is seemingly appropriate in this case!! Speaking of colloquialisms, this movie was full of them. The F word was habitually used in the film ""Resevoir Dogs"", in fact it was the movie's favorite colloquialism!! The F word is basically an interjection, however, the usage of the F word demonstrates an amazing versatility which accommodates virtually every part of speech, it is very amenable when used a as a gerund as well!! Such an excessive use of this word in ""Resevoir Dogs"" bares a precarious resemblance to the movie ""The Departed""... My G-Rated euphemisms are not displayed here because I am so delicate, rather, it is because I am aware of IMDb's comment guidelines!! This film was about a bunch of reprobates who were amused by their irrational conclusions, and delving into a complacently convoluted logic became their favorite hobby!! Why were all of the characters in this movie so thwarted? Come on!! I have to be at another appointment in about a half an hour!! When someone talks about seriously engaging in a first class felony, they get attention, once they totter with the idea of murder, people are all ears, at least they should be!! Such lamentations evoke a very lethal excoriation against the ""establishment"". Quentin Tarrantino directs this film, and, he is without a doubt, an unprecedented cannon of creativity!! His overall motif of blood and violence is his notoriously successful trademark, ""Pulp Fiction"" being his prize piece!! While compared to the movie ""Diner"" I may be one of the few who likes ""Diner"" better, of course, I am civilized!! Nevertheless, ""Resevoir Dogs"" is a remarkably well made movie which tries to use the recreation of murder as the ultimate and prevailing diatribe of circumstantial justification!! It (""Resevoir Dogs"") has an innovative approach to larceny, and a criminal's code of ethics!! You watch ""Resevoir Dogs"", I will guarantee you that you will not be bored!! The acting, the directing, and the aggregate creation of this film, falls into the category of sensational entertainment... I give this film a perfect ten!! See it when you're angry!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Poetic Justice,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the rare films that lives up to its hype. Much like ""Goodfellas,"" this film did not let me down, but I actually enjoyed it much more than I ever dreamed.The film plays backwards, a bit like ""Memento."" It opens at the end, and recounts the last few days in the lives of crooks pulling a jewelry heist. But as we learn immediately in the beginning that the heist went wrong. Someone ratted to the cops; the cops showed up during the heist and all heck broke loose. But I may be getting ahead of myself.In the beginning of the film, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) in a car. Mr. Orange has been shot. We don't know how, he just has. Mr. White brings Mr. Orange to a warehouse, and the two men enter. Eventually Mr. Pink (the wonderful Steve Buscemi) shows up, followed by Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), a crazy madman who opened fire on civilians at the jewelry heist. For the duration of the film, we are left to wonder who the cop is/was, and how everything happened.Things open up bit-by-bit. We are shown every Mr.'s life in the last few days before the heist, and what all happened. Of course, the men aren't really Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange and Mr. Blonde. These are their fake names for the sake of the heist. But we learn their real names and the parts they play in he robbery as the film moves on. And the last twenty minutes of this film is one of the most absorbing twenty minutes in film history. Things appear all of a sudden. For example, how Mr. Orange got shot. Once you realize who shot him and why, things start to make more sense. Because knowing who Mr. Orange is makes you wonder why he got shot. But who is Mr. Orange? Is he the cop? Or is he someone else? See the movie for yourself and figure it all out.""Reservoir Dogs"" ain't no ""Goodfellas,"" but on the level of film it is a masterpiece. The opening scene is one of the most mimicked scenes in film history. And the performances are extraordinary. Harvey Keitel fills in the shoes of Mr. White, who some said Robert De Niro would have been better for. In all respect, I do like De Niro better, and admit that the character carries many traits that De Niro's characters usually do. Cool under pressure. Smart. Always thinking. You can see his brain working like a clock. But I must also admit that Harvey Keitel did a very, very good job of bringing his character to life. You can almost see the chemistry between the actors boiling up. I like films where there aren't many characters, because you will almost always find the actors on screen giving some of the best performances of their lives. They are locked with these other actors, and their performance just gets stronger with every line they speak. Take, for instance, the tension between Mr. White and Mr. Blonde. Keitel and Madsen really go at each other, and it's great. And Buscemi, my personal favorite of the group, is not only funny, but fun to watch on screen. His performance is as great as his humor.""Reservoir Dogs"" isn't for everyone. It's rough, tough, gruff and at times sickening (see the police torture scene). But if you can handle some very strong violence and language, then this film is for you. It's got some amazing talents, some fairly unknown at the time, bringing together one well-written, well-directed film. Quentin Tarantino has said to be losing his charm for making a good film lately, but no one can forget this film.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Powerful; brilliantly written and consistently engaging, Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the greatest debuts if not overall films of all time.","Reservoir Dogs, at least for me, is one of those films that sneak up on you in terms of long term opinion. The first time I'd seen Reservoir Dogs was after a wave of Tarantino enthusiasm having watched and loved Pulp Fiction, a film released two years after this little masterpiece. But I was disappointed; I felt like I hadn't been taken through the roller-coaster ride of emotions; laughs and thrills that I had been with Pulp Fiction, a few months prior. But looking back and after many further viewings, Reservoir Dogs has snuck up on me because I now value it a little higher than Pulp Fiction and bizarrely enough, I get more of an emotional kick out of this film then Tarantino's follow up.Perhaps it was my naivety in regards to independent film at the time that I didn't take to this after the first viewing, but any doubts towards this not being an excellent and spell-binding film have since been laid to rest. Reservoir Dogs is a film that delves into the past from the present, setting up several characters; situations and stories within flashbacks that all combine to deliver a hair-raising climax with plenty of other dramatic, some more gruesome than others, moments thrown in for good measure. Reservoir Dogs is at its very core, a brilliant and emotionally fuelled film that twists, turns, creates doubts and delivers on levels of artistic creativity, out and out action and stupendous dialogue without ever feeling like a gimmick.Some of my favourite scenes in the film rely on slow motion such as the German Shepard police dog barking in the cloakroom amongst the other officers and Cabot (Tierney) lighting up a cigarette as he gives his opinion on the false story, smoke flying up all around him as another voice-over kicks in. Then there are the scenes in the warehouse in which Steve Buscemi playing Mr. Pink and co-producer Harvey Keitel playing Mr. White deliver some fantastic performances aided with dialogue that sums up the situation, mentality and emotions running high given that scenario they find themselves in. But the film knows how to rope us in and juxtapose our feelings and emotions without ever feeling manipulative. Some examples of this is are at the very beginning when, after a quiet and relatively subtle breakfast conversation, Mr Orange (Roth) lies screaming and bloody in the back of a car  something has gone wrong. There is also the incidence when Mr Blonde (Madsen), during that infamous 'ear' scene, leaves the action to go to his car in order to get a can of petrol. These juxtapositions and toying with the audience sums up not only the brilliance of being able to switch between scenarios but also highlights Tarantino's skill as a writer/director.The truth is that any scene that takes place in the warehouse rendez-vous is just pure genius, whether it is dialogue between two or three people or the torture scene or the unforgettable climax. A diamond robbery has gone wrong and the immediate theory of an undercover cop crops up thanks to the quick thinking of Mr. Pink; the more outgoing and independent of the thieves. But this seed planted in the audiences mind is one of a few things we are to concentrate on throughout the duration. Twinned this, we get numerous flashbacks and, indeed, flashbacks within flashbacks that tell us a greater deal of information involving the heist and the characters past situations. But here several things work at once: Nice Guy Eddie (Penn) arrives and maintains there is no 'rat', perhaps disbursing the theory of a traitor, challenging the audience to work it out. Mr. Blonde is established as someone who is just out of prison and his awkward situation involving parole officers and such doesn't faze him as he accepts the new job from his former employees of the heist. This creates a dangerous opinion of him in our minds, further emphasising the earlier opinion we had of him when it was established 'Blonde went crazy' and shot several people, including a young woman. It is an appetiser for what's to come, especially when he has a policeman at his mercy; but my favourite bit is when we learn he went to a drive-thru restaurant at a time of crisis and with a policeman in his boot.But these criminals in suits are not caricatures of mobsters from other crime/heist films. Mr. Orange screams and squeals in agony after being shot thus expelling any 'tough-guy' stereotype we may have of these guys in this genre. It is later established to great effect that he is a very humble and humane person, with bigger fish to fry. Tarantino executes a film here with random flashes of violence such as the torture scene climax and Mr. Pink's breakaway flashback. He lands his pop culture dialogue with talk of Madonna; The Silver Surfer and likens Gene Tierney to 'The Thing'. It even transpires some of the guys enjoy Lee Marvin's work. Shot on a budget with the help of Harvey Keitel but written with a budget of a lot less in mind, Reservoir Dogs shocks but entertains; humours but does not glamorise and generally gives its viewer a kick every time they watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

For the dogs.,"The idea that Quentin Tarantino could be seen as a great filmmaker for ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" is ridiculous, and ""Reservoir Dogs"" is proof exhibit A. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is simply one of the most shamelessly plot-driven movies I have ever seen. First of all, what is the point of the commode story? In the movie, the crooks are supposed to keep their mouths shut, but Tarantino has Mr. Orange go on and on, pointlessly, about the commode story just so Tarantino can make an attempt at art filmmaking by showing Mr. Orange talking to the actual police officers in the bathroom and dry his hands in slow motion. Talking that much would only make it more obvious that Mr. Orange is a policeman, anyway. Also, as one viewer pointed out, Mr. Orange doesn't shoot Mr. Blonde before Mr. Blonde cuts off the police officer's ear. Want to know why? Because Tarantino needed Mr. Orange to hear the bad guys say they were going to return to the warehouse after ditching the cars, but he also needed the ear-cutting scene. What else was there to do except make Mr. Orange not give a damn about the police officer, which is totally ridiculous. Also, why in God's name was Mr. Blonde going to set fire to the police officer? Wouldn't that have drawn attention to the warehouse hideout? Sure, it would. But Tarantino threw out that logic just so he could make a ""thrilling"" scene as Mr. Blonde prepares to set fire to the police officer. Also, what sense does it make to have the warehouse in the middle of a neighborhood? What a bunch of smart crooks. It's no wonder they couldn't snoop out the undercover cop.This movie shouldn't even have made as little as it did (one million, I believe).

Tarantino's best!","Now don't think I'm being biased on my opinion because Quentin Tarantino is my favorite writer/director hands down, but you've gotta admit, this is one awesome movie. Another thing that makes this so special is that this is the first movie I've ever seen. But enough about that. This movie is down right amazing. The performances (especially by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen, who plays a convincing psychopath) we're incredible. Also great and original, was the plot (about a bunch of criminals who team up to commit a diamond heist, but turning on each other when it goes haywire), but most of all, the script was the glue that held the movie together. It was funny, cool, pop cultered, and vulgar. The only thing that let me down was the short length (compared to other Quentin Tarantino epics), and the ending, but overall, it was a fantastic movie experience and one of the best movies ever made!

I've never enjoyed movie dialogues like this in my life,"Just wow .. What a masterpiece .. This is the third trip with my third director after Scorsese and Kubrick and now the role of Tarantino and frankly impressed me from the first film .. His way of narrating is great even though it's his first movie .. I loved the use of music in the film, especially the music of the 70s .. A film about a robbery, but you don't see a robbery in it and at the same time it grabs your attention throughout the film .. The dialogues are great .. Tarantino's way of writing scenes is very fascinating .. A film that makes you get along and enter into literally every dialogue with them .. A film full of violence, but surprisingly fun .. It's a fun movie to watch, but at the same time it hurts .. A lot of twists to take out and a great shooting angle .. I expect that this is where Tarantino really got his start and formed his own style .. A low-budget but great movie you don't find that much in the Hollywood world .. Tarantino's first film and first masterpiece .. A very great movie .. The negative that bothered me about the film is that sometimes there is a big exaggeration in the violence, an exaggeration in the length of the dialogue and it makes me feel lost .. But in general it's a terrible movie, it's an unforgettable movie and you have to re-watch it every once in a while .. My rating is 8/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Still its a joy to watch!,This is one of those classic movies that have aged very well. I watched an anime named Baccano which I really liked and I wanted more things like that then I read about how Baccano was inspired by Tarantino's style so I decided to go ahead and watch this movie and I gotta say its excellent. Its each and every dialogue is just there to entertain you and it does its job pretty well. I never found myself getting bored and always eager to see whats next. The non linear style also adds to the fun and I really like this type of movies which are like a puzzle which we can solve as we go along the joy filled ride!,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

After crime...,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is a Crime - Thriller movie in which we watch a group of criminals suspecting one another as a police informant after a jewelry heist. Soon things escalate and they have to figure out the truth before it's too late for them.I liked this movie very much because it had a simple but very interesting plot with many plot twists that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Quentin Tarantino was for one more time simply amazing and he did an excellent job on how he presented his characters and their connection to the crime. The interpretations of Harvey Keitel who played as Mr. White / Larry, Tim Roth who played as Mr. Orange / Freddy and Michael Madsen who played as Mr. Blonde / Vic Vega were very good. To sum up, I have to say that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a nice, interesting thriller movie and I recommend everyone to watch it because it is undoubtedly considered as one of the first masterpieces of Quentin Tarantino.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dogfight,"Suspicion and paranoia overwhelm a band of criminals after a tightly plotted heist goes sour in this feature film debut from Quentin Tarantino. The film is built on an interesting dynamic with none of the robbers actually knowing one another since they were all hired by a third party, given code names and were told to not tell each other their true identity. How much can they really trust each other's word and could one of them be a police informant? Intriguing as all this might sound, one's mileage with the movie is almost certain to vary depending on one's tolerance of the dialogue-heavy script. While some of the violence is quite brutal, there is precious little of it as the film mostly consists of the characters bantering back and forth, which unfortunately has a tendency to feel repetitive. The imbalanced time spent on each criminal's background feels a little odd too with some of them far more developed than others. All that said and done, the revelation of the police informant's identity is very well done and the second half of the film has many intense moments. The final few scenes are especially memorable with an outcome that resonates in the mind long after the film is over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Excellent, it tells a good story with minimal styling.","I will start this review by making a warning that I give whenever I dedicate myself to a film directed by Quentin Tarantino: I am not an admirer of this director. On the contrary. I'm even quite critical about his work. Not even Jesus Christ pleased everyone, did He? However, from this filmmaker's long list of works, this film is one of the ones I liked the most, I must confess.The film is based on the failed attempt to rob a jeweler, in order to steal a load of diamonds. The gang is highly professional and was hired by a boss who is superior to everyone. The degree of professionalism and commitment of the thieves reaches the point of not even knowing each other's names, using only nicknames created for the purpose. However, the failure revealed that one of the elements is actually a police informant. What remains is to find out which of the surviving elements is that informer.Some say that this film is very violent. I honestly don't agree. There are a lot of films out there that manage to be much harder to see than this, and I am thinking, for example of the long lists of horror gore (""Hostel"", ""Saw""). In any case, it is a movie for adults, in which Tarantino shows that he is very good when he does not sacrifice everything that makes a film work in favor of the look, style and technique. Superbly done and well written, it tells a story with logic and coherence.The cast is excellent, and combines several big names like Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney and Tarantino himself. I would personally highlight the performances of Keitel, Buscemi, Roth and, above all, Tierney for their quality. Technically, it is a discreet film, which almost clashes if we look at Tarantino's stylized and very visual films. Perhaps this is due to the mere fact that this film was the first major work in the director's career. Cheap to produce, as befits a film made outside the big studios, everything takes place in a restricted group of scenarios and there are few exterior scenes or effects, being a film based on dialogues and the interpersonal relationships of the various characters. Even the blood looked fake, actually.This film is proof that it is not necessary to abuse stylization in cinema to make good films. Just having good actors, knowing how to direct them and telling a good story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An amazing debut for Tarantino.,"So, the in the first scene we have a dialogue where Tarantino explains his view on '' Like a virgin'' by Madonna and i really was into it. With an amazing style and compeling dialogues this picture catched my attention every second. What shows why this movie is so good is the fact that this is probably my favorite heist movie without showing any actual heist.Incredible. Just incredible.This movie also shows us the background of three characters by flashback which are all amazingly done and so necessary for this movie.I gotta admit this was the first Tarantino movie that I cried, the last scene was just too much....Thank you Tarantino, you're the G.

The original Tarantino masterpiece,"It's the original Tarantino masterpiece in which events happen in a nonlinear timeline and overall it adds to the story by letting us know what happens and later on explaining how it happened while showing what happens after. It's quite something and I love it. It's the one where the legendary Diamond heist takes place and all the iconic colorful characters are introduced like Mr.Blonde,Mr. Orange. It's filled with iconic scenes,characters and their interactions between each other, music in the right places to enhance the expierience of whatever happens perfectly and you can never forget the K-Billy's super sounds of the 70s playing in the background in important moments. It just has everything needed for a great movie.

Harvey keitel is great in this as the criminal with compassion. The ending though from the rat didn't make sense he would do/say that. That's my only gripe with the story.

Additionally, the film's reliance on extended conversations and stylized violence may not appeal to everyone.Overall, Reservoir Dogs is a strong entry in the crime genre, with standout moments and a compelling narrative, but it falls short of being a masterpiece.

An ear for dialogue,"Tarantino's feature length debut, despite some problematical tendencies in the dialogue of his intentionally unlikeable cast, has aged tremendously well.

Tarantino's best,"In my opinion this is Quentin Tarantino's best movie. The story is stripped back and lends itself perfectly to what Tarantino does best: hearty dialogue.

It's a visceral film, but not nearly as gratuitous as his other movies. Here, our imaginations give the violence all of its impact and it makes for a more intense experience. The fact that almost all of the film takes place in one setting is a perfect example of ""less is more"".

The scenes are long but feel real, the conversations between the characters are super engaging, entertaining and most importantly believable.There is a lot of attention to detail, small little details that add to the realism of the film, like a character not having a pack of cigarettes on them so they walk over to the next room to get one. I don't know, small things like that, everything feels so natural.The vibe, the pacing, the dialogue. The unfolding of events is gripping, the sense of mystery is great and the revealing of the truth is even greater.The final scene of the movie is powerful, a lot of emotion and it doesn't drag out, once it's over it's done and that's how real life is.Great film to turn brain off to after a long day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"For his first film, Quentin Tarantino hits hard.","Already an inveterate cinephile and brat stuffed with references, he offers us an original gangster film that talks about robbery without showing it and whose action is essentially behind closed Doors in a hangar. Parades because of a limited budget, of course, but which make Reservoir Dogs totally brilliant and which imposes the style of its director, capable of launching crooks on discussions as innocuous as the meaning of ""Like a virgin"" or the importance of tips for waitresses. His universe, riddled with references manages to exist and to make a place for itself without acting as a pale copy. On the contrary, the proofreading of the references is skilful and sufficiently assumed for the pleasure to be there. Whether in the choice of dialogues, the actors (Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth form a quartet of shock) or the violence (the ear scene is just cult), Tarantino seems to amuse himself and benefit its viewer, delivering the first centerpiece of a brilliant and enjoyable filmography.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"8.9/10 - a Well-Made, Instantly Iconic Film","My first Tarantino film IS the first Tarantino film! How apropriate.Anyway, Reservoir Dogs is the directorial debut of one of the most famous directors out there - Quentin Tarantino. It tells the story of a bank heist gone wrong, backwards - I mean, the film starts after the bank heist, and we follow the characters as they try to understand what really happened, thinking that some team member sold them out. We learn what happend and about each character through flashbacks and dialogue, mainly.So, gotta tell ya, I get why this film is so iconic. This film is pretty fast-paced, so it just grabs you in and throws you from one iconic scene to another. The dialogue is so natural, and its flow is truly great. Each main character is so well-written too, and memorable in its own unique way. The acting is mostly solid - Mr Orange, Mr Pink and Mr White are quite legendary acting-wise. Eddie is the only one whose acting fell a little short for me from time to time, but it was decent most of the film. I love the structure, too - it may sound weird on paper, but it works so incredibly well here.The soundtrack is really on point as well, and I honestly think that this is one hell of a debut film.I mean...damn, it's only his first film and it's that good! Definitely looking forward to watch more of his stuff.Feeling an 8.9 on this one. Probably will grow on me with time, but that's for now. Highly recommended.P.s

"Original, Violent, Insightful, Humorous, Shocking...but most importantly, Gripping","From first impression, this film appears to be slow, difficult to follow, and completely random. However, 20 minutes into the movie you will find yourself glued to the television. Being Tarantino's first film, it's not his best but it is still excellent! It operates how you would expect a Tarantino film to do so - in a seemingly unclear, incredibly violent and dialogue-driven manner. However, just like most of his other films, the plot soon becomes evident as the action shifts between characters and time (yes, the film is not sequential, so this may not be the film for you if you have a tough time following these types of movies). If you enjoy movies that really make you think and question some things you believe, especially reality, then this is the movie for you! Tarantino presents a gripping plot that is as real as it gets - this is not your typical Hollywood-ruined crime film. This is reality (or at least, Tarantino's reality).The performance of Madsen as Mr. Blonde / Vic Vega is amazing! I don't believe that the role of this character could have been cast any better. Madsen will remind you of Al Pacino's Scarface with his attitude, and his acting is impressive. Tim Roth also offers an unforgettable performance as Mr. Orange - an incredibly deep character whose story is the most interesting out of all the others. Likewise, Harvey Keitel takes the film to a whole other level with his emotion as Mr. White, especially through his relationship with Mr. Orange and his actions at the end of the film. The ONLY thing I DISLIKED about the film was Tarantino's acting performance, which I found to be completely unnecessary, below-average and awkward (thank God he doesn't play a major role in the film). I understand that it is a staple of his films, but he needs to provide performances like the appearance he did in Pulp Fiction if he wants anyone to like him.Otherwise, this film is a MUST-SEE and belongs higher on the IMDb top movies list!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the Greatest Directorial Debuts of All Time,"Reservoir Dogs is a masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino's knack for dialogue offers the film up as more than just a crime thriller. The film offers extensive intrigue to the viewer with its superb dialogue. The dialogue is masterful and while camera shots typically establishes a film's strength, the dialogue serves as this vehicle's steering wheel. Despite the incredible dialogue, the cinematography doesn't take a backseat. The camera shots elicit the film's thrill, presenting the viewer with scenes that will undoubtedly stick with them post viewing. The script is incredibly written, exhibiting Tarantino's masterful manner of holding the viewer's attention and keeping them engaged despite time jumps. The time jumps and pacing compliment each other and are cohesive throughout the entire film. The film wastes no time getting to the point and answering the viewers questions. The acting in this film is incredible. This cast is filled with incredible leading men who carry on as if they've known each other their entire lives.

Gonzo Hitchcock,"This movie is now as old as the Hitchcock films it imitated were when it was made in 1991. Though not really my cup of tea, the movie is much like the playhouse theater movies of the 1950s and early 60s with emphasis on dialogue and noir violence rather than taking you somewhere. Obviously low budget but that goes with the genre. The cop bashing seemed over the top to the point of pandering and I doubt any cop these days would sacrifice himself to bust some garden variety mobsters. The three way shooting scene at the end also seemed a bit hard to believe given that the the subject of the argument, an informant cop who took a bullet to the gut was about to die anyway. These issues notwithstanding, what was really missing from the movie was one more big ticket star. The trivia says Tarantino tried several times to get James Woods for the movie but his agent didn't pass on the offer to Woods given that it was below what he normally gets for a movie. That is too bad, because Woods wood have been perfect in this movie, say as the wounded police informant. This is the one thing that separates this movie from a Hitchcock classic - Hitchcock always got big stars for his movies to make sure they will be iconic films. I don't recommend this movie because of all the violence and bloodshed. But if you don't mind that, go ahead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A bloody mess of a great early quintessential Quentin film,"***1/2 out of **** starsOkay...I've been a big fan of Tarantino's work since he exploded onto the scene in the early nineties. I've watched Dogs several times and watched it again tonight on IFC with the instantaneous intention to finally review it. Not for the squeamish, this one: large pools of blood; screams of pain; a severed ear; people (cops mostly) being blasted with deafening gun shots...so how can Dogs be so darn funny with so much carnage and suffering? Well, it's what makes Tarantino so darn special; the melding of gut-busting dialogue and gore, along with the prototypical wardrobes of black and white gangsta suits. Let us not forget Quentin's love for 70s nostalgia as well, which in one case is evident in his characters parleying about bygone blacksploitation movies and television shows. And what a fantastic ingredient to use Steven Wright's dead-pan voice to introduce all those archaic B-siders on K Billy's Super Sounds of the 70s.A lot of Reservoir Dogs could be a stage production. I can easily imagine sitting front row in a playhouse watching all the actors hit their marks with precision, and hearing their voices reverberate throughout the building. Obviously, I speak of the warehouse scenes. For me, this is quite an accolade because how often can actors work so wonderfully and successfully in two different mediums with the same story? I realize that Dogs has never been made into a play, but it could be...don't you think?Only a half-wit would bitch about Tarantino's formulaic storytelling. Does every movie have to begin, then go on to the very next thing, and the very next thing, and the next, and the next? Tick tock tick tock? Zzzzzzzz. What brilliance to amalgamate past, present and future with such rotating uniqueness. Keep teaching your audience to tune-up Quentin. Nothing wrong with starting your story somewhere in the middle and going anywhere you want from there. Way to go man, is what I say.It seems as if Tarantino's career will be a bit like Kubrick's: quality instead of quantity. The bummer is having to wait for his next project, which can never come soon enough for me. What I love most about Q is his obvious great love for film-making. He seemingly has a child-like enthusiasm for the creative process, and his love for simply viewing movies, let along making them, is very evident.Keep making movies as if you're watching them for $9.50 like most of us Quentin.

In this, his debut, the dialogue is a constant accompaniment. The only time there is more than ten seconds without a spoken word is the credits.The gangster movie has long had a strong relationship with dialogue. That's one of the reasons there were so many of them in the early talkie era. The wisecracks are part of what makes the genre, and Reservoir Dogs contains some choice lines, like ""You shoot me in a dream you'd better wake up and apologise"". Tarantino – quite deliberately I'm sure – builds the story around numerous gangster clichés. Mr White, the hood with too much humanity. Mr Blond, the sociopathic killer. Mr Orange, the ""rat"". The dialogue is often used, not just to throw in some tough guy banter, but to add layers to these gangland relationships. Mr Orange tells the rest of the gang the ""commode story"" in order to convince them he's a real criminal. The story itself is about a narrow escape with some drugs under the noses of a bunch of cops. Meanwhile the cops in this fictional episode are talking about ""a civilian who came this close to getting blown away"". The anecdote-within-an-anecdote gives a tense commentary upon Orange's tenuous position.Another advantage of this dialogue-based approach is that there is a lot of information for the actors to play upon and a lot of time to get into their roles. Harvey Keitel is very impressive, personifying the honourable mobster. Lawrence Tierney, who was playing lead men of dubious morality four decades earlier, clearly knows just what his character is about, and portrays the formidable crime boss with laid-back ease. Michael Madsen is simply perfect as the creepy, quiet type (although quiet type in this context only means he pauses for breath between lines), giving off an intense presence while barely making a move. Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth both overact a little, although admittedly in Buscemi's case it is to good effect in depicting the weasely character, and even when Roth is waxing lyrical he makes you realise how poetic some of this dialogue is. Maybe it needs a bit of theatricality.Despite of his writing so much wordage for his own movie, Tarantino is still very much a visual director, whose camera seems to be finding angles on the action other than those which focus directly on the actors as they're talking. You have for example the wheeling camera in the opening scene, Tarantino's voice disembodied, a long-shot down the corridor as Keitel and Buscemi discuss their predicament, and the lengthy close-up on Keitel as Buscemi rants offscreen. Actually, these are techniques you see an awful lot in very early sound movies around 1930, when sound itself was seen as more of a gimmick than something fully integrated. It's as if the dialogue has its own entity, gliding over images like that radio show soundtrack.And indeed, a lot of the dialogue is simply there for effect. The essential exposition lines are all there as they should be, but unlike a more typically sparse screenplay, they are buried amongst reams of chitchat that serves only to amuse the audience and add realism and depth to the world in which the story takes place. Tarantino's opening spiel about Madonna's Big Dick is a prime example – completely irrelevant to plot or themes, uttered by a character who does barely anything else of significance in the whole rest of the movie. It seems it is just a funny little observation that Tarantino wanted to say (and, appropriately enough, it is literally him saying it). What we are witnessing with Reservoir Dogs is the beginning of dialogue for dialogue's sake.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the worst movies ever made,"This repulsive, reprehensible trash for Quentin Tarantino has to rank as one of the worst movies ever made.  When I wasn't bored to tears by interminable dialogue, I was repulsed by the glorification of sadism as an alternative life-style.  The Marquis De Sade would have been proud.  Tarantino should put his talents to suitable use and just make a real 'snuff' film.  See 'Clockwork Orange' instead.  That is a work of real genius.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It was connections and luck that got this movie as far as it has.,"All a Los Angels video store clerk had to do was show a script to an acting teacher. Lucky for him, this teacher happened to be the wife of Harvey Kietel, and since he's notorious for his depictions of mobs and the underbelly, Harv just happened to like it and decided to contribute funding it into a feature length film. Unfortunately for the movie, it's not too original and at times non-linear. It's been said that it took elements from Hong Kong director Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"" and redefined film noir. Other way around, it was a rip-off to ""City on Fire,"" and an insult to film noir. Triteness is common in the world of Hollywood. I'm glad James Woods turned away from it.Added on to the stolen plot of the 1987 movie was gratuitous uses of the ""N"" word, 70s music/tends and anal sex. If this were done in one movie, it would be an unusual touch. If it's referenced in all of the director's movies, it's a lack of an imagination. And that is indeed the case if you take a look at Quentie's filmography.A movie that leaves you feeling something for the characters, even if they're low life scum, is crucial for an ending. After bullets went flying before the fade-out, I came away feeling nothing at all.Maybe that's just me; maybe it's just an irony that mediocrity outnumbers the innovative worthwhile in the entertainment industry.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Dealing with delicate themes such as racism, sexism, drug consumption, criminality and extreme"", Reservoir Dogs"" is a daring, fun and innovative young classic","In 1992, with all the limitations that a low budget brings to a production, he releases his first film: Reservoir Dogs. The feature film - written, directed by and starring Tarantino - tells the story of a group of six crooks - Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino) - who plans and executes a robbery, but does not know that among its members there is an undercover police officer.Tarantino had already written the good scripts for ""Love at the Burn"", released in 1993, but previously sold to filmmaker Tony Scott, and for ""Natural Born Killers (1994)"" when producer Lawrence Bender decided to take over the ""Dogs of Rent"" alongside actor and co-producer Harvey Keitel, who was very impressed with the characters created by the former clerk at Video Archives. Many will roll their eyes at the use of the term ""originality"" in Tarantino's theatrical debut, as the director notoriously draws more than inspiration from previous cinematographic works, with ""Reservoir Dogs"" being, among others, heavily rooted in the excellent ""The Killing"", by none other than Stanley Kubrick and in the fun "" Lung foo fung wan"", by Ringo Lam. However, this eye roll is not only snobbish, but also unfair, as the director has never hidden his influences and has always known, since this beginning here, to employ his characteristic vision for each of his creations.Incidentally, this feature of the director is discreetly present in the superb preamble of Reservoir Dogs, in which, with several slow and circular shots, we are organically introduced to the entire cast in a characteristic US diner in which they chat about pleasantries just before the robbery. To a diamond shop, something we only found out later. Among the subjects, there are two reinterpretations of songs, or rather, a reinterpretation and a clarification. Madonna's Like a Virgin is explained by Mr. Brown (Tarantino) not as a puerile love story, but as a woman who meets a very well-endowed man who makes her feel like a virgin when they have sex. Then, ""Nice Guy"" Eddie Cabot (Chris Penn), one of the masterminds of the crime, reveals that, when he recently listened to the radio program K-Billy Super Sounds of the 70s (which accompanies the entire tape with narration by Steven Wright) , he discovered that, in The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, it is the singer who shot Andy, much to everyone's surprise. Tarantino seems to me very clearly warning that his work is exactly that: reinterpretation and clarification of classics.In a brilliant ellipse - thanks to the editing work of the director's partner, Sally Menke, who would accompany him until ""Inglourious Basterds"", passing away the following year - we are taken directly to the outcome of the more than failed robbery attempt, with Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), bleeding liters in the back seat of a car driven by Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and that's where the story effectively begins, with the characteristic non-linear montage of Tarantino and Menke taking the film by storm, which allows returns to different past moments of the characters, including the robbery itself, which even so we never really see. Orange and White, due to the circumstances, establish closer ties, including revealing their respective real names, a basic ban on all planning. That connection is broken with the entry of the paranoid Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) in the warehouse that is the hangout of the ""Dogs"", who immediately begins to wonder about a traitor among them. Further ahead, it's the turn of the psychotic Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), who has a policeman hostage in to whom he begins to take out all his frustration and sadism.The growing imbalance and distrust in a confined space - the present action is all in the warehouse, something Tarantino would do again in an even more incredible way in ""The Hateful Eight"" - is the great highlight of the work, with the director extracting the best of each of its cast, with special emphasis on Roth, who does 100% of his work (in the present) lying and bleeding and Keitel, a well of sanity (something he would repeat as Mr. Wolf, in Pulp Fiction) between spirits completely contaminated by anger, desire for revenge and enmity. The warehouse of funeral coffins (note the decoration in the background) is the proverbial pressure cooker that the spectator knows will end up exploding one way or another, in a phenomenal job of building tension that is astonishing for its simplicity of execution, something seen even in the basic costumes - black suits - of each character.Another key factor here is Tarantino's almost unrivaled ability to curate songs for his films, and the casting for Reservoir Dogs is where it all began. If the highlight goes to Stuck in the Middle With You, a song that today is inseparable from acts of sadism, especially those related to ears, it is impressive to see how the director - who, according to legend, plays the songs on the set of footage to get everyone in the mood - he manages to dot in snippets from Little Green Bag, Magic Carpet Ride, Hooked on a Feeling and others in such a way that each song seems to have been composed for his handiwork.With few sets and locations, the director works his script in order to bring dynamism to each scene, something that became his trademark from then on. There are the main pillars of his cinematographic style: references to pop culture, stylized violence, a great direction of actors. Everything is already noticed in the opening scene, when in a conversation about the song ""Like a Virgin"", the work introduces us to all the characters that we will follow for the next hour and forty minutes. The choice to draw a non-linear narrative is another differential. Skipping scenes and events, the feature ends up being a robbery movie that is not necessarily concerned with showing the act itself, but its consequences. The tension between the characters grows naturally and the events have a very irreverent comic realism.We still cannot fail to mention the verbose dialogues (with the absolute performance of actors Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn in this regard), and sometimes cruel when dealing with delicate themes of the American puritanical society, such as racism, sexism, drug consumption, criminality and extreme violence. In addition, he launched symbolic elements that extend throughout his career from erudite cinephile bows, quotes to an extensive B-movie cinematography, and various references to pop culture, ranging from music (discussion of Like a Virgin, by Madonna) to TV (series Get Christie Love). Tarantino also elaborated a striking aesthetic repertoire, which transits between the seventy's aura, the gangster underworld, the white trash of the American lower-middle class, the Yankee kitsch, the diverse exploited and a lively gringo horror show that, invariably, ends in a bloodbath.Quite simply, the story - a robbery, which goes wrong, at a jewelry store, a situation whose tension increases due to the suspicion of the presence of a police informant within the group of robbers - has certain gaps filled in by means of flashbacks, which, however, are not inserted in a merely didactic way. Tarantino individualizes the characters through a structure formed by chapters in which each one gains certain prominence. The characters, however, have their identities duly hidden (they are identified by color, in order to avoid that some pass data on the others, if they are captured). Despite this impersonal designation, emotional bonds eventually develop between them, as between Mr. Orange-Freddy and Mr. White-Larry (Harvey Keitel), in that film played by a finely tuned male cast.In any case, the relationships are brutal, judging by the violence depicted on the screen. The contrast between the lightness of the soundtrack and sequences full of blood accentuates the perversion of some characters. The images of the tortured police officer, Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz), and the shot member of the gang, bleeding incessantly, suggest that Tarantino seeks to value the extremes of the body - the extremes of pain -, a perspective highlighted at the moment when both, already almost without strength, they talk. This approach to the body connects Reservoir Dogs to the director's future achievements, mainly to the Kill Bill project (2003/2004). There is also a discreet link with Jackie Brown (1997) through the mention of Pam Grier and the issue of racism, constantly highlighted in the characters' prejudiced comments. Concise, rigorous, irreverent and disconcerting, Reservoir Dogs mobilized a cinephile generation in the early 1990s. The film fully survives the passage of time.""Reservoir Dogs"" is the amalgamation of the Tarantino style of filmmaking, something that many mistakenly claim to be nothing more than copying someone else's work, not realizing that this style became the basis for which crime and crime films of the following decades began to crave and be compared. The director establishes his school here, already in his debut, and, from there, he would move between genres with almost unscathed mastery. Not every debut work has this merit. Here in his first work, Tarantino exudes confidence with assured direction, using elegant camera transitions and a great soundtrack to establish his narrative. Even when we are faced with scenes of visceral violence, the director manages to soften them by employing a certain humor that brings identity to the film. It's not hard to say that in his first film Quentin Tarantino was already a complete screenwriter and director. Since then, he has only improved his technique. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is daring, fun, innovative. A young classic of cinema that ages better and better within the filmography of one of the greatest filmmakers the world has ever known.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fun watch!,"Extremely fun and enjoyable movie. Fast paced yet informative in some way with all the flashbacks. Also you feel a sense of discomfort and urgency the whole movie because of the injured man (Mr. Orange).

Could have added more suspense but as a rather short movie it's perfect.

Tarantino really started off high.,"This movie proofs it. Tarantino became employee of the month on his first day at work. He already had his unique way of designing scenes and dialogues from early on and created a masterpiece out of nowhere.
It was this unique style that captured me from the first minute I experienced it. The way characters were introduced and scenes were arranged was so different to everything I had seen at this point and the dialogues had such impact without being over acted. But not only the spoken word stands out in this movie also the pictures you see on the screen have a whole lot of impact. The way the camera is used has something I can't really explain but it makes every frame of this movie look like a cool poster in my opinion (something Tarantino kept up to this day imo).
Also the story is a hell of a ride and the order which the story is told in is just pure genius and could not be done any better in my opinion.
The puzzle gets resolved more the further you look and collapses in a bangin End.

"Rushed, Anti-Climatic Tarantino Movie","I went into this movie with some expectations. Having liked all of the Tarantino films that I've seen I was hoping for another great movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't really anything special.Reservoir Dogs is about a bunch of criminals hiding out after a robbery went horribly wrong and waiting for each other to arrive. While I like the idea of everyone waiting in one place and having trust issues, I've seen it before in Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight'. I do realize that Reservoir Dogs came out over 20 years before, but The Hateful Eight felt more like an improvement off of this movie. Plus it just shows that Tarantino is reusing ideas at this point. While I did really like The Hateful Eight and not so much Reservoir Dogs, I believe in giving credit where credit is due. Considering Reservoir Dogs came out first, I'm giving it credit for having the idea first, but The Hateful Eight did it much, much better. Otherwise, the plot is generally well done. I liked the beginning the most. For the last twenty or so minutes it's just kind of lame. It's anti-climatic in the end, and very obvious when and how it will end. For a Tarantino movie this is quite disappointing. It's probably the most average way for a Tarantino movie to end, only without the awesome overdone violence and tension.The characters are alright, but relatively rushed. They all have their defining characteristics, but it never really goes deeper than that.Overall Reservoir Dogs isn't anything special. It just feels like the most average Tarantino movie ever, and while it was one of his first movies, it doesn't hold up as the classic that everyone makes it out to be. It just feels like a worse version of The Hateful Eight. In the end I probably wouldn't recommend this movie unless your really interested in it. I really didn't enjoy it that much, and I'm only giving it credit because it probably inspired the idea for my favorite Tarantino movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Defines Tarantino as a Filmmaker,"Reservoir Dogs was Quentin Tarantino's first motion picture. But even as early as his first try, you can see every element that defines Tarantino as the unmatched filmmaking legend that he is revered as. It just might be the greatest indie film of all time. No budget, no SFX, no big sets and no wide distribution. But the amount of emotion, humor, sadism and reality that this film conveys is more extraordinary than any big name blockbuster. The plot of the film is brief, but it works. It's about a well organized heist that goes terribly wrong. Truth is, there is a rat in the whole operation, but who? With that in place, Tarantino takes us beyond what is said on paper and retraces the steps it took these men to get to the predicament they are in now. We see the back stories of Mr. White, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, all without ever meaning to place them in the middle of the conflict. Its a movie that only the viewer can interpret, and the important facts are placed at the forefront to help come to a conclusion. This information works in favor of the main narrative. Some have complained about not hearing the origins of Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. I agree. Perhaps more clarification of their purposes might have enhanced the narrative. Perhaps it would have answered the obvious question, What was the point of this whole operation? I'm sure Quentin would have made the film twice as long and incorporated all of their stories had he made the film today. Needless to say, It does not take away from the experience. In fact, the mysteriousness makes it even more entertaining. Also, Reservoir Dogs will always fall under the controversy of being too violent for mainstream audiences, as well as being highly unnecessary. Well, I disagree. Violence is the name of the game in the life of being a Dog. If that means chopping off an ear while dancing to K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies, then why not? Reservoir Dogs doesn't exist to share a moral. Rather, it shows to us just how something so right can go so wrong. Even if the right was wrong in the first place. Reservoir Dogs is the precursor to the rest of Tarantino's career, and to get started watching the long journey of his success, make sure you pop in this amazing flick first.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This Little Doggie Bites,"Reservoir Dogs is the debut film of director Quentin Tarrantino. While its not a masterpiece like his later effort Pulp Fiction. For a first time effort coming from a video store clerk who didn't go to film school, this is a remarkable achievement in the world of independent cinema.The storyline is simple. Crime lord, Joe Cabot and his son ""Nice Guy"" Eddie have arranged a diamond heist. To cover their tracks, they hire several associates who don't know each other personally and thus can't give information out in case they get arrested. These associates are Mr White (played by Harvy Keitel), Mr Pink (played by Steve Buscemi), Mr Orange (Tim Roth), Mr Blonde (Michael Madson), Mr Brown (in a cameo by Quentin Tarrantino) and Mr Blue (played by real life former criminal Eddie Bunker). The heist immediately fails ending with a massacre that leaves Brown and Blue dead, Orange has been shot, leaving it to others to figure out who snitched them. What makes the plot interesting is not in the story itself but how it's told. When discussing mainstream cinema, Andy Warhol said that ""All the interesting bits of a film are left in the cutting room floor"". Reservoir Dogs is the anti thesis of Hollywood filmmaking. Yes, the heist happens but we don't see it. What we get however, is the events that happen before and after, feeding enough details to figure out what happened.This is Tarrantino's skill as both story teller and director, he can make details or characters we don't even see seem significant. Part of this is easily attributed to the excellent script. This is where the dialogue deserves a special mention. In an ordinary film, the dialogue is typically used just to explain the plot to the audience. Tarrantino breaks this rule by letting his characters converse from Brown's graphic explanation of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" to the humorous interaction between Eddie and Blonde. By avoiding the usual traps that plague Hollywood films, Tarrantino manages to make a movie solely dedicated to its characters and their knee jerk reactions to the heist.Raising the mark even further for the film is the carefully chosen ensemble cast. Harvey Keitel is superb as Mr White. His skills shine in the films early scenes where he shows his empathy with the dying Mr Orange. One might say that this portrayal is almost the exact opposite of the typical hardened criminal.Michael Madson, whilst having a limited screen time delivers the films most infamous scene as Mr Blonde, a psychotic criminal who is both brutal and cool. His dry deadpan delivery sets up most of the films tension. Perhaps the most memorable performance however goes to Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink. Out of the entire cast or characters, Pink is the most interesting which is ironic given that he is the only character we know nothing about. Buscemi manic performance proves equal match for Pinks loyalty and concerns about what is ""professional"" in the crime world. It is the films finest and most articulated performance. Reservoir Dogs is still not perfect though and I wouldn't recommend it to all people. For starters, Tim Roth's performance as Mr Orange while strong suffers greatly from his constantly slipping vernacular. You won't be sure is he's Italian American Mafioso, a street wise kid or simply a whiny brat. Thankfully, his most of his dialogue is kept to minimum as he spends much of his screen time lying in a pool of blood. Secondly the level of violence in this movie is bloody and gratuitous, peaking at the torture scene which was reportedly disturbing enough to prompt several people to leave the theatre. Yes the film is violent, but in the stylized way of the Hong Kong films that inspired it. Thirdly, the film is full of enough profanity laden dialogue to fill a text book. I don't actually mind it though, as it makes sense given that these characters are p*ssed off at the failure of such a carefully planned heist. But if you cant stomach excessive bad language, then isn't the film for you. These arguments should not be seen as detractors to the film though. Would I recommend Reservoir Dogs? That depends. If you're a cinephile, a pop culture fanatic or just want to see a refreshing film, by all means do. If however you're a concerned parent who wants to see something with the children or someone who cant stand such graphic violence and language, then avoid it all costs. Make no mistake though, this is a fantastic film that paved the way for the way for the career of a talented director.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Reservoir Dogs,"Was that as good for you as it was for me? Not really, Quentin. It launched your career and earned you a lot of fans well before ""Pulp Fiction"" came along, but it's not really all that great. Re-watching a film I'd seen once before in high school should prove interesting, but the movie was basically exactly what I remembered it as. Decent story, good characters, some superb dialogue, but nothing much to recommend as a film. This might have made a great theater production, but Tarantino doesn't create a lively atmosphere with his camera, he doesn't do enough to make this feel cinematic. He's no Mike Nichols on ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", that's for sure, but sadly I don't think he even does an okay job with it. The movie is dead, dull to look at. Cheap-looking even. But yeah, some great conversations, but that's pretty much it. I'm not a big fan, and certainly don't understand this one's rep.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Funny, brutal, and intense","Reservoir dogs is a movie about organized crime. Well, it's really about a couple of hired guns who start to lose their cool when a diamond heist goes FUBAR. Everybody is fast to point fingers. ""Someone must be a rat!"", they proclaim as they try to make sense of what just happened. It's fast paced and has a lot of action to go along with. The cast was really strong and so were the performances. When you watch a movie with well-known actors and you start to forget or should I rather say disassociate their real identity with the characters that they're portraying that's when you know that something magical is happening. This movie has all of the above.Some might criticize the sporadic use of racial slurs in dialogues but truth be told; this is how mobsters back in the days used to talk. It adds an extra layer of realism to the movie.The opening scene of the movie is easily one of the most memorable movie scenes and sets the right mood for what's about to happen (in a a way). A bunch of guys sitting in a diner; jerking around and talking about ridiculous stuff. It gives you a good idea about the group dynamics.  Who gets along with who? What kind of people are they really?  Once the diamond heist fails we get to see each character from a different perspective; under extreme circumstances. That's when you realize that all of these guys are real criminals and things start to spiral out of control as suspicions arise as to who the rat is.While the movie is ultimately serious and sometimes brutal there are a lot of really funny scenes to contrast this reality with. Like e.g. the scene where all of them get code names assigned to them.  Let's just say that Mr. Pink didn't like his code name. I personally think that this scene was one of the funniest movie scenes I've ever seen. Took me totally by surprise because I wasn't expecting this type of witty and hilarious writing.Reservoir Dogs is still one of my favorite Quentin Tarantino movies of all time. As a matter of fact one might even argue that this is the movie that kick-started his career as we now know it. It has all the Tarantino signature elements. It's super-realistic due to the frequent use of profanity and the setting. A true masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Is there any better Film Debut than this?,"I feel like since i was in HIgh School this movie has always been the reason i decided to work in the movie industry. This is one of those rare movies that never gets old, has the perfect opening scene of thieves talking about Madonna over breakfast before killing, robbing and taking hostages. It is just like Pulp Fiction where 2 hitmen discuss McDonalds right before killing a few people over breakfast.Tarantino has that keen vision that just makes his fans want more and more. That is why it is hard to rank his movies from best to worst, they are all great and different in their own way. Can't wait to see his new film this year. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best movie stars out there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Maybe still the best, yet most simple Tarantino Flick!","Let's keep it short and simple:
This movie is pretty straight forward and set in stone the concept on which Tarantino would later build many more and also more complex stories.I can't decide on which is my favorite, but this one always comes to mind first.There is just no scene that could be cut out. If you stick with it to the end, you will not be disappointed! Great soundtrack as per usual.The way he tells the story with time jumps is not only there to make it more tense, but is told in a way where we learn the most important things about a character purely through dialogue with others at first and get the blanks and plot-twists filled in at a later point.The most interesting thing is, that this movie is still enjoyable after you know everything there is to know about the characters.Maybe it even gets better, since you get to sit back, relax and let the story and chars just unfold upon you.I'd give this a 10/10 if I only scored Tarantino Movies. Since it has to compare to other movies as well, this one is too niche for a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Reservoir Dogs (1992) **1/2,"This is Quentin Tarantino's first movie -- a really down and dirty, realistic affair about gangsters and what can occur when they screw up a jewel heist. It starts out great (I liked those early diner discussions about tipping and the point behind Madonna's ""Like A Virgin""), and the torture sequence featuring Michael Madsen is disturbing and very effective. But there isn't much of a plot to all of the goings on, and the bulk of this picture consists of a lot of aimless cursing and yelling. I tend to think of the excellent PULP FICTION when discussing Quentin's other movies, as that was the first of his films I'd seen, and I fell in love with it...a real work of art, that movie. So after going back and discovering DOGS, it becomes apparent that Tarantino rehashed some of this for FICTION. Maybe ""fine tuned"" a few things. This is evident with moments like the aforementioned discussion and philosophies in the diner. And Tarantino's obviously fond of working with the same actors again and again.RESERVOIR DOGS is an occasionally interesting yet pointless start for the video clerk geek turned director, but he was to really improve and hone his craft with future movies like PULP FICTION and KILL BILL. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Wow, a movie about gangsters cussing and waffling on, BORING!","This movie just bored me no end. It was so painful to watch. The direction by Quentin Tarintino was terrible and the actors were very miscasted. I watched this with my friend and he also thought it was terrible. Nothing to admire, no action, just cussing. There's no point going to the message boards saying that you don't like it, because if you do people at the message board will use anything as an excuse for you to love it. ""If you don't like it you don't get or you're an idiot. It was Quentin Tarintino's first film, go easy on him."" Don't let tall this get in the way of your opinion, because this movie was stupid and pointless. Very predictable too. So I wont even say anymore.I recommend it to anyone who loves Quentin Tarintino.

"Harvey Keitel was born on May 13th, 1939","Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut is a rollercoaster of a film. He uses plot devices, that were still fairly infantile at the time. His use of flashbacks, flash forwards and plotlines, coming from different angles, was still something that wasn't done a lot. Basically, the plot of the film revolves around a group of criminals, who attempt a jewelry heist, that goes bad. Once they all start to gather at the safe house afterwards, the problems begin to increase. One problem being, there is a mole in the nest. Each of the members of the gang are tagged with aliases, using different colors, in order to hide as much of what each other knows about each other. It is a way of hiding as much information, that police might get out of them later. You have Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), just to name the main ones.Tarantino's gritty storytelling techniques thrive in this film. This film is a textbook example of his style of exploitation. His need to give homage to classic 1970s-style, sensationalized crime thrillers, utilizing the exploitative aspects of those films, is what makes this film a real good one see. That is what makes all his films good ones to see. His use of sub-genres, taking them to their limits, exploring their gritty, violent, shocking sides, is what his style is all about. He also knows how to use them to his advantage, crafting a slick story, full of energy. His actors put all they can into the film, mostly from the respect that he garners from them. They are all very convincing performances, including Tarantino himself, as Mr. Brown. This is the Tarantino film you need to see first. It harkens to you, that which is yet to come. It is a fantastic filmmaking career, that is 30+ years strong now.7.8 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS,"Quinton Terrentino yet again proves that he is one of the best writers and directors in the game.I can not go on about this movie enough. I've seen amazing movies. The Departed, Zodiac, Goodfellas, 7even. This movie stands up there with them in that it was just amazingly written. Amazingly well screened. And amazingly well casted. If you are looking for a movie that is gangster. Crime-filled. Action-packed. And just overall ball-kicking amazing. This is the movie for you. A couple of things that took it a part from the rest is that the scenes were all very thought out and drawn out. Each scene ranged from 6 minutes to even 15 minutes. I watched this movie very late so I was tired. But even still I was drawn to the screen every second of it.The acting was absolutely impeccable. Every line was said without a stutter and showed you exactly what was going on in a crime gangster way. The language was a lot but very expected and well thought out in the moments. It fitted the situation very well which made it not stand out. There are a lot of movies out there that overdo the swearing a lot just to make it darker, which doesn't work a lot of the time. But this movie made it fit in well enough that you didn't even notice as much.The whole movie was filled with a tension and release method which made you drawn to the screen a lot like I said before. There were no scenes in the movie that didn't need to be there which made it enjoyable and easy to watch comfortably.I rated this movie a 10/10 and I will stand with that rating until I hit my grave.

Modern Masterpiece,"I don't know if this movie is worth a 100%, but the fact that I had the courage to give it a 100%, shows that this movie is something more than great, it's a masterpiece, and although I think it's not as good as ""Pulp Fiction"", it's almost there.Six criminals, who are strangers to each other, are hired by a crime boss Joe Cabot to carry out a diamond robbery. Right at the outset, they are given false names with an intention that they won't get too close and concentrate on the job instead. They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads among the group members and one of them is killed in the subsequent shootout along with a few policemen and civilians. When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated meeting point (A warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.Quentin Tarantino, which is one of the finest directors of all time, impressed me more as a writer than as a director in this movie. Right in its first scenes, we can see how well made the screenplay is, the conversation about ""Like A Virgin"", and about tipping are priceless (He really convinced me that I should only tip when the waitress really deserves it). The dialogue is incredibly funny and unusual, that in it's first film, Tarantino defined his own genre. Some dialogues are so original, like when Mr. Pink (Buscemi) asks Mr. White (Keitel) about Mr. Orange (Roth), ""Is it bad?"", and Mr. White answers, ""As opposed to good?"". Or when Mr. Pink asks Mr. White if he killed any real people, and he answers, ""No, just cops."". Or the classic ""Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy? Or you're gonna bite?"".The acting is really great too, Keitel makes a tough, but sensitive Mr. White, Buscemi makes a Mr. Pink that only cares about getting out of there without going to jail, not carrying about the others, and Michael Madsen does a charismatic psycho, and sadistic Mr. Blonde, that doesn't care about anything. It's hard to talk about the other actors, without giving any spoilers, so I'm not gonna do it, although they all deserve highlights.Verdict: If you are a Tarantino fan, you'll idolize this movie, and even if you don't like this director, you'll recognize this is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Depressingly vicious story about violent criminals,"Ok, Tarrantino's films are exceptionally well made. This one too. But I have to say I didn't like it very much.Like Pulp Fiction this film has some wonderful dialog. It was the promise of that, that attracted me to it in the first place. (So, clearly I saw this second.) However, unlike Pulp Fiction, you are not left with warm and uplifting memories of delightful, witty conversations at the end, instead the movie leaves you depressed and feeling sick at having just witnessed humanity pretty close to its worst. The unnecessarily vicious scenes of violence and endless ranting of angry men screaming at each other are what you take away from this film.If that's your idea of a good night out, you'll watch this and enjoy it.

TARANTINO'S BRILLIANT BLOOD SOAKED DEBUT MASTERPIECE,"RESERVOIR DOGS was always my favourite of Tarantino's films growing up in the 90's, most people loved ""Pulp fiction"" the best, yes it's also BRILLIANT but i like the simplicity of his masterpiece Debut movie & his brilliant ""Jackie Brown"" infact it's his 90's films that completely gripped me into the world of Tarantino!!! My love has grown more now for the smart & intriguing storytelling & characters of his underrated Jackie Brown but his low-budget Cracking Crime Thriller RESERVOIR DOGS will always be my favourite Tarantino movie & one of my favourite movies ever!!!! His little Heist Flick is a memorable, iconic & extraordinary piece of filmmaking & one that i hold close to my movie loving heart.
I absolutely love his ""90s Trilogy"" as i call it as each film was outstanding, Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown, what a set of films by probably the greatest director of all time!!!Anyway back to the dogs,
I love the ""set in one place"" situation such as the meeting place warehouse where all the intense drama happens after the robbery has gone wrong.TARANTINO shows how great he is from the beginning scene in the Cafe with the crew of criminals chatting & having Coffee together, here the witty & fun dialogue shines right through, it's funny & smart & so different from any other movie as this is a Tarantino movie & it's already unique.I grew up in the 90's & Tarantino was the Coolest Director out there, his films were all hit instant CLASSIC's such as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown plus From Dusk Till Dawn that he didn't direct but was a main star in it as well as producing it & he had written it, so Tarantino was huge.
Reservoir dogs remains a tight, intense & powerful Crime Thriller before Tarantino got longer & more talkative with his films, this remains a simple story that's not too long but is filled with Cool characters & excellent performances!!!
Reservoir dogs is a blood soaked masterpiece of Neo noir Crime & great story telling.This is probably still my favourite Tarantino film, I'm huge fan of his work as he is truly a genius but hey each film he crafts is excellent!!!I could watch this movie over & over again it's that great & smart, Reservoir dogs is such a Nostalgic 90's CLASSIC & for a debut film it's pretty much a MASTERPIECE.
I feel a connection with the genius Tarantino as i love movies like he does, i understand that obsession & I'm a movie geek too & i feel much safer in my movie world than i do in the horrible real world, the film world makes sense to me but not reality!!!
The 90's were the best for Tarantino though in my opinion as i have big Nostalgia for his first 3 films. A funny & compelling little low-key Genre film that is basically a cheap B-movie but crafted like a ""big"" movie thanks to the genius of Tarantino.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Graphic crime film from Tarantino...,"It took me fifteen years to get around to viewing RESERVOIR DOGS and my interest was piqued only because I've come to admire HARVEY KEITEL as an actor. And I might as well admit, I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino either, although I love a good crime film. This one has to do with tough gang members talking about the aftermath of a crime, where one of them is seriously wounded and they suspect someone has infiltrated their mob and tipped off the police.""Did you kill anybody?""""Three cops. No real people, just cops.""The brutal torture scene was a little too intense for me. But the story, about the cop inserting himself into the mob, is well handled throughout, building tension from scene to scene even though the flashbacks are not in chronological order.Standout performances from the entire cast: HARVEY KEITEL, TIM ROTH, MICHAEL MADSEN, CHRIS PENN, QUENTIN Tarantino and LAWRENCE TIERNEY (almost unrecognizable as the Lawerence Tierney of ""Dillinger"" and other '40s crime films).Warning: As usual with Tarantino, the graphic violence is a bit much with lots of kicking, stabbing, blood gushing moments--and the torture scene of a young cop is almost unwatchable in its intensity and cruelty.But all in all, a powerful film of its kind with a ""crime doesn't pay"" morality tacked onto the brutal ending. If only Tarantino could tell his tales with a little more finesse--but then, he wouldn't be Tarantino, would he?Warning: Not for children. Too intense, too graphic.Seen now, it's almost a forerunner of Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED with the same gangster brutality and the dialog peppered with profanity in practically every other word.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The birth of a legend,"It's so impressive to see a film like Reservoir Dogs come along and change the entire crime genre. With a budget of around $1.5 million, it goes to show how you can do wonders regardless of how low your budget is.Reservoir Dogs follows a group of criminals that are trying to find out who amongst them is the rat after a heist goes wrong.This was Quentin Tarantino's debut film and what a debut it was! This movie is packed with a stellar cast including the likes of Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Alongside that we were introduced to Tarantino's impeccible writing. This movie grips you with its tight dialogues right from the beginning with the infamous ""Tipping"" discussion and keeps you hooked throughout its short runtime due to the talent onscreen and fast pacing. The music choices were very fitting and suited the film's tone. Whilst the film does get really violent, none of it is unnecessary. I feel it reflects the personality of each character perfectly especially Madsen's character.The performances are all very strong. Harvey Keitel does an impressive job as well as Tim Roth. Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen are really fun to watch and make their characters really believable. Lawrence Tierney and Chris Penn are also great in their roles and play them equally well.What I really loved about the film was the way it was structured. The fact that we don't see the heist from the beginning makes the film really unpredictabe as we're constantly doubting who the rat is. There are some really funny and memorable moments throughout that make you realise why this movie is such a classic. The only problem I had was the way some scenes were shot but it also shows how much Tarantino has grown as a director.Reservoir Dogs is really entertaining. None of the characters feel boring, the plot doesn't stray and the fantastic writing by Tarantino gave an amazing first impression of his undeniable talent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Great Directorial Debut,"I just watched Reservoir Dogs for the first time in a while.This movie blew me away when I first watched it in the early 1990's and I still love it. I have always considered this Quentin Tarantino's best movie.The dialogue is amazing. After watching so much awful dialogue in movies lately, I appreciated this even more, this dialogue just pops!!We only see parts of the escape from bungled diamond heist in flashbacks, and we do not actually see the heist itself, instead we get the aftermath.As for the acting, everyone is superb. None more so than Michael Madsen, he has a menacing screen presence only a few actors achieve!! He is amazing. We're it not for Madsen, Harvey Kietel would have walked away with the movie. Steve Buscemi is fantastic as the frantic Mr Pink too. There is seriously not a weak link in the cast.Amazingly. this was filmed on a budget of $1.2 million.This is quite an achievement for a first time writer/director.

Simplicity and Style,"This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. Quentin Tarantino has always had a knack for writing great dialogue in his movies, which spend less time dazzling you with explosions and hot actors and more time pulling you in with unique story lines and entertaining discussions that's not to say he hasn't had his fair share of adding flair to his films but I've always felt the focus was more on his characters and what they have to say as opposed to what they were doing. Reservoir Dogs is easily one of his best films, there is a certain sense of simplicity to the scenes, the writing is flawless and the characters are entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Shallow, unintelligent and pretentious","Quentin Tarantino seems to concentrate his movies very much along the lines of ""cool"" and ""tough"" and pulpy storylines and characters. To me, his scripts come across as done by someone who reads too many B-grade comic books, mainly because his movies have very similar content.The story is very thin, and to sum up the what you see on the screen most of the time: there's a bunch of cookie-cutter emotionally retarded tough-guys who compete over who can deliver the coolest and toughest lines to each other and wave their shiny guns at each other with the right sort of swagger. That sort of thing is just so ho-hum, clichéd, and juvenile that I felt like tuning out right away.Mixed into this macho posturing is some gratuitious violence (even to the point of being repulsive at times, for example when Mr. Blonde gets his way with the cop) and a couple of ""cool"" stories in the vein of Pulp Fiction's story about McDonald's in France (what depth). Too bad it's pretty much gloss over content. The only flash of intelligence in this movie is right at the beginning where Mr. Pink delivers his speech on tipping. That's what kept me somewhat interested at first. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.This sort of movie doesn't appeal to me at all, although I'm sure it has some appeal to teenagers who consider the like of _The Fast and the Furious_ to be ""cool"". Me, I guess I'm just too old (27) to be impressed by this sort of trashy stuff. Had I seen it ten years ago, my review then might have been somewhat different.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Intelligent, engaging, bold and invigorating; a great debut","For me, there's too much emphasis placed on Tarantino's technique of cinematic self-reference and personal homage. Although it has become something of a defining characteristic of his work - even more-so since the release Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003) - it is simply one single layer of a rich tapestry of elements that make his films so effective. When Reservoir Dogs (1992) was first released, the referential aspect was almost completely ignored. Instead, critics applauded Tarantino for his strong characters, clever dialog, use of violence and music; and the effortless use of structure and narrative, which helped to turn a seemingly pedestrian crime-thriller into an exciting and enigmatic exercise in cinematic tension building. Over the years, audience have noted the references to films such as City on Fire (1987), The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974) and The Killing (1956) (though Tarantino claims to be more influenced by the original novel, as opposed to the Kubrick film) and dismissed these references as simple theft. This is foolish though, and flies in the face of the very cannibalistic nature of film, and the idea that every single story, character and theme analysed in 20th century art can be traced back to a secondary source related centuries before.If you've seen enough films, then you can easily draw surface similarities from almost anything made subsequent to 1970. In fact, in a world in which comic book adaptations and ""foreign language"" remakes dominate the box-office; Tarantino's approach is truly defiant. If he were a musician, he'd most probably be a hip-hop producer - someone like RZA or Danger Mouse - taking ideas and samples from a variety of different works and blending it all together to produce something new and exciting. So the themes may be well worn, but the presentation and technique is electrifying. Think of that opening scene in particular; a seriously minded discussion of the textual-interpretations of Madonna's Like a Virgin and a debate on the ethics of tipping that not only sets the scene - quite literally - for the use of dialog to follow, but establishes the single characters and their personalities perfectly. We take it for granted now, but try to think of any other American crime film made prior to 1991 that manages to successfully appropriate a scene of pop-cultural discourse into the opening sequences of a tense and violent thriller. Then, look at how it moves seamlessly into the credit sequence; a moment of decade defining cool that some have seen as a nod to A Clockwork Orange (1971), though it really serves a far more functional means of further introducing this broad ensemble of characters, so as not to over-complicate the actual viewing of the film once we get into the telling of the story.There's then a flash-forward, introducing the idea of a fractured narrative. Again, we take it for granted, but think about it; any other heist film and the scene of the heist would dominate. Here, we don't even get to see it. As a result, the botched robbery and the violence that is described to us takes on a more enigmatic purpose, creating something of a Rashomon (1950) like conundrum in which we're forced to take these varying characters at their word, and - much like the protagonists of the film itself - draw our own conclusions and allegiances. By not showing the heist, Tarantino adds to the tension, not only between the characters on screen, but between the characters and the audience. It's a radical move on the part of the filmmaker; as jaw-dropping as making a film about the D-Day invasions without ever showing the soldiers hit Normandy. The film is also remarkable for the atmosphere that Tarantino creates - both in the way in which he stretches out shots and scenes beyond the point that most other filmmakers would, and of course, in his careful use of framing, minimal production design and the use of hand-held cinematography - all to establish a sense of urgency and unease that escalates as the plot goes backwards and forwards on itself. It's a definite pressure cooker-like environment being developed throughout, as each scene builds and builds and then cuts back in on itself; giving us more of the back-story and further reinforcing the bitter ironies of both the characters and that ending.It is also helped by the fine performances, with every member of the cast defining these characters, not simply as archetypes or conventional components of the narrative, but somewhat believable human beings. This quality is pushed further by the use of the fragmented narrative, as Tarantino presents the story almost like a jigsaw puzzle, with information held back from us until the right juncture in the narrative, at which point we can finally put all of the pieces into place and then stand back to appreciate the view. Without question, Reservoir Dogs is a tense, coolly ironic thriller that not only subverts the usual codes and conventions you would expect to find in a heist thriller, but does so in such a way as to remain light, effortless and greatly entertaining. Today it is synonymous with changing the landscape of mid-90's cinema; creating a brief resurgence of intelligent, character driven films that were quirky, self-aware and filed with that spirit of independence. However, before the hype and the greater success of Pulp Fiction (1994), it was simply a great film; one that presented a clever story, cinematic characters and an unconventional approach to on screen violence that reminded people that you could have more from cinema than a bland reproduction of a story.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino is a lyrical genius,"I consider myself to be a film buff, a lover of the cinema, maybe even an addict.  I will see a film because it is a film.  For example, I knew I was going to hate the Virgin Suicides and I saw it anyway.  I have heard nothing positive of Battlefield Earth and I am heading there after this review is completed.  And on this logic alone I rented Reservoir Dogs for the first time in 1993.  I had heard of a new man on the scene that apparently was the talk of Hollywood.  I had also heard that there were some pretty interesting actors in the film and I had heard that Harvey Keitel was the one responsible for getting the film started.  So I was intrigued to see what the fuss was over this film.  However, the first time I saw it I was rather impartial to it.  It's not that I didn't like it but I just thought it to be okay.  I didn't really get what all the fuss was about but I did have a hard time watching the torture scene.  So I put Reservoir Dogs away in my mind until Pulp Fiction came out.  Because by the time Pulp Fiction came out Tarantino had penned the story for a brilliant True Romance and for Natural Born Killers and he had a few hysterical cameos in films like Sleep With Me where he attacked famous films like Top Gun and what they really meant.After I was swept away with Pulp Fiction, I went back and watched Reservoir Dogs again and this time I saw something that I didn't or couldn't see before.  I can't really put my finger on what it is or why it is that I didn't see it's brilliance before but I just didn't.  But Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the best movies ever by a new comer.  Forget how it is directed because it's direction is fine, but what Reservoir Dogs has that is sheer brilliance is an ear for dialogue.  There is not one character in this film that doesn't have at least one insightful thing to say.  Even Tarantino gives himself some great dialogue with his take on Madonna's Like A Virgin, or his displeasure with his given name by Joe ( ""Mr. Brown sounds too much like Mr. Shit!).There are certain films that perhaps should be mandatory viewing at film school, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs should be two of them.  This is one of those films that if perhaps you didn't quite like or understand the first time around, you should see again.  It hits you like an epiphany the second time.  In Tarantino's world, people are never one dimensional.  They have things to say whether it is about tipping or the name of an actress, or the rants of Nice Guy Eddie talking about them having places all over of the place.  I would love to see Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino get together and write a film.  It would probably be the funniest yet most serious film that has ever been made and it would certainly be one of the most entertaining.Reservoir Dogs is a film that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of and you can always catch something that you never caught the last time.  This is truly one of the finest films ever made and if you haven't seen it in quite some time, do yourself a favour and rent it.  It is one of a kind.10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

For one, the cast that this movie has is enough to inspire serious jealousy. Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Laurence Tierney, Eddie Bunker, Chris Penn... hot damn! You really see just why everyone wanted to make a film just like this one after it was released. It's funny but the film is so derivative of other crime films that it becomes an entirely new animal. Tarantino delivers a film that is completely sure of itself and what it wants to be. Yeah, some people complain that it's a ripoff of other films that preceded it, namely Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"" but still, the film has so many memorable moments and gobs of instantly quotable dialogue that it is undoubtedly a classic of independent cinema. Tarantino's acting in this film is thankfully subdued. Violence comes in sudden jolts and reminds you of what kind of people it is you are dealing with within the film. The music selection is inspired and he does a great job of establishing these characters through their words and actions, which is why this film is so great. You have to love the characters, even in the case of Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) who gets much less screen time than anyone else in the film.I would like to at least give a nod of special attention to all of the actors in this film. Every single one is a crucial piece to this puzzle and are all very believable in their roles. If I had to pick one scene that was my favorite, it'd be very difficult. Whether it's an outburst of sudden violence or a conversation across a coffee table, this film delivers in almost all aspects.There really isn't much more that I can say about the film that hasn't already been said. The film is a bit rough around the edges technically speaking but hey, it was the guy's first film and it was filmed on a pretty shoestring budget. Regardless, this is simply the kind of film that one wishes they'd have as a debut film.RATING: ****1/2 out of *****.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
GREAT FILM,"This is one of the best films of all time. Really good. The message of loyalty and betrayal and honor amongst thieves really comes through. It shows the caring side of human nature as well as the bad, more violent side. I thought it was seriously good stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Another overrated project of Tarantino who is just a Jackie Brown with a little more blood..,"My bad, again. I thought it would be more like an heist, bank job movie, at least more gun fight or even fight, violence, in his style,but it wasn't. Just talking and talking and little action, almost none. I hope Pulp Fiction won't disappoint. Peace!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the ten worst movies ever,"I can only imagine that those who like this film find appeal in the violence.  It certainly isn't in the direction or story-telling.  It's an incredibly badly-written and episodic piece, full of irrelevant scenes without which it would only be an hour long.  What is relevant makes no use of the medium.  Characters are not introduced through telling actions, but by introducing themselves in some kind of criminal job-interview. Tarantino's 'genius' seems to be a habit of having the lowest sort of people engaged in violent pursuits converse as casually as ladies at tea.  It's a trick he uses and re-uses in all his films.  Maybe Reservoir Dogs was meant to have deconstructionist elements a la From Dusk Till Dawn, but I think it's just what it appears to be:  a really bad film.William Bell",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Classic!,"Reservior Dogs is a classic film and Quentin Tarantino is just an absolute genius.I really liked this film, it was gripping and suspenseful. Straight to the point and extremely well acted. A few of the scenes were very gruesome but they needed to be. Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde was just crazy but my personal favourite in this film was Chris Penn who played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, I found him to be hilarious. The story developed at a good pace even though it was mostly set in one place with just a few flashbacks.Overall this is well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 250 list, a classic film that everyone just has to see.9/10.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino's Masterpiece,"A group of criminals are assembled to pull off a diamond heist, but something goes wrong and all heck breaks loose. To top it off, the ones who escape must face the facts: someone in the team was a rat. But who was it? And what do they do with the cop in the trunk?I think many people consider ""Pulp Fiction"" Tarantino's best film, and I would agree that it's a fine film. But ""Reservoir Dogs"" uses the same formula even earlier, with a tighter script and solid actors (without relying on heavyweights like Bruce Willis). And, I think it's safe to say, this one has created more of a cult following and generates more homages (the walking in unison scene, the cop torture scene, etc.).We definitely get Michael Madsen's best performance here, and a strong Steve Buscemi. Was Madsen good in ""Free Willy""? Sure, but this is his defining role that kept him popular for the next decade. Buscemi always shines, but again he stands out here like he's not allowed to do anywhere else (with the possible exception of ""Ghost World""). Chris Penn (science bless him) and Tim Roth also are wonderful.Tarantino knows how to incorporate music into his movies -- you have to give him that. Taking lost or forgotten songs and making them sound fresh and new. Stealers Wheel was already known for ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" long before Tarantino put it in his movie, but how many of us can now never hear it the same way again? Radio play of the song likely increased, and we're all picturing the same thing...We also see his strong dialog writing skills. This is Tarantino's best skill: dialog. Sometimes this hinders him (some think it dragged down the pace of ""Kill Bill Volume 2"", almost all agree that ""Death Proof"" was too dialog-heavy). But other times it's the driving force. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is largely memorable for it's conversations, such as the Madonna conversation and the tipping conversation. Madsen and Buscemi are very quotable (""Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?""). ""Pulp Fiction"" steps this up a notch (the watch story, Royale with Cheese, Big Kahuna burger), but the foundation really rests on this movie.If you haven't seen this one, see it. As of this review, it is sitting at the 65th best movie of all time according to Internet Movie Database. I have no reason to deny it that ranking. It might be better, it might be worse -- but it's clearly a strong movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
what an incredible masterpiece!,"Before watching this film i had no previous expectation on the genre nor the plot of the film. People occasionally spoke comments about it, mostly praising it, but other than that i was in the dark.My first reaction seeing the cover was that it would be another action movie. However, when i began to watch the film i was very interested as it began to hook me. The dialogue is brilliant. Simply superb. The only other film that matches this sort of witty, catchy and super cool dialogue is pulp fiction.The whole film is brilliant from start to finish, showing that multi million dollar explosions and car chases are no match for dynamic acting and excellent writing.As for the story, well, i wont ruin it, but it is simply brilliant.Tarintino shows off all the skills and tricks he wanted to show off all the years he dreamed of becoming an director.If you are passionate about films, you Must see this.The actors in this film do not get enough credit, nor does the genius behind the film, the director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

My way or the highway...,"This is one of those movies you simply hate or simply love. It's a quite strange and slow movie. In my case I liked it, but on the wrong day I might not have.Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a bunch of criminals who's going to rob a diamond warehouse. When things turn south they start to suspect someone is snitching. The question is who.Let's start by saying that there are a lot of talking in this movie. It's basically all just talk. It's also kind of slow and almost the whole movie takes place at only one location. It looks like it's one long scene. The story is not really original, but it's well written. It's not too deep witch is good cause if you needed to pay close attention to all the talking you would be tired after half an hour. This film is about the characters and even though you don't get to know anything about their background you get to know them. You kind of feel like one of them. They don't know each other neither and you learn to know them by the way they act and do on this particular job. The characters are well written and by the end of the movie you have a good idea of who they are.The acting is good. Many famous names are on the list, but if they don't go well together it can screw up the whole movie. This is not the case for Reservoir Dogs. On the contrary, they all work well together and everyone gives a good performance. Steve Buscemi is good as always and Madsens ice cold psycho-performance is great. Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel makes a pair of aces.The cinematography is good. Nothing really good about it nor nothing bad either. There's not any really cool shots, but there are some that sticks. The composition is really nice, but the lightning is nothing too special.One thing Tarantino really know is music. The use of non-original music is genius. It's risky as people may have a relationship to that song and so they may get the wrong impression, but Tarantino manage to succeed. It fits the scene, looks cool and sounds great. This part is really half the experience.To watch this movie you'll need to have an open mind. It's not a ""normal"" movie (but then again Tarantio's not quite normal either). You can turn out to like this movie or you can turn out to hate it. I liked it quite a lot and it's a technically good movie. My personal advise; watch it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very violent but still brilliant,"I have seen this for the first time in October 2017 and found it good. However, last February I rewatched and I found it even much better. Even tho is not for everone (don't let your kids or sensible friends see it) is still great and has to be seen at least once. I also respect that the movie was made on a tiny budget and not by a big studio. Quentin Tarantino managed to assemble a slew of actors known for villanious roles (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and film noir veteran Laurence Tierney) and it's in some sort an homage to film noir.Now, since it has to date 1289 reviews and it's on IMDB's top 250, I'll cut to the chase. Suffice to say that the aforementioned guys end in trouble after an heist doesn't go as planned and there is the suspect that one of them is an undercover cop. For the rest, is bloody, full of bad words and very violent... but brilliant and with a great ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My Favorite Tarantino Production???,"There are so many perspectives on which to praise ""Reservoir Dogs"". First and foremost, it has the edgy realism that began to slip away in the ""Kill Bill"" films (which I still very much praise and enjoy), and was completely discarded in his recent film ""Inglourious Basterds"". It's like recently Tarantino let his fame go to his head and just went all out without thinking about if what he showed on screen made any real sense. This film of his, basically his first three, are the ones I admire the most. Not to mention the way the story is told, it's just very intriguing from the start. We see only brief glimpses of what actually happened at this bank job that apparently went very, very, bad. The cast was phenomenal throughout and this film had the chemistry to really make the tension play out realistically and brutally later on. The atmosphere is solid and full of well acted malice and is pretty unpredictable. In fact, amidst all the insane and gruesome scenes which some may struggle to sit through (""Can you hear me now?"")is a very nicely paced plot that in reality is probably one of the greatest crime/thriller pieces ever written.The talent here is undeniable, and every performance is just awesome. The ones I really admired the most were that of Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, and definitely Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink. And where as I believe every individual character stood out quite well, the two that stirred up the most in me was Tim Roth as the nefarious Mr. Orange, but over all Michael Madsen as the sadistic Mr. Blonde. I will never forget Madsen as the soda sipping psychopath. Tarantino does well himself I must admit, and kudos to the often over-looked performance of Kirk Baltz as the unfortunate Officer Marvin Nash.With its tremendously talented cast breathing life into these characters we know so little about, coupled with its very involving story and well placed music, it all comes together as arguably Tarantino's most refined work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Hardened criminals on parade,"Mr. Pink: You kill anybody? Mr. White: A few cops. Mr. Pink: No real people? Mr. White: Just cops.This is probably the most succinct characterization of this movie. We are talking hardened criminals here that have no regard for cops. Killing them is a sport. This movie shows the criminal mind better than any other I have seen. It is raw and hard and bloody and violent. It is not full of shootout and special effects. It is pure and clean and focused on conversation that gives some insight into what a criminal goes through. The anxiety after a botched job becomes paranoia and suspicion. Yes, it is justified, but here you see it to the extreme.Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi were a joy to watch even though I would have shot Mr. Pink at the first opportunity just to shut him up!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
not bad for a debut film,"Not bad - especially for a debut film. But really not a convincing film for me. I did not find it very fascinating, and the dialogues were not masterful, but rather boring. I think Django Unchained is a better movie for example, but maybe I am just not that big of a Tarantino fan.The limited resources for this movie can clearly be seen. Cinematography is still pretty good. Acting Performance also pretty good. Nice to see Tarantino himself as an actor (did not even know he had done so) and Steve Buscemi is one of my all time favorite actors.Only reason why I think Tarantino is so appreciated, is because of his dialogues (something that does not attract me that much).Would give a this movie a 6.5 if at first sight.

Reservoir Dogs - great independent film,"The master piece that is ""Reservoir Dogs"" is hands down one of the most underrated movies in history. The independent film was directed by Quentin Tarantino, the genius behind ""Pulp Fiction"", the ""Kill Bill"" series, and ""Django Unchained"". Running at an hour and a half, every minute is filled with blood, violence, and foul language. Three factors that would go on to define Tarantino as a director. The movie revolves around six strangers who come together to perform a heist on a diamond store. Unfortunately the heist goes bad and leads the six men to figure out who among them is an undercover police officer. The film has received many great reviews (IMDB=8.4 / Rotten Tomatoes=8.8) such as Empire magazine calling it the ""Greatest Independent Film ever made"". Since it was an independent movie it only managed to produce $2,812,029 in box office sales. This falls way below the amounts seen on the All-time Box office earnings list. This statistic is not surprising but it does prove that independent movies should be taken seriously and that box office revenue is not a suitable way to measure a films quality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A striking debut of Mr. Tarantino (or Brown),"Quentin Tarantino's love affair with cinema is clearly visible with this debut film of his, RESERVOIR DOGS (1992), a film which belongs to one of the most memorable and important American films of the 1990's. Tarantino wrote and directed this film and the result is great. This is the kind of film that doesn't require millions of dollars from some major studio and it's (of course) ten times better and noteworthy film than many of those which require.The story is taken from Hong Kong film maker Ringo Lam's masterpiece City on Fire (1986) which is one of Tarantino's favorite movies which I understand. A bunch of criminals unknown to each other and following a plan which was meant to be flawless and water proof rob a diamond store. Something went wrong and a violent gun battle and quest for life and freedom took place and it was obvious there was a ""rat"" among them who informed the force about the details of the robbery. The film is told as a flashback as some of the gangsters, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), arrive to their meeting place in an abandoned storehouse waiting for the others, Mr. Orange very severely injured as a result of a gun shot wound. Other cast includes Tarantino himself, Eddie Bunker, Lawrence Tierney, Michael Madsen and Chris Penn and they're all as great and interesting as the story and its many sides.The film is a homage to masters like Martin Scorsese and several Hong Kong directors like John Woo and of course Ringo Lam. Their films usually depict honor and loyalty between men and criminals and how they are ready to risk their lives for a friend and the one they love. RESERVOIR DOGS has these same themes and they are as soulful and believable here as in GoodFellas or A Better Tomorrow, to name just a few films. Also the statement about tipping and the position of many ""uneducated females in America"" at the beginning is definitely an important one and despite the scene being pretty funny, it is also serious and important.The characters are great and speak much, but not in vain. They are interesting and real and the dialogue just secures this by forcing the viewer to go with the verbal flow inside the characters' soul. The dialogue is often very clever and also very funny and witty without being stupid. Tarantino is great screenwriter and story teller, too, and the flashback structure of RESERVOIR DOGS proved this for the first time. The soundtrack is again very nostalgic with many seventies classics which Tarantino grew up with so it is another homage this film maker wanted to make with this first film of his.The film is occasionally pretty violent but the violence is never glorified or made look good and entertaining. It is raw and painful and never without its results. Mr. Blonde (Madsen) is one of the most sadistic screen psychos of the nineties and he is definitely willing to use violence ""just for the fun of it"" but it doesn't pay in this film any more than in real life, either, and the gangsters learn it the hard way during the film and their fateful 2 minutes robbery.RESERVOIR DOGS is personal and intelligent film and began the film career its director had dreamt about during the years he worked at the video store, and this film once again proves what can be done when there are talented makers and ideas which don't require major studios and huge amount of money. It is great Harvey understood the talent of Tarantino and wanted to help him begin his life as a film maker.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quentin's First Stab At Directing........ BRILLIANT,"Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's first movie, and it's pretty bloody good. I was cautious of this one because I had read mixed reviews of this. But I eventually decided to rent this, it was a great choice.Reservoir Dogs is about a diamond heist gone wrong. They all meet up at a warehouse. This is where we enter a series of flashbacks and confrontations leading up to a huge finale.Sound familiar, OF COURSE. This is a typical Tarantino way of homaging movies he loved as a video store clerk. He really does a brilliant job with this movie. Even thought nothing will top Pulp Fiction this is his second best. This movie has a great cast. Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Tarantino himself.This violent masterpiece has earned it's way into many fans and made Tarantino a legend in film-making.4½/5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A modern gangster classic,"Quentin Tarantino's first movie before he gained fame with pulp fiction, reservoir dogs is about a gang of criminals hired to do a simple robbery.The story is told in out of order scenes that show the events leading up to the heist and the things that happen after. The characters use colours instead of names so no one can rat them to the cops, and the entire cast give career-top performances. Harvey Keitel takes the lead as Mr.White and is in my opinion the best performance of his career, Tim Roth plays Mr.Orange in one of his earliest roles, playing the young member of the crew doing one of his first jobs. While Micheal Madsen plays the psycho Mr.Blonde in another top role. Other performances include Chris Penn and Tarantino himself.The story moves a lot quicker than other Tarantino work, while keeping all of his trademarks like a great 70s inspired soundtrack and chunky well written dialogue that moves the plot along.Overall Reservoir dogs isn't QT's best movie but is still a brilliantly fun crime movie that has became one of the most iconic and quotable films of the 90s. Its features tons of famous scenes that became huge in pop culture including Micheal Madsen's controversial scene with a policeman.I'd definitely recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino's best work ever,"This was and is, by far, Quentin Tarantino's best work ever. I could care less about Pulp Fiction, that was a decent movie that did well commercially but this one is his crowning achievement.This movie is well arranged. The Dialogue IS the movie. You can sit and turn the picture off on this one and the audio itself tells the story. The Music is absolutely great and well chosen. The acting was not extremely great, but that itself was also a masterstroke. The budget was small, the sets almost non existent, yet Tarantino created a wonderful piece of film making art, and assembled a cast worth watching. There was plenty of dark comedy mixed with the signature violence and blood that always accompanies Tarantino.The Characters have no names and are introduced only as colors, and that is one of the best scenes of this movie. It is a perfect blend of comedy, violence, crime, character development, plot, all told in a unique and intriguing way.Tarantino will probably never make a movie as well as this one again. He now basks in his own cult following and his love of bad B horror of the 1970's, and seems content in giving us horrible movies, bringing back a genre that nobody ever wanted to see (except really crazy people that rarely get out of their own basements) and there was a reason Hollywood stopped making.I say celebrate this one outstanding movie and remember Quentin when he used to be a decent film maker.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I expected something more,"The truth is, the first time I saw it, I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I don't know, I just felt that I didn't fully like the movie. I was expecting something different, a different plot or better development.I felt perfectly that instead of lasting approximately one hour forty, it could only last one hour. I feel that the plot is a bit bland and I must admit that at certain moments, it got boring.What I can highlight from the film is how mentally ill the characters are and how two-faced they are, like ""Mr. Rubio,"" who at first seems to be a kind person, but in the end, it turns out to be the opposite. Also, I like the typical Tarantino scenes where everything is resolved by pointing a gun at each other. I sincerely hope that when I see the movie again, I like it better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Crash-bang-whalop from a director with something spanking new to offer.,"A set of criminals gather in a garage to discuss a jewel heist that has gone tragically wrong.What a fantastic film to start a career with. Tarantino shows that while he has never been to film school he knows what he wants and he knows how to get it. This doesn't take cinema to a new level but shows how to make a simple story - that could have been a cheap TV movie in someone else's hands - in to something epic. Yes epic, not a word I use very often.If you want proof that stories are in the telling, the mood and the music just look here. The story is nothing, but the delivery and the acting make it what it is.There really is no substantial plot. It is just throw you off balance cinema. Roth plays a man bleeding to death on a floor through most of the movie: what a fantastic device and so original. Who would have thought of that? Who indeed would not only have thought of that, but used it so effectively?The criminals (known by colours - or is it colors?) are funny, dangerous and strangely real. Real people that squabble over names, food and even tips. People that go from killing to small talk to humour as if it as all the same thing, in the same way that Prince goes from talking about sex to god as if it is also part of the same thing. Is this real? Is this how real criminals talk and behave. Not in the main, no, but probably true of a minority. The only problem - beyond this movie - is whether he can capture other types of criminals. The question remains open.Criminals, cops and  bystanders are all out to earn a dollar and return home to watch TV. The criminal is caught by one policeman and takes it out on another, who knows nothing about the original crime. People are in the wrong place at the wrong time. We have outlaws, but they are 9-2-5 outlaws, they want to eat out and drive nice cars. They are career criminals for whom the real world is too much like hard work. They want to live off the fat of the land, like the idle rich. They may have had real jobs (indeed they say they have), but it is not for them.As I said earlier, the plot is nothing. It is a frame for mood and atmosphere (what Kubrick took twenty years to learn Tarantino knows day one) and how it all turns out doesn't really matter. It is a journey, not a destination.Is the film moral? Not really. It is a mixed bag, but he is more moral than some comedies where out-of-work middle aged couples ride of in to the sunset having robbed a bank. Movie morals are different, it is not that people are dead, but how they died that matters. If you believe that cinema should include all people from society then films such as this should exist.Sadly Tarantino loses control in the ""ear"" scene. I have nothing against the haunted house experience, but you can only spend so much time in it before emerging in to light. Making the audience nauseous is no achievement. Nor is shocking it. We can all do it. In life or on film.All movies have to have drama and to create all drama we must have conflict. We haven't much to play with here. It is a minimalist playbox, although we have the robbery (used sparingly and not at the beginning as most fly-by-nights would use it) and some gun play, but these are sidelines. This is a relationship play. People (criminals) that want both anarchy and order. They come together for greed, but the pecking order has to be established. It is not easy being leader of the anarchist, they are, by nature free thinkers that play and work for themselves.It doesn't let anyone believe that being a criminal is easy or a good career options. After all, as I hinted above, who are you working with? Other criminals who only want to look after themselves and would happily steal for you as much as the original target. This doesn't make it as clear as say Goodfellers, but the message is there all the same.When this film came out it maybe it wasn't as big a deal as is made out to be now. However the industry stood up and took notice as did most film buffs. This is something new and - as has been shown with the better Pulp Fiction - the product of  someone that has the seeds of magic in his fingers. Sadly QT started to believe his own hype, and worse started thinking that he only had to please himself to please his audience.The problem is that QT is like the sexy girl your old school class. The problem isn't that she is sexy, the problem is that she knows it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Definitely Exceeded My Expectations,"I had started and stopped this film many times before actually sitting down and watching it all the way through. After sitting through it, I can't stop thinking about it.The film was composed beautifully. Instead of a simple plot line, it was broken up and rearranged making the audience work until the end. The music and character transitions were perfect.Tarantino did a great job making the characters true to the people portraying them. Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. White could have not been more perfect to their characters. The sheer fact that I hated and loved the various characters almost to a point of them being real is a feat in it of itself.I felt that the profanity was a bit much and it may be necessary to the plot and emotions, but at times it was a bit overbearing.Overall though, I was very impressed by the rawness of the story and how developed all of the characters were.

Tarantino's most moral and complex parable.,"UNC professor Kent Brintnall stated, ""Tarantino's film is, on one reading, a reductio ad absurdum on the cult of masculinity""; film-maker and critic Robert Hilferty noted,""violent language and violent acts define the power politics of male sexuality, on which Reservoir Dogs is a virtual tragicomic essay"".Every frame in Reservoir Dogs exists to expose the damaging consequences of our society's warped view of masculinity and how it is intertwined with violence. The film's emotional core, and what elevates it to greatness, is the profound bond that exists between Mr. White and Mr. Orange. Their non-traditional dynamic (in which they both exhibit ""feminine"" traits; White's compassion/tenderness, Orange's vulnerability) is presented as something superior that exists outside of the masculine. The way 12 Angry Men is a film featuring white men while exposing the trappings of white male privilege, Reservoir Dogs is a film featuring hyper-masculinity that celebrates gender non- conformativity. It is Tarantino's most moral and complex work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Life Requires Conflict,"Plot Summary for Long hu feng yun (1987) http://us.imdb.com/Plot?Long+hu+feng+yun+(1987)Yes, it seems that Chow Yun-Fat played the Mr. Orange in Reservoir Dogs part a year or so earlier.Quentin Tarentino was said to have worked in a video store at the time he penned the screen play. Whether he is conscious of the similarities is unclear.Regardless, by itself, Reservoir Dogs is an example of American filmmaking distilled from American filmmaking.  Tarentino has taken thousands of hours of film and video and produced a new piece of work.  The question whether this film is entirely original hurts, but not enough to remove this film as a new benchmark for filmmakers.To say it simply, films can demonstrate aspects of life that change our lives, sometimes long after the movie is forgotten.  There are very direct educational or industrial training films and then there are films that provide deep insight into human behavior and the relationships between people.I thought the black suits used by the gang of jewel thieves was ripped off ofOcean's Eleven (1960) http://us.imdb.com/Title?Ocean%27s+Eleven+(1960)And that's the heist movie that I used for comparison. I've always hated gangsters, in real-life and in the movies, and I always hated the images that Frank Sinatra purveyed as a gangster (in real-life and in the movies). ""Reservoir Dogs"" doesn't try to seduce the audience into thinking that the criminals are at all likeable. Frank Sinatra's ""charisma"" was just as slimy as his real life.I had always liked heist films, usually from the point of view of the thieves. But this film changed all of that. It is easier for me to realize nowadays that thieves would be much more like Michael Madsen's Mr. Blonde rather than the singin' and dancin' ""rat pack"" alcoholics.Life gets tougher. Harvey Keitel's ""Mr. White"" was the only character to show even a small amount of concern for any other living thing, and his care and concern was the mistake that brought the entire heist to its bloody end.Not easy lessons to learn. Certainly not the happy news I was hoping for. For me, spiritualism seem silly since we have so many real-life vampires and predators among us.""Reservoir Dogs"".  Most city water reservoirs are on hilltops or out of the way. Most cities buy up the land around the reservoir to add an additional buffer. These areas are usually wooded, kind of wild. The reservoir is kind of a ""no-man's land"" and any dogs seen there are probably wild.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best Movie Ever,"This is, simply, the greatest movie I have ever seen, and I have watched many. The acting is terrific, the directing is the best, and the dialogue is brilliant.

An instant classic. one of the most important films ever made.,"This movie was very well made. Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan on Quentin Tarintino. I can't stand his work. I thought Reservoir Dogs would be the same, but I was wrong. Just by judging the way the cover was, it looked like a gangster movie where they spend the whole movie in the bank, but it isn't. It's about the perfect robbery that gets organised and it goes terribly wrong. They then realise one of them is a cop, but which one, is it? It was quite a change to actually have a relationship with gangsters for once. It was good to know that gangsters are human too. In an evil way, but they are still human. Most people say ""They're gangsters, they're not human."" But it's not true. They are human. Quentin Tarintino makes them human. It explains their backgrounds and how they got their job, etc. It had great 70's songs too such as ""Stuck in the middle With You"" by Steeler's Wheel. The cast is fantastic. They do act childish in their situation, but who wouldn't? All he characters in this are so lovable. This film is very important because it's exactly what gangsters do and i'm 99% certain it's what they talk about. It's just good to have a relationship with bad guys for a change instead of the good guys all the time. I recommend it to Quentin tarintino lovers and people who love gangster films. 10/10 Advice: A lot of people hate reservoir Dogs, which is fine, but don't get mad. Don't say something like ""You just didn't get it and you're not adult"", it's the fact that they don't like it.Respect their opinion. You can't make everyone love the same movie. The world would be boring.Oh, and another thing, just so the people who haven't seen this, there's no action in this movie, it's all about the dialog.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A modern master's flawless debut,"Pulp Fiction made him a worldwide phenomenon, but it was the very first screening of Reservoir Dogs, his directorial debut, at Sundance in 1992, that proved Quentin Tarantino, a former video store clerk with no formal training behind the camera (except for a failed experiment called My Best Friend's Birthday), was a force to be reckoned with: mixing Sergio Leone, the French New Wave and Asain thrillers in the same package (and adding a lot more on the way), his first feature doesn't boast that much originality, but it has energy, passion, violence and wit.Ostensibly a classic heist flick, Dogs is about a bunch of criminals who are brought together by the edgy Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) to perform an apparently flawless robbery. These people have no real names, at least not when they're together: job-wise, they will just be known as Mr. White (Harvey Keitel, one of the driving forces behind this film's making), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker), Mr. Brown (QT himself) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi). With some minor help from Joe's son ""Nice Guy"" Eddie (Chris Penn), things should go smoothly.Obviously, they don't: by the time the opening credits are over, we know the job went wrong, as the surviving ""dogs"" (including a seriously injured Orange) gather in a warehouse and try to figure out what happened. Through a clever use of non-linear narrative, we learn how they were approached by Joe, the aftermath of the heist (the robbery itself is never depicted on-screen) and their suspicions regarding a potential undercover cop in the group.The storytelling technique is obviously borrowed from Jean-Luc Godard, who famously said: ""A film should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order"" (coincidentally, QT's production company, A Band Apart, is also named after one of Godard's movies). The plot, however, is the smallest of Tarantino's concerns. What really matters here is the execution, the style. And what a style: the seamless merger of images and music (see the opening credits), with the additional brilliant idea of having virtually all the songs (no original tunes here) come from an internal source, namely a radio program, the Scorsese-inspired long takes, the innovative use of violence (excessive but often amusing, rather than revolting, as in the famous torture scene).And then, of course, there's the dialogue, the primary reason to watch any of Tarantino's films. The audience at Sundance was memorably shocked by the opening sequence, which explains nothing about the story but gives precious insight regarding the characters: Mr. White has a short temper, Mr. Pink doesn't believe in tipping and Mr. Brown is firmly convinced Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" has a pretty crude significance (in true QT style, the language is not something the easily offended will embrace). That's just one of many quotable sound-bites, which also showcase the talent of Tarantino's ensemble cast: the standouts are Keitel, Roth and the psychotic Madsen, but everyone, even Bunker, whose role is - on the surface - less prominent, gets a well deserved moment of screen immortality.The cast (Keitel most notably) is also further proof of how Reservoir Dogs doesn't ""look"" like a traditional '90s first feature. Unlike Clerks, which was deliberately constructed like a home-made extravaganza, Dogs never flaunts its small scale or limited locations (the bulk of the movie takes place in the warehouse). It's a little movie that thinks big, and the Weinstein brothers were clever enough to see it in 1992, when they bought the film and gave Tarantino free reins to do whatever the hell he wanted after that. The rest, as they say, is recent motion picture history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Reservoir Dogs - An Absolute Gem!! 10/10,"I watched Reservoir Dogs for the first time a week ago and couldn't really understand what all of the fuss was about and why people rated it as a good film, Then i watched it again, an then again and then i did start to understand.I think that Quentin Tarantino did a brilliant job with this film, (to say it was his first), and also casted a few characters out of this film into Pulp Fiction etc.But there was a little bit about this film that i did not understand, the Violence. It was supposed to have been banned in a few countries due to the fact of the violence. If you watch films today such as A Man Apart, that is an extremely violent film, but if you think about the Rating in 1992, violence and cinema has evolved a lot!I also think that the cast for this film is just, THE BEST! Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi i think play their roles perfect and the film couldn't have been better! According to the IMDb, Reservoir Dogs is Rated #64 in the Top 250, i think it could be a lot higher in the list because i think that this film is a classic that will never become forgotten, its just one of those films that has made a huge impact since it was first released.Reservoir Dogs - 10/10 (I would advise that you watch this film without youngers, it does get abit Graphic:))",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Reservoir Dogs,"Tarantino made a memorial debut as a director on this, Reservoir Dogs.The story is quite simple describing six robbers who call each other by color. They fail to thieve jewels and become doubtful about each other.I know this movie gains high ratings but compared with Pulp Fiction, this doesn't look as good as that.  Although there're many great directions as ever, for me this lacks refreshment after watching.However, opening scene is cool and talk about ""like a virgin"" makes me laugh. Also, musics are nice. The actors Tarantino chose are always refined. Especially, I like Mr. Orange and Mr. White. Besides, Tarantino himself is attractive!In spite of skillful story-telling by moving axis of time, the important story itself fascinates me so much.  In the middle of the movie, I became bored.Still, there're full of humor and violence. You will be satisfied with them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A truly excellent film of this genre!,"What a great movie.Yeah, it's horribly violent and profane, with lots of gore.But this really is a character study of a certain class of criminals.This represents not only the best of what independent films can be, but also how you can get tremendous bang for very little buck if you have a good script and good actors.Notice this film has very sparse sets, no chase sequences, very few stunts, and no special effects. Yeah, there's one dog but beyond that there are no tricks at all. Just great dialog well delivered.This is a classic. Quentin Tarantino at his near-best (in my opinion he parlayed this into Pulp Fiction, his best work).It's a shame that Tarantino hasn't been more prolific. But his handful of films truly revolutionized the whole indie genre.10 out of 10.Barky",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece for its time.,"I did enjoy this movie but I don't think it holds up 29 years later. I liked the middle to end of the movie the most. It held the most exciting scenes and had the least amount of dialogue, which usually is a bad thing but this movie was straight dialogue. The lack of music, although quite eerie made me bored and tired. It gets good when the music does begin to play and the movie begins to feel more relaxed. The twist towards the end, while not anything too unique was exciting and interesting, I'm sure at the time of its release it wouldn't have been seen anywhere. The characters weren't anything special, which was the point, the audience isn't meant to feel sympathy for any of the ""reservoir dogs"" through personal information. This allows the smaller characters that were mixed up in the violence to be the ones we feel for. I liked Mr.Blonde a lot, he was the most interesting of the group and I thought to be the best acted. The beginning is, for me, where the movie falls flat, it was slow and added barely anything to the film as a whole. The scenes where far to long to not have music to fill up the empty space. I can see how this is a masterpiece of a movie, in 1992, not anymore...sorry fans of the movie. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Sorry, but this is a overrated movie !!!","First, I love Tarantino, because he is able (as a director) to follow his own unique style and made a very good movie like Pulp Fiction. But when making Reservoir Dogs, he was (in my opinion) maybe just searching for the borders of what other directors did not dare to do. A movie as RD with (just) a strong focus on violence is not enough for me to give it a high rating. Of course the acting and directing was very good, but I was missing a real strong script. And thats why I could not enjoy this movie and was just very disappointed because my expectations were very high (also based on the high rating on IMDB). So, when you not only like violence, but also care about a good script (story) than you also want to watch the Mob-movies of Martin Scorsese like Good fellas and Casino.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino's Best Film So Far,"With all the hoopla about 'Pulp Fiction' many people forget that this QT film was much better, in my opinion.  Grittier, more violent, brutal, funnier.  It's amazing what a filmmaker can come up with when his whole story revolves around a bunch of gangsters hanging around an old warehouse and just talking, bitching and bleeding.  A nice little film noir flick. With influences by John Woo, Kubrick, Big Jim Thompson, and Scorsese.  I don't know why, but I also liked the nice shade of green the warehouse interior was painted.  The multicolored graffiti background that Mr. Orange uses as a mock stage to practice his commode story was a nice touch too. These are the weird little details of a film that only I probably like.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the greatest films ever made,"Reservoir Dogs is probably one of the smartest crime films that I have ever seen. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most brilliant minded directors in the history of film-making who came out of a video store to making one of most popular crime film. Reservoir Dogs is capable of having small time actors (with the exception of Harvey Keitel) and making them put up fantastic and mind-blowing performances. This is what a great script can do to actors. The dialogue is so amazing, the music is incredible especially the song, ""Little Green Bag"" in the beginning of the film, and of course the acting is sensational. Reservoir Dogs is breathtaking and trust me I have a lot of favorite films, but Reservoir Dogs falls in my top 10. It is a pure adrenaline rush and is one of the greatest films ever made.

Tarantino Lets His 'Dogs' Out in Testosterone-land!,"Tarantino has an almost impenitent appetite for blood-spattered barbarism, we all know that. But in his gritty, brutal crime-caper Reservoir Dogs – a tantalizing debut feature that put the name Quentin Tarantino into the cinematic spotlight - his testosterone level is off every chart, as he happily wallows in his own adolescent love of criminals, violence, and vulgarity. So much so that, the movie appears to be set in a theme park called 'Testosterone-land', where nature isn't only red in tooth and claw, it's black as the heart of man and dank as any rag and bone shop of the human spirit.Tarantino gets things off to a spectacularly engrossing start, as Reservoir Dogs begins with the iconic sequence involving the coffee- shop banter of six morally ambiguous outlaws. Yes, they are meant to be an urban wild-bunch, but damn, if they aren't charming and charismatic! Decked out in matching black suits and thin black ties, they've been brought together by a mob kingpin specifically to pull off a heist, and they've been kept deliberately ignorant of one another's identities, knowing each other only by their color coded pseudonyms. The heist is to be a one-shot deal - one job and they scatter to the winds. Soon after masterful opening gabfest, when you start settling in with the idea that Tarantino has made a heist movie, he pulls a coup by skipping right over the robbery itself. Instead, it cuts straight to the aftermath, as we find our wolf-pack hole up in a warehouse after the heist goes belly up, each trying to figure out which one of them squawked to the police. Dissension and suspicion run high and soon, it becomes clear to the audience that at least one of these guys is a snitch, but which one?Tarantino's glitziest stroke in his heist drama is never to show the main event: the film's 'action' occurs after the heist. Tarantino expertly builds tension, interweaving scenes of the aftermath of the thieves' foiled heist with scenes depicting them getting ready for the heist, backtracking in time and point of view half a dozen times. Each flashback reveals just enough information to fill in a piece of the puzzle. His palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect. His trademarks of amplified violence and vulgar dialogue are in full force, as are the flurry of obscure to not-so-obscure pop culture references woven into the dialogue. Part of the appeal of Reservoir Dogs is the way it makes all of it feel terribly authentic, a veracity that is a tribute to the skill of its actors, particularly Michael Madsen who is awesome as the sadistic yet painfully cool Mr. Blonde and Steve Buscemi who is deadpan funny as the always-on-the- edge Mr. Pink.Reservoir Dogs grabs you by the throat and digs its claws in deep. It may seem hideously ugly on paper, but in the sure way it's made, it's inconveniently dazzling - driven, beautifully made and completely wacko at once. It's pure outlaw art!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Perfect !!!,"Ever since I was a little girl, I have been to the cinema two - three times every week. You might say that I am a movie freak - at least I'm one of those people that even though I complain about lots of movies in the new millenium - I still faithfully sit and wonder how they still have the ability to sometimes amaze me in the movie industry... This is one of the few movies I have watched, that I really can not find a single frame that I would like to be different - and that is actually the greatest compliment that I can offer a film director... In this case Tarantino really started off with perfection and now... well we don't really hear anything from him anymore and Jackie Brown was a great movie but nothing spectacular. The scene with Michael Madsen and the poor policeman in Reservoir Dogs will haunt me for the rest of my life... never have I seen a scene so fascinating and yet so repulsive ! If you are one of those few people that haven't seen this movie, please rent it or better yet go to a movie theater where they show it... One of my best friends left the theater when I took her to see this movie - she could not stand to watch the violence - but she is also such a kind spirit... so if you only like romantic movies like Splendor in the Grass or When Harry Met Sally - then you should stay away from this one... Not that I have anything against Splendor in the Grass - actually I think that Kazan has made a very beautiful movie about the suppression of sexuality in a ""middleclass"", Christian society... but it was just to illustrate that this movie is as far away from that as possible... :o)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino's best???? well it's a really hard question,"I saw Death Proof last month and the first person that i want to comment about the film was my cousin, because he is a horror films fan and like me , he loves films and love Quentin Tarantino. The first thing that he told was: Tarantino is in decadence? I say, that Death Proof was a good film but he told that wasn't a Grindhouse film. Well we talk about Tarantino and i think that is difficult for a director to stay in the top for almost 15 years i well, i think that the masterpieces of Tarantino came very early for a regular director. Almost all the greatest directors in all the planet have like a good beginning but later, like 4 films later, it comes their masterpiece, like Scorsese with Taxi Driver, Coppola with The Godfather or Chaplin with City Lights.In my opinion a young director will grow up like 3 or 4 films later but i doesn't means that their first works aren't good like Mean Steets of Scorsese, that is a great film but is not his best.With Tarantino is was all different: his first film is a classic right now and his second film (i mean Pulp Fiction) is his masterpiece and also a classic.Then Jackie Brown, Kill Bill 1 and 2 and now Death Proof are all really great films but for me this 4 films can't be compared whit his first 2 films: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.The conclusion of this question that says me my cousin is that: Tarantino makes his best work in his first 3 years like a director with is two masterpieces Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but i don't think that Tarantino is in decadence for a simple reason: His latest works aren't so good like the firsts ones but still are really good films.Sorry and well now about the film Reservoir Dogs: This film contains an excellent cast that includes one of my favorites actors: Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. Also Michael Madsen, Chris Pen and Tarantino are very good but like a surprise the cast isn't the best part of the film, the best part are the dialogs.The dialogs of the song of Madonna or the dialog with Mr Pink about the tips are excellent and really funny.The films is short and you never bored with Tarantino. Excellent performances, excellent debut and is this Tarantino's best?? this is a hard question but i think that the best is Pulp Fiction but Reservoir Dogs is very close.Reservoir Dogs: 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Waste of Skill,"Many people believe ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a good film. It is not. Tarantino failed to make it into anything but violence and the combination of music and camera-work.

Without a doubt, many movies are about nothing and are good. ""Dogs"" is about a group of men who messed up a bank robbery and went to a warehouse to talk about things and get very angry at each other.Many find the movie hip, but at best the movie itself is not hip, the pitiful characters may seem to be, but really the only hip character is Mr. White, played by Harvey Keitel.

Lights....camera......warehouse (again),Despicable thriller that reads like a manual for a south American death squad only without the cheap aftershave. Interesting to me only as an almost total inversion of Tarkovsky's cinema. It is set almost entirely in an (ZZZZZZZZ) abandoned warehouse. Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick do not appear obviously due to a prior engagement at another abandoned warehouse on an even smaller budget.

Reservoir Dogs its just great,"Starting with a clever plot, following up with a genius screenplay, and ending with mind blowing performances by a male dominated cast Reservoir Dogs will not disappoint. This is the debut film from the often controversial and always twisted director/ writer/ actor Quentin Tarantino and it delivers the punch that he is now known for. Tim Roth (as Mr. Orange) gives his best performance, but, not to be outdone, is Michael Madsen who delivers a surprisingly enticing role as Mr. Blonde. This is often considered a cult hit, as are many of his films, but cerebral plotting and a cunning screenplay keep Reservoir Dogs a must see of 1990's cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What a way to debut your film career,"From the moment this starts I was on the edge of my seat, what this man pulls with this non-chronological storytelling is just delightful, keeping you hungry, intrigued, hooked, absolutely immersed in the story.Dialogues are clever, the characters are alive, the violence is gut wrenching and beautifully delivered.After watching the trailer I was caught off guard by the fact that the heist isn't shown much, if at all, but there's no need, as it paints a clear picture of what went down in your head, the flow is so good you're not ever given much time to think about anything other than what's in front of your face.

Better Than Pulp!!,"This movie is better than Pulp Fiction. Let's get that straight right now. I have seen it a number of times and it just keeps getting better. The story line is fresh, the casting perfect, camera shots are unique, and the sound bites original. Oh yea, the soundtrack is great too. Six guys commit a robbery and you don't even see it. You spend the whole movie watching the planning of the caper and the turmoil afterwards. Harvey Keitel may have given his best performance of his career and Steve Buscemi is a classic. In fact it's Buscemi's 'Mr. Pink' (there is a great line in response to his disapproval to the color pink) weasel character that I feel is the gasoline in the Reservoir Dogs engine. He represents the voice of reason and clear thinking on one point and sneaky and scheming on the other. Michael Madsen's 'Mr. Blonde' was made for him. Tim Roth 'Mr. Orange' has his ground breaking role (I can't say what as because it ruins part of the plot). Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney are perfect as the father son mob team. What is really great about this movie is the dialog. Some of the best ever and truly original. The dialog in Reservoir Dogs flows so smoothly and naturally that it gives a more than a movie feel to it. For example the part in the bathroom with the cops standing around talking was beautiful because that is how how cops chit chat to each other about who's butt they busted or how stupid this guy was. Tarantino even had the cops talking about it with that kind of smirky ego locker room talk. That and having Roth break in and continue his description of the story right there was great. Also, the opening scene is a bona fide classic. The Madonna speech, the discussion on tipping, everything about that was great dialog. I also love the way Madsen and Keitel go back and forth at one point in the movie (""I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan""). If you haven't seen the movie yet be prepared because it jumps around between past and present like 'Godfather 2'. But, that is also part of the genius of it. It's bloody, so if you hate violence go rent a Disney movie instead and save yourself from stopping a great movie and complaining that this is what causes violence in youths. Wrong (that's another argument I won't get into but we can't make every movie for 10 year olds and if they happen to get a hold of it where were you when they did!). Reservoir Dogs goes on the classic list. It's a top of the shelf action movie with dark comedy and great lines to boot. One word of advice to Mr. Tarantino, stop putting yourself in your movies. You are not an actor! Stick to directing where you do your best work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Tarantino classic!,"Reservoir Dogs (1992) tells the story of a heist gone wrong, when the surviving criminals start to believe that one of them is a police informant. The film is a classic! A great start to Tarantino's filmography with some brilliant storytelling and equally impressive performances from all the actors.The film is very simplistic in its approach to the cinematography, and this works in it's favour. The colour palettes are very bleak and the deep colour of the blood in certain scenes contrasts well with the minimalist set design. I absolutely adore the use of 360 tracking shots, they really stand out and feel iconic to Tarantino films.The film also takes the simple route with the sound design, and once again, I see this as a positive as it was very effective. There is a prominent lack of score which adds to the unsettling nature and tension the film has. Also, the soundtrack is instantly recognisable and compliments some of the movie's most iconic moments.The movie is packed full of really great performances and the dialogue is snappy and well written, which is why it works so well as a dialogue driven film. Steve Buscemi is brilliant as Mr Pink and Tim Roth as Freddy was perfect casting, he's a very complex and interesting character that's easy to route for. In addition, the actors all have a lot of chemistry with each other and their interactions feel real and natural.The pacing is surprisingly slow, with an intriguing structure, resulting in a high tension watch. I really love that this film isn't in chronological order, this structure allows the film to gradually reveal details that layer the plot up very well. It takes some wild twists and turns and is a blast to watch, ending on a weirdly disturbing and shocking note.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

""" War   is   an   Argument   which   got   out   of   hand ""","Director Quentin Tarantino has an exceptional ability to create action films like this one called ""Reservoir Dogs."" It is sure to rank among his very best. The script and it's dramatic storyline throughout the entire movie is a visual compendium of 'Waiting for Godot' meets 'Slaughter on Tenth Avenue.' Anyone seeing it for the first time is in for a real treat. The story is of an experienced gangster who attempts to create the perfect crime. Its simple enough, collect seven of the most professional and trustworthy men in the business, assign them code names, tell them just enough about the crime to do their part, snatch the haul, then rendezvous in a warehouse after the job and split the take. The men selected are top of the line actors like Lawrence Tierney as the Boss Joe Cabot, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Like the best laid plans, the unexpected was not included and therefor becomes the focus of a violent shouting match with guns. Between themselves, the heist should have worked, why it didn't has much to do with the body in the trunk (Kirk Baltz) and will have them at each other's throats trying to fathom the reason. The final segment of the film makes it the most exciting climax since the shootout of the Wild Bunch.

"A Crazy, Good Movie","Finally, while catching up on some popular movies I've missed, I got around to Reservoir Dogs. Luckily, the run time was only 1 hour and 40 minutes so I knew I could manage even though it took a few days to find the time for it after renting.So much has probably been said about this since it came out so long ago, but in a nutshell, this is a very good, classic crime drama that probably has inspired many movies and shows of the same genre since it came out. Everything is well-put together from the acting performances to the directing and writing.It combines a kind of ""who-done-it"" with some vintage, gritty Tarantino dialogue as a group of thieves deal with the fallout of their heist getting busted by police while camping out in some vacant building. The big question looming as it is apparent there must have been someone who was an informant in their group and they are consequently all now in jeopardy of being caught is ""who is the rat""?The fast-moving, well-edited film combines flashbacks with the present moment to put together how it all went wrong, leading to a shocking final conclusion that makes you, as a viewer, feel like you got your money's worth.Yes, Reservoir Dogs is a classic.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The delineation of violence,"Future historians may well look back at the cinema of the nineties in the United States and wonder why it spawned so many movies that seemed to celebrate gratuitous violence while catering to an audience fascinated with gore. (I have some ideas on this, but I'll skip them here.) Some may say this is nothing new, that there has always been gore in the movies, that the horror flick is a standard genre, and that, at any rate, human beings are quite naturally interested in violence because even if it is rare in their suburban experience, when it does occur it is of overriding significance.When historians do look back they will surely take a gander at this film, director Quentin Tarantino's celebrated breakout cult classic. Anyone reading this has already seen the movie or certainly knows about its content. It contains one of the most unredeeming scenes of sadistic violence ever to strike the silver screen. It depicts a world in which men stick their guns out at each other the way little boys play.... It is a world in which women exist only on the periphery (like an old war movie there are virtually no women in the film), a world in which men are constantly preoccupied with macho notions and the phenomena of male bonding to the exclusion of anything else. The behavior of the men while superficially realistic is actually stylized in the extreme. Anything and everything may set a man off. His ego is under continual fire, his manhood is constantly being tested. Life is short, brutal and bestial.Question: where did this vision come from, and why did it resonate so strongly with an audience, and what is that audience? It can be said that Reservoir Dogs appeals primarily to young men and teenaged boys, who are preoccupied with coming to grips with violence because it represents an important part of their lives, and how they might relate to violence is an essential part of their self discovery. This is true, but it is not the whole story. After all, as I write this, Reservoir Dogs is the 58th most popular movie of all time according to votes tabulated at the International Movie Database web site, IMDb.com. Even given that there is still a male bias on the web, this is an extraordinarily high rating for the first film of any director and for such a low budget enterprise.Part of the explanation for the near reverence shown this film lies not in the blood-letting and the macho posturing, but in a story well told, well-plotted and of characters well-drawn and especially the indelible acting performances from most of the cast. Harvey Kietel as a hardened criminal with a soft heart, and Steve Buscemi as the amoral Mr. Pink, and Michael Madsen as the sadistic Mr. Blonde and Chris Penn as the slightly soft and slightly spoiled son of a criminal father and Tim Roth as the high wire acting Mr. Orange, really rivet us to the screen. The professional cadre of criminals depicted here, the cheap thugs and psychopathic killers, are well realized and their life styles and preoccupations well delineated. Tarantino begins with a scene in which the boys around some tables in a cafe ""analyze"" Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" in manner that might be described as Oxford don crude. They continually espouse the racist, sexist macho values of the criminal underclass, in which loyalty to the band and bravery under fire are the highest values, while cowardice and ""turning rat"" are the lowest. Furthermore the script is punctuated with sick little jokes (e.g., about the imagined nature of black women), and wryly obscene juxtapositions, notably the macabre dance of Mr. Blonde to the radio playing ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" as he tortures the cop. Finally there is the structure of the film itself in which time is splintered and events are recalled and presented not chronologically, but according to the logic of the film itself. This technique allows Tarantino great freedom of expression and emphasis.Okay, so why am I only giving this three stars? Mainly because, while the treatment was striking and original, the story and the milieu presented were not. And some of this was unrealistic to the point of annoyance. That Mr. Orange did not bleed to death or at least go into shock and faint dead away with a gaping hole in his stomach is beyond me. And the ""neat"" karmic ending was more than a little far fetched. And all those stylized speeches!You'd think part of this was written for the Shakespearean stage. Indeed, although Tarantino may not realize it, he owes something to the Bard. Didn't Hamlet end much the same way with dead bodies all over the stage? Additionally, while Tarantino's vision appeals strongly to his targeted audience (and his own psyche), it does not relate well with a larger audience. The last thing a man of my age is concerned about is how macho he might be. Such concerns seem childish. And the nature and phenomenon of human violence is very far from a mystery to me; furthermore I know very well exactly how I feel about violence and how I might react in the face of it. I think if I had seen this movie when I was seventeen, I might have been stunned and thrilled with its power. Seeing it in my middle years leaves me a little cold.Incidentally I agree with those who say that this is a greater artistic achievement than the ""Hollywoodized"" Pulp Fiction (1995), also directed by Tarantino.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Perfect movie. One of the greatest.,"Even though 'Pulp Fiction' is quite better, 'Reservoir Dogs' tops most movies. Although the acting is so chemical, under it you can see that the team really enjoys to working together. Their teamwork is the main attraction to the movie. But, good acting is not really a savior. The directing, debuting Tarantino, and script, also QT, is what people will refer to as 'the old fashion Tarantino-style'. The movie is soaked up with blood. It is horrible, as in explicit content, but still, in a way cool and quite funny (if you can look closer?).This is simply a gangster movie that is out of the ordernal. 'Reservoir Dogs' doesn't get predictable, from the fact that the story has been rollercoastered around and the scenes are all in a great mess. But that is also a main attraction. I love this movie, because it has got a hidden meaning deep under the very intensive pulse of this gangster-classic.Harvey Keitel and co starring Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Quentin Tarantino and Edward Bunker as the gangsters they would stick up on (nah, not really, but, kind of) are fantastic titles and brings this cult-movie up even higher, as I've said.The absolutely gross torture-scene (Michael Madsen, Kirk Baltz) should nobody miss.

Great early Tarantino,"I love this film because you can see all of Tarantino's potential as a filmmaker seeping out of every corner. Compared to Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc, Reservoir Dogs is quite simple, lower budget, shorter, and noticeably less mature. But the magic is still there, and his style is already quite distinct. Kind of like looking at someone's baby pictures. He has always had an amazing ability to choose soundtrack material, and this movie is no exception. The cast is perfect, although there are no female characters. (Forgivable considering the plot, and he has more than proved his appreciation for the strong leading woman in subsequent films.)

Stuck in the middle with you.,"There are few films that have revolutionised cinema. Citizen Kane. The Godfather. Jaws. Die Hard. Reservoir Dogs. Before Reservoir Dogs came onto the scene, we were stuck with any crappy script making it's way to film within a year of it being written. The 80s were a bad time for movies. The excellence of the 70s movies(Godfather, Jaws, Apocalapse Now, Taxi Driver) had gone. Video had meant cinemas were not as popular as before. Then came one small film made an a tiny budget with no- name (except Harvey Keitel) actors, written and directed by a newcomer who had dropped out of school at 16 and worked in a video store until now. This little film was the best thing to happen in cinema for a long time. It was a simple story about a heist gone wrong. It was set in a warehouse. But it was told with a set of flashbacks to make it more complicated than that. There were pop-culture refrences throughout this film, and the acting was superb. Did I mention it contained lots of profanitisin' and violence which sparked up controversy? A cops ear being cut off to the sounds of 'Stuck in the middle with you'.

Ladies and Gentleman: Quentin Tarantino (nice slice of pulp fiction),"RESERVOIR DOGS (1992) **** Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, Chris Penn, Eddie Bunker, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Wright (Voice over only). Best described as ""Abbott and Costello Meet Sam Peckinpah"", this brutal and brutally black comedy/crime thriller balances sadism with levity, with panache and a taut story line reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing"". Chief thug Tierney calls a group of strangers (all given color coded aliases to avoid any mistrust) for a jewel heist, which goes horribly awry. Some clever camera work by rookie filmmaker/writer Tarantino (who plays one of the crooks in a brief role) and viscerally scary sequences (Madsen's torture of a cop to the tune of Stealer's Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" is the cinematic equivelant of rubbernecking at a car wreck; you want to look away but can't) makes this one unique spin on the genre.

A Unique Take On The Heist Story,"Going into the film, I expected the accoutrement Tarantino films generally set forth: witty dialog, violence, a relatively memorable story, pop culture references, and character acting that supersedes most films. Very early on, I was kind of taken aback at how obvious some of these elements were being presented. The Tarantino dialog felt a step beyond intentional. It was kind of thrown at you bare and didn't have some of the context that his other films had. It was amateurish compared to the more cohesive dialog of Pulp Fiction for example. Tarantino's craft of dialog seems not fully matured here and is in some ways used to prop up weak scenes rather than be a subtle manifestation of the scene. Obviously, there's something very hypnotic about the dialog regardless, and its wit does a good job of distracting you from some of the surrounding vapidity. In terms of characters and acting, I was overall impressed for the most part. I was originally concerned that the concept did not allow much diversity of personality between the characters, but there was a surprising amount of distinctiveness. Actors Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Chris Penn give very convincing performances in particular. I was disappointed at the performance by Harvey Keitel at points, particularly the final shootout. Standards by supporting actors had really raised the bar, and he couldn't completely keep up with the surrounding talent's emotional performances. I think the thorn in the film's side is the restrictive story. It is too traditional to accompany some of the nuances that Tarantino brings to the screen. The non-linear storytelling, while it fits and improves the film, serves better in less restrictive timelines. As mentioned earlier, the story doesn't produce a great diversity in characters. The traditional nature of the story makes pop culture references a little more forced, but I will say that the portrayal of action violence in this film is very natural to the developing scenes. All in all, a very well made and unique take on the heist film, but perhaps not the best palette to work with, as some film elements being not fully realized in this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You'll never get tired of it,"This is one of those films you can watch over and over and over again, and never get tired of.

There are lots of reasons, but let me just give you the most important one: the dialogs! They are brilliant brilliant brilliant!!! The movie begins with this one: Mr. Brown's vision on what 'Like a virgin' is all about... geniality! Every word that comes out of Joe, the big boss, is so hilarious! As I'm running out of synonyms for funny etc., I'll stop here. As in all Tarantino's films, the editing is also of a very high level, as is the music, but then again, how could the music possibly be bad: it's K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's!!! You can't but love the DJ. And on top of all that, we have the honor to see a top-cast in action.

Watch it Twice and You Will Love It,"I won't hold back by saying at first this film is very confusing to the average viewer. The unconventional timeline and the many aliases used by the main characters make the film difficult to follow at times; however, this does not take away from the simple brilliance of Tarantino's first feature-film.In the opening scene we are introduced to a group of men in a diner, each with their own personal quirks and unique personalities. Steve Buscemi's character, ""Mr.Pink"", delivers a long rant about tipping at restaurants that sets the tone as one that is unusual, yet relatable in its own right. After the attempted bank robbery we are informed one of the men in the group is a police informant, but the mystery of who remains unclear. As the timeline jumps back and forth, we come to know more about each character and their backgrounds. With each character's connection to the ultimate heist revealed, it actually becomes more unclear who the informant is, for it seems any of them could potentially be the one.When the mystery is finally revealed, I was simply left speechless by the revelation of who the informant ultimately was. Tarantino's ability to provide clues throughout the film, while simultaneously distract the viewer from the answer that was evident all along, is truly intelligent writing. After watching the film a second time, I was able to notice more of the plot's subtle hints and clues, which made me appreciate the film to an even higher degree.I have watched all of Tarantino's films so far and I personally find this to be my favorite so far. I believe this film catapulted Tarantino into the brilliant storyteller that he is today. At the same time however, this film feels unique from his others in that it is simple and straightforward without the often unnecessary plot background. However at the at the same time, it is the film's unpredictability and realness that speaks volumes. While there is many scenes with violent acts and heavy dialogue, it never seems over the top or exaggerated. This is ultimately a timeless film, that I believe will continue to influence many films to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Noir Excellence.,"Reservoir Dogs (1992)- 4.5/5Possible Spoilers.Superbly entertaining and exciting fare that is definitely rewatchable. Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is a stunning debut film - one where the director is not ashamed to depict realistic dialog and violence. Told in mixed chronology, a crime boss named Joe Cabot (Tierney) hires five men to pull off a difficult job - to rob a jewelery store and bring the diamonds back. When the job goes bad with the police disrupting the heist, the remaining men, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), meet in a warehouse and discuss what went wrong. They come to the conclusion that one of them could be a police informant. The story has flashbacks giving clues to who it could possibly be, leading up to the surprising climax. Reservoir Dogs is definitely a credible film, with the success inspiring him to write the even more brilliant ""Pulp Fiction."" Tarantino's first film really does out with a bang, but the dialog and cleverly-scripted characters are what really make the film work. Probably the best film of 1992.Cast: Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Eddie Bunker, Quentin Tarantino, Kirk Baltz, Randy Brooks.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece.,"Sure it glorifies violence, but how else do you make a movie about criminals, in which everyone ends up dead? Given the plot, violence is hard to avoid. And yet--there ARE more gruesome movies. There are movies in which they'd actually SHOW the ear being hacked off, rather than sliding over to a wall. Personally, I didn't get how people thought THAT was the goriest scene in the movie. I found it wonderful, entertaining and thought-provoking on the nature of good and evil, an instant classic. Tarantino has a real gift for snazzy dialogue, which he exhibits here as much as Dusk Till Dawn or Pulp Fiction. The characters have depth, the simplicity is refreshing. One of the best movies ever made.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Superb - one of the greatest movies ever made,"A crime boss assembles a team of six experienced criminals to pull off a large jewellery heist. However, it goes badly and the team are ambushed by police. The survivors regroup at an abandoned warehouse where it becomes obvious to them that someone in the team is an undercover cop. But which one?Brilliant crime-drama. With a meagre budget, Quentin Tarantino made a masterpiece. Have watched Reservoir Dogs five or six times now and it never gets old or loses its impact, despite knowing how it's going to turn out. If anything, it gets better with each watching, as I spot little things I didn't see the previous times.All the Tarantino trademarks are there: the witty dialogue, gritty characters, graphic violence, elaborate and detailed - yet watertight - plot, the character development, the backwards-and-forwards-in-time effects, the excellent, well selected soundtrack.Tarantino's work behind the camera is the sort of magic that gets examined in film schools. The low budget probably helped - when you don't have special effects and all other expensive means at your disposal, you need to maximize the effect of what you have. Certainly the greatest ever directorial debut (if it is regarded as Tarantino's debut).Casting was spot on, and every actor plays out of his skin. Nothing seems forced, and the characters gel perfectly - you wouldn't even know anyone was acting.Considering the perfection of this movie, it is quite amazing that Tarantino managed to surpass it with his next movie, making the greatest movie of all time: Pulp Fiction.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Great movie, but your mom will hate it...","This movie has got to be one of THE most quotable movies of all time!

The characters are great, the acting is fine, and the flashback construction works well.  The violence and profanity? Well, you'll get used to it, as apparently the characters have, although Mr. Orange and Mr. White do show the only flashes of heart and conscience on the part of the characters in the film. This movie must have been a blast to make, because it sure is one to watch for the first time [unfortunately, multiple viewings tend to decrease one's impression of the film...] Overall though, a good choice and a must-see for aspiring film makers and Tarantino fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Fallen Dog,"The Fallen Dog ""by Quentin Tarantino's early works. Although it cannot be compared to Leonardo da Vinci's first egg or Einstein's first bench, regardless of whether it is great or not, Quentin's career in film has considerable value.To be brave, Director Quentin's catfish like face is as ""violent"" as his film, striking the viewer's heart and becoming more and more sinister as they watch it. Sorry, my words are disrespectful. Actually, they are not. Let me express my love for Quentin's film style superficially.Before the Water Dog starts, there are a bunch of bad ABCs that need to be blocked, most of which come from Young Master Kun's mouth. A table of 'party representatives' sat together, pulling from Mai Jie's' like a virgin' to the female servers who relied on tips to make a living, whether it was Toby Cheung or Toby Wong. This is the restless, excited, and confused 1980s. Since then, there have been signs of violence. Violent language is only enough to warm up the atmosphere, and only by using real weapons and knives can one gain momentum. Also note that this is not a Saturday movie, keep an eye on the kids and keep the remote control safe. Don't say Quentin is unkind, he didn't warn you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Purest Evil,"Quentin Tarantino proved his cinematic genius to the entire film industry with the revolutionary Pulp Fiction. Yet, several years before that, he burst onto the scene with this film, with just as masterful a showcase of solid, colorful ensembles of characters, dramatic empathy for usually unsympathetic archetypes and gory violence subdued and made watchable by mixing a sadistic sense of humor and style into the mix. Michael Madsen delivers one of the most frightening performances ever seen in modern cinema as Mr. Blonde, a devil-may-care sociopath. After watching his most graphic scene, you will never be able to listen to ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" in the same way again. Also, Havey Kietel and Tim Roth give the film its most touching edge, as Kietel's Mr. White develops a very paternal relationship to the mortally-wounded Mr. Orange, creating a trust and honor to protect him at any cost, which is just what he is challenged with. The cast is rounded out with equally remarkable performance by the likes of Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Laurence Tierney as this drama eventually hits a crucial peak, leaving you with a climax that won't soon be forgotten, even when listening to the spookily sedate Harry Nillson song ""Coconut"" as the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cool debut from Tarantino!,"""Reservior Dogs"" is a Quentin Tarantino-directed film about a group of gangsters who are being picked off one-by-one by the police, so they're trying to figure out who ratted them out to the police before they all end up dead.This is a pretty cool movie! It's always a good thing when the debut of someone is good, because it says that they'll go and do great things, which Tarantino has obviously done. Of all the things that this movie went through, it's still great that it is here for us to see. Or at least, the few who enjoy excessive violence, which is what this movie is immersed in. See it with adults.Still, I wouldn't venture to say that this is my favorite Tarantino movie, but it's still good regardless.

Pulp Fiction Before Pulp Fiction?,"As someone who considers Pulp Fiction to be one of the best movies ever made, I was looking forward to seeing a movie made by the same writer/director about a group of criminals playing off each other after a heist gone wrong. And when the Dogs are arguing, stressing out, fighting in that werehouse, you can truly see the roots of Tarantino's style, because anything that takes place in that warehouse truly had me hooked.Me White and Mr Pink are definitely the standouts, with both actors giving a brilliant performance and their squabbles feeling realistic and tense.However, the film begins to lose steam once the story begins to flash back, showing dull and uninteresting scenes that feel as if they were only included to get the picture to an hour and a half. These sequences truly drags the movie down as the conversations aren't nearly as compelling, and feel unneeded as they hardly shed any light on the current situation that couldn't have been told through the chafacgers in the werehouse.Ultimately, Reservoir Dogs is passable, and a decent first effort for the genius that is Quentin Tarantino, but it pales in comparison to his later works, as I feel there's nothing here that memorable or interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Crime Thriller that Leaves You Waiting for the Wrong Kind of Canines,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is a crime thriller movie directed by Quentin Tarantino that tells the story of a group of criminals who are hired to rob a jewelry store. The movie features an all-star cast, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen, among others.While the movie does have the word ""dogs"" in its title, it's not about actual dogs. Instead, it's a slang term used to describe the undercover police officers who infiltrate criminal organizations. So, if you were waiting for cute and cuddly dogs to show up on the screen, you might have been disappointed.However, if you can move past your initial expectations, you might find ""Reservoir Dogs"" to be an engaging and intense movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie's non-linear storytelling, memorable characters, and sharp dialogue have made it a classic of the crime genre.So, while it's understandable that you were disappointed that there were no actual dogs in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" I encourage you to give the movie a chance and appreciate it for what it is - a gripping crime thriller that has stood the test of time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
To Trust a Thief Or To Not Trust a Thief....That is the Question.,"Earth-shattering debut for writer/director Quentin Tarantino as he weaves a wicked and demented tale of five strangers (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Tarantino himself) who are recruited by a mastermind (Lawrence Tierney) and his son (Chris Penn) to pull off a daring diamond heist in Los Angeles. The five have never worked together and really know nothing about each other. When the heist turns into a fire-fight with cops out on the streets of downtown L.A. it becomes obvious that someone is really an undercover cop. But which one? Tarantino knew way back in 1992 how to eliminate the bindings of straight story-telling and time elements as he uses flashbacks and sequence-less methods to get his points across. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a really great achievement for the genre because it was trail-blazing and unique for its era (and it stands the test of time very well). Tarantino would use this feature as a jump-board to do even better work (""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown""). Love him or hate him, Tarantino is a highly gifted writer and director that knows exactly what he is doing. A stunning and thunderous achievement. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Awesome, but...","I've been watching through all of Tarantino's films and I have an unpopular opinion with regards to this one.As my rating and title implies, I love this movie! For a first movie it's really impressive. Most likely because Tarantino's a movie freak, it doesn't feel like it's written and directed by an amateur. After all, the first script he wrote, True Romance, doesn't feel like it's written by an amateur.As with all of his movies...
The characters are distinct and interesting.The dialogue is quotable.That scene that is meant to be disturbing is still disturbing.It's unpredictable.The humor is solid.The cinematography is superb.The soundtrack choices are very catchy.The acting is amazing.On top of all that...
The movie flies by.It doesn't feel low budget. You can thank Tarantino's deft hand.However, I consider this to be one of Tarantino's weaker movies. I know that's a hot take, but I think he's made better movies than this. This is my personal ranking of his films:Pulp Fiction 10/10
The Hateful Eight 10/10

I found it quite overrated. All the praise over this movie is misleading. It is also a matter of taste to whether you would like it or not.

Holds Up Well,"I think this may be Tarantino's best film. I realize that people will argue with that but it is very stripped down and to the point.

No unnecessary stuff like partners and personal lives. Tarantino has jumbled up the timeline a bit but nothing that can't easily be handled.It is packed with great actors giving great performances. All guys but great guys all the same.There is some violence, especially in one scene but the bigger issue is the blood. This is a blood-soaked film for sure. I wouldn't say that there is more of it than suits the story but some people may find it off putting.I saw it in the theater which is my preferred way to see any movie and I went with a fair bit of dread about the violence / blood.

Nice but not that nice,"Dogs is a decent movie, but time has not made it better. I like a lot about Reservoir Dogs. The acting is good and even though the movie is small, we get a convincing Tarantino world painted around us. The dialog is good and funny as we expect but some of the writing is a little dry and plotting slow. The aftermath of the robbery and the history of an informant pervade the entire storyline. The limited set pieces keep the movie simple but also show that it was clearly written with a very low budget in mind, as such it feels limited in scope with some probably claiming that is part of the point. Whatever. I think there are a few scenes that are downright boring. Joe and Mr. White's exchange in the office is a snooze but the ""Comode"" soliloquy Roth memorizes to convince his fellow robbers of his authenticity is brilliant. The violence is effective, but not quite affecting. I wanted more cuts, more sets, more plot. Dogs could easily be transplanted to a stage and many times that's where it feels we are watching it, which to me isn't a good thing.On the whole its a great first film of course. If we only view films in the context of the time they were released, ET and Star Wars would never be surpassed in their brilliance, thankfully that is not the case. Dogs is good, but not as Brilliant as Empire magazine and other Dogs zealots would have you believe. My advice? Show the robbery in silence from a black and white security cam at the VERY end with the credits rolling and you have a better movie. I like it, I really do, but its not a Rashomon or Rio Bravo. Reservoir Dogs is a nice Point Blank. Nicely entertaining, convincingly executed and completely ineffectual.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
IMO better than Pulp Fiction,"I really love this movie .About a week ago Idecided to watch all Quentin Trantinos movies . I saw Pulp Fiction first and then this . And my God did it blow my mind . Now I said that this movie is better than Pulp Fiction .That is mostly because this movies realism . The dialogue is so natural like Tarantinos dialogue usually is . The characters are all great and you really get invested in them and care for them . The soundtrack is great and the acting though over the top is is till excellent ˙(it goes well with the tone of the movie ). The film is also masterfully shot . I definitely recommend that you watch this film if you don t mind violence and a lot of curse words . Now let s get to the plot . So , the movie revolves around the events after the failed jewelery store robbery ( which we never see but we do hear about it ). The robbers ( our main characters ) have been setup by someone in their group They meet at an abandoned warehouse and stuff happens and we get a lot of scenes that have happened before the robbery where we get to learn more about the characters . I won t give away the rest so you can enjoy the movie without any spoiler . Hope you found the review helpful . Sorry for grammatical errors ( I m in a hurry ).

"Some big disadvantages, with some bigger advantages","For a low budget movie, it's remarkable how many great actors have been casted. Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen are each worth of what the movie did cost.I didn't really enjoy 'Reservoir Dogs'. First of all, the locations of the movie were a garage, an office and sometimes the street. They were waiting and waiting for help for their wounded friend. This made the movie too boring. They didn't need to be there all the time. And when they left, the viewer stayed in the garage.Those were the disadvantages, but there's one very big advantage for this movie. The lines of the actors. Sometimes I had to laugh about them, and sometimes what they were saying was very serious. This saved the movie, in my opinion. The acting was great too. Especially Michael Madsen impressed me as the silent, but very sadistic hench-man.I give this movie a 6 out of 10. I don't want to join the trend of liking everything Tarantino is doing.

The hatred that is exhibited for police officers is somewhat repulsive. It was actually painful to watch.

Don't let that detract you from seeing the movie though as the performances from the actors were brilliant. Keitel in one of the best performances of his career was outstanding, Tim Roth entertaining as ever, Buscemi doing Buscemi things, Madsen being cooler than Bruce Willis in ""The Last Boy Scout"" and a very underrated Chris Penn bring the great dialogue of Tarantino to life. No wonder why Tarantino has cast most of these actors repeatedly in his other movies.The music in this movie also adds some extra flavour.

A very strong debut.,"Quentin Tarantino never ceases to amaze and stun with his films, and this is never more true than in his debut as writer/director of this American crime classic about seven men attempting to pull off the perfect jewel caper, but something goes terribly wrong. They suspect there is a rat informer among them, but who? What makes Reservoir Dogs so memorable is that it is so unlike any other crime drama, yet it fits that genre so well. It is violent, but only in a few scenes and the most horrific occurs off-screen. This film is unique because it tells the story backwards and gives us a better picture of the seven men and their interactions rather than the event that is the holdup. AS expected, the dialogue is the best part of the film and some of the best you will ever hear. The acting is very good as well, especially Michael Madsen as the calm, quiet, psychopathic Mr. Blonde, and Lawrence Tiereny as the head man Joe Cabbot. Really, if you are at all interested in film, this is a must see. Not only is it an American crime classic, it is an influential piece of work that set the stage for one of the best directors of the modern era and his masterpiece: Quentin Tarantino and Pulp Fiction.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Reservoir Dogs - Rugged, raw and riotous","Somewhere along the way, opinions on Quentin Tarantino have become divided - some still loving his work, others calling it bloated and unnecessarily inflated. However, those are two criticisms that cannot be levelled at his first (major) film, Reservoir Dogs. It's the very definition of 'minimalist,' focusing on the aftermath of a bank robbery gone wrong and it's shot (in some places) in 'real time.' The story is simple: a gang of bank robbers thinks that one of their number is a 'rat' and has tipped off the police. How do they deal with this? Watch the film and find out.It's hard to choose a 'stand-out' performance among so many great actors. Everyone from the stoic Harvey Keitel, to the psychotic Michael Madsen plays their roles to perfection (and let's not leave out Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi).Basically, if you like gangster or crime films then you probably should have already seen it. However, even if you're not a fan of the genre and simply enjoy cinema then this one is worth a watch because it is very arty in its approach and the performances alone should make up for the fact that some may consider it to be a little over the top on the violence (not to mention explicit language).Tarantino's next film, Pulp Fiction, may have been cleverer and more stylish, but Reservoir Dogs has all the raw appeal of a real cult classic that will definitely stand the test of time.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Tarantino limits his use of locations to the warehouse, the restaurant and the bank and further limits his characters to twelve.

In typical Tarantino fashion: it's GREAT!,"Reservoir Dogs could almost be adapted into a stage-play thanks to its minute scale yet very lively characters and script. Quentin Tarantino knows how to make non-linear stories flow well and never feel jarring with leaping from beat-to-beat.Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Harvey Keitel are phenomenal as Mr Orange, Mr Blonde and Mr White respectively. They're all so cynical and the passive subtexts in their dialogue aimed at each other shows how full of nuance the film is rich with. And you can't blame them considering that all these take part in a heist, that doesn't go well for everyone involved.Without this film and its success, we'd have no Pulp Fiction.

"Sharp direction, sharp dialogue and sharp suits.","There are two ways one can view a film like Reservoir Dogs (and, indeed, much of Quentin Tarantino's work): a) as an uninspired hodge-podge of ideas blatantly lifted from countless other movies (in this case, a large helping of '80s Hong Kong action thriller City On Fire with countless 'nods' to other crime classics along the way), or b) as an exciting, stylish and highly entertaining exercise in revisionist film-making that sees a bold director mining the work of others to forge a classic of his own.Even though I find description a) applicable to a fair number of QT's films, I cannot help but fall in the latter camp with his debut offering, finding it to be a testament to his deep understanding and appreciation of his medium and his remarkable acuity as both writer and director (he acts in the film too, but two out of three ain't bad, I suppose). In the hands of a lesser film-maker, such an 'homage' would simply be deemed a lazy and unethical exercise in plagiarism, but with Quentin at the helm, infusing proceedings with his unique sense of cool, the whole affair becomes a mesmerising melange of movie-making techniques, a patchwork of pulp excellence that bristles with pithy dialogue and contains many a memorable moment.I can't say the same about Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Vol.2, Death Proof or even Django Unchained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Guns and gore, brilliantly told....although not entirely original.","Director Tarantino's explosive debut feature is a storytelling masterpiece. Conventional linear timeline totally discarded, 'Reservoir Dogs' unfolds to tell of deceit, violence (lots of it), brotherhood and uneasy alliances, with doses of the trademark Tarantino banter. Superb soundtrack sets the mood akin to 70's B-grade shoot'em-up flicks.However, the story itself is far from original. It is popularly known that Tarantino is an avid fan of Hong Kong action flicks. So, it is no major coincidence if you find many similarities in Chow Yun-Fat's ""City On Fire"" (HK, 1987). E.g: Mr. Blonde's apparent trigger-happiness in the jewellery...OR the hero's killing of an innocent bystander...OR the climactic sequence in the warehouse.

Among the most impressive directorial debuts of all time,"I hadn't seen this film since 1992 and the only scenes I remembered were the opening with a bunch of thieves sitting around vulgarly talking about singers and whatnot, a cop tied to a chair in a warehouse and someone profusely bleeding in the backseat of a car. I had forgotten the plot itself and I am so glad I did. There were a few times that I was probably just as stunned by twists and actions as I was the first time. This low budget film about a planned jewelry heist by a first time director is some sort of masterpiece of violence, machismo and mayhem. That it wasn't even a hit when released is amazing. The direction is brilliant and the performances are all outstanding particularly Tim Roth, though again, the six principle actors are all wonderful. We all know about that first time director now. It's hard to tell what is Quentin Tarantino's best film, but this is in the equation. This is essentially a simple plot and he would go on to make much more complex and intricate films, but the roots of every Tarantino is here. This is short, tight, immensely effective with an awesome usage of songs, but that has become commonplace in his films by now. Time has not made this any less potent.

The first 5 minutes, I thought this would be a great movie. But then from then on, I just got bored. Too much repeated conversation. Then one of the heist members tortures a cop, which I found quite disturbing, watching the cops ear get hacked off, and then almost having a flame lit on him whilst there was gasoline doused all over him. Yes, I must say, this movie was boring... no significant characters, and just way too random.

Humble Beginnings,"Tarantino's first feature is rich in characters, witty writing and sudden violence that would later become his trademark.Reservoir Dogs's plot is told in non-linear fashion. One of the great joys of watching this film figuring out the coherent narrative lying within. Making the pieces fit. It is an exercise in style. While technically a heist movie most of the movie is centered around either before the heist or in it's aftermath. This allows Tarantino to flesh out it's ensemble of characters. It's a great testament to the movie that all the characters come off as complex and fascinating within a span of 99 mins.There are twists and turns to keep you hooked throughout. And who can forget Michael Madsen slicing of a dude's ear while 'Stuck in the Middle with you' plays in the background. Classic Tarantino.As enjoyable and fresh it feels, I think it is imperfect. It feels too stagy and the dialogues aren't quite naturalistic (Something Tarantino would perfect in his next film). Still this is a great thriller with tensions mounting while you're as clueless as the characters are.Moral of the movie : Don't Tip, you will live longer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino Classic,"The tittle of the review pretty much says it all. If you like Quentin Tarantino, you will find very few movies written and directed by him that you won't be rating a 9 or 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Defies A Conventional Rating,"If I had a dime for every quart of phony blood the characters swim in, I'd be a millionaire. Add a dime for every f--- word and I'd be a billionaire. Jokes aside, there's clearly a creative force behind this ragged production. Trouble is Tarantino and co. lacked enough budget to complete their hopes. So what we get instead are special moments awkwardly combined. It's not surprising Tarantino would go on to an iconic career once the budget squeeze was off. However, I do wish he could have worked in some eye-catching females for relief from all the ugly guys. Surely that wouldn't have cost much. Nonetheless, I'm sure old time movie buffs like me are delighted to catch authentic tough guy Tierney as the gang leader. Too bad for his career he couldn't limit his fisticuffs to the screen.Because of the Tarantino name and the hallelujah reviews, I guess I was expecting more than the mixed result I got. Still, you might want to catch the compelling moments that dot the result.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coolest movie for 1992,"I've just see the Reservoir Dogs on DVD  and I was impress with the storyline.  Quentin Tarantino did a good job on directing the move. There was so many good actors in  this movie such as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Micheal Madsen, and Steve Busemi.  They all do a good job in this movie. Five stangers work together to pull off a diamond heist but there was a mole in the group.Go rent the movie if you are in to bloodbath's movies",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Awesome crime movie.,"Reservoir Dogs tells the story of 6 total strangers who are gathered by a crime boss and his son to pull off the perfect crime. They don't know any information about each other going in. However, tension and conflict arises when the robbery goes wrong and they decide there must be a snitch in the group. The group spends the film in a safe house, fighting and accusing each other, waiting to be picked up. Reservoir Dogs is a violent and in your face movie, and that's what makes it so great.Before Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino was a complete unknown. He was all set to make this film with $30,000 and a bunch of friends, but Harvey Keitel wanted to be involved, and the movie became professional. The movie showed right away the talent that Quentin Tarantino had for film making. His artistic camera angles, his intensely violent scenes, and best of all, his intelligent and witty dialogue. Reservoir Dogs is a small movie. It takes place all within a day, all within one place. We don't even get to see the robbery take place. However, this still ends up being a classic film.The acting is great. Harvey Keitel put everything he has into this movie, and Steve Buscemi is great as the neurotic Mr. Pink. This movie serves as Michael Madsen and Tim Roth's most memorable roles, and rightfully so.Overall, this is the great film that introduced Quentin Tarantino to the world, and I suggest anyone that liked Kill Bill but hasn't seen any other Tarantino movies, go back and watch this film.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Solid but far from greatness,"There's really not much to this flick.  It's an ultra-slick, highly stylish, ultra-violent quasi-gangster flick about an undercover cop working a sting on a diamond heist.  If you like this kind of thing, then you will get a big kick out of this, but otherwise, avoid it at all costs.  Tarantino, in his debut directorial gig shows he has a panache for very interesting dialogue (that usually has nothing to do with the plot) and a very stylish director's hand.  This flick is far superior to his overly praised ""Pulp Fiction,"" (**) which in my mind was a sloppily put together episodic flick that had some decent movie moments but ultimately had nothing to say beyond its own shock value.  Tarantino's only other turn at direction was ""Jackie Brown,"" (***) which for me was his only real ""film"" whose only downfall was that it took its sweet time getting around to what it had to say about midlife crises. As it stands, ""Reservoir Dogs"" (**1/2) is a solid flick but nothing great. If you want all this clever crime caper/con-game stuff without all the ultra-violence but still have the great dialogue, I recommend the work of David Mamet (""The Spanish Prisoner"" or ""Heist"" should do the trick).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantinos best film,"Yes in my opinion this is quintain tarantinos best feature film (AND THATS SAYING A LOT). The pure ""fun"" of it all is insane, especially given this movies low-budget. The acting in this is out of this world and the blood effects are quite brutalThe pacing in this is pitch perfect, the story and script are so good that you'd think it was written by an experienced writer, not some 20-something year old inexperienced filmmaker. But somehow this movie manages to capture my interest every single time that I watch it.This review is not doing the film ANY justice I cannot put into words how insanely good this film is. But if you don't like blood and gore you should probably skip this oneBut oh my god the acting in this movie is so extremely good and bring the movie up by like 2 stars for me. The script is the tightest of any Tarantino movie and had me captivated (almost) all the way through

"pushy, manipulative, annoying, offensive","I'll give the director this much: few films have ever gotten me thinking so much about why I dislike them.  Actually, I would have just walked out on the thing and be done with it, but the movie's undeserved reputation caused me to wonder if I'd missed something in my rush to judgement (and, not coincidentally, to the exit).I suspect I didn't miss much.  There's a lot to dislike about ""Reservoir Dogs"".  The film's violence is legendary, as is its potty-mouthed dialog, but neither of those are necessarily bad things in a movie.No, what's unforgivable in this movie is the way the director revels in his ability to offend the viewer.  The stage is set in the diner scene, as the cast takes turns mouthing cleverly-scripted yet coldly unfunny trash talk, and by all accounts reaches its climax in the bloody scene that finally got me to walk out of the theater, 20 minutes after I first felt the urge.But never mind the blood and guts--though one suspects that if Tarantino had directed ""Fargo,"" it would consist of little more than shots of the woodchipper in use.  The diner scene pretty much spells out that the director's not interested in making the viewer laugh or think, but only to make him recoil.  Tarantino is undoubtedly skilled at this, but it's not the sort of reaction I'm willing to pay to experience, as one gets enough of that for free these days.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Great story, wonderful camera work.","I had seen this movie years ago, but forgot most of it. I'm so glad that I watched it again. Now I had the chance to really enjoy the dialog, music and camera work. The camera work impressed me the most. It was shot with a look Hitchcock could appreciate. The direction reminded me of some of the great westerns. The camera brings you into a one-on-one relationship with the actor as much as possible for a movie. The dialog is hip, very hip...and leaves the viewer laughing, frowning and in deep concern from time-to-time. This is one movie where the music does play its fair part in the movie. So many times music is just an addition to a movie, written to be a part of the movie. I'm not sure if the movie was sometimes written around a song, but the music was perfect with the crime, and or the sentence. Reservoir Dogs, over many years could become one of the top rated American films. Almost everything was perfect. However, whether on purpose, or to play with the fans; I did see the shadow of a boom microphone in a scene. I'm guessing that's what happens with perfectionists who write and direct movies. In Pulp Fiction, I saw the holes appear in the apartment room before the actual shots were fired. Not many directors and writers could let something so obvious slide by without leaving us guessing if he did this purposely. Same with Kill Bill, Tarantino allowed the parody of blood squirting from limbs. Reservoir Dogs is a beautiful movie in all aspects. Enjoy a true American story!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Seems As If It This Story Really Happened,"'Reservoir Dogs' more than likely refers to a pack of mean, killing, blood-thirsty dogs reuniting at a warehouse after what seemed to be a well thought out heist went terribly wrong. It truly is a very original plot, and unique in its ways relating to violence and the psychos that perform this violence, as if it is routine. The acting is marvelous, especially Tim Roth's who must portray a dying member of the crew of criminals involved in this failed heist. Tarantino's dialog is completely realistic and memorable in a way that you would honestly think that real guys sitting around a table in a coffee shop would say. QT's directional debut is flawless. Lower-budget crime films like these don't get any better than 'Reservoir Dogs', for it is a great all around film, with great action 'shots', and dramatic conflicts. With all of these characteristics that go along with the realistic dialog, it is as if this movie plot really happened, and you are watching it take place, and if the viewer feels like that, then this film is a must-see.For all of the movie-goers out there, this is a crime film to watch, at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Quentin is a Genius,"I was not old enough to see any of Quentin Tarantino's movies when they first came out, but now that I have, I cannot look back.  Reservoir Dogs, the first of his movies in a short (but sweet) line of films is fabulous. Seeing it has made me respect him and the other actors in the film to a higher extent.  Harvey Kietel shows up his role from Taxi Driver, Tim Roth is fabulous (and he has been bumped up on my fave actor list for this role alone), Steve Buscemi is just awesome, and you can look at Chris Penn and see what happens to you when you live in a town without dancing...It is a typical Tarantino-style movie, where everything is messed up, and he starts with the end, and ends with the ending to the end (got that?).  His development of the characters is wonderful, and his ingenious is inspiring. Pulp Fiction was good until I saw Dogs.  May I never look back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very bad. Full of blood and that is it.,"This movie was awful. It was basically a bunch of guys hanging around in a warehouse thinking about who tipped off the cops to their diamond heist, which ruined their whole plan. The entire movie plays out in ""flashback"" mode, with the gang of robbers in a warehouse torturing a kidnapped cop while the film shows flashbacks of what happened during the robbery. One of the robbers was shot while trying to jack a woman's car and he lays in the warehouse bleeding to death until the end of the film because none of the robbers want to take him to the hospital. This is extremely bloody but extremely dumb, with more than a third of the film devoted to a brutal torture scene (which is what made this film so notorious in the first place) where they beat a cop half to death, slice off his ear with a razor blade, douze him with gasoline and are about to burn him alive when the man with the lighter is shot by another robber. In the end, all the robbers end up dead for one of them was killed during the robbery and the rest end up shooting each other.

The script is classic Tarantino; lots of talk and at times scenes play out like black box theater. Despite all of this, I wouldn't care to see this again and again.

Above all an exercise in style over substance,"After director Quentin Tarantino had broken through with ""Pulp fiction"" (1994), ""Reservoir dogs"" (1992) became a cult classic after all.The story of ""Reservoir dogs"" is rather an average one. After a heist gone wrong the members of the gang start distrusting each other and the gang falls apart.The style however is unique and vintage Tarantino.A lot of violence.Contagious soundtrack. In ""Reservoir dogs"" the soundtrack has primarily 70's music and is accompanied by a DJ with an extremely lethargic and deadpan voice (the voice of Steven Wright).Criminals having crazy and unexpected conversations. In the opening scene they talk about the meaning of Madonna songs and the pros and cons of tipping.This style was labeled the ""Nouvelle violence"".""Reservoir dogs"" is however above all an exercise in style over substance.In this respect some scenes may be very beautiful but my question is to which extent they are innovative? Let me give two examples.The first is the intro of the characters right after the opening scene. They leave a restaurant and walk accompanied by the music of ""Little green bag"" (1969, George Baker Selection). The scene is shown in slow motion, following the example given by Martin Scorsese in ""Raging bull"" (1980).The second example is the torture scene executed on the music of ""Stuck in the middle with you"" (1973, Stealers wheel). This is some piece of ""Ultra violence"", but isn't it a bit like the ""Singin in the rain"" scene from ""A clockwork orange"" (1971, Stanley Kubrick)?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The camera watches but never judges. Masden sits down instead of stands because he can't be bothered to get up. Keitel closes the door in the background because it opens by accident.References to Lee Marvin (extremely funny in Paint your Wagon)are made, Buscemi shines, Roth is truly believable as the cop/amateur thief. Keital well Keital is just a movie icon and Masden is truly frightening/but never amusing. Who have I left out.The opening is possibly like no other. Funny, brave and truly original. The opening theme is just so cool you want to stop it play it back and then write an essay on the beauty of image and soundtrack.Who designed the set?

Cinema Reborn,"First films aren't meant it be like this, have no right to be anywhere near this good. They tend to have an academic respect for storytelling rules, to emphasize the visuals.Reservoir Dogs made Tarantino as a director. It was his first chance to truly take control of one of his zinger-laced screenplays and make it his own, and it was his first time working with actors. And with results that would kick-off one of the most revered filmmaking careers in the history of Hollywood, he faced his insecurities head-on: it's all in the performances.This film should not work because it is a heist-film where you never see the heist, where you find out more about a character's take on Madonna's lyrics than their deep-seated motivations for committing the off-screen crime. Most of it happens in a grim safe-house, and features many actors who barely registered on people's radars, led by Harvey Keitel who, immeasurably generous with his co-stars, championed this film into existence and let others keep its most memorable moments.Reservoir Dogs is an impeccably written, performed and crafted dark little gem. It kick-started a slew of new bad habits in filmmaking: self-aware dialogue, retro- soundtracks, and language that comes with its own hygienic disclaimer. Yet like all masterpieces of note, the more you see its influence applied, the more it shines for getting everything perfectly right.it's safe to say Tarantino, drowning in critical-adulation and his urge to fill every film with 70s B-movie homages, has not matched his work here since. Then again, nearly no one else has.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Comical, Crackling Crime Yarn","Tarantino's violent crime tale and character study is a fast-paced, lurid, and wonderfully wicked film about a group of criminals who converge to pull off a diamond heist that ultimately goes awry and causes them all to question who gave their schemes away.While all of Tarantino's characters are dishonest, morally-corrupt, criminals, they all show very different methods of handling their work, and all the actors do a fantastic job of presenting an array of seemingly similar characters and fleshes them out as individual, thoughtful, and sometimes sickly logical.  Steve Buscemi here steals the film as the extremely talkative, motor mouth Mr. Pink who initiates the idea of a conspiracy.  Harvey Keitel is also a formidable force as the too-sympathetic and trusting Mr. White.  The soundtrack is also something to rave about. The 70's music fits the film perfectly.Tarantino's script is sprinkled with some very amusing and well written dialogue as well - he literally transforms excessive cursing and obscene stories into operatic and poetic filth.  Also, the few action scenes reinforce the tension that builds up to the brilliant ending.Reservoir Dogs is a throughly entertaining crime movie that doesn't take itself gravely seriously and presents a thrilling tale in a comical way. Reservoir Dogs is well-acted, well-scripted, and has a gritty feel that separates it from the glossy crime movies that spew from Hollywood.  With a cast of almost virtual unknowns and a dynamite script, Tarantino goes for the audience's throat and packs Reservoir Dogs with thrills and tension to spare.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A delightful menagerie of non-linearity, earlessness, and Joe.","Reservoir Dogs is a (non-linear) story about six (four significantly) unacquainted career-criminals who are hired for a job but introduced to each other by alias only. During the attempted heist (apparently there is one), things go pear-shaped and the presence of a ""rat"" is strongly suspected. Distrust and paranoia predictably ensue, as do sporadic outbreaks of severe physical pain.I disagree with Joe-290 (the only other Irish person to submit a review for this film), in that I do, in fact, think Reservoir Dogs is a great film, certainly within its own decade. The quality of the overall plot (which is good anyway) does not matter, I feel, when the overall effect is considered. This film is endowed with a streak of intelligent originality I have rarely seen elsewhere. The famous inclusion of the soundtrack as part of a radio-station that features prominently during the film is just one of many individual examples.The script is non-linear and non-continuous, and so refers to some aspects of the story only indirectly and certain aspects of the characters which would have been treated with importance in other films are, almost flippantly, left to the imagination. This is, at least, an interesting and original effect and, at best, may even enhance characterization, as events on the screen can never emulate those which occur in the mind.Despite the heavy and sometimes unusual violence, there is an all-too-human and realistic feel to the characters and to events in general. This is perpetuated by scenes such as the ""meeting with Joe"", in which the hired criminals are seen to be assigned their ""job-aliases"" on an arbitrary basis.So what does Reservoir Dogs comment on and depict? Organized crime and its attendant unpleasantness I suppose, for a start. Human relations (I won't get into the whole ""love story between men theory"", although it is amusing to keep in mind post first viewing). It certainly doesn't resolve the problem of existence or articulate the fabric of the universe (though I think Joe almost does so accidentally at one point). It is, however, a verifiable work of art and ""great"" film  and it's damn cool.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
These Dogs Show Their True Colors,"White, Pink, Orange, Brown... you'll be thinking of these colors in a different way after watching this ensemble of actors act their guts out in a twisting, vibrant re-interpretation of a crime drama. Tarantino nails it; the next one, ""Pulp Fiction"" was more ambitious and had more bucks, but this had the advantage of a fresh approach, a new way of presenting cinema as, dare we say it, art. The actors went along with him, all the way, to the smallest detail. Watch the end of the introductory breakfast scene, after Mr. Pink (Buscemi) explains his non-tipping philosophy. Joe (Tierney) returns to the table and commands Pink to pay up anyway and Pink finally complies. Eddie (Penn) sits very solemnly during this point, with his hands under his chin, as if in deep thought. What's he thinking about? Could it be he thinks I should've forced Pink to pay? Is it times like these when I'm still the kid and my dad's the man? This is just a 2-second shot.Examples like that may be why a film such as this gets better every time I see it. I don't remember much about what I thought of it when I first saw it back in '92; probably that it was interesting. I thought it was more interesting the 2nd time I saw it. By the 3rd time, I was thinking, this is fantastic. I've just seen it again, probably for the ninth time and it's better than ever. Returning to Penn's performance as Eddie: most fans of this film usually point out Buscemi as the comical, quick Pink, or the cool Keitel as Mr.White, or the unpredictably cool Madsen as Blonde (Blonde-what a color,eh?-you psycho!). Penn gives the performance of his career here. He switches from daddy's boy to Blonde-type menace in the space of a few frames. He's probably the most creative with Tarantino's lengthy dialog, juggling pressure from his boss/dad, supervising the cadre of crooks and trying to make phone conversations interesting. And Tierney, struggling in a B or C movie career all his long life, has the role of his lifetime here thanks to Tarantino; the entire scene of him giving out the color names to the boys couldn't have been played better.What is really thrilling, however, is how Madsen still manages to surprise and chill after all these years. I watch him now and questions start to percolate in my brain: was he on drugs when he 'acted' this role? Is he slightly insane in real life? He really is amazing here - so much so that the few years following this movie all his roles were overshadowed by this performance. I almost believe Madsen discovered a new method style of acting back then, which didn't take because no one else knew how to do it.So why not a full ten stars? I have a few problems with Roth; nothing too serious - he's dead on in some scenes, such as when he tells himself not to chicken out in the mirror; other times, he's trying hard to hide an accent or just trying too hard. Thing is, in most ways, he has the most difficult role; he has to act like a criminal being acted by someone else being acted by Roth. I'm also aware of accusations regarding the older film ""City on Fire"" which hints this work may be slightly imitative of at least one sequence unlike, say ""Pulp Fiction"" which, despite appearances, is wholly original. But these are quibbles in the end - if Reservoir Dogs isn't original, what is?",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best crime drama ever made,"Reservoir Dogs is an incredible start to Quentin Tarantino's career. First off a lot of people say that this movie is too bloody and too gorey. Not so. Yes there is blood and gore, but its not in excess like a lot of people think. You mention this movie and sometimes all people say is how bloody it is. This movie tells an incredible story of when the perfect plan goes bad and you dont know who you can trust. Michael Madson plays, in my opinion, one of the most sadistic characters ever. He is so arrogant, sarcastic, demented and crazy that you can't help but love him....Hence the ear scene. It's great that now people are starting to really discover this movie. It took 10 years, but hell you will not be disappointed. The acting, story, suspense, humor and twists make this movie a masterpiece. Check out the new 10th anniversary DVD set to get the real scoop on this movie. Get your fave character as the cover. It has some great behind the scenes stuff including a full view of the ear scene. This and Pulp Fiction are my favorite movies. Jackie Brown was okay, but a little to dragging for me. Hopefully the upcoming Kill Bill will get the Tarantino fans back.

Tribute to Tarantino,"Once upon a time, in the bleak, dark days of yesteryear films lacked power and interest.  Then along came a man who would change the filming industry, Quentin Tarantino.Reservoir Dogs, truly is a tribute to filming.  This risque modern day gangster epic simply blew me away.  The scriptwriting in impeccible and the character format - using colours for each character - was genius.Harvey Keitel's performance as Mr White is astounding.  It was here where he became a gangster hero, in true Tarantino style!  This is a proper mind thriller, the greusome scenes which Michael Madsen, as Mr Blond are phenomenally brilliant, albeit quite disturbing!However this lucid torture is accompanied by a now very memorable song 'Stuck In The Middle With You' - Stealers Wheel.  The juxtaposition between the torture and the song is pure genius!Steve Buscemi manages to steal the show once again, as the unforgettable Mr Pink.  He makes his mark with his usual witty comedy and his humourous appearance.However the thing that makes the film is Tarantino's small part during the first few scenes.  He plays the ill-mannered Mr Brown.  His philosophical outlook on the Madonna song 'Like A Virgin' is classic genius in itself. Never again will you be miffed as to what the lyrics mean, as he shrewdly and crudely depicts the true meaning behind the words.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A ground-breaking thriller.,"Reservoir Dogs marks the directorial debut of Quentin Tarantino, and is a smart, gutsy, original slant on a familiar story. Tarantino admitted that he wanted to focus on the events that would normally constitute the final ten minutes of a heist movie, and stretch them out so that the whole film revolves around them. He also admitted that he has no idea why he called the film Reservoir Dogs, though it seems to me to be a wink in the direction of Straw Dogs (another extreme film which pushed back a few moral boundaries twenty years earlier).The plot focuses on the aftermath of a bloody jewel heist. The would-be robbers meet at their agreed rendezvous point in a deserted warehouse. One, Mr. Orange (Roth) is bleeding from a bullet wound to the stomach. Another, Mr. Pink (Buscemi) is roaring and raging that he thinks the heist has been blown wide open by an informant. Then there's Mr. White (Keitel), a cool killer who believes in honour among thieves, who just wants to protect the survivors and get them out of there before the cops show up. But deadliest of all is Mr. Blonde (Madsen), a psychotic loose cannon who's abducted a cop from the crime scene and is prepared to do whatever it takes to find out if there really is a mole amongst the team.Tarantino has a fabulous eye for grim detail and a fabulous ear for believable dialogue. These guys swear a lot and chat about seemingly irrelevant things, but they sound every inch like a team of lethal jewel robbers. The ear-severing scene may have gone down in history as one of the the most horrific scenes ever witnessed, but it's power and impact are undeniable. However, Reservoir Dogs isn't good just because of some snappy interplay and a couple of powerful scenes. It's quality far exceeds that. The structure is very unorthodox and absorbing, while the predicament of the characters is conveyed with genuine excitement. We know from the start that Roth is the informant (the other thieves don't) and there's something moving and honourable bout the way he suffers in silence as the finger of blame shifts about among the bewildered crooks. Reservoir Dogs is an outstanding thriller, as challenging, disturbing and gripping as any film you'll ever see.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good, but not awesome","I saw this yesterday 26/02/2009 and enjoyed it but felt underwhelmed by the films lack of ambition. I was also disappointed by the obvious mistakes at the end of the film, which i'll let anyone who hasn't seen the film notice for themselves. The characters were cool as i had come to expect after watching pulp fiction, but i would much rather watch pulp fiction again than watch reservoir dogs again, largely because in reservoir dogs not much goes on despite some interestin moments. i think that reservoir dogs doesn't live up to the rep i had been made to feel it would deliver to. The range of scenarios was to simplistic, there was large parts where nothing but waiting for people to arrive happens and the overuse of the word fock to make some men sound hard is annoying. the banter is funny tho. overall the films average to good, definitely worth seeing once so you know what its all about but its def not my favourite film as it lacks the wow factor, scope etc but won me over in terms of style. 6/10. i'd like to think i'm mr blonde.hah, well maybe not",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Violence, colours, breakfast, guns, Stealers Wheel, 70's music, blood, and style.","Quentin Tarantino has always been one of my personal favourite directors - and ""Reservoir Dogs"" is his second finest movie. The movie is about Six men, who pull off a bank heist, with colour-coded names - Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino) and Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker). But, this heist goes terribly wrong, and they all plan to meet up at a nearby Warehouse. Some are hurt, crazy, and even dead - but the surviving Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, and the half-dead Mr. Orange, suddenly figure out that they were set up, and one of them MUST be a cop. 'Nice Guy' Eddie (Chris Penn) is the big boss' son, and it was him, and his father, who planned the heist. They find themselves in crazy, unrealistic, and dramatic sequences - as we go through flashbacks of the characters to figure out who was the copper.Reservoir Dogs is a fantastic watch, but not everybody's cup of tea - as for it contains over 200 uses of the ""f"" word, and of course some horrific sequences (including a great 'torture' scene with Michael Madsen like you've never seen him before).

One thing that I like most it's the soundtrack, mostly death songs that rises again with extreme beauty in the perfect moments. Like ""Stuck in the middle with you"" from Stealer's Wheels in the scene when Mr. Blonde cuts offs the cop's ears. Excellent, no better choice. Based in another excellent film ""The Killing"" from Kubrick Reservoir Dogs is a master piece that any movie fan should see.

Without a question the greatest film ever. And I mean EVER!!!,"Reservoir Dogs is the coolest movie ever. Tarantino's directorial debut is perfect. His gift for writing great dialogue and not stereotyping his own characters is apparent from the get go. The cinematography and camera work are tributes to French film makers and their great technique. Harvey Keitel puts up his all time best performance as the very professional yet very gullible Mr White. Michael Madsen also puts out a career best as the psychotic but loyal Mr Blonde. Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth and Chris Penn also put out career high water marks. Quentin Tarantino throws in great stuff from old movie, inside jocks and ironic subliminal settings (the mortuary after a massacre) to make the movie great. Mr Blonde can be seen drinking from a Big Kahuna burger cup just like Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. A killer soundtrack of mostly 70's music. A classic infamous super cool scene of Mr Blonde cutting off a cop's ear to the tune of Steeler's Wheel's ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" while the camera pans away leaving the viewer tortured by their own imagination.

"Funny, Bloody, 1st Rate Gangsterama (& little green bag)","There is a deleted scene in 'Pulp Fiction' where Mia Wallace interviews Vincent Vega and says there are 2 types of people: Elvis people or Beatles people; you can like them both but no one likes them equally.In the same token, there seems to be similar groups who love 'Pulp...' and 'Reservoir...' (though some hate one or the other; or both) but few like them equally. As one of the 'Few' who love both films equally; especially when you consider that 'Reservoir...' was made for only 1.5 million dollars. AND! It was a directorial debut ('Pulp's budget was about 8 1/2 mil; equally impressive). Compared to all the mega million dollar movies, you wonder when will Hollywood learn that age old lesson that the 1st step to a great film is the step that costs the least: the Script.Minor spoilers! A movie about a jewel heist...but you never see the heist. A scene where the crime boss outlines the plan...but the scene cuts before he begins (a very hysterical exchange between crime boss Joe and the 'dogs'; no way am I going to reveal more). In fact, it's criminal to reveal much of anything. Do yourself a favor: if you haven't seen this, don't ruin it for yourself by reading reviews that simply regurgitate the plot. This film's magic works on each element of information carefully unfolding before the viewer. The story unravels! The viewer is hooked.The entire cast is top-notch. For one of the few times we're treated to 'acting' and 're-acting'; dialogue that responds to a response... to a response (etc.) to what was said. And small wonder there are legions of people that have the monologues memorized. It's priceless.Yes...the violence IS disturbing...the way violence really is (there's something very wrong when violence becomes entertaining which this film does NOT do...then again that may depend upon the viewer's perception).And the new DTS sound transfer on the 10th anniversary edition makes the gunfire blast that much more powerful and disturbing. And how about that ""K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's"".Now the screen aspect ratio. From the deleted scenes on the bonus material, it's looks like the film was shot at the 1:66 format (which fills the TV screen a little more than the usual widescreen 1:85 format, and a lot more than the very wide 2:35 format). Usually, I champion the wide screen format over full screen, providing that the widescreen format is a TRUE widescreen. This film is not It actually showed more on 'Resevior Dogs' 1st DVD release on the full screen side (and previous cable TV broadcasts). Because on a 1:66 ratio, when the transfer is zoomed in for the 3:4 standard TV; you, the viewer don't lose much visual information. But it was theatrically released in the 2:35 ratio. The point is: the 10th Annivesary Edition took it's full screen transfer from the 'already' zoomed in 2:35 (all you thousands reading this, raise your hand if you don't understand!).An homage to a 25 minute segment from a Hong Kong film called ""City On Fire"". Simular plot outline, that's it! These 2 movies are very different. And Tarantino proves that 'novel rules' works on the film format too.Oh!

The pace was slower than what I had expected from the man who made Pulp.  I angerly returned the tape to Blockbuster.My friend, a fellow Tarantino fan, insisted that I see the movie again, only watch the entire movie this time, so I went by the tape store and picked up a copy.  Man I'm so glad I did.I understand why I hated it at first.  It starts off really slow.  There is very little action in the movie let alone the first hour of it.  I had thought this was an action movie, it's not.  This is a character movie that is filled with great, well-written dialog.This is also a bit of a disturbing movie.  Many of the torture scenes are a little repulsive, but there is always some great '70s song playing.  I love this type of filmmaking.

I could see not being sure about a guy, but I don't think a big time boss would ever take the risk of incriminating himself by talking minutia with the hired goons. Thats counter to the entire principle of organized crime, least what I've always been led to believe. But thats nitpicky stuff, because the movie otherwise is a knockout in almost every sense of the word. Tarantino delivers on style and script in a way which he has never been able to replicate.

Brilliant Film. Quentin Tarantino rules!!,"Perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, Reservoir Dogs is a relentless and fierce film from beginning to end. Director/Writer/Actor Quentin Tarantino directs and screenwrites this film about a group of criminals put together to pull off a diamond heist. The simple heist goes horribly wrong leaving a huge mess for the criminals to sort out. In the middle of the main plot the film also tells about each character and their aliases. (which are based on colors) The film stars: Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde, Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie, Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot, and the voice of Steven Wright as the hillarious DJ K Billy. All of the acting in this film is far past excellent. Mr favorite actor in this film has got to be Steve Buscemi, who turns in an excellent performance as ""The Professional"" criminal and cynical Mr. Pink. On screen the film contains many shocking visuals including the infamous ""ear"" scene played to the song ""Stuck In the Middle With You."" Throughout the film all of the criminals are trying to figure out which, if any of the members is an undercover cop because it seems like they were set up. I won't give way any more details but all i have to say is that this film is revolutionary and paved the way for the visonary Quentin Tarantino who would release his greatest accomplisment in 1994 with Pulp Fiction.

Reservoir Dogs is the 1992 debut feature film of director and writer Quentin Tarantino.,"Reservoir Dogs is the 1992 debut feature film of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It portrays what happened before and after a botched jewel heist, but not the heist itself. Reservoir Dogs stars an ensemble cast with Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino also has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker. It incorporates many themes and aesthetics that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, memorable dialogue with excessive profanity and a nonlinear storyline.The film has become a classic of independent film and a cult hit. It was named ""Greatest Independent Film of all Time"" by Empire. Reservoir Dogs was generally well received and the cast was praised by many critics. Although it never became a major box office success grossing $2,832,029, it achieved higher popularity after the success of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. It is often criticized for its high amount of violence and profanity, and audience members reportedly walked out during the infamous ear-cutting scene.Thanks Sanjiv Christian SEO",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

shocking,"With Reservoir Dogs Quetin Tarantino shocked the film going audience awake with a film that showed a flair for crackling dialogue and blistering violence.  A group of criminals get together to do a heist and it all goes sour.  The dialogue is foul and fast.  The film does not let up, the violence pulls you in.  It repulses you and yet you can not look away.  The films most effective sequence is when Mr. Blonde cuts off the ear of a captive cop.  Instead of seeing the bloody scene, Tarantino pulls away and lets our minds fill in the blanks.  In doing that, it becomes a much more gruesome scene.  All the ruminations of the main players culminates in a stand-off between Nice Guy Eddie, Joe, and Mr. White.  Joe knows that Mr. Orange is a cop, Mr. White doesn't know that and is determined to protect him.  Nice Guy Eddie is incensed that Mr. White has pulled a gun on his dad. The scene climaxes as each character lets out with gunfire and everyone goes down.  The film ends with Mr. White leering of Mr. Orange's true nature and putting a gun to his head.  We hear cops yelling and Mr. White pulls the trigger.  A very loud wake up call to makers of films that have no real characters.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's about weirdly realistic characters with ups and downs like normal people.As all perceivably ancient cultures say ""it's not the end that matters but the trip in itself.""From this perspective, Reservoir Dogs can be seen as a static road movie. It's a metaphysical journey through the characters' lives and how they are interconnected. If you liked Magnolia you should like Reservoir Dogs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A fierce crime thriller,"A group of crooks are assembled to pull of a jewelry heist and the stick-up quickly turns to a shootout and the seemingly perfect crime goes perfectly wrong. The alarm goes off, the police show up, innocents get shot, and the crooks split and barely make it out alive. Were they set up? Bad luck? Or what? What ""follows"" is the aftermath of it all as they reflect how they got there and what they are going to do now. I put the ""follows"" in quotes, because the robbery is the inciting incident to the main story, but interestingly this film has plenty of back story that develops as we see how each of the robbers wound up pulling the job and the whole film is very broken up chronologically. Interestingly Tarantino makes it work and each back-story or reflection is clever and the whole mass of all the flashbacks, some pertaining directly to the robbery some not, make for a big picture showing who these lowlifes really are.Now that's another thing: lowlifes. The protagonists are essentially that. Uneducated, career crooks, that can't hold a regular job or go straight. Basically people that no one is too interested in, but Tarantino treats them like fair human beings and it is admittedly strange to see people like this with a human or humorous side and to see how they justify to themselves what they do for a living. I have heard this film bashed (along with Pulp Fiction) for the pointlessness of its conversations, but if you think about it, life is full of conversations that you forget the next day. And what do you expect gun totting crooks to discuss? Something that a regular person would consider meaningful to their life? While I do agree many of the dialogs are tedious and don't really relate to my life or anyone else that I know, they paint a believable human image of people we'd like to do away with.This film is based on Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire,"" starring Chow Yun-Fat, but out of the two ""Reservoir Dogs"" is definitely better. It is much more focused on its characters and on the film's main situation, the robbery. Lam's film wandered too much, but it is also a recommended viewing as it inspired one of film-making fiercest debuts. 9/10Rated R: graphic violence, brutality, and strong profanity",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Tarantino's First Big Shot,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is the movie that introduced the world to Quentin Tarantino's style of movie-making. Stories full of cool characters, non-linear events, music and pop culture, and of course, lots of violence. Tarantino directed the movie, and also appeared as Mr. Brown. The story in ""Reservoir Dogs"" involves a jewel heist, even though the crime is never seen. The men hired for the heist are all strangers to each other, and all given aliases, to prevent them all from learning anything about each other. But the heist soon goes awry, and it ends violently. Two scenes in particular stand out about this movie: one is the infamous scene in which Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) slices off a cop's ear, a violent scene which is mostly implied. The other is the Mexican standoff scene near the end, a very tense moment. Tarantino has proved his power as a groundbreaking filmmaker with ""Reservoir Dogs.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Best Crime Drama. Period.,"Yeah, others may say that Res. Dogs wouldn't go down as the best crime drama ever, but to me, it even beats The Godfather.Over this past year, Quentin Tarinto has become a hero of mine because of his ability at story telling through dialouge. Every critic knows that Tarintino is a God when it comes to wonderful dialouge, and Reservoir Dogs is no exception.I mean, practically the whole movie takes place in a wharehouse, minus the flashback scenes, so normally, most people would be bored with what little action is taking place.

It's a vicious, cynic, modern masterpiece and one of the best debuts I known to date.The story about a robbery that's gone very wrong is told in an amazing way. We never actually get to see the robbery, the only thing we viewers get to know about it is what the characters say, as they are trying to figure out who's the rat among this bunch of vermin.A great cast where Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel stand out among the others, whom are also great.A masterfully written, witty and highly sarcastic dialogue and well thought out scenes and screenplay, this is Tarantino in his prime.The cynical and at some parts sadistic violence might put some people off, but that's their loss. After this movie, Tarantino's career has been somewhat of a yo-yo, Directing and/or writing great stuff like ""True Romance"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" and less inspired flicks such as ""From dusk till dawn"" and ""Kill bill"".Anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet, you should know what to do about know.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"What a Pathetic, Sad, State of Affairs...","this world must be in, for this non-sensical pile of drivel to garner this much positive attention.It never fails in modern-day cinema, that whenever over-the-top gory, pointless violence is dressed up in hip clothing, and wrapped around so-called ""cool"" fast dialogue, that every Mutton-headed, knuckle scraping Baboon with an internet connection, a keyboard, and a desire to be as ""hip"" as the idiots they heap their praise on, will show up and make excuses for it. Inspiring?, as one reviewer mentioned? Puh-lease. If this garbage is where you look to for ANY kind of inspiration, you're even worse off than first believed.

A great start to an almost quarter-century of cinematic quality and excitement!,"This unique take on the heist-film-gone-wrong was excellent--stylish and intelligently made, yet very funny and inexpensive. Tarantino's accolades from giving American cinema the resuscitation it needed mirrors what has happened, at least since the 70's, with Martin Scorsese's 'Mean Streets', both in terms of entertaining violence and usage of music in the scoring of films. I greatly thank Harvey Keitel for taking a chance on Tarantino back then--It paid off in spades.Minor notes: I also greatly enjoyed the six mini-interviews with people from the film on my DVD, 'Reservoir Dogs: Ten Years'. I can't believe Chris Penn died at only 40 years of age. As well, I haven't checked out the commentary track yet, but definitely am looking forward to it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Despite It's Slick Style And Unique Take, It Leaves You Underwhelmed","Reservoir Dogs is the debut film from Quentin Tarantino and I can definitely say that he is definitely a dime a dozen. Tarantino was bold with making his debut film so unique from the it's competitors at the time.Reservoir Dogs is written by Tarantino and Roger Avary contributing some dialogue for the film. What Tarantino has written is a twist of a staple story in the crime genre, where the events of the actual robbery is not seen but rather shine a light the events after the robbery. Tarantino could have kept it with that road but instead the film flips back and forth between origin/specific robbery stories and the post-robbery events. The film is driven by dialogue, which is now considered a principle in his films, and the dialogue is definitely different from crime films that preceded this film. Instead of physical actions and deep insight of the character's emotional core, characters are instead shaped by Tarantino's dialogue with characters speaking about themselves or others which in turn shapes our perception of these characters, which I think is important in order to view the plot objectively and not gain a deep attachment to these characters. The issues I had with his script is the underwhelming origin stories that doesn't really show off the wildness and absurdity that is found with many of his future films. The screenplay also felt a little held back on pushing the boundaries of the dialogue when compared to his succeeding films. The dialogue also from time to time jump from being a natural and organic conversation, regardless if they are in a crisis situation, to basic plot driving dialogue.Quentin Tarantino is an amazing director and even though all of his films are not always in excellent condition, though his worst are miles better than most films it competes with, he still brings a sense of style that defines the film and it's fresh unique take allows us to be curious on what could come on the next scene. Reservoir Dogs is his first film which is the main reason why this film felt a bit rushed or amateurish, not in a bad way but rather in an inexperienced way. The film definitely is limited by a budget and that in a way restricted Tarantino, as he seems to show more crazy and fun sequences when he has the budget for it. The film for the most part keeps me interested with it's great pace and it's characters play with his dialogue, though Mr Orange's backstory did feel tiresome and did feel like walking through a mountain after the swift two thirds of the film. The film's non-linear approach does kind of play off the style that Kubrick applied for The Killing.Andrzej Sekula is the cinematographer for this film and he returns again in Tarantino's sophomore film. Sekula and Tarantino felt like they were held back in this film due to the budget therefore the film felt like it has this rushed hand held style that a lot of the moments of the film contains but this film does show hints of the photography style that Tarantino employs in his future films, with crooked angles, long takes and long shots of dialogue-full moments allowing the film to feel like a play, which is obvious in this film due to it's budget and boxed story.This film doesn't include a score and this does in a way allow the film to suffer with moments that felt overstretched and needed that cinematic flair. Pulp Fiction also has these features but it makes up for it by having a sufficient amount of musical nuggets throughout the film that keep it from being stale. Though the musical moments that do cameo in this film are top notch with moments that actually feel more gruesome and horrific than what it already is.Reservoir Dogs' cast is confined to 10 people and they are given the majority of the screen time, and it most cases it is shared. The actors do play off well with each other and along with the strong dialogue it makes the film entertaining. The standout actors in this film is Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen, when they are bantering they all just bring the intensity that the scene required and are able to stay strong and fresh in long takes that includes monologues and subtle physical acting. Tim Roth was a bit of a distraction though, his American accent and the slight over the top acting did have me cringing.Tarantino's debut does bring something unique and fresh to the crime genre but with an underwhelming screenplay and the inexperience and budget constriction does bring the film down.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"World, Meet Quentin Tarantino","Quentin Tarantino is loved and hated by many, as is his debut feature, Reservoir Dogs. Like the bulk of Tarantino's work, many criticize Dogs as being pointless, excessively violent, and filled with over-the-top obscenities. I've always looked at it in a different light, as I consider it something of a The Crucible for the '90s.The Reservoir Dogs are Mr. White (Keitel), the sympathetic veteran; Mr. Orange (Roth), the young rookie; Mr. Pink (Buscemi), the squirrelly yet levelheaded one; Joe Cabot (Tierney), the tough guy boss; Nice Guy Eddie (Penn), Cabot's enterprising son; Mr. Brown (Tarantino), bit part #1; Mr. Blue (Bunker), bit part #2; and of course the infamous Mr. Blonde (Madsen), the laid-back badass. The ragtag Dogs are assembled to pull off a diamond heist, but their simple crime turns into a bloodbath, and the Dogs, one by one, regroup at a warehouse, where they hypothesize and accuse as to who among them is an undercover police informer.Right off the bat, Tarantino directs, writes, and pseudo-scores a film masterfully; not bad for a high school dropout whose resume consisted of porn theater worker and a video store clerk. His direction is fresh, gritty, and packed with homages.His writing is realism embellished with ""cool"". Considering that the Dogs are all ruthless criminals, the strong usage of expletives is perfectly feasible and never feels gimmicky. The dialogue is intense and thoroughly realistic, yet Tarantino sprinkles ""cool"" throughout it, and he does it so impeccably that one hardly notices (he does this even better in his follow-up, Pulp Fiction). And by ""pseudo-scoring"", I mean that Tarantino fills the film with fun, hip, energizing music, yet he did not write a note of it. A perfect example of this is the masterpiece of a scene in which Mr. Blonde tortures a young cop while the radio plays ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" by Stealer's Wheel. In fact, there is no doubt that Dogs almost single-handedly revived this great song and made it a pop culture classic. The uneasy juxtaposition of brutal violence and upbeat pop music is reminiscent of Wes Craven's The Last House On The Left, only it is done infinitely better than in the aforementioned House.But what impresses me the most about Dogs is: a) Tarantino's flawless direction of his actors. The cast is literally perfect and the chemistry flows relentlessly. The emotion is raw and real, especially in the performances of: -Tim Roth: Considering that his character has a profusely bleeding bullet wound in the gut throughout most of the film, what Roth does with his role is nothing short of remarkable. Through his visceral facial expressions and perfect delivery of dialogue, the audience feels his pain. -Harvey Keitel: Keitel reveals everything that is going on inside his character's mind through his immaculate facial expressions. -Steve Buscemi: Never before and never again will audience love such a squirrelly character, and this due almost entirely to Buscemi's absolutely fantastic performance. -Michael Madsen: In his limited screen time, Madsen delivers a performance that is sinister, funny, likable, and reprehensible all at the same time. and b) The storyline. On the surface, Reservoir Dogs is a stylized gangster movie, but underneath, it is an intriguing character study and a cynical commentary on human nature. Like in Arthur Miller's The Crucible, a dangerous suspicion breaks out, and for the duration of the story, the characters are in a flurry of accusations and frustrations.As for the infamous level of violence, this Dog has more bark than its bite. It has more of a violent reputation than actual violence. Yes, an ear is cut off. Yes, a number people are shot and killed. This is nothing new or particularly shocking. Hasn't anyone seen the far more brutal GoodFellas?Tarantino has crafted a masterpiece with Reservoir Dogs, a film that entertains and distresses from the opening scene (in which Mr. Brown offers a dissection of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" and Mr. Pink explains why he does not tip) to the gut-wrenching final frame. A brilliant and remarkably impressive debut from a filmmaker who went on to greatness I need not comment on.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""City on Fire"", the remake?","Despite the fact that this film 'borrows' lots of elements, i.e.     the main aspects of the story, from Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire""(1987), this is an excellent debut film for Tarantino.He has abstracted, in my opinion, the better ideas from ""City on Fire"" and reworked/formatted them in a fresher style.  The better ideas 'taken' from the storyline include - a young cop who penetrates and assists a wanted gang(and main leader) with a jewellery heist, which of course goes wrong because of an informed police ambush; the young cop becoming good friends with the older robber; then a fateful episode at the rendez-vous point, containing the memorable gun stand-off scene with three of the gang members(although this amounts to nothing in ""City on Fire"").Although this pretty much sounds like a blatant rip-off, Tarantino cleverly manages to freshen the plot up and modernise it by not even showing the heist and keeping the film in present tense, with relevant flashbacks. This adds to the audiences' intrigue as to what actually happened at the robbery and who the rat is.Another gripe that I have with the film though is regarding a couple of continuity errors.  Firstly, in a flashback straight after the robbery we see Mr Pink(Buscemi) running down the street with a bag(presumably containing the diamonds).  But when he goes to get into the car he places the bag onto the ground, and we then see him driving away, without picking the bag up!  Secondly, when Eddie, Mr Blonde and Mr Pink bring the hostage cop, Marvin Nash,  into the warehouse his hands are tied/cuffed behind his back.  Moments later his hands are in front of him, enabling him to be hung up from his arms.  And although this sounds like I am being picky, it's the tiny things like this which annoy me in films.Despite this ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a brilliant film with an excellent cast and great acting, especially Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi; superb dialogue which is occasionally witty; moments of violence, which I do not believe to be too gratuituous; a simple but effective wardrobe; and a really, really good soundtrack from beginning to end.To conclude, I would have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""Res. Dogs"", and I recommend it as a definite must-see film, along with ""City on Fire"". ""Res. Dogs"" is full of the style and black humour which Tarantino also later applied to ""Pulp Fiction"", and serves as a text which shows that the genre of violent films can actually also look really cool.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Quentin's first attempt at movie-making!,"Reservoir Dogs was the first movie directed by Quentin Tarantino before moving on to big projects such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill where he uses violence, hard language and sharp dialog to keep this film on an edge.The film starts off with six gangsters with colored nicknames working for Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son (Chris Penn) where their mission is to rob a bank and make it back with the jewels. The only problem is that somebody knew about the operation in advance where the surviving members meet back at a hideout where questions must be answered and fast before they get busted.While Joe and his son run the operation, the leader of the nickname pack is Mr. White (Harvey Keital) a lowlife criminal who is confident that things will run smooth. The rest of the group is followed by Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) a motormouth who always has an opinion for everything he sees; Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) is the new criminal who befriends Mr. White; Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) is the old timer who doesn't have much to say; then there's Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino) who makes references about Madonna and her wild oral sex along with her music videos; then there's Mr. Blonde A.K.A., Vic Vega (Michael Madsen) a tough gangster with a bit of an attitude.As the gangsters hide out in a local warehouse waiting for answers and help, the premise of the film shows flashbacks of the characters before the operation starts with some of them being friends along with others joining the group because of a reputation. Scenes cut back to the present time where time is running out and things get more violent with a few bit surprises along the way.This is a classic Tarantino movie where he wants to show audience members what it's like to watch his films from hardcore violence, hip soundtracks and movie references.He still remains a master filmmaker.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Takes numerous influences and moulds them into something superb...,"With ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino created a heist film of spectacular impact.  The audience is thrown straight into the action and through clever dialogue quickly becomes attached in some way (even if it be hate) to the characters.  We learn much of what we are shown before we are shown it, but our interest is not diluted because of Tarantino's proficiency at his craft. Credit must also go to the fantastic ensemble of actors who breathe life so vividly into their characters.This effort supercedes all that Tarantino has done up until the time of writing.  Its curious and seemingly contradictory blend of amateur style shooting (No doubt caused by the seediness of the warehouse as the main locale) and yet ultimately professional final production make this a more INTENSE watch than ""Pulp Fiction"" et al.  It's less about trying to be 'cool', and more about trying for naturalism, with 'cool' nevertheless still being the inevitable result.A film that's impossible to ignore if you have any love for cinema as a medium.  You may hate it, but it would be foolish to deny that it deserves its place in film history as being a monumental surprise when it was released.In my opinion, this is classic film-making from the modern era.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Two Guns Up!,"A director's first feature length film can make or break their career. If the film is successful and looked at as a nice first piece, the director must keep it going and make an even better picture. But the real test is the first picture's appeal to audiences. It can't be dull, boring, and have a bad ending. It has to be great all the way through to the last frame. One director created a whole new type of movie...a Quentin Tarantino film...In Quentin Tarantino's film debut Reservoir Dogs, we follow a group of men who attempt to steal a shipment of diamonds. Joe (Lawrence Tierney), the organizer of the group, has hand selected each of the six men who will perform the robbery. Each is given an alias except for Joe and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) to hide identities in case of someone getting caught and to cover up tracks. There is Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), and much to his dismay there is Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi).The job appears to be simple, get in, get out, and get paid. There are eight men total and not a single one of them could ever expected what would happen. After a nice opening in a small diner and what would become the ""Reservoir Dogs March"", we cut to Mr. White and Mr. Orange driving away really fast to the ware house where they would all meet. Mr. Orange has been ""tagged"" in the gut and is bleeding quite a bit. Mr. White has given him his real name, Larry, to comfort him. When Mr. Pink arrives shortly after them, he gives his side of the robbery gone wrong. They both agree that there is definitely a snitch in the group. During the heist, the police appeared out of nowhere almost anticipating what would play out. Mr. Blonde in a state of panic/craziness decided to start shooting innocent people, fearing someone triggered the alarm. When the dust settled, cops were dead, civilians were dead, Mr. Orange was shot, Mr. Brown was shot in the head and believed dead, Mr. Blue was MIA, Mr. Pink and Mr. White are trying to solve everything, and Mr. Blonde has a surprise for them...a cop in a trunk. The movie takes an interesting turn as Mr. Blonde's sanity is in question and the cop is ""interrogated"".Tarantino's unique style shines with his camera angles, music selections, and of course...his dialogue. Tarantino's writing is phenomenal and incredibly brilliant. As soon as the movie starts he thrusts us into the middle of the eight men having a conversation of breakfast. The conversation being Madonna's hit single ""Like a Virgin"". The meaning of the song and how it was derived is brought up. Not your average movie talk, but it's just like real life. The flow and the reactions from everyone make it very real. This is by far Tarantino's strong point. He takes a great story and writes an incredible screenplay.The cast is phenomenal fulfilling their roles as tough guys out to do another ""job"". Keitel is the tough talking, heart of gold bad-ass who will help you off the ground and shoot the guy in front of him at the same time. It's as if his conscience takes a break every now and then. Buscemi and Madsen earn respect for their deliveries as Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde. Roth does is impressive as the rookie and shows his strengths at acting. Even Penn and Tierney deserve credit for their roles as father and son. They might not act like family but put a gun in one of their faces, the other will be at your throat. All together this a magnificent ensemble.Reservoir Dogs will go down in movie history as the gateway to a new generation of film making. Tarantino brings us one of the most unforgettable movies of all time. Thankfully he didn't let this movie go to his head too much and made more great films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and both of the Kill Bill movies.

"An average movie from Quentin ""One hit wonder"" Tarantino","Pulp Fiction might be the best movie of the decade and Reservoir Dogs is not a bad movie, its just not very good.  Tarantino deserves all the praise in the world for Pulp Fiction, it was a great script, wonderful direction and he even managed to resurrect the dead (John Travolta.)  Reservoir Dogs struggles most of the way after a great first five minutes.  The movie's psychological tension falls well short of what it could be because it is quickly lost through thoughtless violence.  Violence can fit if its done well (Fargo, Godfather, Pulp Fiction) but this violence is totally pointless.  Useless and tasteless violence like this is only needed in a movie with no story, if the movie already has a story it turns the viewer away from an otherwise provocative story as was the case in Reservoir Dogs.  Tarantino seems to have the know-how to make an excellent movie, only he manages to blow it every time except for Pulp Fiction.  Reservoir Dogs is not without fine acting, at the forefront are Tim Roth and Chris Penn, Michael Madsen is excellent too, but Steve Buscemi is not on par with his performances in Desperado and Fargo and Harvey Keitel is just awful.  I can't stomach his waivering from trying to look cool and tough to whining and crying in vigalantic protection of Tim Roth and back an forth.  I suppose it could work, but not Keitel, wrong guy for the movie, he should stick to Sister Act.  Tarantino casts himself perfectly as Mr. Brown, he has a brief but very funny part both talking about Madonna and yelling ""I'm going blind!"" his acting is not bad at all in this one.  All in all, Tarantino was close, but this movie ends up not being a lot of fun, not a lot of story nor a lot of thought, we'll only ever see those three from him once in this lifetime.  What has he been doing lately anyway? Maybe Travolta needs to return the favor and try to bring the spotlight back on Tarantino. **",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Robbery goes wrong, blame game starts","It is throwback Thursday again and this time I saw Tarantino's first movie of 1992. As per trivia he was not so well off with funds at that time and had difficulties in making the movie. The production, costumes, filming etc were all a make shift arrangement and initially he planned to make it in Band W. Apparently he could finally make it in the way he wanted. All the Tarantino touches including stylistic picturisation, non linear narrative, violence filled scenes, excessive conversations on mundane issues, profanity in dialogue, an extended cameo by Tarantino himself etc etc were possibility formulated in this movie. Few scenes were familiar like discussion in a restaurant and a grievously wounded guy in the backseat of a car. Almost half of movie is set in a warehouse where extensive discussions take place and it appears like a photographed stage play at times. One notable aspect in this movie was that the background music was not though an orchestra but playback of recorded songs of the 70s. The plot was about a group of gangsters who blame each other after a jewellery heist goes horribly wrong specially after they come to know that one of them was an undercover cop who had informed the police.( It seems the title refers to dogs fighting amongst themselves in a closed reservoir). Just like "" Pulp fiction"" ( his later movie) one has to put the episodes in a chronological sequence to understand the plot. This one is comparably simpler though. I find that there are no stars in this movie not that it matters since stylistic picturisation is the star in Tarantino movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Promising,"Reservoir Dogs is was started it all. This is a fact. The Sundance Film Festival had in 1992 what was basically Arthur C. Clarke's 2010, the year they made contact. Tarantino broke new bounds in his debut with Reservoir Dogs, Rodriguez broke new bounds in his debut with El Mariachi, Allison Anders with Gas, Food, Lodging, Gregg Araki with The Living End, Jimenez and Steinberg with The Waterdance, Tom Kalin with Swoon, Anthony Drazan with Zebrahead. The one that stuck with everyone and lingered and served as the omen for what was to become a new wave of cinema for the past 14 years was Reservoir Dogs.As much as I get sick and tired of the truly excessive worship Tarantino receives, one can never ever say his movies are bad. He is one of the few great independent filmmakers that started with a low-budget debut that was actually a truly great film. Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese, two directors whose films can hardly ever be rated below 9 or 10 on this IMDb rating scale, both started off with films that weren't terribly great, and not only that, they like everyone else started off with short films and student films. Tarantino's career just started with this color, star-studded, completely un-campy, blood-soaked drama and has never once gone downhill since. The cinematography gives it the perfect look and gives off intermittent volatility, the editing very subtle even if the keenest, sharpest movie obsessive can tell when a cutaway is a cutaway and an insert is an insert. Do I think he should be mentioned as someone you can never compare to whenever a director makes a crime film? Should every other movie be deemed average or a little above because by comparison Tarantino's genius is no match? No. And I get very frustrated whenever I see instances such as these, which happens to be all the time. Nevertheless, the man is an extraordinary filmmaker, a master from the beginning, which is something you can definitely say is rare.The cast, all having been in jail at some point in their off-screen lives, is generally excellent. This is one of Keitel's best performances by a long shot. Buscemi turns in an incredibly smart performance, letting us know that he is possibly the smartest one of the whole bunch. Roth is a chameleon, always shocking us with Mr. Orange's transience. Tierney, famously the main livewire during shooting of the film, radiates that unspoken, indirectly communicated grit and spunk in only a few, mostly fairly docile scenes. While the late Penn lingers between false and passable, Madsen is the most memorable and unique. The cold, unpredictable nature of Mr. Blonde appears with the utmost effect in his performance.This being what has to be a viewing that contributes to what has to be hundreds of times I've seen it, just like most people my age and my sex, I forgot how much the film itself is a film outside conventional storytelling. It begins, as you all know, with a bunch of guys in suits, tough and cool manly men, sitting around a table in a coffee shop theorizing on the song ""Like A Virgin"" and systematic tipping of waitresses. Then they leave. Then the opening credits start. Then one of them is bleeding to death in the back seat of a car being driven at a grueling pace by another of them. Our thoughts suddenly shift. The film continues in this manner. The plot unfolds in ways where our minds take hairpin turns from what we were immediately expecting and gives us something much better and much more riveting and unpredictable. Though his later films elaborate on his brilliance in writing, Reservoir Dogs remains a clear demonstration of Tarantino's shining gift for the power of the pen. He has what even most of the greatest screenwriters of all time don't have, which is a knack for never giving us what we expect and making us love it and want more no matter how extensive the running time. He also has what every great screenwriter has, and then some.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best of Tarantino's early films,The film packs a lot of characters in this multi-faceted story with the glorious dialogues that is typical of Tarantino's films. I am not giving a higher score after discovering that the film was inspired from an older Hong Kong crime drama starring Chow Yun-FatWe can safely say that the director had made complete use of the shoestring budget that he was provided with. You can feel the effort behind every scene and the acting is brilliant enough to keep you involved in the storyThe genius of the director lies in the complex characters he plays with in the film. The script is well-written and never allows you to feel any dull moments despite having many scenes with a lot of dialogues.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Tarantino's best so far,Reservoir Dogs is that rare movie that can be watched over and over and over again and you never grow tired of it. Tarantino's gift for writing great dialogue is never more evident than it is in this film. The dialogue is what makes his movies so great. The characters talk like real people instead of sounding like they're reading from a book. Reservoir Dogs doesn't show you most of the action but prefers to involve you in the panicked recollections of the thieves as they try to suss out the rat amongst them. Great performances by all involved and a K-tel ready soundtrack help make Dogs a great movie to watch. This film is arguably the movie in Tarantino's bag that has the smallest scope. It doesn't take place in a lot of places like Jackie Brown and has a smaller cast of characters than either Brown or Pulp Fiction. We have to wait until the release of Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2 to see if he can top his first effort. Bottom Line: Brilliant moviemaking from the modern crime master. If you haven't seen this then you really need to step away from the computer and go get it. If you have seen it and you don't have the DVD special edition then you may be forgiven for your sloth at not picking it up yet. Go get it.

A Fine Ending,"This movie begins at the end.  Sort of.  It is Quentin Tarantino's major masterpiece, the film which gave him such instant fame.  The reason this film amazed me so much is that it only had a budget of 1 million dollars and a group of unknown (at the time, of course) actors.  These actors are all now well respected.  Harvy Keitel even made a comeback.The movie begins at the ending.  There are a series of flashbacks, and they all lead up to an excellent climactic standoff.  I mean, this whole film is a climax!  Somehow Quentin Tarantino put in a bunch of dialogue which makes one laugh and feel as if they know the characters personally.  Who knows what magic he was weaving when he was writing the script, but Reservoir Dogs has some of the best dialogue I know of.Reservoir surpasses Pulp Fiction in my opinion.  The movie was not meant to be a big hit really, while Pulp Ficiton knew it would make money.  Dogs is a hit.  A true hit.  See this movie, because it is a definite gem on the movie shelf, even if it sometimes goes unnoticed by the masses.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Who would think that such a simple plot could turn out so good?,"I watched this movie a couple of months ago for the first time ever, before I became a QT fan, I never heard of this movie. When I first saw it, I understood why this movie launched him to fame, simply because it is so good!The whole thing is about a bunch of professional thieves unrelated to each other, planning to make a big robbery guided by a Mobster (that would be my guess) and his son. But when things get messed up during the robbery, the movie really starts.I thought the dialogues were excellent, I loved them! Especially the whole ""like a virgin"" thing and Mr. Pink's ""I don't tip"" thing, it was hilarious. Also the cast was excellent, I loved every single one of them, Harvey Keitel as Mr. White was so good! also Michael Madsen, as Mr. Blond, everybody's favorite ""dog"" was so great, like QT said in the making of Kill Bill 2 ""Michael is like the king of *being cool* in movies"" and he is indeed. Also Tim Roth was good as Mr. Orange, and Steve Buscemi was my favorite as Mr Pink. QT also had a small part on this movie as Mr. Brown, his acting was good too.Anyways the story may seem simple, way to simple, but the screenplay is so very well written and the whole movie is so well directed, that it doesn't matter anymore.

A movie which gave us Tarantino,"In 1992, when I was twelve and had no comprehension about good movies, came Reservoir Dogs, a film, which introduced Quentin Tarantion to the world as a director. Now, if I had seen RD before I had seen Pulp Fiction I would without any doubt claim RD to be Tarantinos best movie. But now, as I have seen Pulp Ficiton before RD I can say ""Well, Reservoir Dogs ain't his best film, but it was extremely good place to start."" Most first directions aren't even 10th as good as Reservoir Dogs.So, Reservoir Dogs is about band or thieves, who are unknown to each other. They are total strangers who are gather up to do a diamond shop heist. They use code names ala Mr. Pink or Mr. Orange. This all, of course, goes terribly wrong. Whole movie is describing the moments before and after the crime, when the dogs are trying to figure out what went wrong and who is to blame.Quentin Tarantinos style is very visible from the first scene to the last, everything is stylish to the last and everything has its own meaning. Nothing happens without a reason, no matter how ridiculous it might be.I don't want to give out any scenes or characters, so I won't dig in any further into the story.

"Amazing, simply stunning!","This is the best movie that I've ever seen!  The dialogue is fast and furious, the action - despite how little action there is - is brilliantly filmed, and the acting is fabulous on all parts.The story, as many of you probably already know, follows four criminals taking refuge in a warehouse after a bloody diamond heist.  In the aftermath, Mr. Pink convinces them that one of them has to be an undercover cop, because the cops got to them way to fast.The four nameless criminals are Mr. White, a hot-tempered veteran (Harvey Keitel). Mr. Orange, a young guy, new into the business, who was shot after the heist and is severely injured (Tim Roth).  Mr. Blonde, a calmly psychotic 'crowd controller' who has recently been released from prison (Michael Madsen) and Mr. Pink,  a cowardly little weasel looking out for his own best interests (Steve Buscemi).The acting is definitely the prime jewel of this movie.  All roles are done perfectly and totally believably, namely by Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi.  Madsen delivers a terrifying performance as Mr. Blonde, especially in the infamous 'ear scene' in which Blonde dances to seventies tunes while hacking a cop's ear off!  Buscemi deserved his Independent Spirit Award as Mr. Pink, seeing all the lines he's memorized and the emotion he's put into his role.Terrific movie, they don't get better than this!  9.5/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
more realistic than Pulp Fiction,"Tarantino's fragmented storyline style, pop culture references,outré and unwonted camera-work,memorable dialogs, violent but realistic psycho acts, non-linear script just sound so good. I chose to watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" after watching ""Pulp Fiction"". Believe me this movie deserves a better place. You don't see just some cocky Hollywood actors that are trying act out some scenes or violent crimes you just feel the characters that are portrayed by them. You don't have to discuss whether something sounds like a miracle, a divine intervention or just a coincidence like in ""Pulp Fiction"". Everything is in there and you just see it and feel it. You don't try to figure out whether a bad character could be subjected to some sort of redemption as in the case of ""Samuel Jackson"" in ""Pulp Fiction"". Tarantino shows that a great film could be made just with 1 million. The only thing I could doubt is that Michael Madsen plays a character named ""Vic Vega""suspiciously close to Travolta's ""Vincent Vega."" Tarantino would later confirm that the two are brothers. But for my part they don't look like brothers at all. I seriously doubt that.Other than that I really liked it more than Pulp Fiction.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A knockout debut from Quentin Tarantino.,"First things first lets drop the argument that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a blatant copy of Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire.""  While Quentin Tarantino outright steals some concepts, ultimately ""Reservoir Dogs"" its own kind of animal. Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a dramatically better film; ""City on Fire"" is a gritty, but ultimately forgettable film that has suppressed potential. ""Reservoir Dogs"" takes the suppressed potential of a story about friendship that develops between two characters on opposite sides of the world--a common theme in Hong Kong cinema--see John Woo's cult classics: ""A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2"",""The Killer"", ""Hard Boiled--and mixes it with Tarantino's now cliche to praise dialogue.The dialogue is what makes the film sublime; the dialogue features a myriad of quotable lines: the diamond speech, the madonna monologue, the rapport between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr. Blonde (Micheal Madsen).  The film feels fresh not because it is gritty, and violent; the film takes a genre which is innately violent, and infuses it with witty dialogue.  It gives it's characters an arc not usually associated with crime films: Cynical character's who talk about day to day pop culture s**t, albeit it is a bit more vulgar--they're gangsters after all.The film doesn't just rely on dialectical laurels; the film also features a non-linear narrative which puts a refreshing spin on the typical beginning, and end archetype.  These flashbacks allow the viewer to piece together the heist; basically giving the viewer a chaotic feeling much like the films characters.  It also allows for some entertaining dialogue: the conversation between Mr. White and Mr. Pink discussing the psychotic Mr. Blonde going trigger-happy at the bank.   Their discussion paints a menacing picture in our heads; so when Mr. Blonde is finally revealed we realize his subtle, malevolent nuances.  Speaking of Mr. Blonde his torture scene is one of the most gruesome, and hilarious scenes--he listens to Steve Miller Band's ""Stuck in the Middle with You""--ever filmed""Reservoir Dogs"" is a film about witty gangsters, who seem to have a bad bout with lady bad luck.  The films mix of kinetic dialogue, ferocious filming style, and perfect choice of 70's pop music creates a film wholly it's own.

It is sad that we are so preoccupied with movies that a script like this has to be wasted on one.Making matters worse is the violence.

A Tad  Bit Overrated But A Great Debut Film.,"Rated R for Strong Violence and Language.I got Reservoir Dogs and Scarface on DVD a couple of weeks ago at HMV.Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarintino's debut film.Tarintino has made many excellent movies such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.Reservoir Dogs is an excellent beginning film.Its a tad bit overrated(#61 in the Top 250 films of all time, come on)but Reservoir Dogs is a fairly good film with great acting and a clever storyline that will leave you thinking.The film is about a couple of people who plan on robbing a bank.They each have color codenames such as Mr.Blonde,Mr.Blue,Mr.Brown,Mr.Pink etc.However the cops came just a bit after they did screwing up their plan.One of the criminals tipped off the cops and they try to think which one it was.The film shows present time and flashbacks.The flashbacks show how each person took the job and the present shows how them trying to figure out who tipped off the cops while in the warehouse.Reservoir Dogs,while not as violent as Kill Bill Vol.1 is a pretty violent and bloody film.With a great 70's soundtrack,some memorable quotes and scenes Reservoir Dogs is a good rental film but it is a tad bit overrated.I don't usually agree with critic Roger Ebert but he said that Tarintino could do much better.I think so too and Tarintino proved it when he made Pulp Fiction the best film in his filmography.Runtime:100min9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Why exactly? The acting of course, the dialogues of course and whether you like it or not, the admiration of brutal violence. What directors like de Palma or Scorsese were hiding is by Tarantino exposed till you puke... just watch how many dialogues are spoken by actors who are bleeding till death. Or the famous scene in where a cop looses an ear (all on the rhythm of Steelers Wheel's ""Stuck in the middle with you""...when an ear is cut the personages usually die after two seconds, by Tarantino they are living for 15 minutes or more while he isn't ashamed to make some close up's from the wounds...

One of the best films ever made,"Reservoir Dogs is one of Quentin Tarantino's best films and is equally as brilliant as Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown not just because of how brilliant the story and all the performances were but also because he made such a good film with what he had to make it with being primarily shot in the warehouse and with a few flashback scenes to introduce the major characters. People have complained 'this is too violent', 'the language is disgusting' etc etc, well yes it is but I would also have to say that if you watch the film you have to look past the violence and the dialog to see what a cleverly made film this really is. As with all of Quentin Tarantino's films they are all cleverly well made but this one is an exception as he didn't have thousands of dollars to make this film with and still it remains one of his best and should stand out as a cinematic achievement for all audiences so I definitely give this a ten out of ten rating and recommend it to everyone to watch this film and see how clever a film-maker Quentin Tarantino really is.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Violence as Poetry,"First things first, I'm not going to call Reservoir Dogs 'Quentin Tarantino's best movie', because I love all of his movies dearly and I will not pick favorites. Nevertheless, as of the last time I saw the three of them (the other ones being, of course, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. I'm not counting Four Rooms, because he only had one segment in it - even if it was the best part of the movie), Reservoir Dogs was the one I enjoyed most.A brief overview: Lawrence Tierney is Joe Cabot, and Chris Penn is his son 'Nice Guy' Eddie. Joe is a crime boss planning a diamond heist, and for the operation he hires six men, all of them acquainted with Cabot but none of which knows each other. To avoid having any details about one another they keep their identities secret and call each other by code names: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (the always wonderful Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blonde (action star Michael Madsen in the part of a lifetime), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino himself, who gets killed at the very beginning of the movie). When the robbery becomes a bloodbath, the thieves escape to the rendezvous and try to figure out what went wrong and who's responsible.The movie is basically a very small scale theatrical production, as the main body of the story takes place in only one location, although there are several flashbacks that play a very important part in the film. The movie caused a lot of buzz at the time of its release partly due to its high level of violence, but today it seems much less shocking and that gives us a chance to better appreciate Tarantino's unique storytelling abilities - especially since having also seen Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown we can now safely assume that its success wasn't a one time thing. Tarantino's dialogue is brilliant beyond competition and his juxtaposition of conversations about life-and-death issues and mindless chatter about the most minor trivialities of life makes his movies a treat to watch (Note the Madonna conversation in the beginning of Reservoir Dogs and the Delfonics chats in Jackie Brown. While I'm on the subject, the use of music here is brilliant, as Quentin juxtaposes a nostalgic 70s radio show with the film's most violent scenes). The poetry and beauty put into the most violent sequences are as enchanting as they are shocking, and Michael Madsen's torture scene, backed with Stealer's Wheel's 1970s hit 'Stuck In The Middle With You', became an instant timeless classic.Tarantino is of course the main guy in this classic, but the actors are all worthy of praise. Harvey Keitel is a great straight man, who seems to be the only honest person in the film, and the always nervous and catatonic Steve Buscemi balances him out. Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are both spectacular, and Lawrence Tierney is brilliant (as another character describes him - ""You remember the Fantastic Four?... The Thing. He looks just like The Thing."") The relationships forming between the six individuals, all of the complete strangers, make Reservoir Dogs a really fascinating watch. Tarantino is a picky director; he makes few movies, but the ones he makes really count. I'm waiting for his next release, 'Kill Bill', eagerly. If you missed out on any of his three masterpieces, don't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Quentin's Inspiration,"As good as this movie is, the original is just as good. The movie in which Tarantino drew his ""inspiration"" is entitled City On Fire with Chow Yun Fat. Reservoir Dogs is essentially identical to City On Fire with one basic exception, City On Fire concentrated on the loyalty and betrayal theme whereas Reservoir is good story telling excluding that element. Which for me, removes the human factor for the film. For most people who are big fans of Reservoir Dogs, they should do themselves a favor and find City On Fire, this movie is just a gritty and as dramatic. Chow Yun Fat is terrific as always and this very well done. I'm sure hardcore fans of Tarantino know about this but for others, they should see where he got his start.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Toby Wong?,"From the hilarious opening to the perplexing blood soaked ending 'Reservoir Dogs' is a masterpeice.  It centers around five men and a robbery they will do anything to pull off.As in all of Tarantino's works, dialogue plays an important role.  Not only do the men discuss how the plan went wrong and who the rat is, but also what the intent of 'Like a Virgin' was and the reason why one doesn't care to tip their waitress.  What's really terrific about Reservoir Dogs is that it shows us things that you would never seen in another crime picture.  Such things as under-confident robbers, the glee the criminals get when torturing a poor defenseless cop, and the over-all sloppiness of the in-and-out job they were supposed to achieve.  Tarantino directs by setting the camera down in front of his actors and letting them just play the scene straight out with not that many cuts.  During acton scenes, the man is willing to and will put the camera anywhere.  The film looks beautiful.The acting is superb.  The legendary cast includes Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, Edward Bunker, Tim Roth, Lawrence Tierney and Tarantino himself.

Tim Roth also gives what I believe is his best as the wounded Mr Orange. Lets not forget the cool, laid back, completely insane, shady Mr. Blonde, played by Michael Madsen. There's also the nervous Mr. Pink, who was well played by Steve Buscemi. Chris Penn is well cast as the loud-mouth, suspicious Nice Guy Eddie.

The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 2 - His debut: Reservoir Dogs,"This film draws ones attentionReservoir Dogs is astonishing in so many ways, it is hard to find a beginning, which in this case are the actors. Every film, no matter how good the story, the directing or the effects rises and falls with the quality of actors and the degree to which they are believable. In this film, it is apparent, that all of the actors deliver great performances. There is really nothing else to be said about the acting, for one cannot go and analyze character depth in this film, for the characters as they are presented, are quite shallow. There is some information on some of the characters, but their characteristics as I might describe them here, would have to be based mostly on their actions and doing that would really screw up your viewing experience.Another really great thing about this film, is it's story, which really is not that special at all when you look at it in retrospective. The story, is basically the typical robbery gone bad, but in this case, the way in which it is told (with a lot flashbacks) increases the excitement and produces not only great tension within the characters, but also within the viewer. Apart from that, the flashbacks also enable Tarantino to give this very thrilling film a lighter and funnier touch. So the flashbacks are really multidimensional here. They increase the tension, they relieve the tension and they provide the film with a lighter touch.All of the aspects above are brilliantly captured by Tarantino's ingenious though simple usage of the camera. In keeping the movements limited and rather simple, he manages to keep the viewer close to the story and the events. By doing that, he succeeds in producing maximum thrill with a minimum of effects.Considering the relatively low budget, the rather simple story and the minimum of effects, I think Reservoir Dogs is a really amazing product and I am not the only one. A lot of people seemed (and still seem) to agree with me on that one. Not only did Tarantino receive a lot of hail for this work, but he also managed to get many more of his idea's realized on film. The climax of Tarantino's career (which is not over yet, mind you) would come in 1994 with Pulp Fiction, which he co-wrote, directed and starred in. After that Tarantino's work (as far as writing and directing is concerned) became of less quality. First he would make a segment for the film Four Rooms and after that he would star in and partially write the still good genre classic From Dusk till Dawn. Following those films, he made Curdled (writing only) and later Jackie Brown, which was his last directorial offering. That film became something of a disappointment, for it did not have the typical Tarantino style and I ask all of you: How could it have if Tarantino had neither written the original story nor starred in it?' One can conclude that, although on average Tarantino's work is of good quality, his films following Pulp Fiction have been of lesser quality than his work before that very same film and one can only hope, Tarantino will manage to shine again with his next project, called Kill Bill. I, for one, am very excited about that film, because the title is catchy, the actors have potential and it is written and directed by the master himself: Quentin Tarantino.

one earful of a film,"Reservoir dogs is in my opinion the best Quentin Tarentino film, simply because of the unique story line and the excellent acting in every scene. To me it looks like when they were filming each scene they put so much effort into them because the acting is that good the best actor in the film Steve Buscemi shows this.What makes it so good though is the fact that the the scenes although set mostly in the warehouse the scenes keep you watching the film there is no dip in the entertainment factor an A star quality film that never gets boring.     9.9999999/10See this if you liked Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown or any other Tarentino film",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Definitive 90's Film,"Back in 1992, a movie written and directed by a video store clerk rocked Hollywood.  There was a new kid in town, namely Quentin Tarantino.  With ""Reservoir Dogs"" he had re-defined the crime thriller with his quirky dialogue and controversial depiction of violence.  The amazing part is, people talk about it as much today as they did then, and why not? It deserves all the credit it receives.The film centres on a heist gone wrong; Six guys are put together on one job -  a diamond heist.  To protect their identities, they are each given a colour-coded alias:  Mr. White (the outstanding Harvey Keitel, who, incidentally, had a big hand in getting the film made); Mr. Orange (the then-relatively unknown Tim Roth); Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen); Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker); Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi, surely one of the most under-rated actors around) and Mr. Brown, played by Mr. Tarantino himself.The film opens with a perfect example of Tarantino's dialogue, as the guys discuss whether or not Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" was a metaphor for big dicks and then debate with Mr. Pink on why waitresses should be given a tip (""I won't tip just because society says I have to"").  From then on, the film is told in flashback, as Mr. Whit and Mr. Pink, along with the wounded Mr. Orange try to figure out why the heist went wrong. Keitel really carries the film and it's his presence that probably ensured the film was made.  Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde is the perfect cold blooded killer and there is also able support from the likes of Lawrence Tierney and Chris Penn.Tarantino went on to make the similarly impressive ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994)(which included some of the ""Reservoir Dogs"" cast) and then later ""Jackie Brown"" (1997), an adaption of an Elmore Leonard novel. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is probably my personal favourite, though, with it's fast-paced storyline and terrific acting.It's been said so many times but it's true: ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the most influential film of the 90's, of that there is no question.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Tim Roth and Michael Madsen are one of my favorites actors, but in this film, Quentin Tarantino can not use their talent and outstanding skills.

A Perfect Crime,"""Reservoir Dogs"", Quentin Tarantino's brilliant first film, left an indelible mark on movies a decade ago and still packs a mighty punch. You know the story. A band of thieves with colorful code names tries to cope with the staggeringly bloody aftermath of their failed diamond heist. Mayhem ensues.The movie is graced with classic dialogue, brutal black humor, and a hilarious soundtrack of sunny '70s pop. The ensemble cast is fantastic, with Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth turning in amazing performances as the film's principal gangsters. Roth and Keitel's characters share a friendship that gives ""Dogs"" much of its emotional heft, and both actors nail it.As if all the above (not to mention beautiful photography and memorable costumes)weren't enough, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is still more than the sum of its parts. Tarantino's love for movies seeps into the heart of this film and gives it a unique, celebratory spirit that is better experienced than explained.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"An Incredible, powerful, bloody, violent film","Quentin Tarantino is just a flat out genius. He is one of the greatest writers/directors ever. His two most popular films, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are the ultimate cult classics of the nineties. This movie got hosed at the Oscars and needed some nominations.The start of the movie at the breakfast table with all of them, might be the single greatest moment in movie making history.

"Tarantino's debut film, is cool and crisp, but ultimately average","RESERVOIR DOGS (1992)Quentin Tarantino, a director I have grown to admire over time has a lot of credit to his name. Pulp Fiction shook the foundations of modern cinema, Jackie Brown had Tarantino being smarter and even more complex and the eastern/western homage 'Kill Bill' saga, was a bloody, thrilling and beautifully served dish of revenge. Plus, he writes all his screenplays including other notable ones (True Romance).Anyway, Reservoir Dogs is a quick action/crime film set during a day in Los Angeles, after a bank robbery (flashbacks elaborate the story). The film begins in a diner, where the gang talk and discuss different matters. It is there, during that scene that you get the first dosage of Tarantinian script-writing; that fast, coarse, punchy, irrelevant lines that won him an Oscar in Pulp Fiction.The film itself gets a bit boring in my opinion. It's blunt, monotonous and quite uninteresting. There's not much to enjoy, as Tarantino jumps back and forth between the gangsters, who overview the situation of the robbery afterwards.I cannot understand why so many people have taken such a liking to this film, when it is quite empty and shallow.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Sheer brilliance...prepare to watch it over and over again,"After Soderburgh's ""sex, lies, and videotape"" announced the arrival of independent cinema with a polite cough, it's younger brother ""Reservoir Dogs"" stumbled in the banquet hall and puked on the floor. But oh, what a glorious heave.There are two things right off that make RD so astounding. The first is that it both honored the genre of the crime drama and simultaneously took every one of its time-honored conventions and gleefully ripped them to pieces. The second is that this multi-faceted character-driven action picture, which is so tight and so seamless (while still managing to be jaw-droppingly original in its execution) could be the work of a (for all intents and purposes) a debut director.People accuse Tarantino of writing scripts full of sensationalized dialog (""it sounds cool but people would never really talk that way""). I don't agree. I think what primarily gives his films their appeal and power is that his characters talk PRECISELY about the things we would talk about...the insane minutiae that would normally bore the average person silly, but in a cool way. It's a lot like a Seinfeld crossed with a film-noir.And this easily relatable language allows us to care about and becomes involved with a variety of characters, not the least of which are a gang of hardened criminals running for cover after a botched jewelry heist.What's even more astounding about the film is that the plot is really just a sidebar to the character dissection at the film's center. We want to know what drives these guys, and after seeing the movie, we do. We may not like what we see, but we never look away whether in boredom or disbelief. These are not cardboard action figures.How Tarantino plays this rich cast of rogues against each other and the constant switches in narrative time-line is strategic and fascinating. Yes, it's been done before, in other films, but rarely to this great of effect.And that may be the most impressive thing about this movie: it does what all truly great indies do best...they economize toward the betterment of the picture. Every frame here adds something...even the blank frames where all you hear is Steven Wright's wonderfully adenoidal mumble as he exhorts you to attend the next Monster Truck Extravaganza. That undoubtedly lowbrow event fits the seamy world the picture revolves in perfectly.This film is just as unmissable, and once you see it, assure yourself it will be only for the first time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Review - Reservoir Dogs,"This first movie of Quentin Tarantino, is already from the opening scene everything you would expect from him, you have powerful and funny dialog, and obviously, a cameo by Tarantino himself.The movie is divided into sections some of them relate the story of the main characters while the main story arc is relating the end.You have all these stories that end up together.However, the flaw in this movie is the story, at my eyes, it seems that attention of details was put to have a very good and long ending, but the since the movie is only 99 minutes long, the sub-arc for each character is ""facilitated screenwriting"" which means that there is no strong link created between each character. In other words, these scenes would have been good if they did bring a new element to the story. However, in this case, they relate a part of the story that was already known by the viewer or that had no influence later on, Which means that at my eyes, these are anecdotal.To conclude, I believe that another useless part of the movie is to the minor characters. Characters like Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue don't have personality, I see them as extras. A good decision by QT was to kill them because he didn't want his story to be separated into too many parts which would have made it lost its coherence. But decided to include them in the movie. The question that I ask myself is ""Why did he decided to include them in the movie if they have no purpose and they gonna die in the first few minutes"".Anyway, that is all that I got the criticize this movie, I wouldn't say that it was bad, but it was average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Well shot. Well acted. Well Done,"I really had wished I saw this film when it was first theatrically released. This film has everything, the right mix of exuberant violence along with witty comic irreverance. Tarantino destroys the mark with his freshman feature. With powerful performances by the Harvey Keitel as well as Tim Roth. An underrated performance by Chris Penn, and Steve Buscemi is over the top as per usual. While watching this movie you are transported to another realm, and in that sense you become one of the rag tag troop. The obvious choice for a memorable moment is clearly the Mr. Blonde torture scene, however in my personal opinion it is the commode story that Roth ""performs"" for Keitel, Tierney and Penn at the club. In short, this film with its criminal pinoche delivers a knock you on your ass punch. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you've already seen it, see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Snuff Film,"Excrement.Quentin Tarantino's ""brilliant"" crime drama is just an excuse to show new and exciting ways to violently violate human bodies. I actually felt sick watching this one long snuff film, with cops, robbers, civilians, and quite possibly water fowl getting shot and butchered and defiled.But hey, it's Tarantino! We're supposed to bow down to the god of guts and gore because it's all so well pieced together and film noir-ey.I watched Reservoir Dogs 23 years ago, and my impression is still one of heartache. I felt as if I had wandered into a battlefield, and I hadn't been drafted, nor had I volunteered. This trash has no-- scratch that--negative redeeming social value, unless, of course, you enjoy watching an LAPD uniformed officer, captured by Michael Madsen, get his ear cut off.Good God, what makes people think Tarantino is anything other than a pornographer? I find almost everything he has ever done disgusting and a supreme waste of my valuable time.I know that makes me a provincial redneck, an illiterate buffoon, a, a conservative, but I like to think that, usually, implied violence is more effective than the lurid, the exposed, the defiled, and the exsanguinated.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quick and straight to the point,"I've seen many of Tarantino's films, so I knew what was to come in this ""Reservoir Dogs"". Many people (I'm not included in this group) don't like his movies because of the violence, slangs and dirty words. In my opinion this is just a real display of what happens in many parts the world nowadays. Of course Tarantino and his intelligence exaggerate in some things, but this is just to mock these tragedies and give his works a taste of irony. There's always something funny in his pictures. In this ""Reservoir Dogs"" we laugh when the criminals discuss their nicknames, a few moments before starting a robbery.Tarantino, in my opinion, belongs to the same group Woody Allen, Pedro Almodovar and a few others do: the geniuses of cinema. Many people don't easily understand what they do (are these directors worried about it?) but I just think these guys have a lot (of good things) to say and show us.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Tarantino Announces His Arrival with (What Else?) a Bang,"Way back in 1992, this seedy, asymmetrical chatterbox of a thriller made an immediate impression, arguing that there's a clear ethical divide between criminals and psychopaths and catapulting the career of first-time director Quentin Tarantino. Although many of the edges are rough and the production budget is thin (a sacrifice Tarantino was happy to make in exchange for creative control), the director's voice is already fully realized and he pulls a number of powerful performances from his shockingly star-studded cast. Primary among these are Harvey Keitel as the guilt-ridden loyal soldier, Michael Madsen as his antithesis, a cold-blooded maniac, Tim Roth as the spark that ignites their fire and Steve Buscemi as the flabbergasted bystander who can't believe it's come to this. They've all got dirty hands, but their perspectives on the stickup business are worlds apart.It's easy to see this as a trial run for many of the ideas Tarantino would refine and revisit, two years later, in the much more potent, polished Pulp Fiction. The two share an affinity for dark humor, rich (if maybe a bit indulgent) dialogue, essentially seedy situations and fallible, humanized assassins, not to mention their mutually jumbled timelines. The thing is, Reservoir Dogs would be fascinating even without an all-timer as a follow-up. It's morally challenging, wickedly entertaining, thoroughly unpredictable and completely unlike anything else that was on the scene in '92. Too often, we toss around the label of ""trailblazer,"" but I can think of no better term for what QT was doing behind the lens in the early '90s. This guy was on the razor's edge.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Extreme violence presents itself from the get go, but it makes the movie, it is done in a fashion that makes you want for more, rather then lean back in your seat.Tarantino has triumphed in what was his first movie, and it deserves better recognition.

Michael Madsen's acting technique, what there is of it, is kind of cheeseball. Harvey Keitel steals the show. Steve Buscemi's turn is energetic.

What now ensues is a recreation of the planning and execution of their raid, their introductions to each other and that all lays the seeds for this over-rated drama of brutal mistrust and duplicity. Tim Roth probably stands out as ""Mr. Orange"" but the rest of the fairly well established cast offer us little by way of sophistication or subtlety as they try to decide which - if any of them - informed the police. It's violent but so what - it's not Scorsese, nor does the story really hold up after it becomes glaringly obvious what is actually going to happen at the end.

Finally, a good crime movie that is about the characters, not the fire power.The movie is complex in a simple way, and outstanding dialogue! What I also found amazing was this was an excellent film, yet there were no women! Before I saw this, if you would have told me a movie could be great without women, I would disagree!

"Flawless cinema, and Mr. Blonde rules.","This is rhe one that put Tarantino on the map, and rightly so. A brilliant ensemble work is flawlessly brought to the screen with a group of terrific actors.The plot consists of a group of men brought together to pull of a jewelry heist. Things go awry when an alarm is pulled and the cops respond quicker than they should. The group then rendevous back at an abandoned warehouse and try to decide whether there is a rat in their midst who is tipping off the cops.The acting, as I have said, is flawless. Harvey Keitel is  perfect as the leader, Mr. White. Tim Roth playes Mr. Orange to perfection, and he spends a good portion of the movie laying on the floor (You'll find out). Steve Buscemi IS Mr. Pink. I know that Tarantino wrote the role for himself, but he made the right decision by putting Buscemi in the role instead. Chris Penn is also great fun as the continually P*ssed off Nice Guy Eddie and he is perfect in the role. And this is the first film I've seen Lawrence Tierney in a film and he couldn't be better cast. No one, Not even Robert DeNiro could play Joe Cabot better than Tierney did. Also of note are Eddie Bunker, who is great with what little screen time he has as Mr. Blue, and Tarantino himself is great and funny as Mr. Brown. Who can forget his ""Like a Virgin Monologue. And I have to point out Kirk Baltz, who makes you feel his pain in the ""Ear torture sequence"". He is great. And Randy Brooks is great and entertaining in his supporting role.But I have to give special notice to The chilling Michael Madsen. For those who have only seen him in ""Free Willy"" or ""Thelma and Louise"" Prepare to be terrified and blown away. Madsen is better than perfect as the showstopper Mr. Blonde. His look, his acting, everything about his performance is flawless and I have to admit, (Though you probably guessed by my I.D.) That Madsen's Mr. Blonde was my favorite character in the piece. He has unforgettable lines ""Are you Gonna Bark all day, Little Doggy, or are you Gonna Bite""? And he has the best and most chilling scene in the movie, the ""Ear Torture Sequence"". Wait untill you see him dance to ""Stuck in the Middle with You."" you will be revolted and want to turn away, but you won't be able to. Alternatingly cool and alternatingly terrifying, Madsen's performance, at least in my opinion, is the best in the film. Because even though he's terrifying, the audience has to admit that he's cool.This is definitely not a film to have the kids watch with you, but any adult who likes crime drama will enjoy it. As to the violence, It is very violent. But it's not half as bad as the recently released ""Gangs of New York"". The first five minutes of that movie are gorier that the whole of ""Reservoir Dogs"". We don't see blood spurting from anyone in this film. In ""Gangs..."", we are treated to blood spurting out of the side of Liam Neeson's character. I won't lie to you and say that people don't get bloody, but it's definitely not as graphic. So if ""Gangs..."" didn't bother you, don't even worry about being revolted by this one.Overall, loved the film, loved the actors, especially Madsen, and I hasve the film on vhs and dvd (the Mr. Blonde special edition). I definitely reccomend this one.*****/***** 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I love it!,"The act of narrating a story is a skill that should not be underestimated. Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut is not only an example of his storytelling ability but also his ability to add flair and style to a story that has been told many times before.The plot of the movie is simple: a heist gone wrong, shown in the preparation stage and the aftermath. However, Tarantino takes a unique approach by playing with the chronology of events, adding entertaining dialogue and an ode to the seventies through the use of the soundtrack.All performances in the movie are excellent, with a focus on Keitel's character but never at the expense of the other characters. Roth's character and performance are particularly impressive, and Tarantino's treatment of the traditional mole character is fantastic.Even after decades, the movie has stood the test of time with its memorable lines and legendary scenes, proving its worth as a classic in the genre.

Well what can I say? If you like the genre and want to remain on the same page as Tarantino's then you gonna get thrills. I can suggest that. But nothing special though. And one thing for sure I didn't expect special something from Tarantino from the beginning.
Actually from the starting of the movie you know how it's gonna end. He's a legendary director though, nothing personal but after all it was his trial round. You'd get one level up but some same kind of thrills in Pulp Fiction though. I think he thought yo this one went really well, why not another one ?

It's a different take on the gangster genre, one that shows the human behaviors of the criminals rather than following the cops. It's filled with humor, drama and great deal of blood, showcasing the early stages of a this masterful writer/director. It's hard to believe this is a debut film, from the expertly crafted dialogue, to the fairly minimal storytelling, one that comes forward in the character revelations, which are abundant. With only a few missteps, mainly some overacting this is a truly great gangster film and one that started the impressive career of Quentin Tarantino.

Perfectly executed and masterfully crafted,"This movie may take some time to grow on you. It may also instantaneously bloom into your top movies. Personally, it took me about a month for the movie to fully sink in. It's screenplay is streamlined; optimal, efficient, yet fully effective. The performances from the likes of Buscemi and Roth are of the highest quality. Don't watch this film expecting to see a heist movie. It unfolds into so much more: a character study, mainly. This is easily one of my top 10 screenplays, and definitely my favorite Tarantino work, over his slightly overrated, in my opinion, 1994 work, Pulp Fiction, which arguably was quite nuanced and well executed, but it lacks the simple nuance and smartness of Reservoir Dogs, which is blunt, pure and clever storytelling. I'd recommend this movie to anybody who loves the craft of telling a story, whether it be writing a novel, a song, or a screenplay. Tarantino knows how to do it, and well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Tarantino Makes His Mark,"Quentin Tarantino's first film of consequence and the film that introduced him to the masses, ""Reservoir Dogs"" bears all the hallmarks of what we have come to expect in Tarantino films.Pop music plays a role, sometimes as background music, sometimes voiced by characters. Violence is a central theme, often gratuitous and gory, like a Peckinpah film. Vulgarity is common, though this can be attributed to accurate character writing. His characters like to tell stories, allowing Tarantino the writer to express his enjoyment of a well-told tale.But what makes this film a significant contribution to cinema canon is its style, particularly the way Tarantino frames scenes. It also includes interesting, quirky characters that engage the viewer and keep him guessing.That said, this film is not for everyone. Particularly those who abhor cinematic violence. The dialogue is also heavily sexist, racist and anti-gay (in accordance with the nature of the central characters).Viwers might ask themselves if Tarantino, as writer and director, is trying to deliver a message or a moral, or if he is merely including all of the film elements that he personally enjoys? Viewing his later films suggests that the latter is true.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino is introduced in style,"reservoir dogs is definitely one of the best films yet.. i have seen the film a dozen times as i have all his movies on special edition DVD, and thats means something.. great cast and tense storyline as we await to uncover the truth to see who has blown their cover and of all people its the magnificent Tim Roth. if you haven't seen this movie then my suggestion is that you do, as a widely massive Tarantino fan myself i wouldn't mind to meet Tarantino in person to talk about his magnificent movies and one day i would love to be the next Quentin Tarantino. reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, Jackie brown and the two kill bill's are absolutely magnificent and the best films of the 20th and 21st century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A good first film,"The thing that makes this movie work at all is its structure. I can imagine this same movie arranged chronologically and it would be a slog. It doesn't help that it was obviously written with this structure in mind, but even taking that into account, the second half would be just too much.It really starts with the opening scene. In a ""normal"" movie, this scene would be much shorter and much more perfunctory. It's the scene right before a heist begins, the final moments before the gang gets into the car and heads to the robbery. Here, we don't really know what they're gathered for. Instead, it's just eight guys sitting around a table talking. We start with something so off the wall (a discussion of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"") that it really feels like a bunch of guys just talking over breakfast. The scene overall does two things, though, it introduces us to the characters (with a focus on a handful instead of everyone) and it is filled with foreshadowing.The most famous example is Mr. Orange immediately calling out Mr. Pink for not contributing to the tip (meaning Mr. Orange is the undercover cop), but the more interesting bit is Mr. Pink's insistence on not tipping. It's a wonderful moment of character and foreshadowing at once. On first viewing, it seems extraneous and paints Mr. Pink in a terrible light. However, what it does is shows that Mr. Pink is willing to question everything about a situation. Why do we tip waitresses but not workers at McDonald's? he asks. Whatever the actual answer is to that specific question, it shows that he's willing to step back and question things, so when the survivors of the botched robbery gather at the abandoned warehouse, he's the one asking the right questions. It's a wonderful set up for Mr. Pink.Anyway, the structure does more than that one scene, obviously. The majority of the film takes place in one location, the abandoned warehouse. If the movie were to take place chronologically, the last 60% or so of the film would be in one place, only going outside for brief moments here and there. It would monotonize the visual look of the film as well as the tone. It's high strung yelling, pleading, and threatening from the moment Mr. White bursts into the place with Mr. Orange bleeding out over his arm. Roughly 55 minutes of that would become almost intolerable, but because that is told in order (limiting confusion about the events in the warehouse) and we cut from there to moments in the past for three characters (Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Orange) that are significantly lighter in tone.Those flashbacks (and one flashback within the flashback for Mr. Orange) provide more than just a lighter tone, though, they further provide character information that helps flesh out most of the gang. Mr. White gives bits of his backstory and we understand his relationship to Joe and Eddie, the two running the operation. We see how Mr. Blonde kept his mouth shut in prison and how Joe and Eddie are grateful for it. We also see how Mr. Orange learned his part and ingratiated himself with the crew enough to become part of the job.The only real problems I have are the fact that Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown are largely afterthoughts and the lack of emotional connection with the rest of the characters. Mr. Blue seems to be a red herring for who could the rat be (since we don't find out Mr. Orange is the rat until more than halfway through the film), but he barely makes an impression when he's on screen and he's barely talked about when he's off screen. Mr. Brown seems to be little more than cannon fodder (and an excuse for Quentin Tarantino to say ""dicks"" a whole lot on screen). The rest of the characters, though, while they do get time to differentiate and grow themselves, don't create strong attachments with the audience (at least this audience), so when they all die in the end, it doesn't hit that hard.Shot selection is carefully arranged with intelligent use of a combination of wide, medium, and close shots at the appropriate times. Entire scenes play out in wide shots except for the heightened emotional moments that go in close. Performances are good, though because so much of the film happens at the same tenor, it's hard to tell how good they are. Still, it's a striking debut from an obviously talented filmmaker.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Dogs is a Bloody Good Movie,"Quinton Terantino's Reservoir Dogs is one of the most blood soaked, shockingly violent, and wildly entertaining movies I've ever seen. I honestly don't know if I've ever seen anything like it, and I'm certain nothing like this had been made before. It's brutal yet witty, with the tapings of a cheap exploitation film but the heart of a classic noir.What Terantino has done is to take the basic formula for a heist movie, crank up the violence by a factor of ten, and turn it on its head. Rather than taking us through the careful planning, the daring heist, and the inevitable final act in which everything unravels, Reservoir Dogs jumps straight ahead to the bloody aftermath. One guy's dead, another's missing, and another is bleeding out from a stomach wound. The only thing the robbers can be sure of is that someone set them up. Now they've gotta find out who- if they don't kill each other first.The amazing thing about this movie is that even though there are bullets aplenty and blood everywhere, it's not the action, but rather the characters and dialogue that drive it. Nearly half the movie takes place in an abandoned warehouse, where the main characters try to figure out what the hell went wrong and what they're gonna do about it. Much of this movie's success is due to the superb cast, Including Harvey Keitel as the veteran, professional Mr. White, Tim Roth as newcomer Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as the utterly psychotic Mr. Blond, and the priceless Steve Bulsami as the sniveling, slightly neurotic Mr. Pink.Another of the film's strengths is its dialogue; key when most scenes involve the characters standing around talking to- or screaming at- each other. Terentino has managed to give every conversation a comic edge, but without tipping over into the realm of farce. Highly instructive is the opening scene at the diner, where the wise guys discuss the meaning of Madonna's songs and the importance of tipping. None of this has anything to do with the plot, but it sets the tone and reveals much about the characters and their personalities, especially Mr. Pink.Or take the scene later on in which Mr. Blond sings and dances along to Joe Tex's I Gotcha- while dousing a tied up cop with gasoline! We've been hearing from the others that this guy is absolutely psycho; it would appear that they've seriously understated the case. It would also seem that Terantino must also be nuts to come up with material this demented.In scene after scene he manages to crank up the tension, paranoia, and bloodshed to a level that approaches self-parody. It's shocking, it's over the top, and it makes you want to laugh, then leaves you wondering if you're all there. It's almost, but not quite in the realm of satire. It's funny, gory, shocking, and absolutely unbelievable. In short, it's everything you'd expect from Quinton Terentino.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Hidden Agenda,"Talk about violence. This film has plenty of it. Most of the killing in Reservoir Dogs can be easily avoided but isn't. The male ego takes over here as all of the characters have their own hidden agenda. For example: Mr. White: Save Mr. Orange. Mr. Blonde: Kill as many people as possible. Mr. Orange: Not bleed to death. The only one of the thieves who doesn't really have an agenda except survive is Mr. Pink, the only character who is professional. As history has taught us, people are willing to die for things that they believe in. The things they believe in may be void or completely irrelevant to the mission at hand. The film is more of a satire than anything, of this nature because everything that happens in terms of tragedy was avoidable as easy as looking in the other direction and dropping these agendas for something more important. Quentin Tarantino makes movies that are a landmark to modern day cinema. With all this death, it appears the main reason he made it was to kill people. The way the characters talk is as if they were actual people in a conversation. I laugh at many of the jokes they tell. I like the suits they wear as well as the story-line because it never really shows the robbery, and as we learn throughout the movie, the chaos in the store may have in fact been more intense than originally thought. I can't wait to buy the action figures, especially the Marvin Nash torture play-set with the removable ear. That brings me to the movies most controversial scene: Stuck In The Middle With You. The most chilling person in this movie is Mr. Blonde played masterfully as Michael Madsen. The scene with him and the cop is disturbing and at the same time politically incorrect (You don't torture people for fun). An obvious versatile actor, Michael Madsen went from this movie to Free Willy. Wow, his career really soared. One minute he's mass murdering a jewelry store. The next he's freeing willy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the greatest directorial debuts.,"I can understand why folk do not like Tarantino as a director. He seems to take a lot of great ideas from fantastic, exploitation films and turn them in some type of video geek fantasy. When 'Reservoir Dogs' blasted onto the scene, he was totally fresh, sharp and with such an original, dynamic script. With a fine collection of actors such as Harvey Keitel and the brilliant Buscemi, this remains one of the most important films of the 90's. Everything Q.T he has done since, has been so hit and miss but 'Dogs' was bang on the money. how can anyone ever forget Mr Blond (and Mr Pink).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cool asf movie,The characters are all great I like there personalities and I like what's going on the plot and how they approach it. I think this did the time bounce around better than pulp fiction did. I do liked the whole locked room concept where it's mainly in the warehouse. I also like the figure out who the rat is aspect and then we get the story behind him. The ending was pretty good too I think it's wrapped up neatly. So all around this is a very good movie but i don't know it didn't have some big thing that made me love it. Like good movie and I can acknowledge that but I can't see it being one of my top movies. Still definitely recommend Im sure im in the minority when I say that.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Dialog, dialog, dialog","The absolute most fantastic thing about ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the brilliant dialog. The movie is one big memorable quote and it alone makes the movie more then worth to watch.Another wonderful thing about the movie are the characters. Rarely has there ever been so many great, cool and memorable characters in one movie. Maybe it's because of the amazing cast, everyone is perfect in their role I'm not going to especially mention a few because I feel I then won't do enough credit to the others and credit they deserve!The story is told in an unique way by using flashbacks from how they all got the assignment for the mission and flashbacks from after the robbery, not shown in the right order. And it works wonderful! It's a shear pleasure to watch from beginning till end.The hand held camera work gives the movie an extra cool feeling, it might look a bit unprofessional but it's nothing more then a brilliant addition to an already brilliant movie. The nice and cool ""Super sounds of the 70's"" soundtrack also adds to this, especially the now world famous thanks to the movie ""Little Green Bag"" from the George Baker Selection.The movie is full with memorable moments such as the fantastic opening, the cop torture sequence and the Mexican stand-off at the end.

eh,"I can't rid myself of this feeling that the only thing supporting this movie is a cheap-thrill ending. It turns out so-and-so was the cop all along and it's quite ironic. It was a nice little idea, cute even; but it's not enough to found an entire movie. In instances such as these, dialogue must be employed to fill the void. There were a few nice quote, such as, ""If you ever dream about killing me you better apologize in the morning,"" but not enough. Moreso, with a lack of plot and dialogue - I mean good plot and good dialogue ofcourse - unique characters are a last option to save a movie. Maybe it's because of the already saturated american mafia movie genre, but I was never really connected with any of the characters. (Although Buschemi was good, but he is always good) Without any viable options, I'm afraid the Terrentino option was employed: If you don't have a movie with a doable plot, play the movie in backwards segments and hope nobody notices.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Major disappointment, completely overrated and a film with a trailer better than the actual film. 2/10","Reservoir Dogs was a complete disappointment. Despite the hyped reviews and high rating on IMDb it was nothing special.

Although to be fair the acting was very good, it did not redeem the overall poor script and plot which has its audience checking their watches within the first 30mins. The violence factor was nothing that shocking either, nothing much more you would find in a Bond film.Personally I do not understand how this film gets good reviews.

The opening credits of them walking is awesome. The film is told in flashbacks and the heist is brilliantly never seen. We see Mr. Orange,fatally show and Mr. White at the hideout trying to figure out what went wrong. The story involves a group of criminals all brought together in annonymity to pull a job. There is an inside rat and everyone tries to figure it out as the bodies, tension, and acting charisma stacks up. Keitel, Roth, Buscemi, Madsen,..hell, the whole cast gives the performaces of their careers. Mr. Pink is the best character because he clings to his annonymity. They argue over who screwed each other over and who the rat is. This is one of the greatest modern movies as is Pulp Fiction. Great dialouge and every scene and line is classic.

8. Some of the songs are good and well-placed but nothing specifically stands out..
9. The dialogues are pretty ordinary plus recurring vulgar slurs kind of puts one off to say the least

Tarantino's Inception Of Storylines & Title Cards,"Tarantino's debut film as a director is a virtuous crime / mystery drama. Now considered by many as a cult classic, little did fans know this was the beginning of a stellar and unparalleled career. This is the first time that we catch a glimpse of Tarantino's penchant for intertwining storylines and the usage of title cards. It proves to be a foreshadowing of the dazzling brilliance to follow. This film has outstanding direction, cinematography, screenplay, soundtrack and acting. All of the actors involved which include the likes of Keitel, Buscemi and Penn deliver realistic and superb performances. In particular two stand out. Madsen with his portrayal of a homicidal maniac and Roth with his portrayal of a duplicit character. The plot revolves around six criminals known only as Mr. Brown, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blue and Mr. White. They are hired by mob boss Joe Cabot and his son "" Nice Guy"" Eddie over a riotous and crisp diner scene. The six thieves are hired to pull off a bank heist, however before that they never worked together. They are amushed by police and a shooting ensues. At their rendezvous point the remaining survivors realize they were set up. Now they must flush out the rat in the group. The ending has one of the most brutal, bombastic and cathartic showdowns on film. The plot is clever, funny, bloody, inventive, dark, gritty, intense, violent and has a phenomenal duplicitous ending. There are so many memorable scenes. This viewer is still haunted by Madsen's scene where he psychologically and physically assaults a police officer being held captive.To this day you'll hear fans of this classic quote famous lines such as, ""Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?"".

Highs and lows,"A diamond heist goes wrong after the police respond too quickly. Can the surviving heisters figure out who sold them out, if anyone?

The climax is reached when Buscemi's character refuses to tip the waitress because he doesn't believe in compulsory tipping. It's a masterfully-written, iconic scene.My problem with the movie is that most of the rest of the first half is much less interesting, with the heisters spin their wheels trying to figure out what happened and what they're going to do. And the torture scene is pretty uncomfortable.The movie picks back up in the second half as the past is revealed, but it's not enough to rescue the movie for me, even if there are some great moments.I short: I can see Tarantino's brilliance in it, but his craft was still growing at this point.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.""","Only the likes of Quentin Tarantino could make a gangster movie as unconventional and as fresh as ""Reservoir Dogs."" With it's chunky dialogue, unsettling violence, non-linear storyline and excellent performances from it's talented cast, it's everything you would expect from the director and something that more movies should aspire to be.During a daylight jewelry heist, six well-seasoned criminals find themselves at odds when things go terribly wrong. The alarm is tripped, the cops show up and a lot of blood is shed. Despite the fact that they don't know each other's names -- they are instead given color-coded aliases to go by -- they have formed a kinship with one another that is broken within two crucial minutes. Retreating to a nearby warehouse, they tend to one of their own who has been wounded in action while simultaneously trying to figure out which of them is the rat. When talking doesn't settle things, they resort to gun-play, while the true story unfolds behind them. What results is a tightly wound, slow-burning little crime-drama known as ""Reservoir Dogs.""Setting a precedent for crime-dramas, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is notable not only for it's unconventional story-telling, but also for the fact that the ""job"" is never shown on-screen. Instead, the movie focuses on its characters, played by the likes of Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and Tarantino himself. Keitel and Buscemi, in particular, are truly natural in their roles and keep the movie feeling genuine and engaging. Madsen plays the unpredictable role of Mr. Blonde almost too realistically, constructing a character that nearly steals the show, and who certainly has one of the most memorable moments of the film. Tim Roth doesn't have much to do here besides gush blood, but in his back-story, shows both strength and vulnerability. Tarantino -- despite being somewhat of an amateur at the time -- finds his vision early on in the film, establishing a style that pays tribute to his influences, while simultaneously breaking new ground only to influence a wave of film-makers in his wake. Made for just under a million, Tarantino stretches an inch into a mile into this amazing little film. It's simple, yet effective. It's loaded with fresh dialogue and a cast that works so well together that you feel like you're in that warehouse with them. Even when you know how the story goes, and it you find yourself watching it over and over again, it never fails to entertain and stimulate the senses, making ""Reservoir Dogs"" a certifiable classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Written And Performed Brilliantly,"Michael Madsen(free willy), Tim Roth(pulp fiction), Harvey Keitel(co producer), Chris Penn(at close range), Steve Buscemi(things to do in denver when you're dead) Lawrence Bender(co producer) and Quentin Tarantino(producer, director, writer) star in this violent epic which sets a standard in modern filming.The story is fairly basic. A class of thieves plan to rob a bank. When they attempt, the police are aware, which leaves them with the conclusion that someone tipped the police off.Buscemi gives a career best(which is hard to do considering his near flawless career) as Mr Pink. Roth, Madsen and Penn also do well and deserve recognition for their performances.Some of the scenes are magic. The torture of a cop where Madsen gives a terrific sequence, the end scene where they all get suspicious of one another and the opening scene where we are introduced through a midway conversation about famous entertainers.Tarantino, in my eyes, is the best director in Hollywood.

Everyone is trying to find out ""Who done it"" and the only person they are sure about are themselves. Is it the psychopathic murderer, Mr. Blonde? Is it the looking out for himself only, Mr. Pink? Or is it the mysterious Mr. Blue who only has one line and disappears for the rest of the film. The answer will really surprise you. Oh and after viewing this you won't want to tip your waitresses either after listening to a fantastic speech on how you don't get tips elsewhere. Your thoughts on Madonna will change as will your feelings whenever hearing the song ""Stuck in the Middle With You"". Happy viewings!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A film of genuine quality...,"Reservoir dogs epitomises the stark violence that Tarantino was known for. His first outing as a director is the best other than the miraculous Pulp Fiction, but face it that is one of the best films EVER made. For the most part the film is set in an abandoned warehouse, where a motley crew of criminals dwell over the aftermath of a jewellery store heist gone wrong... With fantastic performances from the ensemble cast of Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, Tarantino himself, the late Lawrence Tierney and of course Michael Madsen in a career defining role form the colour coded gang who are furious at each other as they discover there is a rat in their midst who has set them all up. But who? Of course we know, and it is quite ironic to see Mr White defending him oblivious to who he is. This creates a great elevated level of tension as you watch him biting everyones head off who suggests that he Mr Orange is the rat. Brilliant. The story is told in typical jigsaw fashion, and it lets you know how the crew came together. The ending is a very tense affair as the cops close in and the so-called professionals turn on each other. The dialogue is fantastic, great examples include. "" Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie. Or are you gonna bite?"" and "" was that as good for you as it was for me?"" These are pretty memorable, especially the latter which is said after one of the most notorious movie scenes ever, which is when Mr Blonde cuts off his poor hostage, Marvin Dash's ear... gory. But still one of the best ever scenes in film history. Sure these are great and memorable, but the film undoubtedly owes a lot to older films, in particular I think it owes a lot to The Asphalt Jungle. But I think Tarantino has created a masterful piece of film, with slick direction, brilliant dialogue and an exceptionally told story, I think this film will definitely go down in history. As it says... every dog has its day, this will have many.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Disturbing, Thrilling, Fascinating, and--most of all--pure Tarantino.","Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's original masterpiece, his first movie to show what was to come in his future films and is as good as any other movie of his. It tells the story of a criminal, Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierny--Dillinger) and his son, Eddy (Chris Penn--Starsky and Hutch) who hire six guys to rob a bank who are known to each other only by their given names for this robbery--Mr. White (Harvey Keitel--Pulp Fiction), the hot-tempered guy: a talkative, constantly swearing New York man, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen--Kill Bill), the sadistic guy: a gun firing, ear-hacking, cop-torturing maniac, Mr. Orange (Tim Roth--Four Rooms), the quiet guy, the silent one who occasionally puts in a few words, Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi--Desperado), the smart guy, the fast talking one who's the best at keeping out of fights, Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino--From Dusk Till Dawn), the joker, the funny one who dislikes Madonna, and Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker--The Longest Yard) the old one--the rarely seen one who always tips waitresses. They team up to rob a place of some diamonds, only to be caught by the police immediately. The survivors reunite back at a warehouse and conclude that one of them must have told the police about the robbery, but there is no way to tell who. Soon, they are all fighting against each other--either blaming one another of being the rat or sticking up for a friend.Reservoir Dogs is a very brutal film. There is graphic violence in it and nonstop profanity. But it's no less than realistic. It contains as much violence and as much swearing as is believable for a bunch of criminals. Though the script is unpleasant to listen to, you'll forget about it all by the middle, where the film takes it's real twists and gives real thrilling content. This movie is definitely an R-Rated movie. Bloody and profane, it makes no attempt whatsoever to get a PG-13 rating. But it is incredible. Anyone who has seen it will say so. Indeed, it displays Quentin Tarantino's full abilities in movie making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A good work of cinema,"I must admit that had I not been totally prepared for Quentin Tarantino's general formula for cinema, I may not have liked this movie so much. Having seen Kill Bill first, my expectations for his other movies was somewhat different and Pulp Fiction really did'nt work that well on me. With an open mind, this movie was found to be quite good, with some of the early dialog being boring and the few locations being too repetitive. However, as the movie progresses, it does slowly get better and better. The ""ear"" scene has been shot so well that it is disturbing. At this point in time, the psychology of the gangsters being analyzed wouldn't seem so original but it must have been for its time. As a low budget movie, it has been quite an achievement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Must watch,"If you aren't a Tarantino fan or don't watch his movies than this is a great movie to watch because it shows how great Tarantino can direct a movie.

I'm a huge Tarantino fan but overall this might be my favorite movie of his. Even though clearly the main characters aren't great people, you can't help but route for them.

"""Reservoir Dogs"" is the birth of a new CINEMA","An incredible piece of work for it's time. A true inspiration for new filmmakers and even veterans of the art. I am still amazed at the myriad of details behind the making of the film. Originally slated to be a $35,000 movie (profits earned from Tarrantino's sold screenplays-""Natural Born Killers"" & ""True Romance""), it was given a shot in the arm by Harvey Keitel, who somehow managed to get a peek at it. he liked the script so much, that he helped raise the $400,000 budget (while taking a huge cut in pay himself). This is a movie with such ENERGY. A film that screams out for repeated viewings. Try it sometime. Watch it over the course of a month, 3 times, and you will see something new every time. There is a layer of details under almost every sentence. *(SPOILER AHEAD!!!)* For instance, at the opening scene, when they're sitting around the table talking. Each individual's character is revealed totally by what they say. Keitel's character conflict's with ""Joe"" (by taking away his book and stubbornly NOT returning it), this is a clue to the end confrontation. Michael Madsen's character seems slightly trigger happy (""should I shoot this guy over here?""). And Steve Buscemi's ""Mr. Pink"", is the only one who strives to stick to his personal creed of professionalism (""I don't tip-I don't believe in it""). Also watch for the ""rat"" amongst the group. He's the guy who tells Joe who wouldn't leave the tip. It only ten minutes into the movie and all of the characters are completely defined and played out like a card hand. But you don't notice this. And even if you do, you don't care, because you're so enthralled with these crazy, colorful guys! Then there's the FINAL shootout, do you really know who shot chris penn's character? DID Mr. Pink get away? What does the orange balloon mean? *(SPOILER FINISHED)* There are a ton of ""hidden"" details and stories behind the characters and motivations that make this movie so rich with life, but this is not the place for them all. If you are interested in more, I urge you to find the literally dozens of well put-together fan sites out there filled with much more than i could ever write here. Also, i have to say, I love the new take on the contemporary mafia.I could talk for hours about this film, but if you haven't seen this one-I encourage you to go get it,see it, and if you're a fan of Quinten Tarrantino even in the slightest, you won't regret it.

Don't Trust Nobody,"Typical Tarantino flick - loud, vulgar, lots of posturing over substance and quite compellingly viewable. Talky (and shouty), the film goes back and forth between time frames to depict a heist gone bad. A good cast and good acting override the B-grade tackiness and overall shallowness of the film, rendering this offbeat curiosity of blood and designer suits worth the view. Good for a particular place and time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I didn't rate it first time around How does it fair 20 years on?...,"Lauded by many, despised by a few, it's been a long time since I saw 'Reservoir Dogs' and I have to come clean I didn't really rate it first time around. So I thought it was time I gave it another shot since it aired on TV (again) recently. How did it fair this time around? Well I'll tell you after this brief summary.A jewellery heist has gone wrong and the perpetrators make their way back to a pre-arranged rendezvous, a warehouse. The cops knew about the robbery and they have a traitor in their midst. To keep themselves anonymous, Joe, the organiser of the heist had given them all names of colours. Mr Brown and Mr Blue were both killed during the heist and Mr Orange is injured. He and Mr White are the first to arrive, soon followed by Mr Pink. Later Mr Blonde turns up with a surprise in the trunk of his car a cop. They start beating up on the cop trying to find out if he knows who betrayed them, but he knows nothing. Nice Guy Eddie, Joe's son, turns up next and tells them to move the cars; leaving the psychotic Mr Blonde with the injured Mr Orange and the cop. At this point I'll leave it or the Spoiler Police (Tarantino Division) will have me making films with scenes stolen from just about every film I've ever seen (again).I must admit I do like the rough style with which this film is made, there seems to be a lot of ad-libbing from the actors and, for the most part, it works pretty well. There are flashbacks telling us how some of the major players got involved in the job and these (to me) are more interesting than some of the stuff going on in the warehouse. As far as performances go, well Harvey Keitel as Mr. White - Larry Dimmick, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange - Freddy Newandyke, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde - Vic Vega and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink all did an excellent job. Honourable mentions also go to; Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot and Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot.As with many of Tarantino's works there is an awful lot of dialogue (just see my 'Favourite Quotes' section below for a taster). This, I find can be both confusing and distracting if not properly choreographed with what the audience is watching. Two talking heads in a room can get pretty uninteresting after a while and this is what you get in some scenes. There is no incidental music, the only music we here is from the radio that always plays hits from the '70's. For me second time around?... Well I can see some good things in there, but not enough for me to rave about it. I will deem it 'Recommended' but only for these good points (about three quarters of the way through the back-story of Mr. Orange definitely NOT the torture scene).My score: 7.8/10.IMDb Score: 8.4/10 (based on 277,019 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 96/100 (based on 48 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

A good movie...,"Oddly enough, I have actually only watched the 1992 movie ""Reservoir Dogs"" once before. But since I had the chance to sit down and watch it again here in 2024, I opted to do so, as I have actually forgotten about the storyline in the movie.Writer and director Quentin Tarantino did put together an interesting storyline that proves to actually remain interesting throughout the course of the 99 minutes that it runs for, while it tells the individual stories of Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blue, Mr. Brown, Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot, as well as tells the story of their joined venture. However, I will say that it is somewhat of an acquired viewing taste, as the movie can be a bit confusing, I suppose.While not everything that Tarantino directs or writes proves to be gold, I will say that ""Reservoir Dogs"" definitely is one of his more interesting movies.Sure, the storyline in ""Reservoir Dogs"" is good, but the movie wouldn't be as effective if it didn't have such an interesting character gallery. Writer Quentin Tarantino really managed to put together some memorable and interesting characters to populate the movie.Something that impress me about ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the cast ensemble, which include some great talents. When you sit down to watch this 1992 movie, you're in the company of the likes of Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steven Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, Edward Bunker and Quentin Tarantino himself.""Reservoir Dogs"" definitely is a good movie, but a bit overrated, I think. But it definitely is well-worth taking 99 minutes to sit down and watch.

Fascinating from the word go,"It's hard to get your head around the fact that 'Reservoir Dogs' has been around for ten years. It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another ""dog"" movie from the same era that I saw, 'Man Bites Dog', that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'. Okay, I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - 'In The Soup'), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - 'Thelma & Louise'), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - 'At Close Range'), there is a lot of depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal ""Tarantinoesque"" movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'. His imitators just simply don't have a clue!Simply brilliant cinema, and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Overrated,"Now don't get me wrong, the film is alright, but its nowhere near as good as the cult following this film has makes it out to be. On the plus side, the cast is definetly great. All the principles are completely immersed in their roles, and give magnificent performances. However the directing does feel a bit amateurish at times, and the script is out and out weak. The story revolves around a botched diamond heist where the thieves involved suspect one of their own is a rat. I don't know if it was because of a small budget or just a weak script but the story doesnt come off as good as it sounds.For starters the film uses a very disjointed means of telling the story. However there's no real flow to it. Most of the movie is set in a warehouse after the robbery, with the charachters trying to figure out the snitch. You'd think the movie would build up to this fact, but it gets revealed midway through. Fair enough. In fact the part of the movie that goes into the snitch's story is probably the best part. So you'd think there'd be some really big conclusion instead, right? Not really. This film has got to have one of the weakest most abrubpt endings I've ever seen. Hell they never even actually show the robbery, which sounds interesting and is something i would have like to have seen as a viewer, but instead its only referred to. So, if you're really big on violent crime films, fine. Go ahead and give it a go, but be warned, its nothing compared to the work of, say, Guy Ritchie. And if you're just seeing this movie to find out what all the buzz is about, you're going to be really dissappointed. Go rent something like Jackie Brown or Snatch instead.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Like many Tarantino classics, it doesn't have much meaning, except that it's a story told with an artist's touch. A rewatch is in my near future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The ending was actually really unpredictability as well but I can't figure out how nice guy Eddie got shot.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A great debut, but not a classic.","I watched Reservoir Dogs only recently, while having matches everything else except Jackie Brown. It is a great film, not one of Tarantino's best, or the best of all time, but still worth spending time on it.The acting is top notch. Harvey Keitel was the best among the five, with a compassionate layer underneath the professional criminal experience that he obviously has. Steve Buscemi was also fabulous. Camerawork was very solid, and I love how most of the movie centers on there being a long-drawn Mexican standoff of sorts. The cross-blaming, self-doubting progresses the plot forwards very well, and the pacing is done really well. The movie has a perfect length.However, this film does have flaws. The dialogue, while in much of the movie very stylish, sometimes feels hammy. QT could have done away with many lines, because a lot of it was telling us the same thing again and again. Of course, that has its own context, but it feels too much. The dialogue style is a precursor to how Pulp Fiction would be structured (a movie that, like most people, i consider one of the best ever made). But, even when the gangsters are talking about Pam Grier, it feels much inferior to the whole legendary Quarter-Pounder conversation in the first scene in Pulp Fiction, and underwhelming in general. The flashbacks were not all effective either, especially the one for Mr Blonde.Granted, it was QT's debut, so it would be a little immature and excessive. It also serves as a great story about trust and compassion, because you're hooked to the end. When the end comes, you will be in disbelief, as to ""Why did he say that?"" But, it will make sense eventually. It warrants a watch for sure, if you want to know how it all started, especially since it was an indie film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Gladly Accepted as Granduer Cinema,"Reservoir Dogs was originally deemed a ""Semi-dramatic comedy, with killing, blood and bullets"" the Daily BlogPress Express concurred, but with the suits and sunglasses exhibited it with the release of Pulp Fiction 3 years later, and the same Director being Tarentino, it was automatically called a ""prequel"" to PFiction. And besides, WTF was in the suitcase in PF? Marcellas Wallace's soul? Bullshit!!! The part of Mr. White was to be played by Tom Sizemore, instead, the part of Mr. White was played by Michael Madsen, who in many realms of popular design is close to the same character as Sizemore would played if given the opportunity.

"If you were put off by the legendary violence, don't be - there isn't much at all","As someone who has only seen Pulp Fiction and loved it - I was put off Reservoir Dogs/Kill Bill by the supposed tales of extreme violence.What violence? It's almost all off camera and left to the imagination - its not even much of the plot. Compared to Django Unchained - it's barely worth mentioning.I wish I'd watched it years ago - its a very solid *story* about the fall-out from a heist that went horribly wrong, not the usual action movie about the robbery itself.The cast are super - and golly do they look young - whilst the tension between the characters as they argue amongst themselves about professionalism is visceral.I found RDogs a bit short on the humour front as its almost played entirely straight and I didn't feel I got to know the characters well enough before the film was over.It isn't often that I'd like a film that's already 2hrs to be longer, but this was one that could've easily been 2.5hrs without me noticing.

For the first 30 minutes, I was just hoping the trademark Tarentino ""dialogue"" would end!!! I know Tarentino is very good at dialogue, but sometimes he overdoes it (also in ""Grindhouse: Death Proof"") and he definitely does so in this movie. The plot is intricate, the acting is well done, but the plot is at a full stop due to the endless drone of talk talk talk that I really don't care about.

Meh,This is an unpopular review for what seems to be a wildly popular film. Quentin Tarantino is a seasoned Director with an eye for finding ways to capture and audience's attention. In doing so I feel like he gives himself a free license to make films that are all about gratuitous violence and no real storytelling. This film is one such example where the whole idea is basically to put in a bunch of A-list celebrities together who end up killing and torturing people...with some comical soundtrack in the background. I didn't really feel like any original story was told. Nor was there any innovation despite its time. 5/10.,5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Brilliant, but let down by Tim Roth...","A fine movie, although a little immature.  Foul-mouthed guys in sharp suits with guns - this is a 'guy' movie.  In fact, there are no female speaking parts in this movie.  And all that macho swearing and posturing.  I think the characters in the film (and the director) protest a little too much, if you know what I mean.There's one almost unwatchable scene too - I won't spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it and it's not quite as bad as you think it's going be. No wonder so many women walked out of almost every cinema showing (except my wife, but I think that was because I had the car keys!).However I think Tim Roth was a poor choice for Mr Orange.  In fact, I don't think I've ever seen a good performance out of him.  He always comes across as really irritating in all his films.  I think his particular style of (over)acting is much better suited to the stage.  That's the kindest way I can put it.Everyone else gives really natural performances which is the film's strongest feature.  You really feel like this could be a fly-on-the-wall documentary in parts.I also disagree with the British censors' views that this sort of film glamorizes violence.  If there is one film that shows the inevitable consequences of giving guns to men who are unsure of their sexual identity, then this is it.Well worth watching, but watch that subtext!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!,"My uncle told me about this movie before I knew who Quentin Tarantino was. I watched it, and it is a totally different movie from other titles. I've never seen violence, swearing, and adult stuff dealt with in this sort of matter. (I'm 16, so I understand it exists.) After that, I'm now in a position where I think that violence and profanity are VERY essential elements. This movie changed the way I write my own movies. My characters talk like these guys do. And I show violence in the same manner. My movie is an action film entitled ""Hard Job."" Look out for it in the future. All the actors are great! My favorites are Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen. The torture scene, that was so outrageous. I now have a new view towards bad guys. I think all bad guys should be like Mr. Blonde. I liked every part of this movie. (Not when innocent people were killed. I thought those scenes were strong, but that's what happened in the story.) This is one of my personal favorites. I think everybody who can take swearing and violence, and doesn't critisize movies for being ""All talk"" should go see this movie.

Nice one!,"Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) is Quentin Tarantino's explosive directorial debut, which quickly established him as a distinctive voice in cinema. Known for its sharp dialogue, non-linear storytelling, and gritty realism, the film has become a cult classic and is highly influential in the crime genre.The film revolves around a group of criminals who come together to execute a heist that goes spectacularly wrong. After a robbery of a jewelry store, the gang suspects that one of their own might be an undercover cop, leading to intense paranoia and a series of violent confrontations. The ensemble cast includes Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, and a young Quentin Tarantino in a small role.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A Tarantino-fest of chatting, cheating, stealing, and killing","Tarantino's more visceral film-making ingredients are here, all pumped up to the max. Suit-and-tie baddies argue and BS each other regularly in expletive-laden conversations, with sudden outbursts of violence in between. Even in the resulting bloody mess of gunshot wounds and mutilation they still have to keep talking. Unspoken directives for them could be: talk, shoot/kill, talk, and perhaps get shot/killed in return. This kind of existence becomes almost an art form in Tarantino's hands.Overall performance can only be good with a cast like that, and this should be more than enough to make Reservoir Dogs a classic for fans of Mr. T. Not bad, just feels incomplete, probably because this is a post-Pulp Fiction review. A tad above 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

overrated pretentious stage play,"Well, this one is overrated for sure, but an interesting study of Tarantino's development as a director. It has all his hallmarks - dialogue, ""the speech"", violence, out of sequence narrative. It only lacks Uma Thurman's feet. In fact, it feels like a test run for Pulp Fiction.I guess the idea of a heist movie without showing the heist and ultra violence was novel at the time.What is the main issue? It feels like amateur stage play with characters' lines rather long winded, acting a bit over the top, especially Mr. Pink and Mr. White scenes that take good part of the movie.All in all, I think, cinematically the movie is carried by Mike Madsen and Chris Penn whose characters feel natural and thus more believable.What is this film about? It is about male insecurities and homosexuality. The theme of big dicks and homosexuality is all over the movie. Even starting with their black suits/white shirt/Ray Ban glamour getup. But particularly interplay between chattering Mr. Pink and others and especially between Mr. White and Mr. Orange where it is frankly hysterical.TBH apart from the torture scene and some mildly entertaining but overly prolonged dialogue in the beginning it is a boring movie.One thing struck me tho. There is a scene with Mr. Orange on a roof top. I wonder - had ""Disaster Artist"" famous ""Oh, Hi Mark"" scene been inspired by that one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Reservoir Dogs: 8/10,"It's safe to say Quentin Tarantino is the master of the crime genre. With only four movies directed, though, it seems a little presumputuous to say that. And having seen three of the four, I don't really seem to be in a position to say that. However, when one of those movies is a masterpiece, another is a stunningly entertaining work, and the third an impressive debut piece, it's hard to say anything but that. He directs his films with such a loving eye towards the genre that it's easy to see what he wants you to get out of it: a good time. And that is what he accomplishes.Six men are brought together to perform a heist. They are Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Brown (Tarantino), and Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker). They're all hired by Joe (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) to steal some diamonds. Things get out of hand, as it turns into a massacre and one of the thieves is a rat.Reservoir Dogs has a different feel to it than Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill did. I suppose that those two movies were fun to watch. Dogs wasn't really fun to watch. It was interesting and all, but I didn't really have a good time while doing so. It does pick up the pace as it goes through its short runtime, thankfully, with more flashbacks and all. There is barely any music in the film, which is what made it seem longer, and music was key to Pulp Fiction. And the violence wasn't over the top like Kill Bill, which was the essence to that movie. Then again, it was Tarantino's first film.That's not to say that Reservoir Dogs wasn't entertaining, it just wasn't enthralling in the same way those other two movies were. Dogs had interesting characters who wound up in a strange situation, and much like Pulp it's a talking heads movie. The dialogue is interesting and profanity-laden, which adds to the uniqueness of the movie. Like those other two movies, too, Tarantino puts in titlecards for the flashbacks, which help, I suppose. Dogs is a hard movie to write a review for. There's a lot going for it, but it just wasn't fun to watch.Many of the actors here came back to do other Tarantino work. Keitel, who plays a pretty level-headed guy here, plays Winston Wolfe in Pulp; Roth, who doesn't have to do that much for most of the movie, was Pumpkin in Pulp; Buscemi, who does a great job as the terminally interesting and entertaining Mr. Pink, was the waiter in Pulp; Madsen, who plays my favorite Dog, Blonde, because of his gleeful derangement, is Budd in Kill Bill. All add to the movie as a whole. Reservoir Dogs is an interesting movie, and I know that it will continually get better on repeat viewings.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong violence and language.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A fantastic foray into the early works of Tarantino,"In 1992 Quentin Tarantino took 7 guys and an amazing script to an abandoned warehouse and started shooting. When Reservoir Dogs was first released it was met with relatively warm critical reception, however almost 20 years later I am here to tell you whether or not it holds up.For those of you still unaware Reservoir Dogs is a heist movie, but only in premise, in execution however it plays out as a heist gone wrong. We follow a group of robbers each brought together for their specific talents, skills, and most importantly their ability to be trusted. However, it becomes quickly apparent that one amongst them had been miss-judged when they get to the location of the robbery and into the waiting arms of the police. This sends the group scattering in their own directions. This is where the action opens. (I say action because the movie itself opens with a hysterical breakfast conversation regarding Madonna.) After this we see very little of the rest of the heist.From there the film turns into a sort of Clue for adults, as we are slowly introduced to each of the major players of the game. Each of these scenes plays brilliantly, Quentin manages to create within each character a personal motivation and a quiet determined distrust towards every other character. He constantly has the viewer's scrambling towards the discovery of the mole and how each character feels, but he never makes it feel frustrating.This movie more so than any of Tarantino's others plays like a movie made by a writer. There aren't any spectacular sweeping wide shots, or any of the fantastic follow shots he has become so known for. No, this film is a well-planned and plotted sequence of dialog and events staged almost exclusively in an abandoned warehouse. And it is from here that Reservoir Dogs runs into its biggest problems. The film exists in such a singular environment that it seems to drag quicker than other films might. Though the quality of dialog keeps the scenes and movie as a whole from stagnating many viewers will quickly bore of the long scenes of nothing but dialog. Not only that but the characters we are presented with aren't incredibly developed. This is believable enough given that it takes place in a matter of hours, however we never really connect with any of the characters making continual investment in their story rather difficult.These things being said Tarantino's first film still stands as brilliant foreshadowing of the career he would go on to create for himself. The films greatest strengths still lie in the moments it creates, the ""stuck in the middle with you"" scene is still one of the most gruesomely original in any film. While some may say that the movie is marred by its simplicity I feel the simplicity was by choice. Everything about this film revels in its simplicity from the names of the characters (simple colors) to the plot itself. Every aspect exudes the outstanding minimalism that can be studied for years to come.While there are places where the film still stumbles, Reservoir Dogs still stands as a fine achievement of film making. Although it drags in places, the dialog and simplicity keep us hanging on long enough to make it to the thrilling conclusion. (The film is a perfectly portioned 99 minutes.) Tarantino's film making prowess proves to us why only he could make something like this work so well. Despite its few flaws Reservoir Dogs stands up twenty years later as a crowning achievement of independent films. (For more reviews visit www.bmf-movies.blogspot.com)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
reservoir dogs,This the first movie of Quentin Tarrantino I must say FANTASTIC. The way the movie is build up is great.

The way he does that is just unbelievable.So I'll just say 1 thing Watch it!,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Enjoyable in a way I wasn't expecting,"At first I didn't expect to like this film as much as I did, but what pulled it all together for me was the acting and the very natural writing in at least most of the film. For a movie with a low budget, they sure got actors who could fulfill these rolls and give them life. There are other aspects that do suffer from the budgets limitations as well, like I would have enjoyed more background on some of the characters and time at the crime scene. I also thought the amount of gore really added to Reservoir Dogs as well. I felt more invested in the plot as things got bloodier for the most part. I loved the main characters as well; I just wish they were a little bit more fleshed out. Overall, there were a few things that I would have improved personally, but still a great movie especially since it had such a low budget.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A must watch!,"Reservoir Dogs is about six criminals with pseudonyms, and each strangers to one another, are hired to carry out a robbery. This movie has to be a classic! Everyone should see this movie at least once! The movie really focuses on the character development between the 4 main characters by going back into the past to see how they were brought into the heist. Since the movie is a Quentin Tarantino movie that means the movie is pretty gore. Not as gore has his other movies but there is a disturbing scene half way though the movie that involves one of the main characters torturing a cop. The movie has a great plot twist and a engaging story.Harvey Keitel plays Mr. White a criminal who cares very much about his team even tho they don't know anything about each other. Michael Medsen plays the man who doesn't care about others will kill anyone to achieve the heist and is the crazy man. Tim Roth plays the young man who is new to the hole criminal things he makes a strong bond with Harvey Keitel character. Steve Buscemi plays the only logical character who's trying to look out for himself.Overall this was a classic movie that everyone should see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino proved to be a talented director with his debut film,"Quentin Tarantino is definitely one of the most famous directors out there. While he is most famous for ""Pulp Fiction"" which is commonly called one of the greatest movies ever made, many of his other films usually get high praise too. What I really like about Tarantino is that while most of his movies are style over substance, it usually never bothers me because his movies often contain a certain aspect to them that is handled so masterfully, I don't mind nor care about the lack of character development or depth. This is his debut film which started his movie making career and this is where all of his talent originated from.After a jewelry heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant and tension rises between them as they slowly start to become more and more suspicious of each other.I mentioned that the majority of his movies being style over substance doesn't bother me because he often handles a particular aspect so well that I don't mind nor care about the lack of depth. What makes this film work so well is its non-linear plot. If it was linear then it wouldn't be as interesting. Its timeline being out of order, however, actually works in its favor. In fact, we actually never see the jewelry heist take place. This movies shows us the aftermath of it. The criminals describe what went wrong in the heist often in the film and they describe it by using such descriptive detail that we are able to imagine what went on in the heist in our heads.Despite all the praise this movie has gotten, some people accused Tarantino of being a plagiarist. There are definitely some similarities to movies such as ""The Killing"", ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""The Taking of Pelham 123"", and ""City on Fire"". Tarantino was definitely influenced by those movies but the word ""stealing"" is a pretty heavy and strong accusation. Reservoir Dogs is great by itself and it still contains a lot of originality. Tarantino clearly has an extensive film knowledge and he likes to pay an homage to some of his favorite directors very often. In Tarantino's case, his technique helped him make 2 of the best films of the 90's: ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"".The ensemble cast works very well together and it helps shapes the movie. Usually when I watch movies, I find that only a select few of the actors stand out among the rest. However, I felt that all of the actors stood out a lot. Many of the actors talk fast and, by doing so, it really makes the words jump out of the screen. Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) is the one that steals the show though. He has been through a lot and we can't help but feel sorry for his character and he is the one that most people root for. Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) plays the mob boss. He does a great job in his role and he is able to convince the audience that he's a character that you don't mess with. I wish that he was in the movie more. If he was in more scenes, he would have been a much more memorable character but he still is pretty memorable in the parts he does appear in.Without any doubt, this film is definitely a masterpiece. It may not be on the same level as ""Pulp Fiction"" is in terms of greatness and impact on cinema history but its quality is surprisingly not far from it. I really enjoyed its non-linear plot structure and I hope that Tarantino expands on this in future films because he creates outstanding works of cinema when he does that. Every time he does it, I always find myself in awe in certain scenes, especially the endings which are very well-executed and often catch me off guard and surprise me. Back in 1992, Tarantino showed us what he was truly capable of and he proved to the world that he was, in fact, a very talented film maker.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Cracking Crime Epic,"The best cast, the best script and the best director made Reservoir Dogs the best film of the year and the best independent film since god knows when.  I remember when it came out in the UK and it just exploded with so much hype which was well deserved and set the trend for many films and styles to come. Heist films in the early 90's were very none existent to what I can remember and Dogs was most welcoming to the view of the public and film critics.   Of course it took a while to see it finally as it was banned for a few years after the cinema release finished but it was well worth the wait.When seeing it I can see the reason why it was banned but at the same time I couldn't.   Because the violence in Reservoir Dogs had not been done since the Romero Zombies films it was very hard for the UK BBFC to stomach.   The use of torture had a big part to play but I was surprised after finally seeing it to have a strong story that holds every character as the main one. Every watch of Reservoir Dogs I always find something new about it and that is what is a joy when coming to Tarantino films because he uses dialogue so much you know you have to go back and watch it all over again without getting bored to get it.You have Mr White, Mr Pink, Mr Blonde, Mr Orange, Mr Brown and Mr Blue and what should you have, the most professional thieves since The Italian Job. Unlucky for them, they are set up and fall victim to a burst in on their robbery and all make like a banana and split for them all to return to an empty warehouse where they should all meet up if they got out in time to survive in a shootout with the police.We don't see the actual robbery which is what genius about the film because we have to guess what happened and imagine it all in your head from what they say when they finally gather together for an explosive finale.   Joe and Nice Guy Eddie are father and son who front up the money for the robbery to take place and when they hear that there men were set up they are all paranoid and going schizophrenic over who did what and ratted who out.   You know who it was before the final scene happens but it still makes impressive viewing and doesn't let it up the very last shot.  Great performances from a stellar cast of Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth let the film flow with some of the most sharpest and coolest dialogue and acting seen since the last Spaghetti Western by Sergio Leone.  Twists and turns made films like The Usual Suspects etc what they are today as Reservoir Dogs is the greatest crime film since Bullit.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The performances are unforgettable, with under-rated actors. The soundtrack is amazing, with the ""K-Billy Supersounds of the 70's"" and some Tarantino's personal picks.

"COOL, COOLER, RESERVOIR DOGS","The acting, particularly by Keitel, Madsen and Roth is top-class. Madsen in particular is brilliant in his role as the chilling Mr Blonde, the sadist with a passion for violence who mercilessly guns down the store's customers leading to the shootout. His performance as he gleefully mauls and maims the undercover cop is marvellous and you really feel pity for the cop and total revulsion for Mr Blonde. Also his brief exchanges with Mr White is one of the highlights of this movie. Keitel as Mr White fits his role as the senior gangster perfectly. Not a calculating type but a gangster with ethics if there ever is one. Roth performs very well as Mr Orange. He spends a major port of the movie in a pool of blood from the bullet wound to his gut. His performance as he convinces Joe, Eddie and most importantly Mr White of his authenticity as a criminal initially is good. Buscemi also merits a mention for his acting as the self-claimed professional criminal who first figures out that there is an informant among them and wants to flee from the meeting point as soon as possible. Penn is good, paricularly the scene where he argues with Mr Brown about Mr Blonde. Tierney does well as the boss who assembles the crew for the job. Bunker as Mr Blue doesnt have much to do in the movie, probably 2 to 3 dialogues.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The timeless Tarantino breakthrough,"This is my very first review on IMDb, so I should start with my favorite of all time!Released on 1992 'Reservoir Dogs' is the breakthrough title of director Quentin Tarantino, the cast consists on: Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi. All of them are great on the film, the plot is about a group men who plan a heist, things start to go wrong during the heist and little do they know, there is a rat on the group, the film focus on each and every one of the men to find out who's the traitor.The movie is written by Quentin himself, and benefits from a non-linear storytelling, which was the perfect way to tell this particular story, the movie is most dialog based, but it is so well acted that invests you in the characters and makes you believe in what's happening on the screen, the film presents us with a great soundtrack, the editing is awesome...Well, as I said, this is my favorite film of all time, so I definitely recommend it to everyone interested in great filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The League of Gentlemen (1960), this is not","There have been many caper movies that include a heist, probably too many for the crime genre. Among them is the one mentioned in my summation line, plus  for the modern set - Oceans 11, 12 and 13 (give me a break, puleese) and for those who remember where it all started: The Asphalt Jungle (1950); Rififi, the Jules Dassin classic from 1955; and, later, Pekinpah's ode to violence, The Getaway (1972), Steve McQueens's best role.The common theme, of course, is how some rat in the ranks makes everything turn sour for the others.There are two things that make this one different to the others: the violence exceeds all those mentioned (and probably all other heist movies) and the narrative is deliberately fractured by the writer/director (Tarantino) as a means of creating suspense for the viewer.As an experiment in using that plot device, it works: the story is terribly fractured, making it just a bit more difficult to get the picture first time round. The long list of FAQs for this one is mute evidence in support. When I saw the film in 1992, for the first time, I was intrigued but also disappointed. Seeing it again on DVD, I think Tarantino sacrificed clarity for the sake of speeding up the action  because, being such a talky film, he had to keep the action going to appease the audience. This, after all, was a diamond heist that went wrong, not a garage sale for diamonds...Some might argue that the violence is excessive. I disagree, mainly because Tarantino very explicitly laid out what types of men these were during the overly long talkfest at the lunch feast: misogynist, narrow-minded, callous, racist and psychotic  but, in an exchange completely at odds with those attitudes, showed them dipping in to help out the waitress with a big tip. The only reason for that must be to show just how different Mr Pink (Steve Buscemi) is to the rest - which is important throughout this narrative.So, the violence that follows is quite in character for all of them, even for Mr Orange (Tim Roth) who shoots a woman who shoots him, as he and Mr White (Harvey Keitel) steal her car. I think Tarantino did a good job in showing just how violent these violent people can be, leaving the viewer with an implied lesson, of course: don't do crime, or crime will do you!It was great to Lawrence Tierney again - even though he was almost impossible to recognize (playing the Big Boss, Joe Cabot) as I'd seen him in many B movies in my youth.In the end, however, I'd didn't care two hoots for any of the characters, except for Officer Nash (Kirk Baltz), the only person with real courage and honour, as he refused to reveal who the rat was.This was the first Tarantino film I saw. It's not his best. If you want that, see Jackie Brown (1997), an Elmore Leonard novel that Tarantino puts to film very well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An incredible debut from Tarantino,"Quentin Tarantino did not miss his debut with this one. He wrote and directed Reservoir Dogs which premiered at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival. A lot of great movies have premiered at this festival but 'Dogs' will probably remain the most famous passage. Although, 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Memento' are better movies, in my opinion. 'Reservoir Dogs' stars the great Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney and Tarantino himself.The cast is simply terrific, everyone is great in this movie. This is of course partly due to the many talents in the cast but also because of the great dialogue and characters. Michael Madsen's character in particular will stay with you forever. The 'Stuck In The Middle With You' scene is brilliant and horrific. Tarantino is at this day still a controversial director, and it all started with this movie and this scene. It's a shame that the violence gets so much attention in Tarantino's movies, because it shouldn't. The violence serves the story, and is in fact essential to the movie.Reservoir Dogs is a crime movie but isn't your average crime movie. The opening scene is a banal, but funny dialogue between the 'Reservoir Dogs'. It sets up the characters brilliantly and shows that the movie is going to be entirely different from what you might expect to get out of a crime movie. Dialogue is the core of every Tarantino movie. In 'Dogs' this becomes clear right from the start. The dialogue in this movie is however not the best Tarantino has written. Great dialogue builds character or introduces characters, serves the plot, is interesting, and does this without being straightforward. Every line of dialogue in this movie was interesting, it always is with Tarantino. But sometimes it didn't serve the plot and merely confirmed what we already knew about the characters. But of course, it was still interesting, entertaining and incredibly funny.'Reservoir Dogs' deserves to be called a classic. Tarantino's debut was so innovative to the movie industry that it will remain a classic forever. Reservoir Dogs will never cease to be relevant. Tarantino's potential is shown in every aspect of the movie. He was however not yet the film maker he is today, in my opinion. The bar scene in 'Inglorious Bastards' is one of the smartest scenes he has ever written. The level of suspense of opening (milk) scene of that movie hasn't been matched very often in movie history. In my opinion 'Pulp Fiction' is still his best and even though 'Reservoir Dogs' is absolutely great and innovative, I don't give this one a higher rating because there was still room for progress, in Tarantino's standards. In his next movies he achieved this progress.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino Takes Off,"Splashes of brilliance and reinvention highlight this debut from Director QT. It is a candy-shop of self indulgence and the Movie languishes at times with over written Scenes that are full of themselves, not quite sharpened, and need some restraint.Character studies to the extreme, most participants are back-grounded with detail but not much depth. The appeal here is that this was made by an obvious lover of Pop Culture and its cribbing of other Movies is painfully evident.Overall it is quite an accomplished ""Film-School"" like abandonment of conventions and style. It is unabashedly and with a heavy hand proclaiming that things need a new direction and Tarantino is at the (Stealers) Wheel.This one was impossible to ignore arriving with trumpets blaring announcing a New Kid in Town. With its unfiltered bravery and a keen eye, this Movie was a make it or break it effort. The result has since been solidified.

Not as good as City on Fire,"I had the rare chance to see Reservoir Dogs and its inspiration Ringo Lam's City on Fire in the same day, and I must say that the City on Fire version is far better than this film.I cannot pin the reasons why Dogs isn't as good as Fire, they are both very well made, highly directed films.  Perhaps because Fire has something more to offer than the ""who shall we blame"" story of Dogs.I'm not saying that Dogs is a bad film, its very, very good.  Its a 90s classic.  Taratino shows that he is a good director but his inspirations (Woo, Lam) cloud this film and his direction.Even so, this is a good film, but you'd probably enjoy City on Fire more. 7/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

First we have Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel).We learn quite abruptly Mr. Blonde is off his rocker so to speak. He beats a police officer close to the point of death, cuts his ear off and than almost burns him to death. Mr. Orange saves his life for the time being. Mr. Orange reveals during one scene that he is an undercover police officer. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are ordered by Mr. Blonde to go and get the diamonds. Mr. Brown is shot in the head while trying to escape from the warehouse. Mr. Orange is than shot in the stomach while trying to flee by a female and ends up shooting and killing her. The remaining group finds Mr. Blonde dead in the warehouse. Eddie Cabot; who is the son of the gangster Joe Cabot (who the cops after and that's why Mr. Orange is undercover) ends up shooting Marvin, the captured police officer and killing him. Eddie is angry over the death of Mr. Blonde. Joe Cabot finally shows up to the warehouse and tells everyone of Mr. Blue's death. Joe accuses Mr. Orange of being an informant and Mr. White defends him. There is a standoff and Joe and his son are now dead. Mr. Orange and Mr. White are severely wounded during the standoff. At the end Mr. Orange confesses to Mr. White that he is a detective and Mr. White cries and points his gun at Mr. Orange. Mr. White shoots Mr. Orange and the police end up opening up fire on Mr. White. Meanwhile Mr. Pink had been hiding comes out with the diamonds and ends up being arrested. The movie is full of shot 'em up action.The movie follows the same gangster theme that all of them do however it's an enjoyable movie. Quentin Tarantino though I think he is very odd does a great job directing the movie. The scenes are shot realistically and the characters fit the screenplay. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Tarantino's movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Raw,"The single word I would use to describe every aspect of this movie is ""raw."" Also the words unfinished, unrefined, sincere, weird, grotesque, and pathetic come to mind.The plot is non-linear, so as a fan of Memento I was intrigued, and I thought it worked well. The jumping around in time (and, at one point, between reality and fiction) was not too disorienting and achieved a good effect.I'm not sure if I like the acting. I can't tell whether the characters were played poorly, or if the characters' melodramatic quirkiness was supposed to be naturalistic. As such, it was believable, but just barely. Like, the characters know they were mobsters, so they subconsciously conform somewhat to the Hollywood stereotype. Or maybe the acting is supposed to be somewhat caricaturish.In any case, the story is solid, though just untraditional enough to keep you guessing the whole movie.Not a family movie.

"Brilliant, excellent, fabulous, unique...

Part of me thinks this is better than Pulp Fiction.,"I consider Pulp Fiction to be the best movie ever made, but sometimes I think this might actually be better. The story might not be as entertaining, but the acting may actually be better. Steve Buscemi is perfect as the professional Mr. Pink. Tim Roth's performance as Orange is often overlooked for some reason(kind of like Roth himself). Michael Madsen is scary as Mr. Blonde and that's a good thing seeing as how Blonde is a psycho.The actors actually become their characters. Each is perfectly cast and Tarantino(like in Pulp Fiction) gets some career-bests from these guys. Also, the ending is very realistic. That is usually what happens to bank robbers(not normally that dramatic though).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
90 minutes of great Tarantino fun,"I think it's save to say this is my favourite movie of all time. I'm not really sure why, though. Is it the suspense of the story line - who's the mole? Is it the iconic Stuck In The Middle scene, which is painful to watch but also entertaining? Is it the awkward and somehow hilarious stumbling in the last scenes? What I can say that this movie gave me a great mix of cringe, interest, laughter, sadness and repulsion... Another important factor is that the story isn't rushed; it seems like you're living the story yourself. It's not a roller-coaster of events, just a simple story line. For me, that's really important - maybe because I live in an action-movie loving family. In that respect Reservoir Dogs seems like a movie where I'm allowed to breath and to be calmly swallowed by the story. I would definitely recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great Fun Watching Tarantino's First Effort,"Quentin Tarantino's 1994 release ""Pulp Fiction"" is perhaps the single most important film of the past quarter-century. Its heated, in-your-face dialogue, hardened criminals, coarse language, and particularly its non-linear story line, peppered with occasional scenes of hilarious comic relief, ushered in a new era in filmmaking. Often copied but never equaled, ""Pulp Fiction"" made a star out of its young writer/director, Quentin Tarantino.But many of us may not realize ""Pulp Fiction"" was actually Tarantino's second film. His first was 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" a caustic, claustrophobic paean to the great caper noir films of yesteryear, updated for a more percipient audience. The highly original story involves a diamond robbery which we never see. Think ""Deliverance"" without the rape scene. We're treated to an opening scene in which a mob boss and his son have coffee at a diner across the street from the soon-to-be crime scene, along with a bevy of hardened career criminals hired for the heist. The men, previously unknown to one another, don't use their real names. Instead, they refer to each other as Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, Mr. White, Mr. Brown, and so forth. They are played by some of the best tough-guy actors of the day – Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Chris Penn.The next scene takes place immediately after the robbery. Something has apparently gone wrong. One or more of the criminals has been shot. The rest of the action takes place at a nearby abandoned warehouse, in which the remaining criminals attempt to find out which of them, if any, is an informant. Here, we delight as the double-crosses accumulate like horseflies in a swamp at dusk.Interspersed with the warehouse scenes, Tarantino gives us flashbacks highlighting the backstories of each of the primary criminals. This serves to break up the present-day action and give us some breathing room, as it were, while pulling back the covers of cynicism we instantly develop about each of these characters at the beginning. In other words, the more we learn about each of the major players, the more we understand the ongoing warehouse scene.Having seen ""Pulp Fiction"" before ""Reservoir Dogs"" (as did most filmgoers), a lot of Tarantino's trademark effects first cultivate in the earlier picture. While not as brilliantly effective as in ""Pulp Fiction,"" the non-linear screenplay is first on display in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" with the individual backstories shedding light on the robbery aftermath. As in ""Pulp Fiction,"" once the movie ends, we then want to see it again from the beginning, due to our now-complete hindsight.""Reservoir Dogs"" first introduces the Tarantino trait of uncomfortable scenes which are intentionally too long. The best of these features the great character actor Michael Madsen, as Mr. Blonde (Yeah, I know; he's not really blonde), torturing a police hostage for information. After slicing off his ear, Madsen douses the cop in gasoline, then continues to talk to him while holding a lit match – all the while Stealer's Wheel's 1973 hit ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" plays on the radio in the background. But before the cop can be set afire, Mr. Orange (who's passed out on the floor in the corner, due to a gunshot received during the robbery) rises to life and kills Mr. Blonde – because he's the informant.This stuff is classic Tarantino – from the non-dead body, to the classic pop/rock oldies, to the double-crosses, to the mordant, uncomfortable nature of the scene itself. He's employed these techniques for the past twenty years. This scene is the first.While the majority of the film takes place on a barren stage, if you will, I like the fact that we don't actually view the robbery take place. Why does Tarantino eliminate the apogee of the film? Because it isn't truly necessary! Much as the real heft of ""Deliverance"" takes place after the rape scene, Tarantino has given us the longest denouement in film history – everything after the opening credits! Again, think about ""Pulp Fiction."" Remember that we never see John Travolta accidentally shoot the man in the back seat of the car. We hear the gunshot, then Travolta and his cohorts spend the next fifteen minutes dealing with cleaning blood off the vehicle's interior. That's what we have here. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is about the ""clean-up,"" if you will, of a flawed heist.My favorite scene of all is the first. Remember in ""Pulp Fiction"" how audiences latched on to the humorous dialogue between Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, as they discussed what the French call a Big Mac sandwich? Same here, but even funnier. As this tableful of career criminals plans a horrible crime, they discuss the fine details of the lyrics to Vicki Lawrence's hit song, ""The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia."" Really. It's a seemingly effortless marriage of downright unpleasantness coupled with meaningless everyday conversation. We find it funny, but it's probably more realistic than screenplays in which every uttered line is pertinent to the plot. No one has perfected this technique as well as Quentin Tarantino.In fact, no one has come close to mimicking Tarantino's love for the cinema, processed and regurgitated from a unique perspective, and thrown back at us in classic film after classic film. I always claimed no one could watch a Stanley Kubrick film in the background. In other words, if a Kubrick film were on television, you were instantly drawn to it. You couldn't knit, play cards, read the paper, or think about anything else. Same is true of Tarantino. He's still one of our greatest living directors, and it's a thrill to go back and watch his very first work. That's why ""Reservoir Dogs"" is this month's Buried Treasure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A very simple tale which is better than the sum of its parts,"On the face of it this film doesn't tell a particularly interesting story but the fact that the end result is a superb study of the human condition means that the finished product is better than the sum of its parts. This is a rare film indeed where the quality is in the feel and the atmosphere created by the people involved who have created a film where as one reviewer for this film puts it 'less is more'. In my opinion all of the actors have to be in a certain frame of mind for a film like this to work and the result could so easily been comical if one or more of its parts had been faulty. That automatically means that the man directing this film is a risk taker and probably an innovative and intelligent film maker. I know nothing about Quentin Tarantino other than seeing him in From Dusk till Dawn which I also enjoyed. Apparently he is only 46 and he will no doubt keep producing films of this quality, well at least I hope he does.

"Tarentino's brutal, offbeat deconstruction of a jewel heist.","Tarentino's debut in the film industry, which he wrote, directed and played a small roll in, the brutal and offbeat 'Reservoir Dogs'.  The film was originally slated to be made for a mere $35,000 but the films production's budget expended to $400,000 when Harvey Keitel became enamoured with the script and agreed to star and help finance the project.`Reservoir Dogs' is a shocking and precocious film and echoes films such as `The Killing'.  Tarentino deconstructs a fatally bungled jewel robbery, structured similarly to `Glengarry Glen Ross' the actual heist is never seen and what is supposed to have happened is disclosed via flashbacks from different characters points of view.  Tarentiono's favourite directors Goddard and Hawks influence are apparent in the fragmentation of the narrative which parodies the criminal subculture with a Hawksism theme of professionalism in which these gangsters of modern times are nothing more but big kids with guns, incapable of controlling themselves and acting professionally.Similarly to Hawks Tarentino uses extreme violence in which bloodshed becomes a kind of gruesome farce.  The infamous torture sequence with the cop is staged in real time making it seem all the more endless, ironicallyjuxtaposing the upbeat seventies pop classic `Stuck In The Middle With You' playing over the stylised violence in which little is actually seen but rather the viewer is asked to imagine.  Typically of Tarentino's dark humour the cop endures having his face slashed and his ear cut off whilst the camera cuts to a `Mind your Head' warning, then being doused with kerosene, only to come out of it concerned that his good looks have been ruined.Criticised for being gratuitously violent and for having borrowed heavily from various other texts, `Reservoir Dogs' is often looked down upon by many who overlook it as being style over substance.   However this film does have substance and a style that stays true to its own and deserves credit for trying to do something different with the worn out conventions of the crime/gangster genre.  Hailed as a cult masterpiece by some and condemned as an overly violent rip off by others `Reservoir Dogs' is still definitely worth watching and is still probably Tarentino's best piece of work to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Overrated but still compelling,"Reservoir Dogs gets off to a rocky start with a lot of silly, inane chatter, much of it coming from Quentin Tarantino himself. Tarantino really needs to understand that no, the whole world is not fascinated by everything that he has to say and , even more important, that he is not an actor and he should stay firmly behind the camera.However, once the action kicks in everything changes. The pace is always brisk , never boring. It's like there's a constant sense of urgency and even impatience to move forward. Tarantino has taken an obviously low budget and made it work hugely to his advantage- it's a stroke of genius. There aren't a lot of pure action scenes but they are all riveting. Harvey Keitel puts in a great performance and Steve Buscemi does too, though marginally less so , but Lawrence Tierney blows them both out of the water. Tierney comes across as a genuine tough guy, he hardly even seems to be acting, he is so much at ease , and occaaionally he has the faintest ghost of a smile on his face , as if he were having fun in his role. His performance alone easily makes this movie worth seeing. Tim Roth is simply adequate , though in some scenes he's quite good. Michael Madsen is just barely adequate. His performance seems sort of lazy and indifferent. Chris Penn starts out severely overacting but somehow his performance slowly but steadily improves over the course of the movie. He seems to gain dignity and gravity plus genuine menace. There are lots of twists and surprises along the way and the ending ties things up neatly. Aside from the opening sequence there is no filler in this movie- not a single moment is wasted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"According to Joe this is to be an easy job, but when things don't go as planned, the remaining members feel there is a rat amongst them.","Reservoir Dogs ReviewReservoir Dogs, (1992) written and directed by Quentin Taratino, is a story about a group of six criminals: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (Quentin Taration), and Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), brought together by Joe Calbot (Lawrence Tierneya) a mob kingpin to rob a jewelry store receiving a shipment of uncut diamonds. According to Joe this is to be an easy job, but when things don't go as planned, the remaining members feel there is a rat amongst them.The movie opens with all the members including Joe's son Eddie (Chris Penn) at a restaurant having long conversations that range from the meaning of Madonna's song ""Like a Virgin"", the radio program ""Billy K's Sound of the Seventies"", to the reason why Mr. Pink will not throw his dollar in for a tip. As Joe returns to the table from paying the bill, he says, ""let's go to work"".We are then flashed forward to the results after the heist, where Mr. White is driving with a wounded Mr. Orange in the back seat of a car to a selected warehouse for the team to meet. After getting to the warehouse, the first to meet them is Mr. Pink. He is sure there is a rat among them, because the police were waiting for them and someone had to tip them off. Mr. Blonde shows up and Mr. White and Mr. Pink are questioning his mentality and unprofessionalism by killing a woman and shooting other innocent people. The conversation again goes to who is the rat. Mr. Blonde tells them he has something that will make them feel better and follow him to his car. In the trunk is a policeman Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz) he has taken hostage and as Mr. White and Mr. Pink grabs him out of the trunk, we go to a dead screen with ""Billy K's Sounds of the Seventies"" playing the song ""I Gotch Ya"". Back in the warehouse Mr. White and Mr. Pink beat Nash to try and extract information from him on who the rat is, but he knows nothing. When Eddie arrives, a bloody Mr. Orange is still lying on the floor bleeding to death. Eddie and Mr. White and Mr. Pink leave the warehouse to get rid of the vehicles so not to draw attention. This leaves Mr. Blonde who has become mentally unstable alone with the beaten Nash and Mr. Orange. Mr. Blonde tells Nash that he is going to torture him and turns the radio on to ""Billy K"" and the song ""Stuck in The Middle With You"" is loudly playing. After Mr. Blonde has cut off Nash's ear and is getting ready to torture him some more, Mr. Orange shoots and kills him. Nash and Mr. Orange have a conversation before the others return and Orange admits he is a cop. When Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Eddie return they are confused about the situation and get into an argument. This leads to all of them pulling their weapons and shooting each other. The last one standing is Mr. Pink who as the movie ends is walking out of the warehouse with the diamonds.Quentin Taratino uses the warehouse, which is large, bland in color and empty, as the set that give us the feeling of a dark place where bad things are going to happen. His use of ""Billy K's"" radio show, lets the viewer know that there is going to be a brutal scene is about to happen. He also uses the flash forward and flash back to give the audience different information on the theme and plot.As a viewer, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a coarse bloody mob movie that takes us on a journey of emotions delivered by the characters. While I feel the movie was well produced and written, I wish Taratino would have delivered the scene of the botched heist; it seemed I was missing how the rat was involved in telling the police. The shootout that happened at the jewelry store because of the rats information, reminds me of ""Bonnie and Clyde"". Law enforcement was waiting for the unexpected criminals and a blood bath occurred.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Reservoir Dogs (1992),"Well directed, well acted, and incredibly grounded- Reservoir Dogs takes a new fresh stance for heist films and executes it rather well. The film's biggest issue in the end is its slow nature, or more specifically it's somewhat often slow pacing. However, if you can be patient with the film, it can be incredibly enjoyable. The film is spectacularly acted, with all actors truly giving it their all, most notably Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen. The film is very well written, with some very realistic and often humorous dialogue. The cinematography is often incredible, and its soundtrack is often very impressive. Tarantino's directing style may be very fresh out of the barrel with audiences first experiencing him from this film, but his directing style is no doubt extremely impressive, and thanks to him every small inch of the film seems perfectly tied together. In the end, Reservoir Dogs may not be the most entertaining film from Tarantino, but there is more than enough notable qualities to the film to make for a very enjoyable and well made piece of cinema unlike any other.

Bare to the bone and excellent,"Reservoir Dogs is a self aware movie that depicts the fallout of a robbery gone wrong. It manages a balance between a detective story to find out who ratted the team out, an aftermath story of finding out who did what and what happened, a crime story with conflicting characters and a heist movie where villains (robbers) organize a heist. This film is an exciting story of betrayal and of humane trust and sadistic violence. Quentin Tarantino weaves a web of stories together to make pragmatic characters and situation where the viewer struggles with the moral choice of right and wrong. Of course, the choice is all in the audiences head where they root for morally flawed characters that are all acted with gusto by their respective actors. This story is the simplest that Tarantino has brought to screen but I enjoyed every second of its minimalist structure as it permits the viewing to become much more personal.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A bunch of criminals facing a screwed up hold up.,"A very good movie that I would recommend to everyone who likes weird and psychologically thrilling movies.  Although I didnt like one bit Pulp Fiction (another movie by Quentin Tarantino), this one is not as weird (for one, the scenes make sense and are in the right order),  However, what i'd like to know is how he got to have all those well-known actors (like Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth), got to write the screenplay himself, direct himself and event play a small part and (I think) be the one choosing the songs in his first ever movie!I mean, he also got Harvey Keitel to be an executive-producer!

A film made skilfully and with just the right amount of passion,"A story about a heist gone wrong has been dealt with over and over again, but Reservoir Dogs definitely gives something new to that story as old as Hollywood at least. You never see the heist that went wrong. You see the characters before and after. Then you just hear what the characters saw. That's why the dialogue in this movie is so important, because without it, we wouldn't know anything about what happened. But if several people see one event, they all see different things. So are we sure exactly how it happened based on what the characters said? Do we need to be?The beginning of Reservoir Dogs is legendary with its sharp and witty dialogue. That opening dialogue could be from anyone's life, anyone could have the same conversation. But in this case it just happens to be between men who are about to rob a jewellery store, because why would they talk any differently compared to other people?The nonlinear narrative let's you know what you need to know precisely when that information is useful to you. If the story was completely linear, the excitement wouldn't be so great. If you knew right from the beginning who set them up then watching Reservoir Dogs would be a lot more boring.Many scenes lack the soundtrack, which just makes the tension in the warehouse grow. But whenever there is music, it is always well chosen. Stuck In The Middle With You is such a light-hearted little song, yet it feels like completely different song after this film.Tarantino knows how to use time. Not one part of Reservoir Dogs in unnecessary. And only the things we really don't need are left out. Usually people either try to force a movie to be 1,5 hours, or they try to make it slow so it feels longer. Both of these are wrong. Each film needs a certain amount of time, and there's no point trying to make it longer or shorter.Reservoir Dogs is an amazing movie.

"Great, succeded only by pulp","The first offering from the most influential director of the nineties is a masterpiece that will be remembered not only for its violence but also its lovely constructed dialogue and it's set pieces.  Essentially a character based piece, Reservoir Dogs tracks the fortunes of a group of robbers after a heist on a jewellery store.  The movie caused controversy when released as it contains some disturbing scenes, but as with all Tarantino offerings, most of the violence is off screen, allowing the audience to think about what is actually happening, rather than showing them it in the flesh.This is a movie that would be hard to follow, and must go down as one of the greatest directional debuts ever.BEST ACTOR: STEVE BUSCEMI is outstanding, delivering a comic feel to his role.  There are a lot of good performances in this movie, especially Michael Madsens, but Buscemi's is so elaborate that he stands out in a crowded room.  BEST ACTRESS: No females of importance in the movie.  BEST SCENE: Without doubt, Madsens ear chopping scene to the beat of 'stuck the middle with you'.

An Instant Classic That Redefines Cool,"Reservoir Dogs is a cinematic masterpiece that still feels fresh decades later.

The cast is flawless-Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi-all at their best, with each character bringing intensity and dark humor.The nonlinear storytelling, set mostly in a single warehouse, creates tension that never lets up.

"Brutal, but well made","""Reservoir Dogs"" doesn't have the entertainment value of other Tarantino movies (I don't come to this for 100 minutes of escapism). But what it does have is serious cheek. Scratch that, what I really mean is cojones. This movie does a terrific job amping the tension in spartan dialogue scenes, and an even better job commanding your attention with a snap of its figurative fingers. When it's not a bunch of gangsters jawing about pop culture over coffee, it's one of them bleeding out in the backseat of a car, or another taking to a cop with a switchblade (effective ruining ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" for me).It's that kind of visceral punch to the face and methodical enjoyment of sadism that this movie prides itself on. And the camera work (a simple pull back to reveal a looming sense of dread, roving camera during a tense warehouse standoff) is the mark of a director who knows how to captivate his audience. The hard-edge-to-fun balance is off for me, which is why I don't make this regular Tarantino viewing, but no question he was on his game here.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Unforgettable crime thriller with an intangible iconic quality,"Anyone could make a film about a botched heist job, even tell it out of chronological order, but Quentin Tarantino provides his film ""Reservoir Dogs"" with certain intangibles that not just anyone can offer. His trademark anecdotal dialogue aside, Tarantino infuses ""Reservoir Dogs"" with a certain iconicity, a power that creates lasting film memories and inspires stylistically. Even the opening credits sequence, which simply features all the main characters in their black suits and skinny ties walking in slow motion through a parking lot, exudes a kind of swagger that has few rivals.For ""Reservoir Dogs,"" the iconology starts with the characters. All dressed the same but most definitely different, they're initially introduced to us by color code name: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino). They've been hired by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son ""Nice Guy Eddie"" (Chris Penn) to steal a shipment of expensive diamonds, a quick job, but one that requires a large team such as this one.The other key is that we don't see this story from the beginning. We get to see one completely anecdotal lunch scene in which all the guys give Mr. Pink crap because he doesn't tip at restaurants and then after the credit sequence we see part of the aftermath of the heist, which has gone most horribly wrong. Rather than concern ourselves with story, Tarantino creates character portraits through thick amounts of dialogue and lengthy scenes dripping with tension. He takes his time filling us in on the details, but we get them all eventually. This disguises a rather generic plot with a subplot (although it's a bit more than that) that the audience infers from the subtext of the characters.The source of the conflict comes mainly from misters White, Pink and Blonde. As a shot and bleeding-to-death Mr. Orange writhes in pain at a warehouse rendezvous point, White and Pink recall the events of the crime and begin to realize that someone must've informed the police. Enter the calm but ruthless Mr. Blonde, who makes tempers flare even more.If excessive dialogue or drawn-out scenes aren't bookended by major turning points, they're usually blanketed by some kind of tension, such as Mr. Orange lying there freaking out from his wound as Pink and White discuss what to do next. A few flashbacks pull the snowballing momentum out from under the film at times, but they add the necessary depth to actually make us care about these characters.To be clear, Tarantino hasn't executed a great crime thriller or heist film. Instead, he's made these genres into an experimental and violent ball of energy. He's written in scenes that burn images into your head and the swagger — his actors all get it. It's incredible what an ""it"" factor can do to a film and Tarantino and ""Reservoir Dogs"" have ""it"" in no small portions.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's a dog eat dog world out there... (etc.),"It's obvious from the opening conversation on reasons why not to tip and the meaning of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' that Reservoir Dogs tries to be different. To begin, it doesn't fit the expected narrative structure. Instead of the usual 10 minute robbery at the end of the movie after various stages of planning, the entire running time is centered around the surrounding hours of the heist - with only flashbacks giving any information of the characters lives before. The dialogue is refreshingly different, often hilarious. Even if there is a heavy reliance on taboo. The film is cool. Very cool (unlike that cliched pause just now). The crooks are smartly dressed in suits and walk down the street to 'Little Green Bag' in what is the most stylish strut in cinema history. Other sophisticated attributes are the aliases given to the crooks, which each resemble a colour instead of revealing their own names. It leaves the impression that they don't trust each other, which they don't. So not surprisingly violence is a key theme. Claret is present in almost every scene. Whether it's Tim Roth losing several pints of blood or Micheal Madsen amputating a cop's ear in a torture session to the tune of 'Stuck in the middle with you' ( a powerful juxtaposition of a feel-good music with stomach-churning knife work) . The acting is generally good, especially from Madsen as the psycho 'Mr Blonde' who has a dominating screen presence in every scene he's in. The only flaw is a rather basic screenplay, which has an over reliance on dialogue. The concept isn't entirely original either, the plot and several scenes are borrowed from the Hong Kong film 'City on Fire' which was released much earlier. Despite this, the film remains an impressive and refreshing debut of a quality seldom encountered.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

More Tarantino stupidity for the dorks,"Like most of Tarantino's works, there is no story here. Tarantino is not a writer. Some people think that he is a writer, but those people are on meth or cocaine.Tarantino can't even writer believable dialog. Like all of his movies, the dialog is forced by good actors who sell it to the geeks.Here, a bunch of guys who speak like gay guys trying to be tough are given colorful names by one old guy who doesn't want them to know each other, so Tarantino is doing a bit of Kansas City Confidential here.The story goes back and forth in time, and just like Pulp Fiction, it goes back and forth for no reason, with no artistry. It's like Butthead writing a movie for Beavis.The colorful named guys commit some crime. We really don't know what it is from their gay fast talk, so like all poor movies, you're required to look at the ""program"" to understand what a poor writer and director is trying to say.Not that Tarantino is the worst director or writer. There are other big names who are lamer (Coen brothers, Leone, Nolan), all of whom are revered by the sheep who believe in the old Greek mythology that some men are gods, some are demigods, and the rest of you are mortal or sheep.At least Tarantino makes fun of the very people who esteem this ""demigod classical Greek hero"" garbage, which is why he gets 3 stars out of ten, compared to the 1/10 that those hacks deserve.Most of the action takes place in an abandoned warehouse where we get the forced, unnatural dialog of geeks pretending to be tough.It's plodding for most of the way, despite all of the bloodshed. Many directors have simulated action without actual action, and given us more ""bang per violent act"" than this movie, but at least Tarantino can laugh at himself, playing both ends against the middle, placating the Beavis who thinks this is a cool movie, and the other people who realize that it's not meant to be credible.Still, it's not a good movie.

Bloody Loyalties,"Reservoir Dogs is a raw and gripping debut from Quentin Tarantino, marking the arrival of one of cinema's most distinctive voices. Released in 1992, this crime thriller is a masterclass in tension, dialogue, and character-driven storytelling.The story revolves around a group of criminals brought together for a diamond heist that goes catastrophically wrong. Told through a non-linear narrative, the film focuses on the aftermath of the botched robbery, with the survivors attempting to uncover the identity of a possible police informant. The structure of the film is unconventional, heightening the suspense and allowing Tarantino to delve deeper into character dynamics and moral conflict.The ensemble cast delivers stellar performances, with Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen standing out. Keitel brings gravitas as Mr White, a seasoned criminal torn between loyalty and suspicion, while Roth's portrayal of the wounded Mr Orange is raw and compelling. Madsen's sadistic Mr Blonde, particularly in the infamous ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" scene, is chilling and unforgettable, marking a key moment of violence that defines the film's intense atmosphere.Tarantino's trademark dialogue shines throughout the film, blending humour, tension, and philosophy in ways that feel natural yet stylised. The opening scene, a casual yet heated debate over tipping culture, immediately sets the tone and establishes the characters and their dynamics with remarkable efficiency. The dialogue is sharp, revealing character traits and building tension through seemingly trivial conversations.The minimalist setting, primarily a warehouse where much of the action takes place, heightens the film's claustrophobic tension. The violence, though sparingly shown, is visceral and impactful, reinforcing the gritty realism of the story. Tarantino's careful selection of pop culture references and a soundtrack that includes tracks like Little Green Bag and Hooked on a Feeling adds a unique flavour to the film's aesthetic, further establishing its distinct style.While Reservoir Dogs is undeniably a landmark in independent cinema, its reliance on dialogue and its deliberate pacing may not appeal to everyone. The absence of the heist itself, a bold narrative choice, may feel frustrating to some, but it allows the film to focus on character development and the emotional fallout of the robbery.In conclusion, Reservoir Dogs is a fiercely original and sharply written film that showcases Tarantino's exceptional talent for storytelling, characterisation, and dialogue. Its gritty style, memorable performances, and moral ambiguity make it a standout in the crime genre. A must-watch for fans of bold, unconventional filmmaking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Although, on the day the job goes horribly wrong and the police ambush the gang of criminals and they all have to make their own way out. As they make their way back to their arranged meeting point they soon start to consider that one member of the group must have informed the police or possibly be an undercover officer. All the criticisms soon turn into acts of violence in the location of the warehouse.What I enjoyed about the film was that it's not just a typical crime film. Reservoir Dogs is a lot more realistic, especially with the use of mise en scene, there is no make up that creates a good-looking criminal as a character, which would usually be seen in big Hollywood films. It is mostly set in the same room, which is the warehouse they meet up in after the ambush. Tarantino presented the film so simply that it is representing the genuine position a gang of criminals would be in after being chased by the police following a robbery suspiciously going wrong. Also, I liked that the dialogue is so normal as it starts with a standard looking bunch of men sitting having a coffee talking about women and music. I believe this is very unique to a film that it makes it even more natural and convincing.When I started watching the film for the first time I wasn't sure what to expect. But, from the soundtrack used after the first scene I was expecting a standard robbery that goes down to plan as they are walking down the street looking very confident with an enthusiastic song playing along, this created the image that they know what they are doing and are relaxed about it all.After watching the movie I read some reviews on the film and some said that the violence was a bit unnecessary, I completely disagreed with this as I thought that the violence helped to build upon the characters true personalities as it exposed Mr. Blonde as a genuine psychopath.Overall I would say Reservoir Dogs is a movie you must watch if you haven't done so already. It is one of my favourite movies due to the great soundtracks, the natural dialogue and the lifelike twist at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Michael Madsen!!!,"One of my old favorites! I was 19 when It originally came out. I am a huge Michael Madsen fan! The movie I didn't hundred percent care for. But I'm a young lady who's not accustomed to gore and violence! LOL, however I did love and respect the storyline and the Twisted job they were trying to get done!

"Emotionally charged, superb acting, too much dialogue.","Although written before Tarantino's other blockbusters, I saw this movie after seeing the Kill Bills, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown.  I was disappointed; this movie is clearly inferior to all the aforementioned titles.The acting was superb, and the actors really breathed life into the hackneyed dialogue and saved an otherwise mediocre movie.  Tarantino's other scripts are wittier and sharper.  If you are looking for a riveting tale of distrust and greed, watch this movie.  If you are hoping for clever dialogue and moments of comic relief, you won't find them in Reservoir Dogs.The emotion of the movie builds in a void of real action.  Depending on your taste in movies, the excessive dialogue may bore you at times.  One of the classic rules of a screenplay is to show what happened rather than having characters describe it.  Consider Tarantino a rule-breaker in that respect.The overall story, characters, set designs, etc. are simpler than other Tarantino movies I have seen.  Compared to the standard Hollywood crime drama, this movie fares well, but certainly should not be considered a classic.  Rent the Usual Suspects or LA Confidential instead.  I give it a 5 on the Tarantino scale and a 7 for my IMDB score.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Just great!,"This is Tarantino`s first movie as a director. I can just say that he did a great job! We see many good actors, examples are: Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and my favorite actor: Steve Buscemi. I would say that his performance in ""Reservoir dogs"" is his best ever. He plays the role of a paranoid, big mouthed and cynical gangster. Harvey Keitel plays the role of an more calm, experienced and ""caring"" type of gangster. I would say that the rest of the actors did a great job too.What I like about the film: I love that the gangsters is the main- characters and we develop a sympathy for them during the movie. We can see the other side of crime, not just the usual ""goodguy"" view. I like that we see the plot from several points of view and in the end it narrows out to a climax and a sudden end. This technique is, in my point of view, Tarantino`s specialty. The dialogues is also superb. They are so natural and catchy that this spices up the action and makes it a really good film.Absolutely recommendable! 9 out of 10 STARS.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Stylish and Tense Crime Drama,"Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is a groundbreaking crime film that set the stage for his unique, influential style. Following a botched diamond heist, the film explores the aftermath as the group of criminals, who are unsure of each other's identities, begin to unravel under the pressure of suspicion and betrayal. Tarantino's sharp dialogue, non-linear storytelling, and intense character development make this film a captivating experience from start to finish.The film's minimalistic setting, primarily taking place in a warehouse, enhances the tension and focuses on the performances and conversations between the characters. The ensemble cast, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi, all deliver standout performances, with each character bringing their own brand of volatility and depth to the screen. The iconic ear-cutting scene remains one of the most infamous moments in film history, perfectly capturing the film's gritty, unpredictable energy.Reservoir Dogs is more than just a crime thriller; it's a study in loyalty, trust, and the chaos that comes with a life of crime. The film is raw, brutal, and packed with tension, showcasing Tarantino's ability to turn a simple heist into a thrilling, dialogue-driven experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Woof, woof","Saw this film last night on TV.  Heard of it for a long while, butnever got to see it actually.  Scene after scene which could easilymake impressive posters (Mr. White & Mr. Pink pointing gun to eachother, Eddie, Joe & Mr. White pointing their guns, Four men walkingwith their trademark Black&White outfit, etc.) shall stay in my mindfor sometime. It's not the viewers' task to find out who the ""under-cover"" is, as itwill be revealed quite bluntly (but surely with surprise), and evenbefore that, Quentin plays around giving clues on screen (might I say,""watch out for the balloon""?).  What are we expected to enjoy with thisfilm?  Dialogue, plot, action, yes yes of course.  But what I trulyenjoyed was the mind of the characters in the film.  Men (I don't knowabout women, because I am not) can relate to each and every characterof the colorful gangsters.  Of course not to the extreme act ofviolence, but to the emotion behind each words that are shot out like amachine gun, and to the thoughts behind each action and reaction togiven situation...Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Orange, eachof them have something that men have or wish to have. Mr. White's paternal care for Mr. Orange, which at the end, costs hislife.  Trusting dad figure. Mr. Blonde (proto-Antonio Vanderas), blood-cold with no remorse,nevertheless knows how to practice loyalty in a primitive but precisemanner, which loyalty bears fruit even beyond his death (his loyaltywas THE key when Eddie figures out who the ""cop"" was). Mr. Pink, you've got to love this guy.  He's by no means ""cool"", butalways finds his way out.  Note the way he leaves the scene unhurt.And as already mentioned, he's the only one who hasn't got one's""Christian name"" revealed.  He is by no means a stupid idiot.  He talksa lot, but knows each and every word he spits out. Mr. Orange, all he had to do was stay quiet until everything wassettled at the end of the film.  Why on earth did he ""confess"" to Mr.White, who's holding a gun?  But this, my friends, is the sad nature ofmen.  At the end, you can't help it.  Anyone in a calm state of mindwould say, ""Don't blow your cover, cuz that would do no good.""  Butthere's this wee thing in your gut which can't stand it.  So, you blowthe story big time.  We see this all the time.  Men are bad in tellinglies and sticking to them.  But again, you've got to have sympathy forhim at the end of the day.If you are a guy, there's a fairly good chance you'll enjoy this.  Andwhile you watch, for heaven's sake, don't get too much into details.That will do no good.  And also, don't get too morally correct aboutthe film.  Why on earth are you watching a gangster film anyways?  Now,prepare a sack of Doritos, a bottle of Coke, and hit the ""play"" button.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great film with a great storytelling,"Reservoir Dogs is one of those movies that do not have a big budget, yet almost has everything else. The story is very intriguing, the narrative novel, and the acting simply brilliant. I cannot name one scene that I did not enjoy or does not work, and almost every line feels authentic and amusing. I do have one problem with the movie that the theme is somewhat ambiguous. It is not absolutely a bad thing, because you can see clearly that Tarantino sacrificed some of the possible screen time for thematic development and used it on the storytelling, which is great, and it pays off wonderfully. However, for me, I would prefer just a little bit something more out of the already amazing plot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

They were rounded up by a notorious and wanted mob boss for the heist.

Far too self-indulgent,"Tarantino movies hit the world by storm. Watch them again and you'll start to ask ""why?"". His pan-around-the-table scenes where everyone is making a case for some silly argument, (whether it be foot rubbing or Madonna's 'Like a Virgin') that is supposed to have rich, deeper meaning, is just boring, dry and plain dumb. At least in Pulp Fiction this was somewhat related to the story, in RD, it's nothing but filler. I found it less than humorous. Over-the-top violence and black humor are now so common, seeing this in any movie seems like a cheap trick. RD with the famous Mr. Blonde dance is just screaming ""look at me and how sick I am"" and has the subtlety of a sledge-hammer. The plot falls apart near the end as you think to yourself ""this is completely out of character"". And if you've seen any Tarantino movie, you know how this one ends. If you like his work, more power to you. His style had an impact 15 years ago, and Pulp Fiction was enough.

The Coolest Heist Movie That Barely Shows a Heist,"Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) is the cinematic equivalent of a high-stakes poker game where everyone is bluffing, sweating, and occasionally bleeding out. A crime film that rewrites the rulebook, it spends more time in a warehouse full of paranoia and snappy dialogue than actually showing the botched heist at its core. And somehow, that's exactly what makes it brilliant.The cast, featuring Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi (in his natural state of exasperation), delivers performances so sharp they could cut glass. The script crackles with Tarantino's signature blend of profanity and pop culture, proving that even hardened criminals can have heated debates about Madonna lyrics.With a killer soundtrack, a color-coded cast, and enough tension to snap steel, Reservoir Dogs is a masterclass in minimalist storytelling. It's violent, hilarious, and impossibly cool, just don't expect a straightforward heist flick. Oh, and Mr. Pink was totally right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Worst Tarantino film.,"Reservoir Dogs fails to impress beyond its iconic opening scene, which cleverly critiques tipping culture. This moment is sharp and engaging, offering a glimpse of potential brilliance. However, the rest of the film doesn't live up to this promising start. The dialogue becomes repetitive, the characters lack depth, and the plot meanders without purpose. The movie relies too heavily on shock value and non-linear storytelling, failing to deliver a cohesive narrative. Ultimately, ""Reservoir Dogs"" feels like an overrated exercise in style over substance, with the tipping scene being its only redeeming quality.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Quentin Tarantino's mobster flick is very violent and bloody, but superbly entertaining","Quentin Tarantino has scaled the ladder of Hollywood filmmakers since his directorial debut in 1992. With his unique style of filmmaking and writing, Tarantino has established himself as a masterful Hollywood mogul. Although his magnum opus 'Pulp Fiction' placed the director in the front ranks of Hollywood filmmakers, it was this brutal crime- drama that place Tarantino in the cinematic radar. Blossoming with a cutthroat script, audacious humor, and a masterfully artistic representation of violence, this mobster drama showcases the fine director's snappy filmmaking talent in arguably one of his most polishes forms yet. It is violent, it is brutal, and it is darkly funny in shocking ways. Most importantly, it is a raw gangster flick that pays a fair amount of homages to the classic film-noir genre of the 50s and 60s, and that is only half of what makes this movie subversively entertaining. This film stars Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot, a mob boss who hires a group of gangsters under the names Mr. White (played by Harvey Keital), Mr. Blonde (played by Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (played by Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (played by Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (played by Quentin Tarantino), and Mr. Blue (played by Edward Bunker) to rob a jewelry store in attempt to their hands on some precious diamonds. When the robbery goes terribly wrong and Mr. Orange is severely wounded, the criminals grows suspicious each other, believing one of them is backstabbing traitor. From there on, tension rise to violent consequences.Tarantino supplies an incredible surplus of substance and flair in this violent ""whodunit"" caper story. This film opens with a scene of our characters gathered up a diner where we are treated with a bold, yet darkly humorous introduction of the characters before they embark on their dangerous heist. When the heist turns to chaos and Tim Roth's character takes a bullet to the chest, that is when the plot kicks into gear. The driving force behind the plot is the visceral tension that grows between the characters as they each suspect that one of them is a mole. This soon accounts to a series of verbal spars supplemented with audacious dialogue and tension that leads to unpredictable bloodbaths. One scene in particularly involves a tied-up police officer who is unfairly treated to one of the cruelest (and most graphic) methods of torture ever put to screen. With the most of the action taking place in an abandoned warehouse, the violent tension greatly builds up to the shocking climax which demonstrates the nihilistic nature of the characters. While things go escalate far into mean-spirited territory that can e uncomfortable for the weak stomach, Tarantino never attempts to dive into the realm of exploitation.Although the none of the characters are particularly likable for their obvious moral depravity and ruthless personalities, Tarantino does a fairly decent job at keeping the characters interesting. The cast of made of a roster of inspiring actors who exhibit incredible performances that make a good equation of the characters' memorability. Lawrence Tierney as the mob boss and Chris Penn as his son deliver strong performances for their limited time on screen. Acquiring the most screen time is Harvey Keitel who demonstrates plenty of grit and energy in his role. The same can be mentioned for Steve Buscemi who takes a stab at some bold humor, mostly during the opening scene in the diner. Tim Roth gives a solid performance for a role that restrains him to lying in a pool of blood after his suffers a bullet wound. He does a marvelous job at displaying a realistic sense of agony for someone who's met the wrong end of a firearm. Michael Madsen is steals the show with his sadistic role as the mean-spirited member of the group who takes a cringe-inducing joy in sadism, particularly in one scene. Then there is Edward Bunker and Quentin Tarantino himself -- both of whom share a very limited amount of screen time but nonetheless make good work of the small roles they are pitted with. It is hard to say whether any of these performances are Oscar-worthy, but for they these actors accomplish, they will keep your eyes glued to the screen.Reservoir Dogs is a raw, violent, and bloody crime thriller that is superbly entertaining from start to finish, and displays Quentin Tarantino operating at one of his finest forms yet. With no surprise, this film is highly unlikely to be a welcoming experience for those who can't stomach blood-spewing violence and gleeful profanity. For everyone else, this is an entertaining picture for the crime genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I prefer it to Pulp.,"I've loved this film from the first time I saw it. I prefer it to Pulp Fiction as it is his (Tarintino's) first.What I like about it most is the fact that there is no hero and no villain. None of these guys are pure evil and all of them are from good. Some great performances are in this film, put across that these are real guys in a bad situation. The two that stick with me are Harvey Keitel as 'Mr. White' and Steve Buscemi as 'Mr. Pink'.People talk about the amount of violence, however, most of it happens in you minds eye and ear. Many of the shootings and the ear-cutting happen off screen. But unlike Pulp Fiction the violence in this film doesn't push the story as much.The script is this film is great, a lot of shouting, some memorable lines, a lot of tension between Blonde and White and a few great conversations about nothing in particular.And....what else can you say. Thanks to Tarintino's individual style, this will be remembered as one of the great debuts from a director.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Reservoir Dogs (Review),"Reservoir Dogs (Review)This film directed by Quentin Tarantino is centered on six individuals with relatively the same type of background (criminals). The story of these six gentlemen starts with a calculated plan to rob a jewelry store. The men are led by crime boss Joe Cabot, (Lawrence Tierney) along with his son Eddie (Chris Penn). As they embark on robbing the diamond store they encounter resistance from the police. This ultimately leads to a shootout between them and the cops. Members of their group are injured and killed thus sending the message they were set-up. Each member begins to turn on each other realizing someone within their tight nit group is an undercover agent. As they question one another's integrity and commitment, tensions begin to rise amongst the group creating an atmosphere of distrust and animosity. The thieves are identified by names of different colors for the protection of themselves and their identities. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), and Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen). The theme behind this film is based on friendship and loyalty to one another. This is obviously tested when the group is forced to rival against one another to prove their innocence in being an undercover cop. Mr. Blonde a psychotic individual just released from prison (but very loyal to Joe), reveals his true self when he kidnaps and tortures a cop, his demeanor is very riveting and cunning in the sense of being one sick individual. The climax of the movie is when Mr. Orange (The undercover agent) finds the strength to kill Mr. Blonde before he burns the cop alive. When Joe (the crime boss) enters the warehouse and finds Mr. Blonde shot to death he then suspects Mr. Orange of being the undercover agent but the reinforcement of the theme, ""friendship"" is represented and clouds the better judgment of Mr. White which leads to a shootout between the group.There were multiple techniques used in this film to portray and enhance the theme of the movie. The first being the constant images and patterns that represents friendship throughout the film. For example, Mr. White's concern for Mr. Orange after being shot during the robbery was constantly shown through flashbacks, courageous words, and his actions. Another technique used to enhance the overall theme of the movie was the low-key lighting used in the film. I believe this enhanced the relationship and heightened the suspense in finding who was loyal to the group and who was not. The overall setting was also crucial in the success of the plot and theme, I believe it gives the viewer a sense of being part of the action and suspense.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Moral of the story - Be professional. Tarantino's first deals with the jovial before and the bloody aftermath of a job gone awry.,"Reservoir DogsDirected by: Quentin Tarantino Written by: Quentin Tarantino & Roger Avary (background radio dialogs)Quentin Tarantino's debut film Reservoir Dogs, released in 1992, marked the entry of one the most gifted writer-directors of our time. A project that took off with Tarantino's lucky break with Harvey Kietel. The result was a film, which despite a lukewarm response at the BO has gone on to become one of the classics of the 90's. It's better regarded today than when it was released, I suspect because people watched it with more intent later, recognizing a Tarantino film for what it is; thereby reading between the lines and appreciating the genius in the film-maker's first.Tarantino's first film serves as a blueprint for the rest of his films. He touches up on all things Tarantin-ian, tension, violence, jumping narrative, brilliant dialogs and most of all his unique (or not so unique) style of storytelling. Reservoir Dogs is about 7 'professional' criminals on a mid day heist in LA. It takes us from a comical coffee shop scene, where the characters are introduced, to the opening credits followed by a drive to a warehouse, where most of the real action takes place. The robbery takes place in the time span of the opening credits and while we see nothing, Tarantino makes you think you've seen more than he's shown. Most of the film deals with the jovial before and the bloody aftermath of the heist.To make a good film you have to make it personal but Quentin tends more towards self obsessed. It's an ever-present factor in all his films. He creates characters who are an extension of his personality, uses banter that's probably pulled out from his life and works his entire film around an idea which is far from the conventional yet inspired from other films. But that's absolutely fine, Tarantino is smart with his use of homages, their timing is perfect and although not completely necessary, seem like the best fit for the situation. After all good artists copy, great artists steal.Tarantino gets one thing bang on, the dimensions of male camaraderie, especially when the men in question have no knowledge of each others' identity. Each of them has a phony name given to them by the big fish, Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son, Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) as a safety measure. There's Mr. White (Harvey Kietel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buschemi), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino) and Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker). When things are going well everyone's getting along, cracking jokes and sharing stories, all the while trying to get the last word in. With no set hierarchy everyone's out to prove they've got the biggest dick in the room but with more bite than bark. It's all casual and positive when there's a promise of a big loot hanging in their future. However, when things don't go according to plan, panic sets in and the half-good criminals lose the plot, they stop thinking straight and personal matters come in the way of professional calls. There's the magic in the film, when the characters with fake names are put in a situation that slowly brings forth their true identities.It seems as though apart from Joe and Mr. Blonde, the only two to have served time, none of the others have the mettle to keep their wits about in high pressure situations. In the end its Mr. Whites judgment that moves him to play the role of a guardian to the dying Mr. Orange. Tempers flare, voices are raised and the guns are readied. In a situation that resembles an old western the film draws the curtains on a note of twisted poetic justice.Tarantino's screenplay works on the prowess of its cast and their interactions. In a colorful cast it's hard to separate some from the rest but Tim Roth and Michael Madsen do a little more than the others. Tim Roth shows good range as he shifts between characters. For the most part he's delivering all his lines while bleeding out and in constant pain, its odd, but he's convincing enough. Madsen, follows James Cagney's principle –When playing a mean character, find a lighter side. It works well and Madsen plays the vicious Vic Vega to great effect. Steven Buschemi as Mr. Pink does a good job as well.Its difficult to put Reservoir Dogs in a genre, while there is a lot of action and violence, it's not really an action film. There are elements of mystery but it's not really a whodunit. It's got shades of a thriller and black comedy but it can't be classified as either one. It's all about the there and now and there's no telling what's going to happen. One critic said; it's an action movie that works entirely on words. Words are Tarantino's biggest strength and he sticks to it all the way and makes for a commendable first outing. Reservoir Dogs is a highly enjoyable ride that promises to thrill, shock and entertain any audience able to listen, pay attention and stomach its brutality. Moral of the story – Be professional.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A dazzling blend of influences and originality,"The script for ""Reservoir Dogs"" was written in just three weeks and is a blend of originality, enthusiasm, and homage.  Quentin Tarantino worked in a video store and turned himself into a sponge and encyclopedia of cult, often violent, marginal and sometimes classic cinema.  The film is dedicated to, among others, the cult figures Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Melville, Chow Yun Fat, and Roger Corman.  The taut screenplay is filled with references to Tarantino's favourite films:  ""The Killing"", ""White Heat"", ""Rififi"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", and ""Straight Time"" (based upon the book by Eddie Bunker, who plays Mr. Blue), among many others.  The concept of a gang of mutual strangers known only by colours appears in the New York subway heist film, ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"", one of Tarantino's favourites.  A key source was another Tarantino favourite, Ringo Lam's ""City On Fire"", which features Chow Yun Fat as an undercover cop infiltrating a jewel gang, scenes in a cafe, a sequence where the cool-looking gang walk in hip, bedraggled unity towards the camera, and concludes with an identically composed Mexican stand-off.  Another source was ""Odd Man Out"".  The film is fascinating for its complex borrowings, but most admirable for the profane poetry of the dialogue, the complexity of the narrative structure (similar to ""Rashomon""), and the stylishly camp soundtrack.  It is supremely cool, and gained an instantly devoted following.  Everything about it was taken from somewhere else, and yet it has a style all of its own that established the Tarantino signature - a look and sound all its own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino's Best ......#1,"One thing this Tarantino classic is brilliant for is the script alone. Tarantino is by far the best in the business when it comes to on screen characters and written dialogue! Reservoir Dogs is excellent proof of that and is one of the best casted movies that i can remember in a long time. Chris Penn (rip) who i thought wasn't that great of an actor during his short lived career, however he was brilliant as well. If you have never seen any of Tarantino's work, then i definitely suggest starting here as it will only leave you either wanting more or not. You see you either love Quentin or you don't their doesn't seem to be any in between. I myself before seeing this for the first time (RD was my very first Tarantino film ) did not like to sit through films that were heavy in dialogue as i found them immensely boring. That changed and was only cemented after also viewing his Pulp Fiction (Another character/dialogue enriched film).For those who have yet to see this cinematic masterpiece let me fill you in a bit. 7 men all hired by crime thief expert Joe Cabot to perform a job on a jewelry store that has according to sources a load of diamonds that just came in from Brazil, after the job goes very badly the men who survived the aftermath shootout with the police were to show up at the rendezvous point. We get three of the men Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) pulling a badly injured Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) who had taken a bullet to his belly who are at the rendezvous point first and let the dialogue roll... All of the men seem to believe that the heist was a setup but have to unfortunately stay put until the arrival of Joe Cabot to tell them further instructions.Kudos here to Michael Madsen who portrays, most excellently the psychotic Mr. Blonde aka Vic Vega who was definitely my favourite character in the film. This is a movie i can easily watch 1000 times over and over again as it remains as one of the best films i have ever seen!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great debut,"Great story-telling, great cast, great ending. I liked how lean it was and how it focused on events after the heist, which was a nice spin on the genre, and pretty impressive for Tarantino's debut film.My only complaint was the vile racism the characters spewed several times, which seemed unnecessary to tell the story. When added to the comments about women, jokes about prison sex, analysis of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin,' it all seemed to add up to something that reveled just a little bit too much in an unpleasant character type, the white/male/racist/sexist/heterosexual. I still enjoyed it though.So funny story about Harvey Keitel. Once upon a time I visited Oamaru in New Zealand, and happened across a bookbinder who used ancient techniques to handcraft blank books or restore old volumes, like family Bibles. After I told him I would buy works of fiction if he had any of those bound, he recounted the story of his meeting Harvey Keitel, ""the last American who asked me about that."" It was a story that would make for a fantastic short film - this luddite craftsman seemingly displaced in time by hundreds of years (even dressing the part), meeting a minor celebrity, who continually introduced himself as an ""Oscar nominated actor"" in an almost caricature of Hollywood egotism, as well as his assistant, one of his ""people"", who made unreasonable demands on the poor guy. The bookbinder had a policy where requests to skip over others in his work queue would be honored if he was given a bottle of Scotch. Keitel thought he was joking and that his celebrity alone would ensure higher priority, but the bookbinder was serious, leading to a miscommunication and some unpleasantness. When the work was eventually done, extracting payment out of the ""Oscar nominated actor"" was challenging, but eventually the bookbinder was in New York for other reasons and tracked him down. I couldn't help but think of that while watching this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Breakthrough For Tarantino And Indie Cinema,"For the general public, ""Pulp Fiction"" might be the movie that put Quentin Tarantino on the map, but for cinephiles and filmmakers, it will always be ""Reservoir Dogs."" Before production began on the film, Tarantino had only directed one previous title - a 36-minute amateur project called ""My Best Friend's Birthday."" ""Reservoir Dogs"" was thus Tarantino's debut feature, and it introduced a broader audience to the trademark techniques that keep his movies unique to this day.The crux of the plot takes place in an abandoned warehouse after a jewelry store robbery in Los Angeles. Eight men were involved in the heist, but one of them supposedly tipped off the cops, for police were waiting at the scene of the crime from the very beginning. Through flashbacks, we learn more about the characters' backstories, as they spend the present trying to weed out the rat in their entourage.Flashbacks are a staple of Tarantino movies, and he evidently began his taste for non-linear storytelling here. Narratively, ""Reservoir Dogs"" centers around a diamond robbery, but the crime itself is never shown on camera. The director only shows instances from before and after the event. In doing so, he creates something derivative of a standard crime movie. The film fits no absolute mold and takes on the gangster genre from a novel angle.Another way ""Reservoir Dogs"" stands out as a Tarantino movie is through its dialogue and characters. Tarantino wrote the screenplay as well as directed the movie; he therefore created its ensemble of slimy people and penned their ruthless vocabulary. Particularly through their language, the characters in ""Reservoir Dogs"" bring new meaning to the term ""toxic."" Few of them are easy to root for, but all are thrilling to watch and hear. Much credit is due to the film's superb performances, but the script alone is truly memorable. The lines are edgy, and perhaps offensive, but nevertheless fitting for this raw kind of film.And speaking of rawness, ""Reservoir Dogs"" also introduced Tarantino's most infamous trademark - over-the-top violence. Each character appears soaked in blood, sweat, or spit at one point or another, and the camera does not shy away from depictions of torture or death. All of this bloodshed is presented with an uncanny sense of fun, though. Tarantino will place upbeat music over gruesome scenes, and some characters seem to relish in their sadistic actions. One could easily call the film morbid, but Tarantino wears that criticism like a well-earned badge of honor. In reality, it is no bloodier than the average horror film, and as a movie, it's equally victimless. In today's market, it honestly feels more dicey for lacking diversity or any female speaking parts than it does for gratuitous violence.Nevertheless, I applaud Tarantino's daringness. Before this film, the director was working at a video rental store in Manhattan Beach. He was going to make the movie out of his own pocket until Harvey Keitel read the screenplay and decided to co-produce it. In 1992, it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and made lots of noise. Miramax acquired it for distribution and it effectively began the indiewood trend of the 1990s. With ""Reservoir Dogs"" Tarantino established himself as an auteur, but also paved the way for other experimental filmmakers to find popular outlets in the mainstream movie world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino's Best... (subjectively),"I adore this film. From start to finish.First of all, don't get me wrong, I love Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill (Vol. 1&2), Inglourious Basterds and practically everything else he's done.But this, ladies and gentlemen, is his magnum opus.He took a huge risk in making this the way he did, especially for a debut, but he did it, and I'm thankful.This isn't much of a review, but that's because the film was made in 1992 and there are plenty of other reviews that will present my view with more depth.The acting is fantastic, the dialogue is inexplicably intriguing, the soundtrack is like no other and it oozes that lovable Tarantino style.If you haven't seen it, what are you doing?

Timeless and Gripping,"Right from the first minute, this movie takes you into its own world and keeps you fixated. Tarantino's script + direction means that the movie was pretty gripping. Like many others, I too loved the background score. It is unconventional but goes well with the movie. The overall execution of the movie was so good that we forget the actors and instead focus on the characters like Mr. Pink, Mr. White etc. Special mention to Mr. Blonde who made a lasting impression through 'that' one scene. The movie, its characters, its music, all have become a part of the pop culture and there is a very good reason behind it.It left me asking for more.

Unmasking Loyalty,"Watching ""Reservoir Dogs"" for the first time was like stepping into a whirlwind of tension and style that I had never quite experienced before. I remember the anticipation building as the opening credits rolled, accompanied by the infectious sounds of the 70s soundtrack. The film's unique structure immediately caught my attention; it felt like a puzzle waiting to be pieced together.The diner scene, where the characters engage in a seemingly mundane conversation about tipping, was a masterclass in character development. Each actor brought their A-game, but it was Steve Buscemi's portrayal of Mr. Pink that really stood out to me. His blend of humor and desperation made him instantly relatable, even as he was embroiled in a criminal plot. The dialogue crackled with energy, and I found myself laughing and gasping in equal measure as the story unfolded.What struck me most was Tarantino's audacious choice to not show the heist itself. Instead, we were left to piece together the chaos from the aftermath and the characters' conflicting accounts. This non-linear narrative kept me engaged, forcing me to pay attention to every detail and nuance. The tension built with every flashback, and the way the characters interacted revealed their personalities and motivations in fascinating ways.The violence, while shocking, felt purposeful and impactful rather than gratuitous. It served to heighten the stakes and emphasize the desperation of the characters. Michael Madsen's portrayal of Mr. Blonde was chilling, and the infamous ear-cutting scene is forever etched in my mind-not just for its brutality, but for how it encapsulated the film's exploration of morality and loyalty among thieves.The film's aesthetic also deserves praise. The cinematography and editing were sharp and stylish, perfectly complementing the gritty narrative. I found myself captivated by the way the camera moved, the clever use of close-ups, and the seamless transitions between scenes. It felt like I was watching a piece of art in motion.As the credits rolled, I was left with a mix of exhilaration and contemplation. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is not just a crime film; it's a bold statement on the nature of trust, betrayal, and the human condition. It's a film that demands your attention and rewards you for it. I knew then that I had witnessed something special, and I couldn't wait to dive into Tarantino's other works. This film is a must-see for anyone who appreciates sharp dialogue, complex characters, and a unique storytelling approach.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Misunderstood masterpiece,"Who would have thought such a simple plot could become this much of a classic. I can't find any fault at all with the film itself and I'm so glad to have it in my collection.The plot is simple as I said focusing on 4 survivors of a failed diamond heist as they attempt to unravel who was the rat who set them up. This film isn't about the plot, however, it is about the characters and this is where the film shines as possibly the best ever. Each character is unique but not clichéd and this is very clever. They manage to make the watcher both like and dislike them at different times. This is true even to the extent that a conversation about Madonna and tipping can be interesting to listen to. The most interesting parts of the film are where it takes you into the back-stories of the main characters including the planning of the heist.The acting is carried off superbly particularly by Michael Madson as the quiet psychopathic Mr Blonde and Steve Buscemi as the prickly nervous but logically thinking Mr Pink. When it gets to the end of the film you will have got to know all of these characters and the tense climax holds up against the best modern films. This film proves that you don't need a huge budget and CGI to make a good movie.Reservoir Dogs is somewhat similar in style of directing and filming to Tarantino's later film Pulp Fiction. But I prefer Reservoir Dogs as it is the classic that started it all off. I would recommend it to people who appreciate a movie that makes you think and isn't about action heroes or explosions but is much more subtle. It would be easy to mistake this for a plain movie with too much bad language and violence for the sake of violence. It is much more than that trust me and you'll soon find that Reservoir Dogs goes much deeper than so many titles out there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The all star cast that still couldn't do it right! But what is a Reservoir Dog?,"A epic story of loyalties, friendships and betrayal as Tarantino really comes into his own in directing a film that achieved cult status. An all star cast: Keitel, Madson, Penn, Tierney, Buscemi, Bunker and of course, Tarantino, really set the scene of the low budget jewellery heist that was doomed to fail. Accompanied by new boy, Tim Roth, the dogs create action, suspense, comedy and drama that keeps the viewer's eyes glued to the screen until the final 'killer blow' finale. With sequences still revelled over today including: The Diner, The Stroll and the infamous 'Torture Scene' (adapted into a dance video in Louise's top 5 cover hit of 'Stuck in the middle with you'), Reservoir Dogs is one of the greatest films of all time.

Reservoir Dogs pales in comparison to Pulp Fiction,"""Reservoir Dogs"" contains the same macho, profane, tough-guy attitude and non-linear story telling as Tarantino's other film, ""Pulp Fiction"", but lacks the love of dialogue and the diversity and interest of characters. The characters in ""Pulp Fiction"" all had views, mannerisms, and characteristics all their own. They loved to talk, and we loved to hear them, because, insightful, funny or just plain stupid, Tarantino made everything they say interesting. In ""Reservoir Dogs"" however, almost every word spoken serves only to advance the plot. The characters are more or less interchangeable. None of them say anything that you couldn't imagine another character saying. With the exception of Red (Madsen) and Orange (Roth) none of the diamond thieves have any background. There is very little uniqueness to any character in this movie.I mentioned the non-linear storytelling that was used in both ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", unfortunately however, the concept that was so exciting in ""Pulp Fiction"", seems like a gimmicky way of hiding the movie's greatest flaw: Nothing much happens. The story involves a robbery (which we don't see) and the setup to the robbery (which we don't care about, because we don't see the robbery).With ""Pulp Fiction"" already out on DVD and video, there is very little reason to see this movie, apart from, of course, curiousity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Reservoir Dogs - The best film of all time!!!,"When Reservoir Dogs hit cinemas in 1992 it was an instant success world-wide and eight years on, the movie that started writer/director/actor Quentin Tarantino's roller coaster career is still considered by many to be one of the all time great gangster movies.Like all Tarantino movies, reservoir dogs consists of crime, hard hitting characterizations and extreme violence. The basic plot is this: The dogs, a group of men under the aliases of Mr. White, Mr. Brown, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blue, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, are recruited by crime boss Joe and his son Nice Guy Eddie to pull a job on a jewelry store. But the plan goes horribly wrong, the police were waiting for them and the result is a bloodbath involving the cops, civilians and some of the gangsters. Back at the rendezvous, a deserted warehouse, the remaining dogs try to work out what went wrong. Suspicions arises that one of them is a rat who sold the others out and paranoia soon sets in when they each realise that they can't trust each other. Emotions run high resulting in an unpredictable yet dramatic climax in the final two minutes of the film.Reservoir Dogs is typical of Tarantino's refreshingly unique approach to the genre of action/thriller. He uses the flashback technique constantly and effectively throughout reservoir dogs to not only gradually reveal additional information about the sequence of the bloody events that have lead up to the present situation but also to give the audience an insight into characters histories and perspectives. Clear parallels can be drawn between Reservoir Dogs and Tarantino's critically acclaimed Pulp Fiction, which was made two years later. In Pulp Fiction Tarantino intertwines three stories with random flashbacks and it is only by the end the movie that full sense can be made of the events that have transpired which stimulates viewers interest and involvement. Tarantino's focus is on the violent side of life as can be seen in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, the only three movies, which Tarantino has taken full credit for as director. He explores this focus through stylish characterization drawn from the criminal world in LA.Although this film contains a diverse range of techniques, I would have to say that the most original aspects of the film were: The camera angles and the music. Despite the plot being superb, every word out of the character's mouths interesting and unusual, the casting brilliant, and the acting gripping and totally realistic, it is the camera angles and the music which really give Reservoir Dogs its atmosphere, which in this movie is everything.The camera shots in this film add much to the suspense and are at times uniquely directed. Many times throughout the movie the shot is so far away that it is impossible to ascertain which character is actually speaking and therefore it almost seems that the characters play a secondary role to their dark and miserable surroundings.Although the camera work effectively creates the mood it is the music which truly plays the most vital role in Reservoir Dogs. Everyone is stylish in Tarantino's world and this is reflected  through the use of music. The recurring theme of the radio show `K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies Weekend' plays an extremely important role in the music element of this movie. Nearly all the music present in the film is actually heard from radios in cars or bars and is always K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies Weekend. The gangsters talk about their identification with the Radio show, and have a kind of shared memory with each other through the songs.Overall this is my favourite film of all time and no matter how many times I see this movie I just can't seem to get tired of it. It could be something to do with me and violent films, but I think it's more because this is the only movie I've ever seen that mixes such a diverse range of techniques so successfully. This is summed up by the fact that even the dramatic and somewhat tragic end to this film leaves in its wake a strange sense of completion.The test of a great film is whether or not at the end of it you would want to see it again immediately and if you find yourself sub-consciously uttering the phrase ""Goddam, that was brilliant film"", you know what you've just witnessed won't be forgotten for a while.If you haven't seen this movie SEE IT NOW. Even if violent films aren't your forte, bear with it and watch it to the end, you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Resrvoir Dogs,"The movie Reservoir Dogs, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, was a great movie. It is a movie that is created with the classic cops and robbers theme, but with a creative twist and motif. A group of criminals, all who use code names for protection, attempt to pull a jewelry heist that goes bad. The group consists of actors such as Harvey Keitel (Mr. White), Steve Buscemi (Mr. Pink), Tim Roth (Mr. Orange), Michael Madsen (Mr. Blonde), Lawrence Tierney (Joe Cabot), and Chris Penn (Nice Guy). I felt that the actors chosen for the roles were a great cast job by Tarantino. The group becomes suspicious that one of them is a cop due to the response time of the cops to the heist. The movie has major amounts of violence and foul language; however it is necessary to convey the ruthlessness of the criminals. The movie shows that even the hardest criminal can have a heart and care as well. It also shows just how evil one can be as done through Mr. Blonde. Mr. Blonde kidnaps a cop from the heist and tortures him by cutting of his ear and covering him with gasoline. These are two elements shown in the movie Training day, written by David Ayer, as well. The angles used help the viewer to feel inside the scenes as if you are taking part of the movie. Overall the movie was very well cast and thought out. The common theme of man going undercover to ""get"" the bad guys was done with a creative twist. The use of violence and harsh language is a necessary to get the message across, but done in a way not to glamorize the criminal lifestyle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Proof that Quentin Tarantino was a skilled filmmaker from day one, already beginning to master his craft.","As Quentin Tarantino's first film this one truly sets the hallmarks for the director which would be used in his later films. The movie is about six criminals who work together to rob a bank but their employer attempts to keep it professional. They all dress in suits and never use their real names so as to keep their real identities hidden. Interestingly the film completely revolves around the robbery but it is never actually shown with the entire movie jumping back and forth from before and after the robbery. It shows how the different men got hired on for the job and how they react to the robbery going completely wrong. Most of the group believes that they were set up so they also must discover which one of them is an undercover cop. So the story is very non-linear which really keeps it interesting and the movie really makes you keep on guessing about who the undercover cop is which is really good storytelling. So overall an excellent plot that works very well in the film.All of the actors do a stupendous job here in each of their roles. Harvey Keitel plays Mr. White and does a great job at getting sympathy, professionalism, and the ability to do what is necessary without needing to be pushed. Then there is Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde or your psychopath of the film. He seems incredibly calm and professional around others but once they leave he really seems like a loon which means that he does a good job in his role. Tim Roth plays Mr. Orange who is injured throughout the majority of the movie (all of the after the robbery scenes) and he works really well too with how someone would act when they are injured like that. And we also have Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink who isn't crazy or very professional either but he is smart and plans everything out. Just like everyone else in this movie he does his job perfectly. So we have some excellent acting here from the entire cast.When it comes down to the special effects they are quite good for the time period and budget with some very realistic looking injuries and wounds plus some great looking gunshots and just about everything else. The music has a lot of 1970s songs in it and it works surprisingly well for the movie. The soundtrack is iconic and memorable which really helps get the film off the ground.Overall, this isn't Quentin Tarantino's best film but it is still incredibly entertaining. It is incredibly violent and has some very course language but if you can sit through all of that then you'll really see a skilled filmmaker just beginning to master the craft. The non-linear storytelling is rarely used in films which really keeps the audience thinking and with such an incredible story, stupendous acting, and some decent production values this one is worth a watch.

Hounds Of Love,"As if I've not started enough stupid internal lists to I've decided that we're going to run through Quentin Tarantino's career and reappraise how I feel about it. So naturally, we started at the beginning.When a jewellery heist goes violently out of hand, a group of career criminals return to base and try to determine what went wrong. Though they've taken precautions and are using codenames, the remaining members of the group begin to believe that one of them may be a police informant.So. This is an Iconic movie in my life. I had the poster on the wall of my University dorm room, and a framed picture of Tarantino at other points. We even, at my insistence, recreated the final third of the movie for one of my friend's art projects. The point is, I was really (embarrassingly) into this film a few decades ago. Now.... I feel it's got some undeniably iconic scenes but I'm a little underwhelmed by some of the other aspects of it.It's a lot more awkward than I remember. He's one of my favourite actors, but Steve Buscemi trips over his lines a lot. You could argue that is creating a realistic style but if that's the case, he's the only one doing it, as Harvey Keitel is all about the style of his lines. ""You shoot this man, you die next. I repeat. You shoot this man you die next"". A few of the aspects of the back stories aren't up to that much. Particularly the ten minutes devoted to Mr Orange's anecdote, which isn't particularly funny. The pop culture discussions though are excellent and were along with ""Clerks"" revolutionary at the time.Visually it's dynamic, with the camera chasing the crooks down the street, for example. But there's some odd choices, such as a combined focus two shot that has a distinct and obvious line down the middle of the screen.Generally I still feel like ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a good film, a great film even . . but perhaps not the all-time classic I used to think it was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It took me too long to revisit this modern crime classic.,"Filmmaker Quentin Tarantinos' feature debut is a viscerally entertaining, powerful, witty, and well acted (for the most part) piece of work that showcased his flair and prefigured his follow-up picture, ""Pulp Fiction"", with the way that it leaps back and forth in time.A group of lowlife criminals with clashing personalities gets together for a diamond robbery that goes horribly wrong. (Now, we never see the actual robbery, but the vivid descriptions supplied by the characters still tell us what we need to know, and truth be told, it works just as well in ones' imagination.) Now the survivors have holed up in a warehouse where, in between their verbal attacks on one another, they work at figuring out what went wrong, and realize that one of their own has to have been a rat.You know you're going to be in for an interesting time when a group of grown men are debating the message in the lyrics to Madonna songs; this is just one example of how heavily QT leans on his own dialogue. Here, of course, he was already dropping pop culture references (Marvel Comics characters, the TV series 'Get Christie Love') and quoting the movies that influenced him, in his approach to telling this story. It's often effectively gory, and many people are quite familiar with the show-stopping torture sequence, even though in actuality we don't see the worst of it.The whole thing is grimly compelling; this odd assemblage of characters reveals little details about themselves throughout and often just get on each others' nerves. No matter how ugly this may get, it's the kind of thing one just keeps watching.The eclectic cast inclues Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, ex-con turned author & screenwriter Eddie Bunker, Tarantino himself, and legendary movie business tough guy / wild man Lawrence Tierney in one of his best roles since the 1940s. The soundtrack is a treat to listen to, with Stealers Wheel rightfully earning, at the time, newfound appreciation for their old song ""Stuck in the Middle with You"".Solidly entertaining all the way through, ""Reservoir Dogs"" served as a fine announcement to the world that a fresh talent had arrived, and holds up extremely well. It's gripping stuff that could also work pretty well on the stage, always striking and never boring.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What a Debut,"It's very rare that we see a director establish him- or herself as a true talent with their first theatrical release. Not only did Tarantino establish himself as a great storyteller with the release of Reservoir Dogs, he also gave us a glimpse of his distinct artistic voice that we would anticipate in the years to come. He specifically set a trend in the use of dialogue which reminds us of everyday conversations yet is simultaneously layered with subtext and analogies.The opening sequence establishes Tarantino's master of dialogue perfectly. While the conventional director might open a robbery film with a scene which highlights the plan for the robbery, Tarantino strays away from exposition. Instead, we get a lengthy conversation in which the robbers analyze a song, discuss the ethics of tipping waitresses, and make pop culture references. What does this do? It establishes the characters as human beings and gives them life instead of having the boss merely explain the plot to the robbers, who would substitute for the audience.This might have to do entirely with the fact that the film had a low budget, but Tarantino essentially uses one location for about two thirds of the film. He is still able to establish an intricate and very tense story revolving around the idea that one of the robbers suspects an undercover cop is amongst them. The set design is simple - an abandoned warehouse - so the visual creativity of the film is mostly in the cinematography, but even with that, the heavy use of the warehouse as a setting makes this come across as more of a play, which it should. The dialogue is the driving force of this film, and while the characters may discuss plot at points (I hate it when movies rely on explanations of the plot through dialogue, a la Inception) it is only done when it is necessary. The rest of the dialogue reveals much more about the characters than visuals could provide in this film, and hey, I'm okay with that.One problem I have with the film is the fact that while this film revolves around a group of robbers we never learn too much about two of the robbers since they are hardly in the movie. In fact, one of them only has a few lines in the opening conversation scene of the film. The absence of that character would hardly change the meaning of the film at all, which is why I wish we would have gotten to know him a bit more. I understand side characters, but in a film about a group of robbers, the entire group should have a significant part in the film as an ensemble cast.A great directorial debut for Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs shines as a surprising hit for a crime film with such a low budget and as a huge influence on the manner of dialogue used in crime films between its release and present day.4.0/4.0",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Tarantino film,"I thought the movie Reservoir Dogs was very well made and had a good script and good directing.  But even better than that was the movie's excellent acting and great cast.  Every role was cast perfectly and acted very well, even Tarantino's bit, and, although Sam Jackson is an excellent actor, I respect and support Mr. Tarantino's decision not to use him in this film. Harvey Keitel was a special treat in this film, as was Steve Buscemi.  The story is in every way perfect and the setting, although very different from that of Pulp Fiction, is every bit as good.  Tim Roth didn't give as good of a performance in this as he did in Pulp Fiction, since he was playing an American in Reservoir Dogs, but he still did a good job.  Michael Madsen did an excellent job in this film, playing his role perfectly (probably just as writer/director Quentin Tarantino originally saw the character in his mind), and it's a shame we didn't see him in another Tarantino flick until Kill Bill Vol. 2.

Kirk Baltz as Marvin Nash
Edward Bunker as Mr. Blue
Quentin Tarantino as Mr. BrownREVIEW:
Six criminals who are completely stranger to each other are hired by Joe Cabot to carry out a Diamond Robbery. Right at the beginning, they were given some false names so that they don't get too attached to each other and focus only on their assigned job. Mr. White, a professional criminal; Mr. Orange, a young newcomer; Mr. Blonde, a trigger-happy killer; Mr. Pink, a paranoid neurotic; Mr. Brown; and Mr. Blue But the plan starts to fall apart when the alarm is tripped and the cops show up within moments. Of the group of men, all of whom are identified by colours, only four survive with one being seriously wounded. It is suspected that there is a police informant in the group, but no one is sure who it is.This was certainly cutting edge for its time and I believe the editing and sequencing of the film is still used in our time. The narrative structure of movies has undergone radical change in modern film, and I'm not sure if this film is chiefly responsible, but it's certainly there in the grammar of modern film. It's quite ingenious how it's put together, and how it's explained, this film of crooks and hoods planning a jewellery robbery that is hamstrung from the get-go. Hamstrung because one of the hoods/crooks is actually a cop that has infiltrated the group. It appears to be a random film, but it is only random in the sense that the order of the narrative is shuffled around. The narrative itself isn't or we'd probably be entering the world of the nonsensical.So, there's plenty of brain power behind this, and there's humour here too, but the aftershocks of the violent acts are quite disturbing. Tarantino dwells on blood and the physical and emotional aftermath of acts of violence to an extent that it could almost be a poster call (Tarantino's poster call) for anti-violence in the movies. It is quite hard to look at without turning away because he plays on acts of violence and their aftermath for such extended lengths of time. That's one of my personal arguments against this particular Tarantino film. Another would be his extensive and prolific use of obscenity which hits the registers as his violence does. He overdoes it. And he does make you feel it in ways you don't want to feel it. He gives violence and obscenity a bad name not because he uses it, but because he dwells on it extensively and purposefully. A third negative for me is that I found it hard to picture Tarantino as one of the hoods/crooks picked for the jewellery heist. Him sitting around the dinner table with the other hoods/crooks clasping coffee mug with both hands looked strangely out of place with the other hoods/crooks. He's certainly got some imaginative ideas about making film though - his editing, his story idea of a jewellery robbery given a modern make-over, his crook/hoods pointing their guns at one another, his choice of popular music soundtrack, his opening credits of the hoods/crooks walking in their dark suits in slow-motion, his actors which are all quite capable and sometimes funny. Hence four stars. This is something new. New and fairly raw.
Well this movie has adapted a new and very unique technique of storytelling in its time, which feels fresh till today, even after almost 3 decades of the film being released. And if we look back in time it can be called a tribute to Tarantino by himself as the film is characterised by nonlinear storylines, satirical subject matter, aestheticisation of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts, references to popular culture and a wide variety of other films, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the 1980s, alternate history, and features of neo-noir film. It had almost all the ""TARRANTINO EFFECTS""
It is a must watch for all the movie lovers out there and the screenplay which should be studied by all aspiring directors and Screenplay writers. I have read the screenplay and I personally think that a seldom a 90 minutes screenplay has so detailed narration. the screenplay is full of witty and quotable dialogue (""Mr. Brown? That sounds too much like Mr. S**t."")",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Probably the greatest heist film of all time.,"Pulp fiction is an interesting film without a doubt. There are no over the top effects, maybe 3 settings and to be honest not a lot happens. However it is the characters that make this film. This is one of those movies that are not at all complex, but are also exceedingly enjoyable. The acting is pretty good, especially Steve Buscemi. Mr. Pink is without doubt one of the most memorable characters I have ever experienced. Considering the time when this movie was made, it is even more impressive the level of interest this movie achieves. All in all, if you like heist movies, character movies and most of all Tarantino movies, Reservoir dogs cannot be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"perfect, in every respect","A lovely cocktail of violence. Sit down, relax and let the 'dogs' come at ya. The first time I saw the movie, I even hypnotized by the characters's names. Mr. White, Mr. Blond, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink (""why I'm mister Pink""). And there are much better inventions in the movie. The plot, for example. A classical 'whodunnit' turned upside down. In this movie, the criminals try to find out who the 'bad guy' is.But the best of the movie are the dialogs, the painful scenes, and the haunting atmosphere. The scene where there is cut an ear of a police officer while the radio plays cheerful music, for example. Or the strange bond between mister white and mister orange. And all this perfectly acted by a dream cast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
violent but brilliant storytelling,Such a classic. Great dialogue. Surprising turns. Characters are unforgettable.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very Good Movie,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a ""Usual Suspects"" type film that is a good watch with good moments as the audience gets to see a sloppy, amateur filmmaker that is looking to make a name for himself (in what became a great launching point for one of the best filmmakers ever).Good Direction, Good Acting (By the whole cast (With Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel standing out the most)), Good Story, Great Screenplay (very Tarantino-esque), Pretty Good Editing (Tarantino-esque), Plot Structure is very minimal as the audience is thrown right at the end and they have to put pieces together throughout, Pacing was all over the place given the way the narrative was told (No fault really); very short runtime (which is fine because there is very little plot), There really isn't any climax to build too (No fault given that you start at the very end), The feel and style of the movie has a very similar feel to Usual Suspects (But I liked this one more), A lot of mistakes and misses which shows in Tarantino's first film (Definitely can see his growth throughout his career)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Reservoir Dogs,"Reservoir Dogs, starting out with my first ever Tarantino movie, can you believe it. It thought best to start from the beginning. Reservoir Dogs managed to surprise me with it's story, but also it's rock solid acting and directing for a first timer.Knowing this is pretty much the first thing Tarantino made with some friends of his. It's incredible what he put out here. A cast that never underperforms, a great dynamic and an interesting way to tell a story in a different way. Not doing something run of the mill as a first brings a risk, and it obviously paid off.That being said, it's a dialog heavy movie and whilst it has a few lines that stick, I never fell in love with it as much as I'd wanted, maybe my bar was set too high, maybe I was expecting something even better. Which is unreasonable in retrospect. Maybe because it's so contained, it just didn't do enough.The acting is phenomenal, everyone owns their role and no-one really falls out of the boat...except, Quentin himself. I don't really know if he's a good actor, because my view of him, knowing he as the director, is so tainted, he's featured fairly prominently here. It's not rare to have a director pop up in a tiny 5 second role, but it's prominent here. And maybe for me that just takes me out of it. Because I don't see Quentin as Mr. Brown, but ''hey thats the director!'' It took me out.Action and violence, well done, uniquely vibrant blood, which plays more into the fantasy than reality but also work pretty well as not making it too heavy. The violence for 1992 might've been much but it's alright.The story, and it's new perspective, I can appreciate. Being a aftermath movie in a way, is an angle you wouldn't really go for as it's not really the most exciting. But Tarantino made it exciting, and hats off to that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino arrives!!,"Given this was Tarantino's first film, his style of non-linear timeline and blood and gore was evident in his very first project. Overall, the movie is a decent thriller, but what stands out is the original depiction of the tense situation portrayed with some brilliant performances.Michael Madsen in his role imbued dangerous fun and eccentricity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best movie ever. Can't get any better than this.,"If you want to be entertained beyond belief than this is the movie for you. It's got so many twists and turns in the plot you'll be left drooling for more when the end credits appear. The cast, including brilliant actors such as Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, and the incomparable Quentin Tarantino make watching this movie the highlight of anyone's day, month, year, maybe even life!!  When I die I will be buried with this movie beside me, that's how good it is. If you haven't seen this movie, get to the video store immediately. This movie will enrich your life beyond your wildest dreams",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You already know...,"If you're looking at this movie, I'm sure you already know. It's a great movie. Granted it's not exactly your typical action, comedy, drama... But it is your typical Quentin Tarantino film (meaning great). This was the start of pulp fiction, kill Bill, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Inglourious Basterds, etc. And it's so funny that right from the beginning his style of garrulous characters who have nothing in common except their speech patterns spit out these at times obnoxious conversations. It's like ""what the hell are they saying in this situation?"" but that's what you love these movies for.You've got your normal nonlinear (Tarrentino?) style with a couple of twists thrown in to make it good. Stylistic violence, death and laughter all rolled into one. It's great seeing established actors in roles that they can really sink their teeth into. And the whole movie is like for locations. I mean from the ratings alone, not to mention the word of mouth, you know it's a good movie and for it to be told in such a concise way... Well, it's quality over quantity (quantity as far as everything but lines lol).There's not much else to say without giving away the movie. Even if you don't like it, it's just one of those films you have to see. It's a part of pop culture basically anything that's ever been referenced in the Simpsons you should want in your purview, part of your lexicon. That's all. Good night.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Bloody Brilliant,"Despite what critics think, this is a Tarantino masterpiece with unforgettable characters, smooth and cool dialogue, and a shocking finale.Since this is a crime flick, the plot and storyline isn't that complex or deep, and there is no reason for it to be. It's pretty simple. Perfect strangers plan the perfect crime, but end up in a bloody set-up. With only four of them left alive, they must uncover the rat in the house. But which one is it? That is something they must find out before the cops get a hold of them in this unforgiving and spectacular crime/noir movie.The writing is off the hook. Tarantino is a master when it comes to dialogue. Why? Because the characters talk like real people. In ordinary movies, all the characters ever talk about it the plot or scheme. In THIS movie, they talk about everyday normal things that we would talk about, which makes them seem more realistic and convincing. His writing reminds me a lot of Raymond Carver, except with more humour.The cast is terrific. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, and Steve Buscemi all did their roles justice. Michael Madsen is awesome and cool as Mr. Blonde, who will always be remembered for that very particular role. Buscemi is hilarious, and your eyes never leave his sight when he's on screen. But really, everyone is outstanding in this movie. 10/10 Outstanding.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough,"This film was the breakthrough of the best actor in the nineties : Quentin Tarantino(Pulp Fiction , Kill Bill).The film is like all Quentin Tarantino's films.Brutal and Bloody.The switching between the characters is done in a way no one else can.The beginning of the film is also superb with Quentin Tarantino himself talking me into another good day!It's so funny , I guerantee you!The end is also brilliant , even better than the beginning. The actors are good too.Especially Harvey Keitel is really nice. The sound is the best i've heard in a film of the 90's.It's so good.K Billy's Supersounds of the Sixties:-).I could go on a lot longer but I won't.This film is a good pick!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of my favorite action films EVER,"This is TREULLY one of my favorite action films of ALL-TIME because the writing is BRILLIANT. The transition between the warehouse and the stories about Mr. White, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange is FLAWLESS. The action is INCREDIBELY detailed and editing is CRISP and CONSICE. The acting is BRILLITANT each character has their moment to shine and the actors chosen for each character TRUELLY help the written words for their character stand out in each scene they are in. The lighting is also BRILLIANT because the scenes that need to be dark are DARK and the scenes that need to be light are LIGHT. I LOVE this movie so much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of my all time favourites,"Simply one of my all time favourites this is an out and out classic. So original this brilliant film has been quite often imatated but any imitator hasn't even come close to this. Its flawless in its script, acting, dialogue everything its totally and utterly flawless. And whats this about it being so shockingly violent,in the controversial scene which even though I'm sure you have all heard off I won't tell you what happens there, it dosen't actually show anything. This is basically the hippest coolest film of all time and one of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
