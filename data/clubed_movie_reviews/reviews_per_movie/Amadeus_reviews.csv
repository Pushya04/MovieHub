To give everything you have to music and come up short,"At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna, where Salieri is the court composer. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.Salieri,angry at God for honoring a profane ungrateful boy like Mozart while ignoring his own one desire to be a great composer, swears to destroy Mozart. The strange thing is, as long as Mozart is alive, Salieri is the honored composer, not Mozart, though this just seems to infuriate Salieri even more. Salieri seems to be the only person in Vienna who recognizes Mozart's talent. This just begs the question - why did it never occur to Salieri that being able to recognize something as valuable before anyone else does is a talent in and of itself? After all, in 1975 the second best thing to being Bill Gates would have been to have recognized his genius and invested heavily in his success. But I digress.The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness, and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
True Gem for Movie and Music Fans,"I'd like to point out a few facts before I review the movie. First of all, Mozart died at home surrounded by his family, pupil and a priest. Secondly, the plot of Amadeus is not exactly original. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote a short opera called ""Mozart and Salieri"" with the bare bones of the story and the identical characterization of the two composers, and he used Pushkin's drama for the libretto. So, the rumor that Salieri killed Mozart has been around for almost a couple of centuries though we all know there isn't an iota of veracity in it.That being said, Peter Shaffer's movie adaptation of his own play is still an astounding achievement. Have you ever seen a movie based on your favorite book and come out of the movie theater rather disappointed though the film version faithfully followed the storyline of the book? Amadeus is definitely not one of those movies. Shaffer clearly understands the difference between stage and film; the story is more elaborate in the movie, and some of the lengthy lines are replaced with more subtle images and close-ups.I'm often surprised to find that people don't get that Amadeus is the story of the fictionalized character, Antonio Salieri, not the real one, who adored Mozart's music but hated everything else about him. In other words, the movie viewers are seeing Mozart through Salieri's eyes. Needless to say, his view is rather slanted. If you have read Shaffer's original play, you probably remember he describes Mozart's laugh 'grating.' In the film, this annoying laugh becomes more symbolic. Though Salieri speaks in front of a Catholic priest, he is actually having a one-sided discourse with God. At one point, he declares, ""One day, I will laugh at you. Before I leave this earth, I will laugh at you."" But as he is wheeled out of his room by an aide at the asylum, what we hear is that screeching laugh of Mozart--or is it? It becomes obvious as we watch that this movie is called Amadeus because that's what Salieri wished to be--God's beloved.The movie might give some viewers who don't know much about Mozart a wrong impression that he was a cad, and it gives incorrect information on some of his music (e.g.; the count in The Marriage of Figaro sings ""Contessa perdono"" AFTER he learns that the woman dressed in the maid's clothes is his own wife. There's no mistaken identity here. Read the title of the song--Countess, forgive me!), but these are minor offenses. Though I am a die-hard Mozart fan, I can laugh at tongue-in-cheek references to Amadeus in other movies. My favorite? In Guarding Tess, a secret service agent tells his partner, ""He (Mozart)'s a jerk. One day, a guy shows up with a mask, and he drops dead.""What's not to like about Amadeus? The tale Peter Shaffer tells is gripping, the actors are first- rate, and, of course, there's music. The selection of Mozart's music in the movie is excellent; you can truly enjoy the beauty of his music no matter how much or how little you know about it. In case you are wondering, a little tune Mozart plays on his back and hands crossed as a penalty at a party is Viva Bacchus from The Abduction from the Seraglio, a duet for Pedrillo and Osmin. Pedrillo, while singing this song, is trying to get Osmin, the harem guard, drunk to help his master rescue his true love. No wonder Schikaneder calls it 'our song.' And the improvised version of Salieri's welcome march is actually a famous song, Non piu andrai farfallone amoroso, from The Marriage of Figaro.As I said, I'm a huge Mozart fan, so my rating may be somewhat biased, but what the heck, I gladly give ten stars to Amadeus. I watched it close to a hundred times over the years, and it still gives me a great pleasure every time I see (and hear) it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of those movies that you'll never forget,"I remember as a child, my sister told me to watch this film. That it was the best film she ever saw. I didn't watch it until I turned 10; finally I sat myself down and watched it. I fell in love with it.Based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played a terrific and hilarious performance by Tom Hulce. This also has the life of Antonio Salieri, a great and well deserved Oscar winning performance by F. Murray Abraham. Despite the story not being accurate, come on! This is a great movie that was a gigantic Oscar waiting to happen. Congrats to Amaudeus for bringing the beauty of classical music into out living rooms.The story is that we start off with an older and more suicidal Salieri who blames himself for Mozart's death. When a priest comes to ask Salieri to plead forgiveness to the lord and wants to council him, Salieri describes who he was and how music inspired his life, he plays a few notes from his opera's that were masterpieces, the priest just looks at him not knowing the music. Salieri just looks at him with a smile and says ""Ah, how about...?"", he plays Mozart's most famous work and the priest gets excited saying ""Oh, how charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that!"" smiling and knowing how it will please Salieri, Salieri just looks at him with a emotionless face ""I didn't. That was Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"" and you see the priest's embarrassment. Just great and a perfectly played out performance by Abraham and Frank.Tom Hulce gives Mozart this crazy and annoying yet nevertheless funny laugh that you can't help but laugh at it every time he does it. He brings such life to Mozart and an immaturity that I think some of us can relate too in being spoiled and always knowing you're the best at your talent. He marries Constanze played by Elizabeth Berridge and she does it remarkably well. Constanze is obviously the more mature one and is the only woman who can try to tame Mozart's crazy ways. When Salieri gets a little jealous that the emperor played by an under rated Jeffrey Jones, since he is the emperor's tutor, then the emperor demands more of Mozart and his music. Salieri vs. Mozart: on the next celebrity death match!""Amadeus"" is a fantastic movie that anyone could easily love and enjoy. It's definitely a must see for movie fans and anyone in general who is just looking for a good movie. This was the best picture of 1984 and it's well deserved, just trust me and the awesome reviews it's getting!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Patron Saint of Mediocrities,"Most films about composers- Ken Russell's ""The Music Lovers"" about Tchaikovsky and ""Immortal Beloved"" about Beethoven are examples- rely upon the cliché of the creative artist as tortured, neurotic genius. Perhaps we like to console ourselves for the fact that we are not ourselves geniuses with the thought that genius must be paid for in mental suffering. Of course, not all composers fit this stereotype- Haydn was stoical in the face of misfortune (including a miserably unhappy marriage), Rossini was a noted bon viveur and it was often said of Felix Mendelssohn that his forename (Latin for ""happy"") well suited his character. But when did you last see a biopic of Haydn, Rossini or Mendelssohn? ""Song of Norway"" told the story of Grieg, another composer who doesn't really fit the ""tormented genius"" label, but it bombed at the box-office.""Amadeus"", however, attempts to overturn this cliché with a vengeance. The Mozart portrayed in the early scenes is about the least tormented genius who ever lived, obnoxiously hearty and cheerful, without the slightest doubt about his own talents. The tormented character is his rival, Antonio Salieri, but Salieri is no genius; in his own mind he is a hopeless mediocrity whose talents pale into insignificance besides Mozart's.The story is told as a confession made by the now elderly, half- mad Salieri to a priest in 1823, long after Mozart's death, the earlier scenes being seen in flashback. As a young man, the deeply pious Salieri vows that if God will make him a great composer he will live a chaste, virtuous life and use his talents to God's glory. At first Salieri believes that his vow has been accepted. He quickly achieves fame and is appointed Court Composer to Emperor Joseph II. When Mozart arrives in Vienna, however, Salieri realises that the young man's music has a transcendent beauty which his own can never match.Salieri's attitude towards his rival is not one of simple jealousy. Were Mozart a man of his own austere, puritanical stamp Salieri would not resent him nearly so much. Mozart, however, is very far from being puritanical. He is not a bad man, but he is very young, and his are a young man's faults- brashness, overweening self-confidence, a bawdy sense of humour, a keen eye for a pretty girl and a lack of respect for authority. (Actually, those last two are not really faults at all). His most irritating characteristic is his high-pitched laugh like a braying jackass. In Salieri's eyes, however, Mozart is a vulgar upstart, a smutty, sex-obsessed boy. Salieri believes that God has cheated him, by denying him the musical talent he deserves and giving it to an unworthy recipient. (The title is an appropriate one; Amadeus was not only Mozart's middle name but is also Latin for ""beloved of God""). Salieri therefore plots a diabolical revenge against both Mozart and God.The director Milo Forman took the brave decision to cast little-known actors in the three main roles, F. Murray Abraham as Salieri, Tom Hulce as Mozart and Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's beautiful young wife Constanze. In each case, however, that decision paid off admirably. Constanze has sometimes had a bad press from biographers, but here Berridge portrays her as strong-willed but loving and kind-hearted.Both Abraham and Hulce were nominated for ""Best Actor"" Oscars, and it was Abraham who won. Good as Abraham is as the gloomy, saturnine Salieri, a man eaten up with obsessive hatred, I still think that Hulce should have beaten him. There is a remarkable contrast between the brash young jackass of the early scenes and the Mozart of the later ones- a more mature, serious family man who has learnt the meaning of responsibility and who is for the first time starting to experience worries- about his finances, about his health, about his career. Hulce's achievement is that he not only makes these two Mozarts equally believable but also indicates that they are not two distinct individuals but rather two aspects of the same complex personality. There are also good performances from Jeffrey Jones as the conscientious but bumbling and musically tone deaf Emperor Joseph and Roy Dotrice as Mozart's autocratic father Leopold.""Amadeus"" is not, and is not intended as, a factually accurate biopic of Mozart. As Peter Shaffer, who wrote both the screenplay and the play on which it was based, was well aware, there is no real evidence that Salieri was obsessively jealous of Mozart, and absolutely none to support the old legend that he murdered him. He was not in reality a celibate puritan- he had a wife, eight children and a mistress. Shaffer uses this legend as the basis of a fictional story which explores complex questions about the nature of artistic creativity and the relationship between man and God.The film, deservedly, won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1984; indeed, it is in my view one of the finest films of the eighties. It works on a number of levels- as a lavish piece of ""heritage cinema"" recreating the Europe of the late 18th century (the sets and costumes are particularly fine), as an intellectual exploration of philosophical issues, as a well-acted human drama, as a fictionalised study of a great man. The soundtrack is heavenly, but that is only to be expected, containing as it does some of Mozart's greatest music.The film has had a curious side effect. It could have condemned Salieri to perpetual infamy as a jealous minor composer who was supposedly responsible for the death of a great one. Instead, it seems to have led to a revival of interest in his work; he is certainly better known today than he was in 1984. Many musicians would now regard him as something far more than the ""patron saint of mediocrities"". God may have answered Salieri's prayers long after his death. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A movie of a genius, directed by another one !","I thought that it would be impossible to make a movie like this one! Peter Schaffer's original play inspired Milos Forman, the great czech film maker, that surprised the world with ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" (1975). The sublime, almost over-human performance by Frank Murray Abraham (the Mozart enemy and secret admirer, Salieri) is one of the keys for the movie success, mostly to it's depth. The perfect sense of timing by Milos Forman is admirable, he knows when to play wich music. All the scenarios: opera houses, palaces, streets, etc., are details absolutely harmonious! One of this classic secret was that Forman gathered ""the"" team, perfect team work.We can just admire it, laugh, cry, reflect, most of all, listen to it.

Amadeus Speaks for All Mankind,"In 1984, Saul Zaentz, Peter Shaffer and Milos Forman collaborated in bringing a truly remarkable life to the silver screen. The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, through the eyes of rival composer, Antonio Salieri. The film is complete with an insightful script (courtesy of Mr. Shaffer), magnificent acting, wondrous sets and costume designs, incredible choreography (thanks to Twyla Tharp), and, above all, the glorious music of Mozart himself.The movie of Salieri's life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.The priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father's untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how ""The Creature"" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of  music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri's heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.As the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions.The movie won eight Academy Awards in March of 1985. The only reason it did not win nine was that Tom Hulce was nominated for best actor instead of best supporting actor. He actually was in a supporting role, and in a strange twist of irony, F. Murray Abraham won the best actor statuette; citing probably the only time when Salieri beat out Mozart in anything.The movie itself was shot in Prague where Milos Forman said ""(It) is a gem because it's possible to pivot the camera a full three hundred and sixty degrees and never encounter a modern vision."" Very few new sets had to be built, as the scenes and buildings they found were quite often apropos to their needs.Amadeus works well on virtually every cinematic plane that exists. It is a masterpiece that must be viewed multiple times to receive what the film has to offer. The emotions of humanity, through the eyes of the troubled Salieri, indeed speak for all of mediocrity. He is their champion and their king.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Grrr...the history teacher within cannot allow me to completely enjoy this film.,"Sometimes, it's hard to be a retired history teacher. After all, when I see many historical films, I see the errors in the script--where the writers take HUGE liberties with facts. As a result, you would NOT want to go to certain movies (such as ""Pocahontas"") with me, as I invariably complain about the crappy writing and lack of historical accuracy. While ""Amadeus"" is a gorgeous film to watch, it is also a film you would probably not want to watch with me! While vaguely following the events of the adult Mozart's life, so much of the film is wrong--terribly, terribly wrong. And, in the process, the film does a terrible disservice to the memories of the folks portrayed in the film. To me, history is like a holy book--you don't just change it to meet your needs--but here in ""Amadeus"", facts just aren't particularly important. In the film, Antonio Salieri is a bitter, nasty no-talent. It's easy to urinate on his memory today--it's not like he has family members who will defend him after 200 years! And even worse is the portrayal of Mozart who is shown to be a two-dimensional man. On one hand, he's a musical genius. On the other, he's a blithering idiot whose laugh makes your skin crawl--and there's absolutely no evidence that this aspect of the character is the least bit like the real Mozart.Now if you completely ignore history, the film is good---very good. The sets and costumes are lovely and it looks as if you have been transformed back to the 18th century. It certainly deserved Oscars for Art Direction, Costume Design, Makeup, Direction, Sound and other technical categories. F. Murray Abraham is great as the conniving Salieri--even though he's very fictional. Tom Hulce, on the other hand, is so annoying at times with his horrid and piercing laugh that I could see why this film didn't result in him being catapulted into stardom. Without this laugh, he would have been MUCH better.Why couldn't they have just created a story about FICTIONAL characters instead of fictionalizing real peoples' lives? If this had been done, the film would have been exceptional in every way. As it is, it's a severe irritant to anyone wanting to know about the real life characters portrayed so badly in this film. And that laugh...that HORRIBLE laugh has got to go!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Great movie - rotten history,"This is indeed a very well-made movie but it is based on the extremely dodgy fiction that Salieri somehow caused Mozart's death. Most of it is absolute hokum including the portrayal of Mozart. Of course he was not the heavenly boy of a legend but neither was he the character portrayed here. He was of course a highly sophisticated man of the enlightenment. Scheffer appears to have thought that because Mozart wrote crudities into his letters to friends, he was like that with everyone. A totally absurd assumption. At least the film does not go as far as the play in that regard. So while there is much to enjoy here, there is also much that is total rubbish. For example, the implication that Salieri was celibate is complete nonsense as the man was married. He was a very respected composer in his day even though his music went out of fashion. Even as his works dropped from performance, and he wrote no new operas after 1804, he still remained one of the most important and sought-after teachers of his generation, and his influence was felt in every aspect of Vienna's musical life. Franz Liszt, Franz Schubert, Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart were among the most famous of his pupils. Not a bad legacy. Rather than being bitter rivals, Salieri and Mozart had a respectful relationship. The other point of the film which is ridiculous is the portrayal of Joseph the Emperor. He was actually a very fine amateur musician. So although it is a very entertaining movie it is rotten history and the problem I have this many people will take it as true. It is hokum.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hatchet job on Salieri,"In a telling scene, after Mozart has performed his genius work to tepid applause, Salieri, self-confessed patron saint of mediocrity, performs his to wild acclaim and receives a medallion from the emperor.That is rather like this receiving so many Oscars and so much praise.It is not a bad film, indeed it is often visually stunning, however at well over 3 hours it does flag in many places. The use of quite earthy American accents among the gentry of 18th century Europe is also somewhat grating (although this is what may have endeared it to the academy awards)however the real problem is the script.The script labours the same point of coarse genius versus pious mediocrity over and over. There is a curiously 20th century lack of deference to one's social betters (such as Mozart's wife constantly and annoyingly always referring to him as ""Wolfy"").But this pales by comparison to the hatchet taken to Salieri. The author has taken the real life rivalry and created a fantasy completely removed from history. Salieri had nothing to do Mozart's requiem or indeed Mozart's death. The true history is actually far more interesting than this fabrication.Salieri as written here, is a one dimensional villain. One almost expects him to be swirling a moustache. Of course this is merely a film, a piece of fiction. But since it deals with real historical characters, it does have a duty not to slander someone unfairly.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
my number one,"Now, this is my idea of a movie - spectacle, religion, sex, envy, and some of the most stirring music ever composed.  And it all seems so modern; a bad visit from Mozart's father is awkward in the same way as a bad visit with my own parents!  Here's a film that makes ancient history seem like yesterday, using the same trick employed by all classic films - solid characterization.It's a shame that so many of these actors never did much else, but maybe that's a blessing in disguise because it allows them to embody their characters without other movie associations getting in the audience's way.I was worried that the extended edition would hurt the film's pacing (most extended editions are a bad idea - the material was cut for a reason!).  But in fact, all of the restored scenes are excellent.  I should have expected no less!  Beautiful costumes, beautiful locations, beautiful everything...very fittingly, ""Amadeus"" stands above and apart from the mediocrity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Ravishing in sound and vision,"The unseen star of this film is the Academy of St Martin's in the Field, London. Buy the soundtrack and you will be rewarded with some of the most stunning music you can hear. Mozart's music excells with brilliant treatment and dies with a bad performance. And that, after all, is what the film is about. Without his music, Mozart would be lost in time, a fate that the narrator of the story, the composer Salieri, saw as his own. Ironically, while Salieri has indeed been completely overshadowed by Mozart, his music still survives and has its followers.But beyond the music this is an outstanding film. Set in the prettiest and most flamboyant century of the last millennium, it is visually stunning and the writer's portrayal of jealousy is perceptive. The casting of the Austrian King and courtiers, (indeed all the actors in this film) that Mozart needed to impress capture the gentility and courtesy of the time, and also subtly shows their growing indignation and impatience at Mozart's personality and behaviour; the presentation of Mozart as punk musician is probably the only failing in the film. As a theatrical device to show that genius can come in disastrous packages it succeeds well, but anyone with any historic sense of social ettiquette or manners will know that Mozart's sill y behaviour would be well wide of the truth, as might, perhaps, be the concept of Salieri as murderer-in-chief. Only in the final scenes is Mozart's brilliance as a composer truly explored in what amounts to a deconstruction of his final composition - his moving, uncompleted and poignant Requiem mass.Another unintended star in this film are the candle lit sets and theatres of the 18th Century; their operas and drama ooze a magic  that is lacking in the present world and which modern producers might well try to reintroduce; so lovely are these buildings with their flickering lights and theatrical techniques that one is left desperate to to seek out these rare theatres to experience them.This film leaves one breathless from its visual beauty, its magnificent score and the choreography, indeed, of the two together. Mozart's life had the air of tragedy, and his undoubted genius speaks to us now and forever. This film is a monument to the skills of the writer, maker, performers and, of course, Mozart's music. If you have not yet done so, see it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Perfect Film,"As of this writing, I have about 90 reviews on IMDb. I'd only began submitting reviews a few years ago, so the films I'd seen in the past were never reviewed by me.

"Big, fast, crazy, touching, and gorgeous. And with lots of Mozart. Superb stuff.","Amadeus (1984)A million reviews have been written about this deserving movie--and the big points are good ones. And debatable.One, the play was better. Maybe. The play couldn't use cinematic tricks for its effects, but the movie really took it all much further in movie terms. It's a movie, not an adapted play.Two, it's inaccurate. Yes. Of course. It's a dramatized movie based on an historic figure. The truths are plenty--the boy genius, the patronage, the music scene in general. The fictions are worth noting, mainly that Salieri didn't kill Mozart (there is zero evidence of this, just chatter). Salieri didn't transcribe Mozart's final Requiem at his death bed. And Mozart's wife didn't sound like a ditzy American. Of course.Three, the operas are staged in contemporary terms, like dry ice effects. The venues are appropriate, and in fact, Mozart's time is not that far from ours, not in the larger picture.Speaking of venues, the whole city of Vienna looks terrific--because it's actually Prague. Go to Prague now and it'll have the same effect, though without the gray severity. Yes, Mozart was buried in a common grave. Yes he died too young from still uncertain causes (see Wikipedia for a full rundown of likely options). And yes, he was pretty innovative and radical. And if not as silly as Tom Hulce's interpretation, still a renegade socially and musically.Is it a good movie? Yes, a great movie. Who won't like it? Well, people with an aversion for historical dramas might, but even here, it zooms with such crazy, fun, funny energy, I don't know why it wouldn't just suck people in. Eventually though there are short scenes that are basically straight opera, with some continuing story along the sidelines. If you hate hate opera, you might have to just marvel at the sets and crazy crowds.There isn't a bad actor here, or a bad moment, really. And the music, the music! It's wonderful. The performances, take note, are by the high water mark of Mozart performances in the 20th Century--Sir Neville Mariner leading his famed orchestra. Likewise, the opera productions are by one of the great talents of the era, Twyla Tharp. The director Milos Forman has a short resume but it's impressive, including ""Hair"" as a kind of precursor and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" as proof of some kind of higher ability. (Forman hasn't always been on target, though, notably with his highly polished but pushy and almost abusive ""Goya's Ghosts,"" which has a similar structure to ""Amadeus,"" building a large world around a true rebel artist.)Anyway, a marvelous movie, a truly lovely experience, beautifully filmed, intensely envisioned, and acted with aplomb (F. Murray Abraham is a wonder as Salieri, young and old). And it is layered with some of the most emphatic and resolved music ever written.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce's laugh,"The movie opens with an elderly Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) confessing to killing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). He used to be one of the great composers of Europe but has since been forgotten. As a boy, he was jealous of Mozart. He was delighted that his boorish father died. He works his way up to being the court composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) in Vienna. He is eager to meet Mozart but finds a flamboyant immature sex-fiend. Soon his admiration turns into jealousy of Mozart's Godly gift. Mozart marries Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge).Director Milos Forman injects a lot of energy into a period piece. Tom Hulce's laugh is infectious. However it's F. Murray Abraham that is the true driver of this movie. It's his jealousy and scheming heart that creates the depths for Mozart. His older self gives so much color to his disgust for Mozart. And the music is operatic. It is not just beautiful and grand but it's also hilarious. There's also special mention to Jeffrey Jones.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Absolutely brilliant!- funny, charming and touching, a masterpiece!","I adore classical music, and Mozart is one of my favourite composers. When I came across Amadeus in my local charity shop, I knew I had to buy it. I watched it, and I loved it from start to finish. It is true it is not necessarily a true depiction of Mozart's life, but I was so blown away by the quality of the acting, sets, costumes and music that I forgot about that. The film is just gorgeous to look at, Vienna in the film (Prague in real life) looks beautiful, but the sets and costumes are colourful and lavish. The music is utterly majestic, from the Marriage of Figaro, Queen of the Night(brilliantly sung in what is one of the most difficult colouratura arias ever), Requiem in D minor to Don Giovanni, it was a feast to the ears. The script I thought was of exceptional quality particularly during the finale of Marriage of Figaro(one of the most beautiful tender moments in any opera is where the countess forgives her husband), and the direction was very fine. As many reviewers have pointed out, this is more about the mediocrity and envy of Salieri than it is of the eccentric genius of Mozart, thus the story was compelling and intriguing. The acting is wonderful; Tom Hulce is excellent as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, yeah his laugh is a tad grating, but I loved the manic and eccentric interpretation Hulce gave. Elizabeth Berridge is suitably petite and alluring as wife Constanze while Jeffrey Jones is delightful as Emperor Joseph II. For me though, F Murray Abraham gave the film's best performance, for he was absolutely outstanding as Salieri. Overall, brilliant film, gorgeous to watch, amazing music and essentially a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An Excellent film of describing Mozart's life from wealthy with great fame that shatters in pieces,"Amadeus is one tremendous film. The acting was great. Tom Hulce did wonderful and I have only seen him once in a film and that was Animal House. The rest of the cast was great to like F. Murry Abraham did a terrific job in his performance. The music was brilliant, I have never seen a film with such great performances in their plays. I really did admire this movie, everything in it was very interesting and after I watched the film I did a little research on Mozart. The script and directing was superb and the cinematography was brilliant. I couldn't of asked for a better film than Amadeus. I'm glad I saw this film!Hedeen's outlook: 10/10!! **** A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The casting of Hulce was a problem for me.,"I am sure that casting Tom Hulce as Mozart was a great risk, but unfortunately that was the main thing that kept me from enjoying this movie. It wasn't all Hulce's fault, since there was a decision to have him insert an exceedingly irritating cackle at pretty much random points. Whoever dreamed that up must have really liked the idea, since there is one final cackle that closes the movie after all of the end credits have run. Hulce's attempts to act as an orchestra conductor were on a par with what you would expect from some untutored middle school student, what with gesticulations that mainly just kept the beat.Mozart was a musical genius who challenged the hidebound opinions of the times as to what was deemed acceptable. In that he is little different from early rock-and-roll stars. As presented he was a young, brash, free spirit (so at least the audience was spared the ponderous, agonized artist trope) with few endearing qualities. Granted, there seems to have been a large disparity between Mozart the person and his incredible music, but I cannot believe that he was quite the fool as what is seen here; the personality set forth was not credible to me. If only we had a time machine.There are some good things, like a couple of good performances. F. Murry Abraham is a standout in his subtle portrayal of Antonio Salieri. In this movie Salieri is a tragic figure. He was a popular and respected musician in the court of Emperor Joseph II. Beethoven and Schubert were among his students and I think Salieri gets somewhat of a bum rap in this movie. Solieri's torture was to recognize the difference between his talents and the pure genius of Mozart causing a serious conflict between jealousy and awe. I have seen this scenario played out in the workplace and it would have worked out for the best if the inferior party had just accepted that he was out-gunned; the results were unfortunate, as with Salieri. I thought that Jeffery Jones was particularly effective as Emperor Joseph II. He could walk the fine line between haughtiness and genuine feeling with aplomb.The staging of the opera segments is brilliant. In fact a movie with just extended opera segments, so presented, would be a treasure. As appropriate, Mozart's music plays a central role. But they never let it play for any decent length of time. Particularly irritating was the interruption of the staging of the final scene of ""The marriage of Figaro"" with a voice-over from Salieri. Couldn't they at least spare a few minutes to let the audience appreciate one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written? If that piece does not convince anyone of Mozart's genius, then there is no hope that that appreciation will ever be sparked. At least they had enough sense not to interrupt the Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem played over his burial. The brief scenes from ""The Magic Flute"" left me wanting more--the translation into English for those scenes was clever.The production is lavish and a delight to watch. The film deserved its Oscar for costume design--the costumes must have been a major expense. The filming is first rate with sets and architecture that created (at least for me) a feel for what 18th century Vienna must have been like. Some scenes were filmed in an opera house where Mozart himself conducted.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A terrible waste,"I saw Amadeus at the Cambridge Film festival. I was told it was the story of Mozart's life, was critically acclaimed and the pinnacle of the festival. How much was I disappointed, often irritated and by the end I felt thoroughly used and exploited by what I can only describe as a terrible, terrible film. But why? Well I was quite excited by the thought of a film about one of the greatest composers and musicians of all time, the potential to create really powerful film with some emotional and awe inspiring scenes accompanied by his most famous and rousing music was tremendous and, seemingly, obvious. Instead Amadeus chose to focus on how irritating Mozart the man was, and featured a few uninspiring scenes demonstrating his genius in composition. Good Will Hunting managed to make maths exciting, but Amadeus was given the most moving medium of all, Music, by one of the most incredible musicians who ever lived, and they made it more boring than dry paint that's been dry for a very long time.For such a critically acclaimed film I was expecting certain things. First was good music, but this was a taken. It was about Mozart, of course the music was good, it was Mozart. All they needed was Mozart's greatest hits playing in the background to be good! So I give it 0 points for the score, you want good classical music then buy the CD.  I would say that Fahrid Murray Abraham was very good as the narrator and main character, putting in solid performance. As far as the other acting is concerned the mixture of accents from Shakespearean English to Italian, German and inevitably American never related to the actual nationality of the character was enough for me to hate every performance, if I hear Elizabeth Berridge say Volfey in a German\American accent once more I consider suing for mental aggravation.You want good classical music with a complex story and impressive cinematography then watch 2001 A Space Odyssey. If you want the story of a flawed but fantastic composer then get Shine out on video, you wont be disappointed. If you prefer your musical period drama documentaries full of irritating actors, pretty costumes, tedious storylines and bits of opera then do watch this, and if you would prefer to while away your time for three mind numbingly boring hours then check out the directors cut. Amadeus, you owe me £5 and three hours of my life, I wont forgive you until I get them back. dan",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Dominant Best Picture Winner of 1984,"""Amadeus"" is a great film that is deep, thought-provoking, and overall exceptional.  The film deals with the last few months of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's (Oscar-nominee Tom Hulce) life, told in flashbacks by an old, washed-up musician named Antonio Salieri (Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham). Salieri tells of the genius, the ingenuity, and the insanity of the young musician who died mysteriously at the age of 35.  Salieri's jealousy may have led him to kill the young composer, but that is something that will never be known.  ""Amadeus"" is an interesting commentary that tries to fill holes in history and succeeds amazingly.  By mixing fact and probable fiction, the film-makers succeeded in creating a truly remarkable motion picture that is easily one of the best of the 1980s.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
My brief review of the film,"A lavish, highly enjoyable production, the film is one of the finest biopics ever made, not just because of excellent production values, or the mystery element about the title person's death, but because it brings more to the depicted section of Mozart's life than just that. The film brings up and dives into deep religious issues and how important such religious beliefs were in the eighteenth century, and also it brings up some ideas about the profane mixed with the sacred. The whole production is wonderfully set to classical music, and it is technically superb in every area, with very good costumes and editing, as well as some fine acting, particularly from by Jeffrey Jones, who is as delightful as ever as Emperor Joseph. Nevertheless the film feels a bit lively in excess at times, and it never quite feels like it is in Vienna with the mixed accents, but still it is a quite a stunning achievement and simply superb entertainment. The film deservedly won 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture. A director's cut of the film was released too, running an extra twenty minutes at no detriment to the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A well-done and memorable piece of work,"Not only did I enjoy watching this movie, but it also stuck with me afterward. In most respects it is well put together. The story if multidimensional and carries the viewer along well. The acting is superb; F. Murray Abraham as Salieri is flawless, Tom Hulce gives a fleshed-out portrait of Mozart's brilliance and his (according to the film) frivolous personality, and Elizabeth Berridge and the other principal actors put in solid performances too. The music works well with the scenes; my only complaint is that some of the opera scenes get a bit long. However, all in all this is an excellent piece of work. It is not historically accurate, but if one keeps that in mind, what harm can it do to appreciate its beauty?",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Stanzi shines in the Director's Cut!,"After recently purchasing the Director's Cut & viewing the film with the 20-plus minutes of added scenes, I really appreciate the character of Stanzi so much more.In the original theatrical & D.V.D. release, I believe that many people claimed that Stanzi's character really lacked depth, where as all of the other performances were great.In the newly released Director's Cut, there are a few scenes (most notably the Stanzi-Salieri seduction sequence) that add such a great deal of depth to the Stanzi character. For example, her distant behavior/bitterness towards Salieri (at the end of the film), her protection of her husband & his well-being, her humanity as a woman, etc. are so much more easily understood in this version. In the original theatrical/D.V.D. release not much was presented about her character; audiences felt that this was due to actress Elizabeth Berridge's shortcomings as a performer, when I feel that it was more of a lack of her character in the screenplay & some unfortunate cuts in the editing process.Bottom line: This could be considered the ""Stanzi Edition"" as she shines in her supporting role & brings so much more to the film than she ever had before... 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A tale of talent, jealousy and tragedy","F. Murray Abraham portrays Salieri, a hard working but mediocre composer driven mad by the arrival of a ``natural'' talent, Mozart (played by Tom Hulce) in a highly political environment.  The movie provides some crucial insights into the motivations of the characters, and shows both a superficial image and reveals deeper truths (e.g. Mozart appears to party all the time, but is actually a very diligent worker). I am uncertain as to the historical accuracy, but this movie (i) was entertaining, (ii) inspired a greater love and knowledge of Mozart's Music, (iii) dramatized the undoing of a great talent by both external forces and his own weaknesses (iv) has great costumes and music and (v) has a great supporting cast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Solid biopic or film masterpiece, depending on your perspective","There's no denying that this 1984 biopic, directed by Milo Forman and written by Peter Shaffer, is a great film. It's a story about the old adage -- life is unfair. In fact, just to demonstrate how unfair, it probably should have been entitled ""Salieri"", rather than ""Amadeus"", because its really the story of Salieri and his bitterness over the success of his contemporary. But, the average person is somewhat familiar with Mozart, so let's be commercial about entitling the film.If you are ""into"" classical music, there will be little to dislike about this film. You'll find a great story and lots of the music in which you revel. If you are not really into classical music, but are watching for the story, you may find the film a bit long with some sections highlighting the music (opera scenes) a bit lengthy. I'm the latter, but still, this film maintains your interest.One interesting aspect of the film is that Salieri tells the story of his rivalry with Mozart as a sort of confession to a priest, after the court composer has been placed in a lunatic asylum for attempting suicide. And, though brief, the scenes in the asylum are chilling. I think the technique of flashbacks in films is overused, but is perfect for the telling of this story, because it allows Salieri (Abraham) to narrate the story effectively, thus aiding in understanding his feelings and motives. It may be a little difficult for us to understand that Salieri supposedly saw his musical talents as a product of his devotion to God -- a different time, to be sure. Mozart's irreverent and lewd general behavior surprised me, and in the light reading I did after viewing the film, appears to be accurately portrayed. Hence the source of Salieri's bitterness -- God appears to have graced the rude and obnoxious Mozart with the talent, while nearly bypassing the serious efforts of the pious Salieri. I did find Mozart's childish squeal of a laugh quite entertaining. Salieri comes to believe that God is using Mozart's genius to cruelly laugh at Salieri. Hence, Salieri's plot to kill Mozart, though the latter actually dies from exhaustion (?) -- the film not clear at all about the actual reason for death (and does not make obvious the many medical struggles Mozart has through his life). Particularly considering the length of the film, I would have liked a couple of minutes more dialog by Salieri describing Mozart's funeral and burial...just to put it all in more understandable perspective -- why the anonymous burial in a mass grave -- common at that time? What's interesting is that both Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham were nominated for Academy Awards (the latter won), but neither went on to luminous careers in film. The film won 8 Oscars in all, and deservedly so.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Landmark historical speculation,"Amadeus presents a heavily fictionalized, speculative portrayal of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's last years, focusing powerfully on his relationship with Italian composer Anthony Saliere, and Mozart's wife, Constanzia. My review is based on first seeing the theatrical release in the theater during its first run, and then viewing the director's cut twice. In my opinion, the director's cut is a much better film, though the theatrical release would still earn an 8 from me.Do not approach this movie looking for some objective presentation of historic fact. Do not go into this film expecting to see a tribute to one of the world's greatest composers. Do not see Amadeus in order to understand the workings of musical genius. Inasmuch as all of these are incomprehensible - probably as much to those who lived them as they are today - Amadeus fails to achieve any of these laudable goals. What is does achieve - and quite well - is the blending of elements of Mozart's personality, aspects of his historical context, and an ingenious plot which is spelled out in a very clever narrative style. The truth you get out of Amadeus - as with most good historical fiction films and novels, is the truth of the feeling of a particular time and place.Amadeus immerses its audience in Europe's 18th century, but has just enough anachronism in its script to prevent losing its audience there. Mozart is a young prodigy who struggles with his own ego, over-sensitivity, arrogance, and self-destructiveness against a world which does not really know what to make of him. Salieri (Abraham) is his most ardent fan and admirer, but harbors a deep personal and professional jealousy, as well as an overwhelming self-centered guilt, and an even deeper conviction that his own perceived inadequacies reflect on his relationship to his creator. The third character, much better developed in the director's cut than in previous versions, is Mozart's wife Constanzia (Berridge) - seemingly the only fully rational and practical person among the principal roles. The film narrates the twists and turns of fate - the intrigues and folklore - which, even today tend to crowd out the facts of this part of Mozart's life.Hulce, playing Mozart in what is easily his greatest performance to date, utters a couple of highly anachronistic and off-color remarks in the course of the film. ISince I do not hold historical FICTION to some arbitrary standard of authenticity, I can say that my reaction to these was probably exactly as they were intended: (1) Either Mozart was so creatively explosive that he occasionally happened upon 20th century phraseology through sheer coincidence and/or (2) We are supposed to find these phrases a little shocking and they are used as plot devices to give the film a sense of surreality. Either way, the films works very well as a work of art and a good story, and what some describe as problems of authenticity are, to my mind, nothing more than artistic license. Most movies are not meant to be encyclopedic recitations of 'what really happened'. Keep that in mind before you commit to watching this. The only danger with regard to this film is that it is SO compellingly portrayed that some people are likely to walk away from it believing that this REALLY is what happened.F. Murray Abraham, who almost always does well, exceeds himself in this film, and well deserved his Oscar. Hulce is remarkable and the supporting cast are easily up to the task. The directing is subtle enough to be somewhat refreshingly unnoticeable, and the script and editing are excellent (at least in the director's cut). Very little can be said about the use of period music and costume which has not been said in the numerous awards and the high praise received from critics.This is a great film. Highly recommended for adults of any age.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Excellent in the director's cut, though still long.","Amadeus actually caught my attention, in parts. It has excellent performances from F. Murray Abraham as a semi-famous musician who is incredibly jealous yet fascinated with the prodigy Amadeus, played to utter perfection by Thomas Hulce (love that laugh). The theme of competition is one that director Milos Forman latches onto and gets enough juice and dramatic tension to pull off the epic nature of the film, both personal and extreme. Often quite good, however suffers from the overlong-ness and sometimes it is impossible to keep attention, however it snaps back every once in a while. Period detail and is to the dot. And the music makes up anything else I could want in a film. A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Ambitious and Contradictory,"'Amadeus' is arguably one of the most ambitious films of the 1980s. It presents a popularized account of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart following his arrival in Vienna from Brno, at the age of 17. His reception by his new patron, Emperor Joseph II, disturbs courtier and established composer Antonio Salieri, who becomes consumed with a burning, selfish passion to physically eliminate Mozart, while recognizing the latter's unique musical genius.Aside from adding considerable interest to an otherwise prosaic script, Salieri's confessional narration that guides the film provides the vehicle for a truly phenomenal performance by actor Frank Murray Abraham. Milos Forman's thorough direction augments Abraham's superb theatrical delivery, and is in turn amplified by the outstanding soundtrack furnished by Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields.Inevitably, most of the remaining protagonists fade miserably in comparison to Abraham, including the overacting Tom Hulce, as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Elizabeth Berridge, as Constanze Mozart -both complete with distinct Yankee and Texan accents respectively. This latter aspect is arguably symptomatic of a deeper flaw in the film, which subscribes to a somewhat Americanized version of W.A. Mozart's character, overstressing the composer's historically unfounded maverick and nonconformist traits. There is also little -if any- historical evidence of any schemes by Salieri against W.A. Mozart. Indeed, the film's commitment to historical accuracy appears to be exhausted at a number of pictorial shots of Vienna and the striking facial resemblance of actor Jeffrey Jones to Emperor Joseph II.Yet, the film's daring illustration of the many negative sides of Mozart's character, including his artistic arrogance and his self-destructive womanizing, is commendable, as is its achievement to popularize the music of one of the icons of Western musical tradition. Overall a satisfactory result, 6.4 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Mercurial Genius,"Long after his rival died at a young age and his world essentially obliterated by the Napoleonic wars, Antonio Salieri as played by F. Murray Abraham looks back on his life from the confines of an insane asylum. Everywhere the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is played and hummed familiarly by even the masses. Scholars study Salieri, the people from all walks of life listen to the notes that Amadeus put down for posterity.Amadeus is a wonderful recreation of the court at Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna during the age of reason. The Hapsburgs have now become the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine as a result of Maria Theresa becoming the first female monarch of their empire. The empire and the court are now ruled by her son Joseph as played by Jeffrey Jones.What I liked about the film is that author Peter Shaffer obviously researched with great care the period this rivalry between Salieri and Mozart takes place. Jones remarks on more than one occasion about letters he got from his sister Antoinette from the French court and what she's observing, but not quite understanding.Mozart is played by young Tom Hulce and in one of the few times that two actors from the same film got nominated in the same acting category, Hulce and Abraham were both up for Best Actor and Abraham won as opposed to both of them canceling each other out. It really would be hard to live on the difference in their performances, without a good Mozart and an equally good Salieri, the film would not be the masterpiece it is.And it did win for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman and a flock of other Oscars, all well deserved. Besides those already mentioned I think you will enjoy Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's long suffering wife and Roy Dotrice as his more staid and settled father who can't cope with a mercurial genius of a son any better than Abraham can.And Amadeus brought a revival of interest in the old classical masters and that's always a good thing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Genius? A Diamond In The Rough? Who? Mozart? Or This Movie's Director?,"What can you say about this movie's director, Milos Foreman? He is just simply superb at the itemization of complex human nature. The film, ""Amadeus"" is considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time! You would think that any director who lays claim to a film with such a stellar reputation would be at the pinnacle of his professional genius. The fact is, that in Foreman's case, he previously directed another film which has been critically earmarked as perhaps the most spectacular movie ever produced, that motion picture being: ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" Milos Foreman won the academy award for best director in '1975 for ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", just as he won the academy award for best director in '1984 for ""Amadeus"". Foreman takes a monotonously challenging approach to his films. I am convinced that this world renowned director could build a perfectly designed New York City skyscraper using only a pair of tweezers. This is how detailed Milos Foreman actually is! ""Amadeus"" was a simply remarkable movie which engages in a comprehensive biography of one of the most masterful composers of classical music in the whole history of all creation, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This movie depicts how Mozart did not even write the notes to his sheet music on script paper, he memorized all of the music which he originated !! That is just simply amazing! Clinically using the adjective, prodigal, for describing Mozart, would merely be a paramount utterance of understatement. The culprit to Mozart's vulgarity was due largely in part to his baroque environment! Mozart's corrupt candor cultivated a tailor made invitation for his spontaneity to allow his personality to open the floodgates for him to maximize his flourishing aggregate potential! The movie ""Amadeus"" purported an intensely vivid clarity for pointing out a great many of Mozart's talented attributes! In a time when Germanic culture carried an assertively chauvinistic aura with the world's paradigm, Mozart was convinced that if he was going to write an unequivocally marvelous opera, that this opera should be composed and expedited in Italian. The English translation for this opera was entitled ""The Marriage of Figaro"". The cerebral complexities to Mozart were simply astounding. The grass root recognition of ideological fervor which prevailed with the hierarchy during the period of nineteenth century Austria was portrayed with a very subtle disposition in this film! The rendition of Mozart's music which was performed by the Dallas symphony, and conducted by Edward Mata, was a compendium of Mozart concertos which I will emphatically categorize as marvelously top notch entertainment. When I was in Austria, while visiting Salzburg, I ate lunch at a restaurant which use to be Mozart's home. The plethora of Mozart artifacts in Salzburg were, to say the least, intellectually sensitizing! This enriching sojourn of mine became a reflective synopsis of how influential Mozart was to the entire spectrum of classical music. As a matter of fact, I became passionately imbued with an aesthetic appreciation for Mozart as a result of watching this film,!! Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart auspiciously revolutionized all of western civilization.The film ""Amadeus"" executes a successfully cogent expertise at illustrating Mozart as an aficionado with an artistic finesse and an unprecedented musical flair!! Winning the academy award for best picture back in 1984, this is just simply the introductory tip of the iceberg in terms of being an indicator of how wonderful this motion picture truly is. If you have not seen ""Amadeus"" yet, make it a point to do so. The acting is great, the cinematography is enlightening, and the directing, by one of the all time directors in the whole history of Hollywood film making, Milos Foreman, is totally sensational!! See this film!! Five Stars!! Perfect Ten!! No Question About It!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amadeus - Beloved of Gods,"Mozart is my favorite composer, I love his music, all of it - his symphonies, concertos, operas, Requiem, you named it. I've read many books about him; I try not to miss any concert where his music is performed. I know that ""Amadeus"" the movie is not exactly his biography, and his relationship with Antonio Salieri, with his father Leopold, with his wife Constanze Weber, with the Emperor Joseph II and with the court musicians in Vienna of 18th century, might not have been exactly like it was shown in the movie, and Mozart himself might not have laughed as Hulce did but I LOVE the movie. I've seen it many times and I still love it. It is about a conflict between a genius for whom to create was as easy as to breath, and a talent that realized that no matter how he tried, he can not be a genius. It is very easy to admire a genius from the distance; it is unbearable to be next to him and to realize that you never will reach the same heights. Admiration, contempt, hatred, denial, self-hatred and above all of these ""monsters with green eyes"" -divine music that will live forever, music oblivious to the dark passions, music that makes us feel the presence of perfection and harmony...Once again, ""Amadeus"" is not a biography, at least I don't see it as such. It is a work of fiction and a wonderful film that did not make me see a real Salieri as a villain. Having read many materials about Mozart and his time, and having listened to the music from his epoch, I have a respect for Salieri and his music which is quite charming.Amadeus - beloved of Gods and taken by them too early because those whom they love die young.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
the movie making you want more,"1. The Movie Making You Want More 2. When I heard about the film Amadeus, I was not very thrilled about seeing it. I didn't think I would be very interested or even like the movie in the end. As I watched the film I started liking it more and more. I feel this film deserved all the Academy Awards that it won. 3. Amadeus is a film about Mozart's life while in Vienna. Antonio Salieri is out to kill him because he is jealous of his success. The film starts out with Salieri in an insane institution looking back and telling a priest the whole story of Mozart. Mozart starts out in Salzburg, but soon gets kicked out of the town and decides to move to Vienna to further his career. With the help of the emperor of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Mozart is composing many various operas and writing symphonies. Mozart meets the love of his life Constanze and they have a child together. She is by his side the whole time, supporting him and praising him for the work he is doing. Mozart thinks that Salieri is actually trying to help him and one of his friends, but little does he know that Salieri is hoping that he dies. In the end, Constanze leaves him to decide and take some time away because Mozart has a very bad drinking problem. She eventually comes back, but doesn't come back to find the happiest thing. 4. I really enjoyed the film because of all the colors and settings. The settings were very broad and stood out. All the costumes and makeup were bright and catching of the eye. The scenery really used big props and had spectacular visual effects. The music was another big factor. The sound was enhanced to keep the viewer interested and wanting more from the film. When something bad was about the happen the music got really loud and the opposite when something good was about to happen. The transitions in the movie were very smooth. The movie didn't switch scenes really fast without warning. 5. I didn't really like how the film wasn't fully portrayed to the fullest. There were a couple things missing and things turned around to make the film more interesting. In real life, Mozart and Constanze actually had four kids. Salieri was not actually jealous of Mozart and he was famous at the time in composing his music. I didn't really like how the movie portrayed Mozart as being a bad person because he went out and partied all the time. This was what kept him going and focused on his music. It also wasn't portrayed well that his wife was nagging him all the time. 6. I really liked all the characters. The actors were all selected very well for playing the characters in this movie. I don't think anyone could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce. He had the serious times when it was needed and he had a sense of humor. I think certain audience members would be able to relate to certain characters. 7. I would love to see this film again and would recommend it to anyone. I didn't want the movie to end. I thought there was more to come and it just ended. You don't have to appreciate music to see this film. It has much more to offer and is a lot more interesting than someone would think. You also want to see this film to find out what happens at the end. This film is a must see. I would give this movie 8 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

disappointing biography,"I re-watched this film recently after many years, and my opinion of it hasn't changed. This is a terribly flawed, disappointing film that's unjustly considered a classic. It had great potential, a biography of the great Mozart seen through the eyes of a mediocre composer, but the result fails in many areas and leaves one confused and hugely disappointed. Everything about this film is top-notch except for one crucial element: the script. It lacks punch, it lacks heart, it lacks momentum, and it lacks any particularly memorable dialogue. The actors do their best with this below-par script, and so does the director and the entire crew, who deserved their Oscars, but the film really suffers from its by-the-numbers screenplay by Peter Schaffer. It's clear he's a passionate music-lover, but it's also clear he isn't able to construct a compelling narrative too. I've never seen the play, but I've heard it's better than this film. I certainly hope so. Somehow those moments that are intended to generate emotions in the audience never really pay off. We never feel like something horrible has happened, the events onscreen never really involve you, but make you hope the film will get better. Playing loud classical music on the background for dramatic impact may be effective for some, but not for me. However, the film is exceptionally well filmed. The cinematography, sets, and costumes make this a real visual treat, and the actors are all wonderful in their roles. And of course the classical music score makes for wonderful listening. With all these impressive elements, it's a shame that the film's core, the script, is so bland and uninvolving. No matter how good a cast and crew you've got at your disposal, if your script is mediocre, then your movie will be too, and AMADEUS is perfect proof of this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

From the very moment he first came on screen, groping after an equally miscast Elizabeth Berridge as his fiancée-wife, I knew I was in for a very rough ride; here I was only 20 minutes into this thing and already the leading lovers were utterly irritating ... and with 140 minutes left to go!Hulce looks like what he is - a 20th Century guy in a 1700's period white wig - and though she's actually over the age of 20, Berridge hardly appears old enough to play anything but his kid sister. Somebody should have told these two to lose their modern accents; Berridge loves to say ""gonna"" (""I'm not gonna marry you"") and she tells someone that ""only an idiot would ask Wolfie to work on that 'stuff'"". Oh well. All the same, I'd imagine that speaking in a proper 1700's dialect would have sounded even more out of date while delivering such silly dialog as this:MOZART: ""Here, everything goes backwards. People walk backwards and dance backwards and sing backwards and even talk backwards.GIRL: ""That's stupid"".MOZART: ""Why? People fart backwards...""How idiotic. But this is not limited only to these two bozos; even another character uses the modern expression: ""if you marry him you won't have a pot to p*ss in"". It also seems like the phrase ""kiss my ass"" was very popular back in the days of Mr. Wolfie, too.Enough about the dialog. There is still one glimmer of hope in all this mess - and that's F. Murray Abraham (who won the Best Actor Oscar) as Antonio Salieri. What very little there is to admire in this movie is solely owed to his interesting performance, and in the character himself. Maestro Salieri's overwhelming envy of his childish colleague's superior talents, and the gradual resentment he feels toward God for leaving him in the dust of mediocrity, is the only saving grace keeping the film from total ruin. It's a pity that this angle of the story was historical fiction, though.And then there was that giggle... that ever-present, idiotic giggle...* out of ****",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A triumph of genius,"""Amadeus"", while historically inaccurate in numerous ways, is a brilliant film.  Its central character is not a man but an attribute of man at his most remarkable: genius.  Mozart's genius was at the highest level, on par with Shakespeare, Michelangelo and Balanchine.  Forman knew this when he undertook translating Peter Shaffer's play.  Although most of the acting is on a very high plane, the actors themselves are not top tier, not should they be.  A famous, easily recognizable actor would have detracted from the central thesis that genius is greater than the one on whom it has been entrusted.  Mozart was, of course, deeper than the character shown in the movie, but no personal life could equal the extent and depth of the musical genius that flowed from this little man.  The letters he sent to his father show a remarkable sensitivity and depth of understanding.  However, they are not paradigms of literary greatness.  The immense contribution of W. A. Mozart lay in some of the most sublime music ever written.  Fortunately, the film gave us snippets of some of the real gems in the Mozart canon: the great C Minor Mass, the Requiem and ""Don Giovanni"".  Forman realized that no human being will ever be great enough or have the background to pen such masterpieces without intervention from elsewhere.  This is certainly true of Shakespeare as well.  So what we have here, ultimately, is a celebration of genius, that great gift to mankind that nearly always proves to be too much for the person who is chosen to manifest it to the rest of us.  Many thanks to Milos Forman for the wisdom to keep out of the way and allow genius to shine through.  In that sense, ""Amadeus"" is an exercise in humility.  Few films come across as blessings for those who experience them.  ""Amadeus"" is one such film.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Rock me Amadeus...,"For all intents and purposes, I have split this review/comment into two portions, namely the subjective and the objective.Let's begin with the subjective: I personally don't like musicals on the Silver Screen; they just don't work for me (I said the same thing about CHICAGO). And while I agree that this is not a musical per se, it does feature a lot of overly dramatic operatic pieces/plays, which brings me to my second point: I don't like opera. Maybe it's just me, but I just can't get into it no matter how hard I try. Thirdly, I'm not necessarily fond of period pieces, and have only liked a handful of movies of this type (most notably BARRY LYNDON and ATONEMENT). As such, I really did not appreciate this movie as much as I probably should have.Now onto the objective: The acting by F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce is simply extraordinary. Abraham (as Salieri) presents a character who is conflicted and troubled upon meeting Mozart, not necessarily because he hates him, but because he believes that God is teasing or mocking him by placing such musical genius into the hands of a disrespectful, idle, and roguish youth, while seemingly giving the pious Salieri nothing more than mediocrity. As such, Salieri is decidedly presented as the 'reluctant' villain whose guilt and jealousy and sense of divine betrayal constantly eat away at his conscience. The conflict faced by Abraham's character is evident in every scene in which he appears. Tom Hulce presents the prodigy Mozart as somewhat of a modern day 'rock star', living a reckless and carefree existence. It is a bit unfortunate that he had to contend with Abraham for the Best Actor nod, since it was a battle that he was never going to win.Biopics about artists are generally long and boring and do not succeed in connecting with the audience. This is where AMADEUS proves itself to be exceptional; it is not really a biopic and is in fact more of a story than a documentary, as Milos Forman and Frank Shaffer took some liberties with the storyline, resulting in a quite compelling story.Then there's the Music. I mentioned earlier that I am not a fan of musicals, but that doesn't mean that I am opposed to Music in Motion Pictures. On the contrary. I was quite curious to see how Mozart's music would fit into this film, and the end result was simply breathtaking. The musical pieces are not inserted at random in the film as I feared; instead each featured piece succeeds brilliantly in capturing and enhancing the overall mood evoked, and it is evident that much forethought went into the music selection.A final note about the title 'AMADEUS': this film could have been called 'MOZART' or 'WOLFGANG' or anything else that would indicate that the film is indeed about the legendary composer (as not many people knew that Amadeus was his middle name). Any student of language will know that 'Amadeus' loosely translates to 'Loved by God', and it is this concept that drives the film, as Salieri believes that God has forsaken him by blessing Mozart with the musical talents which Salieri believes he himself should have had. It is the resulting bitterness and jealousy that propel the story.This is a great movie overall, and a wonderful character study. It deserved the Best Picture and Best Director (a second for Forman after ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) Oscars in a relatively weak field that year (1984). Nonetheless, it is just not my type of movie and I find it difficult to give this movie more that 8/10 since it would seem that I am bending to the will of other critics, influenced by the 'popular' vote rather than my own. I give this film 3.5 stars (out of 4) since I believe that as an Oscar winner it should be seen and studied. This film will garner a spot on my 'Honourable Mentions' list due to the superb acting, direction, storyline, and music, rather than to the overdone and seemingly never-ending operatic segments. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Just upgraded my vote,"When I first saw this film I voted 9 as I wasn't 1000% smitten by it. But I have just seen it again and consider it one of my favourite films of all time. A feast for the ears and eyes. Mozart's music is, of course, incomparable. For a purists, not doubt, the speech-over some of the music would be annoying, but I found the soto voce comments helped to make sense of the pieces and to combine them into an integral part of the whole film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce shine,"I've just acquired a video of ""Amadeus,"" and I have a much greater appreciation for it now than I did when I saw it six years ago. I was filled with the urge to see it after watching ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" repeatedly, which stars Tom Hulce as the voice of Quasimodo. Yet, as I watched ""Amadeus,"" though Tom Hulce was exceptional as Mozart, it was F. Murray Abraham with whom I was most impressed. He is PERFECT as Salieri, and he does one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen in my life in this part. He plays his character in such a real and believable way that I was completely taken in by him. Also, so great is his talent, that it took me about five times of watching the movie all the way through (and checking the credits!) to realize that it was the same actor playing ""Old Salieri"" and ""Middle-aged Salieri"" throughout the movie. I recommend that you see this movie just of Abraham alone, though the entire thing is a masterpiece. I went out and bought a cd of Mozart's Requiem Mass after seeing it just twice! Overall, this movie is intriguing and entertaining, and the actors are perfect. No one could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce, and I don't think I have to mention how amazing F. Murray Abraham is as Salieri again. I give it a 10/10. Simply fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
overrated,"It is not a bad movie, certainly not a masterpiece as claimed by most people in this web page either. In total it is mediocre and forgettable. I really prepared to like it. I love this kind of theme: 'the burden bestowed together with gift. By the end you are not sure how to look at a genius mind: a blessing or a curse.' But it turned out to me a major disappointment. I was most deeply let down by the portrait of Mozart. I wouldn't have mind it so much if the movie hasn't kept on pressing the point via the statement of Salieri: the contradiction within Mozart - God's voice from a unworthy man. The movie totally failed itself in this aspect. On one hand Salieri went on and on with how magnificent and brilliant Mozart's music is that my head starts to ache. On the other hand Mozart has shown himself as a funny, sincere, self-confident man, cute and cuddly, with an off-beat laugh, a loyal son, a tender husband, simply an example of morality. It is a mystery that how come he didn't become the most popular man in Vienna. So many other works have done it much better, 'moon and six pence' and 'shine' to name a few, over the dark anti-social side of genius that 'Amadeus' in corporation only offered a very pale and shallow endeavor. Another thing bugged me is the other main character Salieri. He blamed himself to madness and tempted suicide. For what? What EXACTLY had he done to Mozart? True, he has not been a true friend to Mozart. Is that the reason Mozart died? No way. Those little tricks he had applied to harm Mozart, did they succeed? You better be kidding me. From what I can see they either missed miserably or by the unexpected turn of events helped Mozart instead. He hated Mozart and wished him dead, but that didn't make him a murderer. The director overdid the contrast between the two main characters and massed it up. And, the maid, played by the one of the ladies out of the sex and city. What an annoy! She lamenting 'Oh I am scared!' For what! and tears over Mozart's death. Again, for what? When did she grow so emotional over Mozart? What the director was thinking, did he forgot the story? Everybody hates Mozart, right? In conclusion, everything is pretty lame here, plot, direction and acting. Only recommended if you are an opera nut. Otherwise, skip it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Amadumbus,"Amadeus is a movie on the life of the legendary composer Wolfgang Mozart. From a very young age Mozart has had a gifted ear for quality music. Among other things Mozart carried a horrible attitude toward anyone who tried to counsel him. He was very immature, and irresponsible in a number of ways. He had many adoring fans but the fame and attention goes straight to his head. Not even the kind words of his lovely wife could take him off of his high horse.From the very beginning of the movie, Mozart was shown as a very childish young man. Not only was he childish, but he was also disrespectful. There was no one above him as far as people to respect. His father tries to steer him in the right direction but goes with no success. After being banished from his original home he seeks redemption in a new country. He goes to try and conquer another city with his remarkable musical talents.The film itself was well written and well executed. The music was good and the majority of the actors fit their roles very well. Costumes and makeup were perfect; they really did a great job of giving you an idea of what people looked like in those days. The overkill wigs and the extreme dresses put me in the mind set so I could better understand the setting.The major cause for my overall dislike of his movie was the character Wolfgang Mozart. The fact that Mozart was so obnoxious and immature made me happy to see the conclusion. His humor was never funny, his laugh was brain wracking, and his arrogance was angering. The only thing good about Mozart was his ability to crate music. I have no sympathy for people with his character.For people who are interested in the life of a legend this would be a great movie. The director got the story right. The actors brought out the characters very well. The character Salieri was played very well. For the most part his is an overall good movie. I would rate it 4 out of 5. My personal opinion toward it is skewed off of my strong dislike for the character Mozart. Not everyone else may feel as strongly as I do but the movie itself was impressive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Amadeus,"When the two worlds of Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart collide in Milos Forman's Amadeus, it is anything but a symphony. As the court composer of the Emperor of Austria, all Salieri desires are fame and recognition as a composer; it is all he had wanted his whole life. When he learns that Mozart, whose name he had known as long as he can remember, is going to come to the court to play, Salieri cannot wait to meet the outstanding and righteous man that he knows he must be. However, when Salieri learns that Mozart is a young, crude, and unrefined young man, endowed with all the talent and ability that he ever wanted and strived for, it plants a seed of jealousy that soon grows into bitter resentment and hatred, not only for Mozart, but also towards God. Salieri's desire to get rid of him is seemingly boundless as he plots and schemes for Mozart's demise. It is no wonder why Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with 5-Star performances by F. Murry Abraham as Antonio Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart. Amadeus is an emotionally charged and tragic piece, a story of the life of one of the world's most famous composers, as seen through the eyes of his worst enemy.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Today's artists get paid millions for singing songs that most of them don't even write, yet Mozart composed more than 600 pieces of music in his short 35 years of life, probably earning less than what he was worth.

That level of character development gives the viewer an interpretation for EVERY look on F. Murray Abraham's face, and not to mention, an intense connection with the story.  After all, this is Salieri's movie, not Mozart's.This film is packed with movie moments that grip you, and most of them involve scenes showcasing Mozart's music.  I am so happy that Mozart's beautiful catalog of music is associated with this top-notch film, even though the story is fictional.  However, you know that there was at least one composer who recognized Mozart's pure genius, and professional envy is a common vice.

"One of the best movies ever made by a genius, Milos Forman.","If you look back at Forman's passed movies, you think essentially of one of them, that movie being the all-time classic ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"".  But you can't overlook his second masterpiece, ""Amadeus"".  Although not quite as excellent as his previous classic, Forman's tale of jealousy and tragedy plays out as well as it could have.  Plus, a terrific performance by F. Murray Abraham and a terrific script kept the movie as good as it could be for its complete running-time.The movie's opening scene consists in the camera filming two servants running over to their master's room whom we hear yelling.  After they break into the room they realize that their master, Antonio Salieri (Abraham), has tried to commit suicide for his neck is slit.  However, he is saved just on time and taken to a hospital where a priest comes to see him offering him forgiveness.  However, Salieri uses the priest as a witness to his tale of the murder of Amadeus (Tom Hulce).The movie shows all the facts that made Salieri hate Amadeus all the more as well as the trouble Amadeus could get into and his difficulty to make end's meet also.  You finally see how Amadeus dies, according to Forman naturally, and why Salieri blames himself for the murder of the composer.Between the directing, the acting, the script, and the costumes, there isn't much Forman doesn't include.  Of course, the music is better than in probably any other movie.  But I think that what impressed me the most about this movie is Abraham's truely beautiful, convincing performance.  It's a shame he hasn't played in any other great movies since because he is a tremendous actor.  But the bottom line for this movie is this: See it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Flawed Musicians Do Bad Things In Pursuit of Immortality... with Lovely Costuming,"Aware of this film's stature, upon my first view in 2021 (the Director's Cut) I have to say I am quite disappointed. It's by no means bad, but not the masterpiece I was expecting.As many reviewers have noted, this is not a film about Amadeus and should not be considered a biopic. Rather it takes the already dramatized relationship between Amadeus and supposed court ""rival"" Salieri and uses this as a platform to explore one man's drive for excellence. So, akin to films like 'Whiplash' and 'Shine' that see obsessed musicians collapsing under their pursuit of perfection, this films looks at Salieri and his actions following the crushing realisation that he is not in the same league as Amadeus, and his seeming rejection/betrayal by God. To that end, we see Salieri double down on his godlessness and bitter envy, mounting a campaign to craftily manipulate those around him to bring about the slow tortuous downfall of Amadeus: however, all of this is narrated by Salieri himself from a sanatorium, well established as an unrealiable narrator steeped in guilt. The film never really quite gets under his skin and so we are left with little additional insight into what drives his jealousy to such great heights and the whole film plays rather like a lavish soap opera.As a period piece, it doesn't strive for authenticity (just 5 minutes of dialogue, American accents and the frat-house dynamic of the king's court are enough to establish this) but it does pull out all the stops in terms of style and visual sumptuousness.All-in-all, I was entertained throughout the 3 hours, which is an achievement for any director, but the experience was much like eating a Ferrero Rocher: it looks sophisticated, but really it's just being made in a factory with all the other Mars Bars, Twixes and Double Deckers. It's enjoyable while it lasts, but offers little in lasting nourishment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A classic profile of the creative persona!,"Yes, Amadeus is funny, sad, musical, romantic, and even sexy; but its real value (IMHO) lies in what we can learn from it about the creative temperament.

Amadeus can easily be viewed as a tragic-comic essay on the artistic personality in general. It was this focus that made it such a valuable learning experience for me. It will remain on my personal top ten list of rewarding film experiences.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Salieri's Story, Not Mozart's","""Amadeus"" is one artist's approach to solving the many mysteries of young Mozart's life, including the now-mythologized circumstances surrounding his early death at the age of thirty-five.Interestingly enough, the film was more of a character study on Salieri, a Composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The film opens with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in an asylum after attempting suicide, asking for forgiveness for murdering Mozart (Tom Hulce) in 1791. His story; his confession; this film, is told to a priest by the name of Father Vogler (Richard Frank). ""Amadeus"" takes place primarily in Vienna, from 1781 until 1791, when Mozart dies. Through Salieri's words, we are able to see Mozart as he is (supposedly) when away from public eye, and the picture is less than ideal. Mozart, although still an undeniable genius and musical prodigy, is also immature, rude, selfish, and has no respect for his wife, children, family, nor anyone else in society.It goes without saying that the accompanying music is phenomenal. Mozart' compositions are essential and forefront enough throughout the entirety of the film to be considered a character. The costume design, period production, mise en scene, etc. was all exceptional. However, I could hardly watch the film because of Mozart's character. Especially his laugh. To make this worse was the fact that this was all in the director/writer's imagination. Yes, this is historical fiction. And I understand that not all facts portrayed in the film need to be historically accurate. However, although this has been perfectly fine for me in other films, in this film, it simply did not work. I really wanted to like this film, I did. But I could not. I had to force myself to watch most of the scenes, saved purely by beautiful costumes and melodious compositions. I found myself hating Mozart, but why? I should rather hate the Mozart this film has created!As I said, thankfully this was more Salieri's than Mozart's plot, and Salieri, although far from lovable, was a watchable and complex character. Although he idolizes Mozart's genius, he hates his character, and struggles with this up to the very last moment. And, really, that is precisely how I felt.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An insult and mockery of a musical genius.,"Wow. I've just read dozens of pages of rave reviews about how this movie was awesome, the best, amazing, and yes, even incredible. Are you serious? Most likely this is because they were no doubt impressed by the score which featured masterworks by one of the greatest musical geniuses in all of history. Or, perhaps this was their first exposure to music of this caliber.But to anyone who knows the real historic truth about Mozart, these raving positive reviews are the equivalent of these uniformed reviewers wearing a t-shirt that says in big bold letters: ""I know absolutely nothing about music history"".Of course, any complete novice of classical music would be impressed by a totally fictional and insulting movie about Mozart simply because of the music. And the obvious fact, they don't realize that what they are watching is pure fiction, ignorant to that it is revisionist history, and to anyone who knows who Mozart really was, an offensive insult.In reality it's a film that exploits Mozart's music in order to win over the uninformed, and then proceeds to fill their heads with a mockery of who the man really was. The result is the masses, who know nothing about Mozart, go away impressed by his music but believing a fictional mockery as the truth. It uses his creative works to perpetuate a mockery of the genius who composed them. Sad, really sad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Great music, slanderous ""history""","After not having seen ""Amadeus"" for many years, I impulsively bought the director's cut edition which was on sale at the local wholesale club. It is everything I remember about it.First the good...The score is wonderful! As noted in the bonus materials, the music - all Mozart's and not adapted - actually becomes another character in the movie. It's glorious! Milos Forman also made the conscious decision to use a variety of Mozart's music and not just a few familiar pieces and it adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the movie. Of course, the other can work well as well - e.g. ""Elvira Madigan"", where Mozart's 21st piano concerto became ""the Elvira Madigan theme"".The direction and cinematography are gorgeous and impeccable. This is a beautifully-crafted film which invokes a great sense of time and place.Now for the bad...The myth of Salieri's murder or attempted murder has been around since the time of Mozart. It's the sort of juicy story that just develops a life of its own, despite all evidence to the contrary. It's unfortunate that it has been perpetuated by so many - from Mozart's time to Pushkin to Shaffer. TheMozart's portrayal as childish and vulgar is inaccurate. He had a sense of humor and fun. Sometimes his sense of humor was vulgar in interaction with those closest to him, but he certainly knew how to conduct himself as a professional in public. In the movie, he is depicted as both immoral and an alcoholic toward the end of his life. Affairs have been speculated, but almost anyone who draws public attention has to endure such speculation, true or not. In Mozart's case, there is no serious evidence to back up the gossip. Certainly, he was not a drunkard! Also, although he was certainly not wise in his handling of his financial affairs, he was just as surely not without students and lived quite comfortably for most of his adult life.Salieri's portrayal as a mediocre composer is also wrong. Salieri was certainly in the shadow of Mozart, but he was a talented composer of mostly operas (unlike Mozart, Salieri rarely composed instrumental music). Had Mozart not lived at the same time, Salieri would certainly have been better known, but then the same could be said of almost every contemporary composer. It's worth noting that Salieri's students included Beethoven and Liszt.Costanze's portrayal is closer to the truth, but still misses the mark. By all accounts, she was a devoted wife and Mozart was devoted to her. She certainly did not leave for ""the spa"" when he was sick. The backstory of her as the daughter of Mozart's landlady ignores the fact that she was the younger sister of a girl Mozart had wanted to marry when he and his mother were in Paris. The older sister eventually became famous as a prima donna and spurned him. Mozart remained in good terms with the family and was boarding with them in Vienna when he and Costantze developed into a couple. Leopold Mozart was opposed to the marriage mostly because the family had a reputation for what we would call a Bohemian lifestyle.Leopold Mozart's portrayal is more accurate, but then his isn't a fleshed-out character in the show. Leopold's relationship with his son was complex and, after the death of Mozart's mother, increasingly strained. The motives imputed to him by the script are not only wrong, but over-simplified. One thing we do know for sure is that it was not Salieri that commissioned the requiem mass. Count Walsegg-Stuppach was the mysterious ""man in gray"" who intended to pass the work off as his own.While I enjoyed the movie enough to give it an 8 rating, it's unconscionable to think that many people may accept its slanders as truth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A masterpiece in every sense of the word.,"""This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God.""As I sat there breathless staring at my screen watching this astounding masterpiece while listening to its amazing soundtrack, I couldn't help but relate to F. Murray Abraham's Salieri in his admiration for Mozart and his genius, although my admiration was geared towards Milos Forman's outstanding direction and not on the actual composer himself. What a unique experience this three hour film was for me. Amadeus was a movie I had been putting off mainly because of its extremely long running time and its subject matter: a biopic about a classical music composer, but what a pleasure it was to finally get to experience it for the first time. My concerns about this film couldn't have been so far off because this was such a rich treasure to discover. Amadeus is a timeless film, directed in 1984, it could just as well have been directed today and you wouldn't notice the difference. Everything from the art direction and the set pieces, to the costumes and makeup, to the cinematography could rival any film released this year. I still can't believe this was made in 1984 because it is better than most biopics made today. Just as the central figure of this movie was such a creative and talented composer, Forman proved once again to be way ahead of his peers and was a prodigy director during the 80's. I thought there was no way he could top his marvelous work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but he just did. To say this is one of the biopics ever made is an understatement, because it is one of the best films period. Roger Ebert couldn't have said it better in his review when he wrote, ""the film is constructed in wonderfully well-written and acted scenes -- scenes so carefully constructed, unfolding with such delight, that they play as perfect compositions of words."" Winner of eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, the Oscars oddly awarded the more deserving film that year.Amadeus couldn't have a more suitable and meaningful title, taken from Mozart's middle name which in Latin means ""loved by God,"" the film explores the tormented relationship he had with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), the court composer of Austrian Emperor, Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). Salieri was so passionate about music that he begged God to make him the best composer the world had known by promising to remain chaste and devoted to Him. We learn this during a confession he is giving to Father Vogler (Richard Frank) after having attempted to commit suicide and confessing to being responsible of Mozart's death decades ago. The film is told in flashback as Salieri narrates what an impression Mozart had made in Vienna during his youth. He was eager to meet this prodigy who God had blessed with such an immense and unique talent, but when Mozart (Tom Hulce) is finally invited to perform at the Emperor's court, Salieri is shocked by what he discovers. Mozart is a childish and vulgar fellow with an obscene giggle that only seemed to mock everything he believed about God's immaculate and pure music. Feeling betrayed and confused as to how God could allow this hideous being to be blessed with such an amazing talent, he makes it his personal vendetta to defy God and bury Mozart's career.The film centers on themes of artistic genius and creativity as well as professional jealousy and uncomprehended talent. The universal theme of man against God is also tackled throughout the three hour runtime. These themes are perfectly explored and balanced with comedic moments scattered throughout, which allow the pacing of the film to move at a pleasant beat. Very seldom do you find such a perfectly balanced biopic that manages to remain comic and tragic at the same time. Some of the success of Amadeus must be attributed to the gorgeous location in which the movie was filmed. Choosing Prague to depict the mid 1700's Vienna was a perfect choice and the stages where the Opera scenes where performed were simply mesmerizing. Forman also allowed his actors to retain their American accents which was another intelligent choice. There is no need to give the actors silly English European accents if you are going to have them speak in any other language other than the original. The screenplay adaptation of Peter Shaffer's Award winning stage play was also a hit because the dialogue in this film is truly inspiring and I can recall several great quotes from it.The two lead performances in Amadeus are incredibly powerful. F. Murray Abraham took home the Oscar for best lead actor and he will forever be remembered for his role here as the frustrated and jealous Salieri. The inner conflict he experiences as he easily goes from admiration and bewilderment to hatred and jealousy while listening to each composition is outstanding. Tom Hulce is just as great playing the titular character. Never in a million years would I have cast him in a role like this, but it only added to the underlying theme of looks and talents not always going well together. Hulce's cheerful and giggly demeanor slowly grows on the audience as he is first presented as an irritating figure, but gradually begins to appear more sympathetic, and our initial alliances with Salieri begin to turn while he grows darker. I could go on writing about this amazing film, but I feel no matter what I have to say about it, it's simply going to be another mediocre review of an incredibly masterful film. There are no words that can justly describe this film, so by all means if you haven't seen this masterpiece go check it out.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A perfect film,"Quite simply, a perfect film - the only one (of many hundreds I have seen) that I would rate10/10. Characterisation and plot are superb; casting and acting are excellent. The film has been brilliantly adapted from an exceptionally good stage play. The plot is gripping, building up to one of the most moving finales one is likely to see. And on top of this there is the music, and the sets. Having just visited Prague for the first time, I was delighted to find that it is just as beautiful as I imagined it to be (after watching Amadeus). The Director captures the city perfectly, and it becomes a major player (rather like the Nostromo in Alien). It is hard to imagine how Amadeus could have been improved (and I don't think the 'Director's cut' is better than the film as it was originally released).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
As Good a Film as Mozart was a Composer,"This is a film that tells its story so well that there is no need for another version of it. After seeing this film, I have no desire to see another Mozart film. This one gave me everything I wanted. Such is not to say that another great, original Mozart film could not be made. I have too much trust of the creativity of the human race to not believe that. There is just no purpose in doing so. There does not need to be more LOTR films, there do not need to be more adaptions of To Kill a Mockingbird, and there do not need to be more movies about Mr. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.If Forman's other great movie, OFOTCN, is a gloriously humanistic and smartly rebellious, if more than slightly manipulative, knife of a movie, this one is an over-the-top, stylistic, creatively- flourishing, operatic broadsword of an epic. This is the kind of movie that is not just made by a the mind of a director but by his very soul. OFOTCN is 'directed by Milos Forman.' Amadeus is a 'Milos Forman film.'The film mostly takes place in late eighteen century Vienna. It centers around the lives of two men; the eponymous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played expertly and to an Academy Award nomination by Tom Hulce, and Antonio Salieri, played expertly and to an Academy Award win by F. Murray Abraham. The former is depicted as a boorish brat and playboy who can nonetheless compose some of the finest music ever heard by human ears, the later as his opposite: a dedicated musician who is nonetheless consigned to be 'the patron saint of mediocrity.' We follow Salieri and go through his eternal misery of being one of the few people in the world who can fully appreciate Mozart's talent yet being completely unable to replicate it.Yes, if you check actual historical accounts, Salieri was not as antagonistic towards Mozart as he is in the movie. But that's not the point of cinema, something that a lot of so-called 'movie fans' don't seem to understand. Yes, I respect and am a fan of Schindler's List and the like. But realism and staying true to actual events is about as essential to a successful film as massive car chases.Film is about feel. Film is about emotion. Film is about style. Film is about characters. And in all these respects, this film soars. Watching this film is like being an opera at one of the old opera houses of the Old World. The watcher is taken into a world of magic. Not Harry Potter-style magic; there are no magicians casting spells. And not abstract, surreal magic either; there are no volcanoes erupting out of nowhere and covering the world in stylistic lava.No; this is high-quality stage magic. When I watch this film, I feel like it has gone up to me and said it was going to entertain me like I had never been entertained before and that I had agreed, giving it my time and my imagination, letting it do with them what it pleased.And it never disappoints. You start trusting the film, building a relationship with it. It starts to become that rich, adventurous friend we all wish we had, one who would take you with him on his trips around the world. And though this film is by no means a 'perfect movie' (I hate that term, by the way), it never fails you so egregiously that the trust you have formed with the film is broken.Every part of this film succeeds all the way through, from the acting to the cinematography to the plot to the near-entirely Mozart- composed soundtrack. Like many of Mozart's compositions, it flows so smoothly yet gloriously that you are both dreamily carried along and strikingly aware of the greatness you are witnessing.My favorite of these aspects is the character of Salieri. Though there is no doubt that he is a villain protagonist, he is also one of the most tragic and unique figures of film. His struggle manages to be both operatically grand and deeply personal. I, for one, was impacted by it on a level that most films cannot even comprehend. I think that in a way, we all feel that way about the geniuses we encounter in our lives.And while I chastise movies for fulfilling simple fantasies, I applaud them for creating characters like this, who are in ways personifications of some of our deepest feelings. Though he knows how idiotic the king is for declaring that Mozart uses 'too many notes' (one of my favorite quotes, by the way), he is still wanting the young prodigy to be taken down a peg. He knows that if he had been born with Mozart's gifts, he would have been as famous, if not more famous than his nemesis. But alas, he is not.There is a scene in which an elderly Salieri play some of his compositions and asks if the priest who has come to hear his 'confession' has ever heard of them. He shakes his head 'no.' Then Salieri plays one of Mozart's pieces and the priest instantly recognizes it. Whether you have seen this film or not, there is no doubt that Mozart was on a different level. So, too, is this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mozart:Great This movie:not great,"Honestly are people reviewing Mozart himself or this movie? I can't figure any other reason it gets an 88/100.I've never watched a movie where I cared less about any of the characters. None of them seem remotely recognizable as human beings despite taking the liberties with historical inaccuracies.Most disappointing is that for a movie about one of the greatest composers of all time the audio is a big let down. It's just a seemingly random order nonstop soundtrack that feels flat. I'm still waiting for that moment that would make the hair on my neck stand up.Can't quite put my finger on why all the opera scenes felt completely unrealistic but I did notice the lip syncing is awful, and the sets look like they are all made of styrofoam at a local high school.Someone needs to make a good movie about a classical composer so everyone can come to their senses as to how mediocre this is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The best movie of 1984. Among the best films of the 80s. Among the best films of all-time.,"While 1984 box-office-wise was dominated by Beverly Hills Cop and Ghostbusters, there is one film that rises above them all in terms of quality by miles upon miles. Amadeus is an excellent and superbly-crafted film that is most likely the greatest stage-to-film translation in the history of film-making. Combining exotic and fascinating sets with great cinematography, flawless acting, grand writing, great directing, and a well-picked soundtrack to blend it all together, Amadeus is a visual treat full of deep themes that will move and question your soul. The effort involved is most likely the reason why mainstream audiences believed that everything that happened in the film actually happened, when in fact it's based off of a popular play. In this tale about religion, greed, envy, music, passion, and love, there is an overwhelming amount of material presented in its above-average running time. Calling this the best movie of 1984 and one of the better movies of the 1980s isn't a stretch at all.Amadeus starts off with an elderly and bitter Antonio Salieri reaching a low point in his depression by attempting to kill himself. He then confesses to a priest his story about his life involving Mozart, and the film enters a flashback mode that jumps between the past and present; the present in the movie is merely Salieri evaluating the events that were going on. The majority of Amadeus is about Salieri as he struggles to find peace with himself and God after witnessing a childish vulgar man deliver some of the best, daring, experimental, and unbelievable music the world had ever laid its ears onmusic that is much better than anything Salieri could produce. Salieri's jealousy and rage gets the better of him as his quest for vengeance and victory spirals out of control at the same time as Mozart's un-expecting depressing spiral. The movie focuses on many themes, with God and religion being the dominant theme.The strongest quality Amadeus possesses is the excellent directing and writing. The writer and creator of the play was involved with the screenplay, and overall its Oscar-worthy material. Stripping the themes and major ideas from the play and turning it into a film-like medium, the movie itself is just as powerful as the stage version. Peter Shaffer's influences include several short stories about Mozart and many rumored tales that Salieri confessed to killing Mozart (which is heavily debated even today). Milos Foreman, known for directing ""One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest,"" is at the top of his game here. We see many sweeping shots of the city streets, beautiful and massive sets for operas, performances, and musicals, and just so much more. It is one thing to have wonderful sets, but it takes a good director to know how to handle the 360 degrees of beauty surrounding the scene. Complimenting the directing is the editing, which apparently didn't win an Oscar. Try naming 10 scenes better-edited than the ""Requiem"" scene towards the end.In a rare double-nomination moment in the Academy, both of the main characters were nominated for best acting, and both of them should have won (instead of just one of them). The acting in Amadeus is nearly flawless, from Tom Hulce as Mozart to F. Murray Abraham as Saliri, to even the smaller roles (See pre-Sex and the City Cynthia Nixon pull a good performance in a minor role). The cast excels the movie into rarely-reached heights, as the opera singers and dancers and performers enhance the authenticity of the period piece and the way the performances were done back in the 18th century/19th century. Even if you aren't a fan of the opera, you can't help but be startled by how long they can cling on to some of those notes.Bottom Line: Stretching this review any longer would be an insult, because it shouldn't require this many words to describe why everyone should see this movie at least once. Amadeus is an excellent movie, no doubt about it. There's too much going for it for you to ever complain about the nitty-gritty details. The only setback is how much fiction is involved, even though some of Mozart's seemingly-exaggerated accomplishments are indeed true (Yes he did write professional music at age 4, yes he used to be able to memorize an entire piece of music after just one listen, and yes he wrote operas at age 7). But forgetting the loose mesh of fact and fiction and you'll find a rich movie full of wonderful music, beautiful scenery, and memorable scenes. Recommend to the highest degree, especially if you are a fan of classical music, or better yet a fan of good movies. Amadeus: One of the shining gems of the 1980s.P.S. Someone come up with a great Beethoven movie, please, he deserves it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mediocrity Is Everything,"With all its colorful and dazzling visual and audio flare, Amadeus is one for the ages. But I never really connected to the characters, and that's where it fails for me.Winning 8 Oscars in 1985 and numerous other accolades, it's safe to say Amadeus is one of the more beloved films of the 80's. It also comes from the great director behind One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Miles Forman. But what Amadeus lacks is subtly. I understand a film about grand-scale music and opera's needs to have a unique identity, but I found Tom Hulce's eccentric title role-performance to lack the human touch.Of course, Amadeus isn't strictly about Mozart himself, it deals with his ""rivalry"" with Italian composer, Antonio Salieri and the various trials and tribulations of Mozart's wish to display his talents to the world and particularly, the Roman Emperor. These events are told in flashbacks by Salieri as he was recently committed to an Insane Asylum after attempted suicide. As far as we know, most of the events of the film are highly fictionalized or exaggerated. Normally, I don't mind such a choice in storytelling, but it seemed to bother me this time around.What didn't bother me, however, was the performance of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. Covering decades, Abraham brings a totally different vibe to both the old and younger versions of Salieri, and both work extremely well. It's also worth noting that his character isn't all that likable on paper, but he brings the grounded humanity, especially in his jealousy for Mozart, that's missing from the rest of the film.Another thing Amadeus has going for it is the glorious music used and conducted for the film. Surely, most of the tunes are genius-ly written by the original composers, but the overall sound quality and editing is brilliant. Putting character dialogue aside, merely listening to this film is a joy.I may be in the minority here, but to me, a film must do more than just sound great, it has to move me emotionally in one way or another. The made up story has its fascinating moments, but it gets old after a while. As does the over-the-top performance from Hulce. Sure, a wonderful soundtrack and Abraham's performance are impressive, but it's not enough to get this to a positive review for me.+Abraham+Music-Hulce-Characters lack humanity-A tad long5.8/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Unparalleled beauty, wit, darkness, genius","If cinema lasts another thousand years, men shall still regard this as its finest hour. Never before have such beautiful words been written about music - whether in film or academia - as Peter Shaffer's exquisite script. Each line is chiselled into perfection. Each scene is contoured with such mastery that it could stand in isolation. F Murray Abraham's embittered snarling Salieri is, simply, one of the greatest portrayals in cinematic history.The film matches the beauty of Mozart's music, which in itself is sublime on a scale never heard before or since, even when one considers the new Ndubz release of beatbox mastermixes. When lazy ignorant musical journalists compare the modern day chart toppers to the Classical giants, Amadeus reminds us that the majority of the new breed are music illiterates. Mozart's genius and insatiable desire to achieve perfection reminds us that for all the advances in the modern world, we must truly humble ourselves to the towering achievements of our artistic ancestors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Divine.,"Never before (with the exception of Apocalypse Now) have I watched a film one day, woken up the next with a new, urging interest to watch it again; this happened to me with Milos Forman's brilliant adaption of Peter Shaffer's play, 'Amadeus'. Brilliantly paced the film runs for 180 minutes (Director's Cut version) and is full of detail (you'll never see a film film so exquisitely ornate with fantastical costumes and production design - it's like a baroque twist between Stanley Kubrick's 1975 'Barry Lyndon' and a wildly imaginative ""anything goes"" style), dizzying narrative depths and extravagant cinematic power. The character studies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) makes both for career-defining performances, the spiraling relationship between them makes for a dynamic pace that keeps upping the drama towards the powerfully dramatic climax. The music of Mozart feels like the final third main character, so beautifully edited to the masterfully shot scenes by Miroslav Ondricek (the elegant gliding through the corridors, the flaring candle-lights, the crane-shots in the opera... it's truly the finest piece of cinematography ever), the film will reveal new artistic elements ""simply"" in its grand beauty. Importantly, the film is not about Mozart, it's about Salieri and his Mozart and his God, and through several viewings it reveals new sides in the tales of greed, guilt and faith, and it's psychological and darkly painted drama simply enhances more and more as years go by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An Incredible Challenge,"Perfection is a feat often sought but rarely attained (perhaps never, some say).Antonio Salieri, the man who never was Mozart, recounts his life and the great influence this peculiar man named Amadeus had on his entirety.

Skill was never a question, but showcasing and having others comprehend his beauty at the time often was. Salieri, despite his best (and vile) efforts, never approaches the perfection Mozart produced at a whim. To create perfection so easily is the great struggle that haunts him to this day.But maybe perfection is never truly the goal.This extraordinary biopic is as entertaining as they come.

What a performance! 7/10,"""Amadeus"" is one of those grand, big and ambitious movies with a huge display of talent and.... well you see? Now I feel like the king in the movie. I'm lost of words. As it is the first time I've seen this movie, I don't quite know what to say. I don't have anything negative to say about the film, on the other hand I'm not sure what else to say about it.I guess two aspects of the film that I enjoyed were the music (obviously) and the costume design. Both of them were amazing and I enjoyed their presence. The music of course belongs to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and every piece of it is beautiful and marvelous. The costume design was also extraordinary and caught me by surprise a bit of how ridiculously giant those outfits were back then. It helped me feel the vibes of the time.The rivalry between Mozart and Saliery was nicely portrayed. Showing Saliery's envy towards Mozart.

Response,"I'm writing this more than anything as a response to the comments about Tom Hulce's accent, the use of English, etc.1. As was already mentioned by another post, the English is used every time the characters ""should"" be speaking German, and so it was done in the songs as well.2. As for the accent, I don't see why this is such an issue. The American accent is a dialect of English spoken in North America, granted. But who cares? That doesn't make Mozart sound any less European. With an English accent, I argue that he'd sound no more Austrian. It's well-known that the characters in this movie, although all speaking German, should represent a huge variety of dialects and accents, not least of which would be Salieri's, who, lest we forget, was an Italian.Other than that, I think the film is outstanding. Yes, I realize there are plenty of historical inaccuracies, but why is that a problem? It isn't a history presentation, it's a movie.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Jealousy is a Man's Best Friend,"""Amadeus"" was a historical biography about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The movie opens with an old man in a wheelchair, whispering Italian. This man, Saleri, plays a key character. Saleri plays as the narrator for some parts in which he is telling about his past and being with Mozart. He then has flashbacks of when he was a court composer and Mozart was just in his youth. Saleri was in love with the music that came from Mozart and was somehow always around Mozart when he had come up with new music. Saleri, himself, being so intrigued with the music and melodies, came up with his own composure's to try and please the Emperor. The Emperor is pleased, however, has Amadeus play it and while doing so, he changes a few keys here and there. This made Saleri upset because Amadeus did this quite often and leads us to believe that Saleri should've been the ""real celebrity."" A lot of Mozarts ideas are inspired by Saleri but with no credit given to him. Amadeus is married and has four children but the movie only portrayed one. He is quite the drunk, he spent all his time writing material and the moment he got paid for it, he spends it all on going out and getting drunk. He has the nice house and all, but his only happiness is coming up with music for everyone to hear. Even though this film is historical, I enjoyed the plot. Describing someone's life is definitely not easy, but Peter Shaffer did a great job with coming up with the plots and screen work. And showing the inside drama within each of the leading characters (Amadeus and Saleri) was interesting and led you into each of their lifes. The acting and music was great, I liked that they actually used his own works and used them correctly. The dramatics between roles were extreme but not the point where it was too much. And having Amadeus have a ridiculous laugh made it more enjoyable and more humorous. Some things I think the director should've pushed more for would be a better German accent. These characters seemed to have more of an English talk. The way they made Amadeus seem like nothing more than a drunk, turned me away. In many scenes in which he was coming up with plays, he always had some sort of drink in his hands, making it seem like it was his only getaway. They made Saleri seem more of like the jealous type and that the only thing he was living for was to get revenge on Amadeus, when in fact Saleri was quite the composer himself and is well-known. With the time transition, they should've made the characters age as years went on. Amadeus looked just about the same the whole movie. The choice of the cast was great, to me there were no actors that are too well-known and would be more favorable than others just because of their acting experience. They made acting seem effortless Amadeus is obviously a story about Wolfgang Mozart and his life. its factual, yet comical. The acting is great and holds drama you don't want to miss. If your into music, biographies, good humor, and a man's jealousy, this movie is definitely worth your time. I would rate ""Amadeus,"" by Milos Forman 8 out of 10.

Music and melodrama - a classic combination,"AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUTAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: Dolby DigitalMany years after the death of Mozart (Tom Hulce), the aged and embittered court composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) relates to a disbelieving priest the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical genius and how it led to jealousy, betrayal, and possibly even murder...Sumptuous evocation of a time and place, using Mozart's glorious music both to propel the story and underline the emotional dynamics of Peter Shaffer's extraordinary script. Based on his well-received stage play, and completely reworked for the screen, AMADEUS (1984) - and its updated version, reviewed here as AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT, released in 2001 - portrays Mozart's world as a romantic marriage of Royal palaces and candle-lit garrets, populated by eccentric emperors and their devious, toadying lackeys. The composer himself is played by Hulce as a spoiled, egotistical brat who indulges his passion for earthly pleasures with all the enthusiasm he brings to his musical compositions. But the film is anchored by Abraham in an Oscar-winning turn as Mozart's nemesis Salieri, consumed by envy and hatred whilst simultaneously awed by his rival's genius, the genius which Salieri had wished for himself, only to be denied by a mischievous God. The scenes in his asylum cell - where the elder Salieri confesses his 'crime' to a naive priest (Richard Frank) - are a tour de force, played with an intensity that simply burns up the screen. Beautifully designed and photographed, and bolstered by a magnificent supporting cast (including Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow and Kenneth McMillan in a role completely excised from the original theatrical print), the movie unfolds like an operatic melodrama which builds to a shattering climax, as the two central characters reach an understanding (of sorts) during the writing of Mozart's 'Requiem', only to be divided forever by unexpected tragedy. A masterpiece.The director's cut runs 180 minutes (the original theatrical version ran 160m) and reinstates various bits and pieces which help to clarify a number of crucial plot developments (the antagonism between Salieri and Mozart's wife is more fully explained, for example). Incredibly, the MPAA gave the film an R-rating for a brief sequence in which a female character bares her breasts to the camera! There's nothing here which warrants anything more than a PG-13.NB.

the VERY few times that the Academy Awards gave the Oscar to the RIGHT film: 1985,"An old embittered feeble Salieri (the great F. Murray Abraham) confine to an insane asylum tells a priest how Mozart (Tom Hulce) was a constant boon to his career always making him look far lesser in the greatness of Amadeus. Even with the film at 3 hours (the producer's cut), this film constantly kept my attention and I was hardly bored. The story while taking some liberties is still beautiful to behold. VERY well acted all around. With Abraham being the best ironically. The movie's soundtrack is very good, naturally. And this was one of the VERY few times that the Academy Awards got it right.

"A brilliantly ambitious, sprawling, and truly epic film","Few films create such a lasting impact as ""Amadeus."" Although it may not be as well-recognized as some other classics, those ""in the know"" have been privy to one of the great films of the 20th century. Its Director's Cut re-release a few years ago re-established it as a classic, and enticed many new viewers.Personally, having been subjected to this film years ago, watching the Director's Cut is a delight, because it seems to flow even better now, even with an extra twenty minutes of runtime.The film begins with the composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) telling his story (and Mozart's) to a priest (Simon Callow). Antonio feels personally responsible for Mozart's early death, and finally - after years of silence - spills his beans.The flashbacks (intercut with scenes of Salieri reciting the story from memory) show us the infantile and juvenile Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (played by ""Animal House's"" Tom Hulce) and his domination of musical composure in Vienna, where he was the subject of jealousy from Salieri, whose lifelong dream was to be half as great as Mozart.The performances are wonderful - Hulce perfectly embodies the Mozart many of us weren't aware existed - the troubled, disrespectful and hyper-active man-child. Today, historians claim Mozart probably suffered from attention disorders like ADD. Whatever the reason for his behavior, Hulce never lets up on the believability.Even more impressive is F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. It is really he who carries the film on his shoulders and is the vital link to Mozart. I personally think it was a brilliant decision by Peter Shaffer (playwrite and scriptwriter) to convey the story through the eyes of another man close to Mozart, rather than Mozart himself. It's far more effective than a simple narrative, which would have detracted from the effortless intrigue of this movie. (Once you start watching, you're hooked - even though it's three hours long on the Director's Cut, it's over in what feels like less than half that long.) Milos Forman has been responsible for some wonderful films throughout his career (other highlights include ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"") but in my opinion, from a directorial standpoint, this is probably his strongest. ""Cuckoos' Nest"" may have had deeper themes and drawn greater parallels between characters and events and symbolism, but ""Amadeus"" doesn't need to be complicated, and it isn't. At heart it is the story of a brilliant composer and the man whose jealousy destroyed them both. This should be seen by everyone at least once - because once you see it, you'll come back for seconds.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A nice depiction of genius,"The movie successfully surprised me with its depiction of Mozart's character and of how he lived his life. But the movie also did very well in depicting the genius of Mozart. I also like how the movie integrate the music into the whole picture, especially on the music writing scene later on. The perspective in the story-telling is also a very nice aspect of this movie. By using Salieri's view of Mozart, the movie nicely confirms the adagio of a hater is indeed a true lover. Especially in this case, the hater is someone who also has quite a talent though not equaling Mozart himself. F. Murray Abraham nicely portray the old Salieri very well, projecting the amazement, hate, guilt and envy all at once. Tom Hulce quite successfully depict his role with the stupid maniacal laughter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
As dramatic as an grand opera,"First the only thing that really grates with me: the heavy American accents are a distraction and clearly undesirable in a movie principally about Italian and German composers.But to moan about that would be to overlook a simply magnificent film, one with the dramatic scope and scale of a grand opera, told through the unreliable recollections of Salieri at the end of his life. Great credit to the director (Forman), actors (especially Abraham, one of very few actors to deserve his Best Actor Oscar outright for the performance given), the city of Prague for recreating Vienna so beautifully, to Sir Neville Marriner for the best soundtrack of all time, and to Schaffer for a script that tells a powerful story in such a spellbinding fashion, artfully weaving fact and the fictions of Salieri.Put simply, Amadeus will always be among my top 3 movies of all time, with good reason.

This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'.

Mozart Lives!,"How awesome is this movie? It's a visual feast for the eyes, a hilarious comedic effort, with the backdrop to one of the most intriguing plots of all time. In that, 'Amadeus' is a very rare film. A film that contains everything that is enjoyable about watching movies, yet is unlike any movie I've ever seen.The plot? Well, the website sums it up as ' The incredible story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, told in flashback mode by Antonio Salieri - now confined to an insane asylum.' But the story is as much about Mozart (played by Tom Hulce in a career defining performance) as it is about his jealous counterpart, Salieri (A much deserved Best Actor performance by F. Murray Abraham.) The root of his jealously? Mozart's musical talent, which speaks for itself. Salieri can't come to grips as to how this young man, who acts with immense immaturity, has been gifted this extraordinary talent. It's a story every human being should be able to relate to. I mean, who hasn't been envious one time or another? That's what a great film does, takes a richly exotic scenario and applies real world issues to the plot.See this movie if you haven't, I personally guarantee you will be pleased. I know I was.

"You'll think, you'll laugh, you'll cry - and you'll learn something, too","Very, very few movies have all their pieces - acting, photography, plot, music, etc - come together in a more powerful way than they do in this film.

It poses an interesting philosophical dilemma, a hero-villain for whom we cannot help but feel empathetic, and gives us a glimpse into the fascinating politics, power, and music of the Classical Age.One word of advice: Do NOT see the Director's Cut.

A true masterpiece of music and madness **** (out of ****),"Milos Forman's Amadeus is a truly magnificent picture.  A complicated character study, a dynamic blend of fact and fiction, and a dark, daring portrait of the madness that often accompanies genius.  F.

A brilliantly done depiction of the life of a great composer,"Amadeus is one of Milos Foreman's masterpieces.  It is the story of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  The movie is visually stunning.  As a costume drama it is very accurate to Vienna during the time of Mozart's life.  It has a rather questionable ending (for the purpose of historical accuracy) and leans toward the belief that Mozart was slowly being poisoned to death. However the movie does not claim to be a biography so it cannot be marked because of this.  I gave this movie a 10 because it is so well put together. Everything from costume to set design to cinematography, editing, and directing is astounding.  The acting is also decent to great.  This movie is definitely one of the best of the 1980's.  It is a must see for any music fan as well as any fan of the great historical Dramas of Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Literature with a soundtrack,"In good literature, there is a deep story, 3-D characters and many well thought out twists and turns. Unfortunately, in most hollywood productions, they seem to replace all this with a flimsy story, 2-D characters and predictable twists and turns. Luckily, Amadeus does not fall into this. I have always imagined what a good book would be like with a great soundtrack, and Amadeus gives me that picture. This music of Motzart seeps into every frame and gives the movie a life to it that would not be present in a book. This is one movie that should not be missed, a landmark standing apart from most of the (horrible) movies of the 80's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
a better film on Mozart would be hard to make,"Forman, though he worked in Hollywood,was Polish; and his films often contain traces of the more subtle European art-house sensitivity. The most sensitive of these decisions in case of Amdeus was to invite the Academy of St. Martin's in the Fields to play the music in this film. Under the conduction of Sir Neville Mariner, St. Martin's had been definitely the best interpreter of Mozart's music in the 20th c. and their playing just lifts the film to another level.Having said that, the film is also visually stunning, though it relies heavily on the acting of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as MOzart to carry it through. And they do carry it through with real aplomb. Especially Salieri comes across as an unforgettable character, though probably because his part is so amazingly well-written, from the brilliant description of the 'Gran Partita' in the beginning to the unbelievable death-bed sequence of Mozart where Salieri takes down whatever Mozart dictates, and what he dictates impromptu is the unfinished Requiem. Again a brilliant thing about this was how Shaffer and Forman constructs this sequence, breaking down the Requiem into its individual parts and lets the music just build up and carry us away. Working with a background score consisting of the best pieces of Mozart has its advantages, and Forman is so very much aware of that, that he consistently uses the music to overwhelm us.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Very Entertaining Film,"You do not have to be a lover of Mozart's music to enjoy this film. The circumstances surrounding the composer's death remain a mystery, and it would be a mistake to see the film as a historical account. The achievement of the film lies in the extent to which it enables us to share in the joyful and almost boyish enthusiasm with which Mozart (Tom Hulce) expresses himself through his music, and to marvel at his eternal optimism in the face of constant adversity, much of it caused by his jealous rival Salieri (Murray Abraham). Hulce's performance is wonderfully spontaneous and energetic, with Abraham's appropriately menacing. Not a great film perhaps, but an enormously entertaining one nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mediocrity as a subject as well as the resulting movie,"Mediocrity is not only the topic of this movie but also the movie itself. Is is mediocre to say least. One would expect more out of a movie called Amadeus. The correlation with Mozart is totally out of place. There is nothing in this movie about nobility, greatness, extraordinary people or anything else among the lines of higher understanding or one self's quest for betterness.The characters behave totally out of place. The action is taking places in the mids of aristocratic society yet everyone from the emperor to the opera director and to the servants behave like 21st century below-average income American citizens. The German (or Austrian) culture is fully ignored giving way to the ""american style"" (as it appears to common individual, not as it is in real life).The actions the characters take, as well as the results of those actions, are totally unwarranted. No reason is given as to way the character would act in the manner described or why their actions would yield the shown effect. This is deliberately so that it allows for ""desire gratification"". This is taking a wish out of real-life (son-father relationships is the mill for most such wishes in this movie), setting up a scene that will make one recognize his (perhaps frustrated) desire in it, and then, contrary to what would've happened in real-life {and by doing so destroying character consistency}, gratify it (with the proper evolution in the plot). This technique is also used for social manipulation in forming a distorted view of reality. One example is when ""the great Mozart"" has to submit his work to be evaluated by a committee despite the fact his works is great, he is intimate (i.e. close friends) with the emperor and the emperor could just appoint him. Like please, get real, in life people DO get appointed even when their work sucks just because they have access to the decision factors. As it must've become obvious by now, I am highly resentful of this type of ""your situation is better than you think and you should accept it as it is the same even for the most noble"".Art should propose a message and argue its validity, not try to impose it by all sorts of subliminal affirmations.Acting is terrible. Like no one really expects the people playing ballet on the scene truly be ballet-players. But they SHOULD move in at least a decent amount of sync. And when the piano is played, again, some correlation between the melody and the motion of the hands over the keys is expected.That being said, this is perhaps one of the best movies for its purposes. The story is told trough the eyes of the mediocre court-composer Antonio Salieri. The troubles of the characters are the troubles of the average individual of the 21st century (like bad credit, alcohol, bureaucracy, father, mother-in-law, etc.). What disappoints me about the movie is that these issues are not treated from a higher-perspective like one would expect but instead they are settled within the scope and understanding of the average individual.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of my all-time favorite films,"There are so many things to say about this film that I could never get them all in! Most of them have been said by other reviewers anyway.I saw ""Amadeus"" in a theater when it first came out, applauded wildly when it won I don't know how many Academy Awards, and have enjoyed it any number of times on video since then.  Peter Schaffer brilliantly adapted his play, which became even more dramatic and human onscreen. The story is moving and profound, and the performances wonderful.  F. Murray Abraham was truly brilliant as the tormented mediocrity Salieri.  So was Tom Hulce as the callow genius Mozart.  Not too-often mentioned is Roy Dotrice as Papa Mozart; he was great, as was Jeffrey Jones in a slyly funny performance as the officious but empty-headed Emperor. I was delighted by the fact that the film avoided the stuffiness so often associated with period drama.  I will even confess that I giggle just as insanely as Amadeus every time Salieri calls Mozart ""The Creature""!  The scene where Salieri takes dictation from Mozart and we see artistic creation happening must be one of the greatest ever put on screen. I hope everyone takes the opportunity to see this wonderful film on video.OK, I do have some more serious stuff to say.  As a budding screenwriter myself, I was impressed by the writer's attention to depth of character, and subtle, interlocking themes.  As a student of cultural history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across onscreen.  Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation).  When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas.  And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri.  And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway).  Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity ""Shakespeare in Love"", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar!  There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and cliches about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though.

"Beautiful film, and very misunderstood","This cannot be taken as a biography. How many times must this be said until you people believe that? I love Mozart, and I also love this film. It never shows Salieri killing Mozart, in fact it never even shows Salieri as the Man in Black, it shows Salieri's reaction to Mozart and God. People blame this for bad feeling against Salieri, but that's simply not true. Salieri was a dead name until this film came about. People aren't stupid enough to think Salieri actually killed Mozart. I cannot understand anyone not liking this film. It's beautifully crafted, written and acted. It's a bit of historical fiction, and revived interest in Mozart. I love this film. I could go on, but I won't. W. A. Mozart is one of my favorite people of all time, and this film shows him in a very human way. They do not portray him as an untouchable genius, but as they very real man he was.   As an aspiring Mozart scholar I would know that this is not a very accurate film. But so what? It's beautiful, touching, and makes me cry every time I see it.   If you enjoy classical music, go see this film. If you enjoy good movies, go rent this. If you enjoy wonderful, character driven performances, go get this. You will not regret it. It's a wonderful, brilliant film",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
should it have been 'Salieri'?,"This film of Peter Shaffer's play is fairly successful once you get past the clunky opening scenes where Mozart and his intended frolic under the tables and swap indecent puns with each other.From a very tight stage production, Shaffer opens out the action to include real-life scenes and scenarios rather than the theatrics of the dukes in the chorus. Salieri is the key character here, the title of the film notwithstanding, and is gloriously played by Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham. Curious that Abraham didn't go on to get the meaty roles that should have been there for him.As Mozart, Tom Hulce is - in the early scenes - an irritating hyena, an overactive child. By the time of the Requiem and the closing scenes his acting talent truly comes to the fore, doing justice to the story and to the wonderful music. Elizabeth Berridge plays his wife Constance very well, while Roy Dotrice is a memorable Leopold (father of Wolfgang Amadeus). Jeffrey Jones is a twitchy Emperor (""too many notes!"") and Simon Callow, Charles Kay, and Martin Cavina make their mark in smaller roles.The true star of this film though, is the music, and you get to hear lots of it, thanks to Sir Neville Marriner and a team of great musicians.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Rock me Salieri,Amadeus: 7 out of 10: Brilliantly filmed fictional account of the rivalry between Antonio Salieri (Well deserved Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce in a daring performance).The costumes and settings are spot on as only great Hollywood historical dramas can pull off. (This is one place independent film doesn't hold a candle to Hollywood). With the exception of Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's wife the supporting cast is excellent (especially Jeffery Jones who plays Emperor Joseph the 2nd like Martin Sheen playing a Kennedy.)The plot line of an old Salieri confessing to a priest how he turned his back on God after realizing the almighty gave Mozart not himself this divine talent is a wonderful and emotionally satisfying tool to hang the plot. Salieri is a wonderful protagonist as it is easy to identify with the jealousy one feels towards those to whom talent comes so easy and seems almost squandered.Besides Berridge's performance there are a few minor quibbles with the film. The music is very opera heavy and not terrible representative of either Mozart's work or some of the pieces that invariably made him immortal (It's a bit like doing a biopic of Beethoven and leaving out his 5th and 9th symphonies.)The movie is also bit long and drags some in the middle. In one scene during the performance of The Marriage of Figaro the Emperor yawns and Salieri goes into great detail how the number of yawns affects how long the opera will run. At 2 hours 40 minutes it saying something that Amadeus only rated one yawn from myself.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

This is what makes it so fascinating. The costume design was magnificent along with the directing and acting, all together it was a great movie but it didn't have the sting that I look for in movies.

Mozart not American!,"This film might have been able to get by on wonderful music and grandiose spectacle, but casting an American actor to play Mozart (and his chick) is a serious mis-service to history. The fact that many reviewers approve of this movie & rate it so highly is proof of this. I'm not against American culture per se (far from it) but the Americanisation of history in films (i.e. which gives the impression that many significant figures from the past grew up somewhere near Disneyland) is a terrible thing - it whitewashes cultural diversity & gives a totally distorted view of the world as it was, and still is. This cannot be overlooked. If an Austrian actor was chosen for the part (not Arnie) the film probably would have made less money so I guess that wasn't an option? Better to cast someone who appeared in ""Animal House""? Instead of a ""Directors' cut"" how about a ""Realistic cut""? Please explain?...well, if one of the characters in ""Amadeus"" had stepped out to buy a cheeseburger from Macdonald's or had switched on ""MTV"" at some point in this movie, it would not have seemed out of place - in what's supposed to be the story of an Austrian composer who lived in the 18th century!

Reply to Ange-8,"Several comments in reply:1) ""Why opera in English?"" - Actually, it's pretty clever how they handle this... In the movie the Italian operas (Figaro, Don Giovanni and Salieri's Axur) are sung in Italian, but only the German operas (Abduction, Magic Flute and the parody-vaudeville) are in English. My supposition is that we assume that everyone in the movie is speaking German, but we hear it as English, except when they speak in Italian or some other language. It's like having a selective Babel-Fish (read Douglas Adams if that one is lost on you).2) ""Why would they refer to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as Wolfie?"" Believe it, because they did. Constanza refers to Mozart numerous times in her letters as ""Wolferl"" which could translate to English as ""Wolfie""... also believe me that she (and others) had names for him that would cause Buddy Hackett to blush. The letters of the Mozart family (Wolferl, his sister ""Nannerl"", and papa and mama Mozart) are full of scatalogical references and sexual humor that still seems pretty crude in our day and age.3) Salieri. Yes, he is quite maligned. I think everyone knows that. He was one of the most famous composers in Europe and gave lessons in vocal composition to Beethoven, among others. He even commanded one of the artillery batteries in the premiere of Beethoven's ""Wellington's Victory"". However, some of Beethoven's conversion books survive where Beethoven's nephew Karl writes that Salieri has gone mad and claims that he murdered Mozart.

Utterly Amazing,"""Amadeus"" is my favorite film of all-time. Usually I am not a fan of historical dramas. The movie centers around Italian composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), who is committed to a mental institution after trying to kill himself. He blames himself for the death of the legendary Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce).Salieri's life and music is faint due to his jealously of Mozart. He is fascinated yet disgusted by Mozart...and wonders why God would use a vulgar, boorish child to be the best composer in history. I like the Director's Cut DVD better, which portrays Mozart's wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) in a more dramatic, involved role. After seeing the prolific scene with Constanze and Salieri, you will see why Constanze carries such disdain for him. Salieri's self-worth is destroyed and he finally accepts he is merely a 'mediocrity'. After seeing this piece of art (I cannot just call it a 'movie'), I grew fond of classical music. The operas and plays were very realistic, as if you were actually in 18th century Vienna! The costumes were lavish, accents perfected, Prague setting majestic and the music was beautiful.Overall, I give 'Amadeus"" an A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A very unusual biographical film; disturbing and at the same time deep,"Biographical films are all just the same. They start showing the childhood of the person portrayed, after that how he/she started to make success or to have prominence, then his/her marriage, the children and finally the very sad death- if it doesn't show the person dying, it shows some subtitles saying what happened. Of course there are some exceptions, as ""Hilary and Jackie"" (that is great, even following this formula) and this masterpiece, ""Amadeus"", that tells by flashback the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Milos Forman is a great director, and also proved that with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Valmont"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" (also a biography). Instead of showing a light, sweet, depressing story, he decided to make a disturbing film, with some suspense and wonderful visually.Antonio Salieri is a musician who is not very recognized and for that he envies Mozart, showed as a very weird man, but also with a very recognized talent. Salieri can't stand this situation and he will do anything to get this over. With this simple storyline, the film tells a important story, about envy and ambition, both present in our world. Forman's aim was just to focus on this situation. So, yes, he may have committed some historycal mistakes, but it doesn't matter.

An Interesting Take on the Amadeus Story,"Peter Schaffer (perhaps better known as the writer of ""Equus"") has an interesting tale to tell: an annoying laugh coming from the belly of God through the mouth of Amadeus, which angers and frustrates his chief rival. Is there a historical basis for the laugh, the rivalry, or the manner of Amadeus' death? Not really, but we can just let that slide because it makes a good story.I really loved this film ,and even though it was nearly three hours long, it seemed to go very quickly. Tom Hulce, who I know from nothing else, was a delightful Amadeus. At first he was a pain, but once I adjusted and began to sympathize with him, I think he played the part perfectly. Beyond that, everyone played their parts well -- even Jeffrey Jones, who (for me) is hard to see as anything but a comic actor or a Tim Burton regular.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Good, but not quite a masterpiece","At its core, Milos Forman's multi-award winning adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play 'Amadeus' is really just a soap opera with extremely lush production values.F. Murray Abraham is captivating in his Golden Globe and Oscar winning role of a man driven mad by jealousy. Relating the tale to the audience via a young priest, it creates an intimacy that helps to pull the audience in. Tom Hulce feels a bit too ""I want my MTV"" era contemporary as Mozart, but he brings a giddy energy to the role that works as a great counterbalance to Abraham.In the end 'Amadeus' isn't good history, but it is a good soapy tragicomedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A masterpiece, worthy of the genius it describes","Vienna -18th Century. The life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, from the angle of his relationships with Hapsburg Emperor Joseph II's Court Composer, Antonio Sallieri. Mozart is here described as a naughty spoiled brat, misbehaving with ladies, disrespectful of authority, wasting the money he really does not have. Overall, a man yearning for the youth he had been denied, a genius laughing at the inability of common people, a human being tortured by the music he cannot live without. Sallieri on the other hand, second-rate musician but true lover of music, probably understands Mozart better than anybody else. ""Here was the very voice of God"", he says of Mozart's music. ""I was staring through the cage of meticulous ink stokes at an absolute beauty"". But he cannot bring himself to help the genius he is so jealous of.

The man who chose God vs. the man whom God chose,"A centuries-old Calvinist theory of pre-destination underlies Amadeus: a composer (Salieri) who dedicates his life and work to God becomes envious when he sees his efforts to please God met with indifference and scorn because God chose another (Mozart) as his musical incarnation. Salieri is perplexed beyond sanity that, in contrast with his own saintly lifestyle, the Chosen One is a vulgar runt who tells filthy jokes, plays around with women, and giggles like a hyena. Enraged and humilated when he recognizes that his hard work falls far short of Mozart's effortless superiority, he decides to strike back at God by trying to destroy his loved one.Most of the music is Mozart's own, performed by major league musicians, and it is a rare thrill to encounter such music, so well performed, in a movie.

"""God was singing through this little man to all the world, unstoppable, making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.""","Though Milos Forman is rarely mentioned among the greats of Hollywood directing, he has certainly left an indelible mark on cinema. Creator of at least two indisputable masterpieces, Forman's films have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards on two occasions, and he has also won the Best Director Oscar for these two same films. The film that brought most of his initial fame was the glorious 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' of 1975, based on the popular novel by Ken Kesey and starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. In the next nine years, Forman only produced another three films: 'Hair,' 'Ragtime' and 'Amadeus,' respectively.Released in 1984, 'Amadeus' is based on the 1979 stage play by Peter Shaffer, which was inspired by Aleksandr Pushkin's short play, ""Mozart and Salieri,"" and loosely traces the lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. The film opens with Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in a mental institution, after having attempted suicide. Now old and frail, he speaks to a young priest (Herman Meckler),who has come to hear his confession. Salieri expresses bitterness that his former-talents have faded into obscurity with passing time, whilst the works of the young prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce) have become legendary. Having known of the talented composer for most of his life, and having developed a hatred towards Mozart because of his own inferiority, Salieri ultimately blames himself for his death. Through his confession to the priest, Salieri explains how his association with Mozart destroyed his entire life.It is perhaps surprising to newcomers that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is not the main character in the film. As the skilled but envious Antonio Salieri, F. Murray Abraham is the epitome of good acting, delivering a dark and brooding performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Abraham is mesmeric as the successful composer who makes a pact with God to be the greatest in history, in exchange for his complete and unwavering devotion. When it appears that this gift has been bestowed upon another, Salieri rejects the Lord, and makes it his life's mission to destroy the talented young man through whom God speaks His voice.Tom Hulce, despite also being nominated for Best Actor for his role, is often cited as the one misstep of the film. I completely disagree, since the idea that Hulce feels out-of-place is the very point that the film is trying to make. When he hears of all that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has accomplished, Salieri was expecting to meet a sombre, respectable genius, only to first come across Mozart crawling on the floor, engaged in vulgar sex-games and uttering jokes about flatulence. This is what ultimately leads Salieri to abandon his pact with God: after all his own unwavering loyalty, how could the Lord have chosen this ""unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat"" through which to channel His voice? Of course Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart was juvenile and somewhat irritating, since it was supposed to be.Hulce based his character's annoying laugh on real descriptions of the composer, which referred to it as ""an infectious giddy"" and ""like metal scraping glass."" Also, though the historical accuracy of Shaffer's play was met with much scrutiny, it appears authentic (if slightly over-exaggerated) that Mozart had something of a vulgar and loutish personality. For example, it is known that the famed composer wrote canons on the the words ""Leck mich im Arsch"" and ""Leck mich im Arsch recht fein schön sauber"" as party pieces for his friends. However, the supposed rivalry between Salieri and Mozart is most likely completely fictional. In real life, Salieri frequently lent Mozart musical scores from the court library with which he was charged; he often chose compositions by Mozart for performance at state occasions, and Salieri taught Mozart's son, Franz Xaver.Despite running for almost three hours, 'Amadeus' is a surprisingly easy movie to sit through, helped along by brilliant performances and a brisk pace. The use of a classical musical score  mostly comprised of Mozart's pieces, conducted by Sir Neville Marriner at the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  is positively perfect for the film, proving that, even though he lived many centuries ago, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is still far better than even the most gifted cinema composers of the twentieth century.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The movie of Salieri's life,"The movie of Salieri's life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.The priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father's untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how ""The Creature"" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri's heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.As the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"I hate costume dramas, but not this one.","I've always hated costume dramas, especially when the story is situated in 18th century Austria or Germany. There is just too much gold foil, too much ugly wigs and pompous costumes, too much over the top decors, just too much of everything that I detest.Big was my surprise when I saw ""Amadeus"". For the first time I wasn't trying to switch channels as soon as possible. From the first minute on it had my attention and never let me go, not even after the movie was finished. What I liked most was the co-operation between the music and the images. It all added to the drama. If a modern composer had written the music for some parts of the movie, I'm sure it wouldn't have been as great as it was now. I've never been a huge fan of classical music, but I sure can appreciate it from time to time. And there can be no doubt about how good the music in this movie is of course. It's Mozart, what more do you need? If you can't appreciate this music at all, than I'm afraid there is something wrong with your education. There is more in life than screaming guitars or techno beats.So for me the big star in this movie was the music, but I have to say that I also liked the way the story was told. I liked the flashbacks, telling the story from Salieri's point of view, the old and bitter man who now lives in an insane asylum, completely forgotten and still in Mozart's shadow. He explains to a priest what exactly had happened and why he always wanted to murder Mozart. I don't really know if all this is historically accurate, but I don't have any doubts about the fact that this is good cinema.Overall the movie was great, but sometimes there were a few details that bothered me. My feelings about the costumes, the wigs and typical architecture you already know, but there were also other things. Mozart's giggle for instance. It annoyed me enormously. I understand that it shows that this man was still very immature from time to time, that he sometimes still acted like a child, but still... Nevertheless I have to admit that this is a wonderful movie and despite some minor flaws it was almost perfect. I give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"I'm a vulgar man, your Excellancy.

Mozart is composing his ""Requiem"" while is health is detoriorating.

"Flawed, but who cares?","This powerful narrative of Mozart's adult career in Vienna - largely devoted to his operatic work, as befits a theatrical event - runs about 30 minutes longer than it might have, and has the power to put attentive viewers to sleep, or into a sort of hypnotic funk.  Mozart's last days are stretched out inordinately.  Nevertheless, this film has depth, humor, and one of the greatest soundtracks you'll ever hear.  The historical facts are inseparable from the fantasy that forms the basis of the plot, so beware of citing Amadeus as an authority on the lives of Mozart & Salieri.  Mozart was not so unworldly in real life, nor was Salieri so obsessed with his colleague, at least while both were alive.  Mozart's music was very popular throughout Europe, though he didn't earn as much money from his compositions as he deserved.  While Mozart didn't die entirely forsaken, as the movie implies, he was a victim of bad health exacerbated by overwork.  Consider that modern ""recording artists"" like Michael Jackson, et. al. release a dozen new compositions every 4 or 5 years, while Mozart composed two full-length operas and the bulk of a Requiem mass, among other things - several hours of classic music - in a few months, while he was dying.

Thats what makes Salieri a unique character in recent film history. The best critic ever seen on screen in a leading role. Besides that, Mozart is not the leading character in this movie. We see Mozart from the eyes of an admirer. Thats why we get a totally wrong impression from the life and work of this musical genius.

A treat for even those who aren't too fond of classical music.,"Without music, would life have as much meaning? Whether it's The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Frank Sinatra or Beethoven, music plays an important part in inspiring people. When writing, I like to listen to music, specifically classical pieces. One of the best classical composers was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose life is brought to the screen in Milos Forman's Amadeus. Well, not all of his life as most of what is portrayed in the film never actually happened in real life. That is not a flaw of the film, however, as Peter Shaffer manages to still create a fascinating story that keeps us gripped throughout the three hour running time. Forman recently released the Director's Cut on DVD, adding about twenty minutes of new footage and it surprisingly enough, improves the theatrical version that graced cinema screens and won eight Academy Awards in 1984. This is the version of Amadeus more worthy of being in your DVD collection.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a court composer in Vienna, is excited about the arrival of his musical idol since childhood, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). However, much to Salieri's shock, Mozart turns out to be a vulgar, immature creature who just happens to be blessed with the power to produce beautiful music. Salieri soon watches his world change as he realises that his own music isn't so great when compared to the impressive operas that Mozart churns out. After watching Mozart mock him at a party, Salieri decides that he must do away with him somehow and take his revenge on God, who he has since declared his enemy for giving the beautiful gift of music to a vulgar, little man with an annoying laugh.Milos Forman and Petter Shaffer created a masterpiece with Amadeus, a startling portrayal of two different men thrust together. F Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce both received very well deserved Oscar nominations for their performances and they both give their characters the right tone. Mozart is a fun individual who surprises people with his impressive music despite his personality (and obnoxious laugh), but is soon going to deeper into debt and alcoholism. Hulce portrays Mozart's nuances so perfectly and Abraham is just as terrific. One of the main reasons that Amadeus is such a terrific film is the fact that when things do not go Salieri's way, we are just as upset as he is, because we feel for his pain. Mozart provides Amadeus with comic relief, while Salieri provides it with torturing pain. That's just how good the performances, script and direction allow these characters work, especially in their final scenes together.The supporting players are also integral to the plot as well, though. Jeffrey Jones is almost comical as an emperor with an attention span of two hours and requests Mozart to cut a few notes from his operas. Catherine Berridge is the actor in the film given the most opportunity to shine thanks to the Director's Cut. Forman looks deeper into the character of Mozart's wife, Constanze and she is given a much more important role than in the theatrical version and there is even bigger reason as to why she is shocked to see Salieri in Mozart's room at the time of his death. And of course, I would be crazy of me not to mention the glorious sets, costumes and makeup effects that are so important in bringing 1700's Vienna to life. This is one of the best films to come out of American cinema and a treat for even those who aren't too fond of classical music. In fact, those who are fans will be very happy with Warner's remastered soundtrack of the film which booms through the speakers and you feel as if you yourself is in one of the opera palaces with Salieri and Mozart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

But the creative liberties taken here add spice, intrigue and drama and do not detract one bit from the film.One of the great achievements of filmmaking and the best scene in this picture has Mozart, weakened by fever, essentially dictating his Requiem to Salieri. As the movement builds from Mozart's imagination, we can see Salieri finally accept the extent of his true genius. That is certainly director's Milos Forman's finest hour - especially when you stop to consider how badly that could have played out.I think that those of use who grew up musicians appreciate this movie more, not because of Mozart, but because we can relate to the searing hatred and jealously of Salieri. For all of us, no matter how hard we tried, there was always someone better.This movie translates poorly to the small screen, as do most epics - but it is still a worthwhile rental.

A Little Night Music,"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was only 35 years old when he passed away. Despite his short life he managed to write over 800 pieces of music in various genres. Works of such melodic beauty and sweeping elegance that Mozart is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers the world has ever seen (or heard). But his greatness also angered many contemporary musicians. Upon Mozart's untimely death, it was rumored that he had been poisoned by his jealous colleague, Antonio Salieri. An accusation that will probably never be proven.These dramatic events were depicted in Peter Schaffer's famous play ""Amadeus"". The year was 1979, and the piece was a big hit on Broadway and in the West End of London. Consequently, no one was surprised when Hollywood a few years later acquired the movie rights. Milos Forman was to direct, but first he wanted to do some rewriting with Peter Schaffer. After six months, and countless, bitter arguments, the two men were barely on speaking terms anymore.Casting ""Amadeus"" turned out to be just as difficult. Every leading star in Tinseltown was interested in the two main parts, but Forman wanted unknown talents in the roles. So, the studio had to hold thousands of auditions before settling on Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham as Mozart and Salieri. The world-renowned Sir Neville Marriner then agreed to conduct the score on the condition that not a single note of Mozart's original music was changed.Against all odds, ""Amadeus"" was a big public success. And at the Academy Awards the following year, the film was nominated for a total of eleven Oscars. Milos Forman's beautiful period piece won in the categories Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Leading Actor and Best Writing. But the picture also had an ironic aftermath. The modestly talented composer Antonio Salieri, whose music had been forgotten for so many years, suddenly began to be played again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Distorted History,"It is my understanding that, according to a many music historians and musicologists, Antonio Salieri did conspire against Mozart. And while this may be worhty of some interest as a footnote or even a few paragraphs in a Mozart biography, it is not a justification for the bloated treatment rendered in ""Amadeus."" Lacking a good enough slant for a powerful dramatic depiction, the writer latched on to this gimmick to propel the story to a wider audience. While we can be grateful for an opportunity to hear this great music and thrill to the recreation of some of the period settings, we cannot be happy about this distorted approach to biography. Nor can we feel elated over the decision to make the character of Mozart a cackling, show-off buffoon. There is a great deal missing from this composer biography, and it is saddening to think that this may be considered a definitive depiction of the life of this great composer. There comes a point when historical accuracy and integrity must override purely commercial motives.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"An intelligent, imaginative and slyly satirical study of the creative mind in all its ruthless glory","Milos Forman's adaptation of Peter Shaffer's award winning stage play of the life and ultimate downfall of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and his difficult relationship with arch rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is certainly something of a flawed work, albeit, one that is incredibly pleasant and engaging nonetheless. The principal focus of the film is on the character of Salieri, from his guilt ridden suicide attempt at the beginning of the film, through to the scenes in which he recounts his story to a priest from the confines of a mental hospital. From here, the film deals mainly with Salieri's crippling jealousy over the younger composer and the natural rivalry that intensifies between them, as Mozart's natural talent and flair for presentation finds him embraced by the Emperor (Jeffery Jones) and the people of Vienna.As Mozart gains more and more success, it is Salieri's obsession to destroy the composer at any means necessary that drives the narrative further and further. Although you could argue that the whole thing is woefully inaccurate in a historical scene, you can't help but marvel at the film's style, wit and excellent period evocation. Shaffer's script fizzes with depth and amusing character quirks that should resonate with anyone who has some familiarly with the actual story at hand, while Forman's direction is close to Kubrick's greatest film Barry Lyndon (1975) in terms of scope, scale and detail. Here, the director is aided by cinematographer Miroslav Odericek's and his staggering use of composition and lighting, with the look, combined with the costume and production design evoking the true grimy beauty of the period.There is also a great pace being maintained by the editing of the film, with some interesting juxtapositions between the worlds of these two composers, and the intelligent use of Salieri as the teller of the story, which opens the film up to ideas of the unreliable narrator, thus somewhat anarchically excusing itself from the more obvious inaccuracies. This all goes towards making Amadeus (1984) a fascinating character study with some wonderfully bawdy comedy and, unsurprisingly, that fantastic use of music. A great look at one man's shallow obsession to share his art with the people and god, but is overshadowed at every turn by a much greater talent, something he only realises too late.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"""An Absolute Beauty""","There is very little that I can say about this film that hasn't already been said.  For all the critics that say that this is not a correct biography of Mozart, well.... I don't think it is  meant to be that.  What is is however, is a masterful piece of film.  This movie is so well put together.... the writing, the acting , the editing, the cinematography.  F. Murray Abraham's performance in this is jaw dropping. His gestures, his glances while he is telling the story as an old man are incredible.  The anger and jealousy that he portrays are truly frightening!  Some of the scenes in this movie   stay with you for a long time.. for instance when Salieri recounts how moved he was when he saw ""The Marriage of Figaro"".. it was so beautifully written! I think his performance was standout like Meryl Streep's in Sophie's Choice. The rest.. the editing... the writing.. the costumes and sets are all wonderful. I consider this one of the best movies of the 80s. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Amadeus,Movie Review Amadeus was a wonderful about the life of Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and it tell whether Salieri is a murderer. The main characters were played by the phenomenon actor F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri and Tom Hulked who played Mozart. Antonio Salieri was the psycho everyone said in this movie. This movie brought the spectacular music of both Mozart and Salieri. This tale was talented. It started out as old Antonio telling of the life of Mozart while in an asylum. It was a tale of pure talented and jealousy ending in tragedy. This movie was a good movie that director Milos Forman made to inform and also entertain the viewer of the life of such a great composer as Mozart. I give it 4 ½ out of 5 star. Get the DVD or VHS and watch it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A unique perspective on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,"I saw this movie several times in the past and could not pass up the opportunity to see if Blu-ray would contribute much.This is a unique approach to the life and contributions of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is told through the filter of an acquaintances' Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) who struggles with God. Also, we see the movie, of course, may miss some of the plays but being a movie, we have replaced them with visions of Prague, where the movie was filmed.The only thing that can be a bit annoying to some people is the laughing style they gave Mozart (Tom Hulce) in this production.Be sure to watch the extra information where the different actors and the director talk about the trials and tribulations of getting a film crew into Prague in 1984 and having to deal with the secret police.Get a different view of the play in Midsomer Murders: The Death of a Hollow Man.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
F. Murray Abraham is excellent,"Amadeus is in no way the perfect Mozart/Salieri biopic. It takes tremendous liberties with the truth, but that's no matter: it's entertaining and inspiring beyond belief. Mozart's natural musical acumen which Salieri envies so much is portrayed beautifully, and I almost felt myself becoming better at appreciating the highest ideals of music through his descriptions. The scene in which Salieri and Mozart work on getting the Requiem down on paper is the highlight of this side of the film: hearing and understanding the separate layers before hearing them altogether is a goose-bumpingly great experience.And F. Murray Abraham is an astonishing presence in the film. At one point, a rather poor actor playing a doorman comes to the door as Salieri is giving a lesson. The doorman delivers his line flatly, but Abraham's acting, in comparison to that, is incredibly nuanced, natural-looking, well-performed and believable. That's when I discovered that he won that Best Actor Oscar for a very,very good reason indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A riveting musical rivalry,"""Amadeus,"" directed by Milos Forman, is a lavish and compelling exploration of the rivalry between composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. Set in the vibrant musical world of 18th-century Vienna, the film vividly portrays Mozart's genius and Salieri's envy, blending historical drama with fictionalized intrigue.Tom Hulce delivers an unforgettable performance as Mozart, capturing both his brilliant talent and his impish personality. F. Murray Abraham shines as Salieri, whose intense jealousy and inner turmoil drive much of the film's drama. Their dynamic is at the heart of ""Amadeus,"" offering a gripping narrative that delves into themes of genius, jealousy, and the destructive nature of envy.The film's production values are impeccable, with stunning period costumes and elaborate sets that immerse the viewer in the opulence of the era. The soundtrack, rich with Mozart's compositions, enhances the storytelling, making the music a character in its own right.While ""Amadeus"" takes liberties with historical accuracy, its dramatic flair and emotional depth make it a captivating watch. It skillfully balances humor, tragedy, and music, creating a rich, entertaining experience that resonates with audiences. The film's blend of historical drama and musical genius ensures it remains a timeless classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Amadeus Explodes Off the Screen in Grand Fashion,"Amadeus represents a humanistic film on the grandest stage. An excellent period drama, the film draws the viewer into Romantic Vienna, cultivator of masterful talents, and home to a foreigner, the young, extremely talented, and quite conceited Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The film beautifully contrasts Mozart's poor handling of his immense talent with his rival, Antonio Salieri's, contemplations on mediocrity and his attempts to carry out his only wish, to be the mouthpiece for God through his music.Alas, it could not come to fruition for Salieri, as he must sit back and admire the genius of Mozart while at the same time be appalled by his chauvinistic and childish mannerisms. Salieri always acts with composure toward Mozart and never ceases to assist the man in his times of need. Behind the scenes, however, Salieri questions his faith, even burning the cross of Jesus in a powerful scene. The man cannot understand how God could make Mozart the instrument of such musical beauty.The movie Amadeus is the centerpiece for some of the finest music ever put on film. The film's music is a character of its own, always in the background enhancing the action on screen. The film, despite its length, feels like a true journey into the heart of two men driven by music. It is hard to watch Mozart mishandle the great gift that he was given, but it is more painful to watch Salieri unable to move past mediocrity despite all of his attempts.Without question, this is one of the finest films ever crafted. It features amazing performances from the cast, and the script is amazingly adapted by the playwright Peter Shaffer. Its 8 Oscars are duly noted, for Amadeus presents itself on screen like few other films have in history.A powerful example of jealousy, humanity, talent, and music, the film Amadeus serves as an instrument for bringing the genius of Mozart to life and for bringing the real drama of two men's struggles onto the big screen in a very entertaining and emotional way. This film is a masterpiece of cinema, and one of the most deserving 10s I have ever reviewed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Stretching the truth never looked so beautiful,"If you've never seen this movie before, you may be forgiven for thinking that you're about to watch a biography about Mozart. The truth is that the movie (and the play this movie is based on) take quite a few liberties in trying to make a dramatic point. Just as in other movies about larger-than-life personalities (think ""JFK"" by Oliver Stone, and you get the idea), the point of this is that it's a MOVIE first, and fact second (or possibly further down the line).Having gotten that out of the way, let me also say - IMHO, this is one of the best movies you'll ever see.The movie opens with a 17th century composer, Antonio Salieri, who one night decides to attempt suicide by slashing his wrists. He's soon brought to a mental hospital, and in the morning a young priest comes in to talk to him. He then goes on to discuss the events that brought him to this point - specifically, his jealousy and hatred of Mozart (it's quite amusing to see him perform a few bars of his own music for the priest, to try and get some recognition out of him, and only 'succeeds' when he starts playing Mozart's famous Eine Kleine Nachtmusik - you'll recognize it too when it starts playing).The movie shows in rich detail Mozart's life, primarily starting when Salieri first met him in person at a concert for the Archbishop of Salsburg. What makes Salieri burn is that Mozart appears to be a ""filthy, dirty creature"" with a foul mind - and that his music seems to come directly out of Mozart's head, ""without corrections of any kind"". During the course of the movie, Salieri's anger and jealousy start to consume him, until he devises a plot to 'kill' Mozart and get his revenge on God (the anger in old Salieri's eyes, and the fear in the priest's, make that scene the most powerful one for me).Besides the beautiful music of Mozart that fills the movie, one of the things that makes this movie work so well is how they made 17th century Vienna look authentic, giving you a feel of what life must have been like back then (of course, some of the stuff was probably also enhanced by the people making this movie, but you'd be hard pressed to point out any problems). My favorite 'play within the movie' has to be where Salieri is watching Mozart's version of Don Giovani. Besides the haunting music and wonderful singing, it's the attention to detail - including 'demons' swirling around with lit torches - that really make this movie stand out.Regardless of what type of movie you normally would watch - action, comedy, horror, whatever - I urge you to watch this movie at least once. You'll be better off for having done so.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amadeus as entertainment,Admittingly this is a highly entertaining film. the historical accuracy is poor however. salieri as everyone should know by now was not Mozart's assassin. this was a tale that was bruited about for sometime without foundation. turning perhaps the greatest musical genius that has ever lived into a buffoon however is an even greater travesty. however once you have jumped this hurdle the movie offers much entertainment in its showing of scenes from some of his most famous operas. costumes and sets are superb of course and very life like. still it is many miles ahead of the pablum that was offered back in the 1940's in terms of bios of great composers. Mozart was a man of many moods. childlike in some ways. and naive of the ways of the world in others perhaps. scatological jokes were rampant however in the lives of the southern Germans (mozarts father) and Austrians (mozarts mother). you would have to read of the letters these two sent each other to know that bodily functions in the 18th century were much more out in the open than in todays much greater privacy. that would help explain Mozart's sometimes out of the norm tom foolery. it was part of the patois of the time. still you have occasion to hear some of the most beautiful music written and i suppose be grateful for that. when will we ever have a lifelike portrayal of the great composers? a brilliant spectacle non the less.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
a classic  period piece,"Surely one of the best films of the 1980's, or even perhaps of the last quarter of the 20th century. Everything about this movie, from the complete character foil of Amadeus compared to Salieri, the conflict within conflict storyline of the rise of genius versus the toil of mediocrity, to the ultimate demise of 2 men, one whose talent is consumed by the ravages of alcohol and guilt while the other's soul is consumed by the power of envy. It's the very rare modern day film, with all the trappings of today's film debauchery (language, sex, violence, etc.) that could just as easily have been produced back in the golden age of Hollywood (pre-1950.) F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri is truly Oscar award worthy. What better way to teach history than to show it through the eyes of the third person in which every step of the title character's role is seen with enough detail as to not confine the character within the facts of histories already known. Yes, as within most Hollywood's rendering of history, there are surely many facts that have been left to the director/screenwriter's interpretation, but then again - this is entertainment, not education.A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Classic Film Worthy Of Classical Score,"""Amadeus"" cleaned up on Oscar Night, 1985, and in its time was as much an event as a film. It even spawned a #1 worldwide hit, the silly but infectious ""Rock Me Amadeus."" Then the movie kind of disappeared. You didn't hear about it much when people discussed great cinema, even from the 1980s. The actors, all hailed when the film came out, seemed to slip back into relative obscurity, except for Cynthia Nixon, the future ""Sex And The City"" girl unrecognizable here as an innocent housemaid. Maybe that's why director Milos Forman and the film's producers decided on releasing a special Director's Cut when it was time to make a DVD.The result, as Salieri might have put it, is breathtaking. The film breathes with new life, shaking whatever period-film shackles held it back in 1984. We see Mozart struggling to make himself an instructor for rich, untalented girls; enjoy with the common people of Austria a rousing farce of ""Don Giovanni;"" and finally get a satisfying reason for one of the original film's few problems: Why Mozart's wife Constanze angrily sends Salieri away from her husband's deathbed. The end result: What was great before is perfection now.Its brilliance is not in its costumes, its set design, its bravura performances or crafty plot. It's not even the music, though classical-music snobs I encountered claimed that was the only thing in the movie worth noticing, though in its hacked-up state it was more ""Hooked On Mozart"" than anything truly edifying. No, what's great about ""Amadeus,"" what makes it rise to the utter top, is how all these brilliant elements are brought together in a way that carries the viewer with it from beginning to end. Even if you don't get it all the first time you see it, your appetite will be stoked enough for you to wish to see it again, and that's where the film really makes it mark.Like other landmark movies, ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" and ""Jaws,"" ""Amadeus"" hits you a different way each time you see it. It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly. Salieri is especially rich in this regard, the way F. Murray Abraham plays him. There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service. Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it.Abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place. Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high-living fellow with a juvenile mind and a poor understanding for the lesser talents of other composers, yet at the same time he makes you care about his many trials. Elizabeth Berridge is believably coquettish and lower-class as Constanze, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good. Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good-naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.That's a good way to describe ""Amadeus,"" as the kind of film Shakespeare might have made had he plied his trade a few centuries later. The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W.S. did so well.Is this a film about the folly of seeing a religious design in the patterns of life, in thinking some divine being guides all and decides who is great and who is not? Some would say so. Others might incline to Salieri's own belief, that God is a being not of mercy but of caprice, striving to undo those who strive to be better than He intends. Finally, there is the idea, which I go with, that Salieri's great loss was not in being there when Mozart came to Vienna but to be so choked with jealousy as to not help him, despite the many opportunities to do so, and to suffer the consequences of seeing Mozart's posthumous reputation rise to greater heights while his own music ""grows fainter."" The brilliance of that last scene, of Salieri helping Mozart write the Requiem, is realizing that with a different, more positive and truly pious outlook, Salieri could have been Mozart's champion, and shared some of his boundless fame.Of course, this is all fiction. Salieri didn't drive Mozart to his death. Ironically, he was more a devoted servant of greatness, as history records him being the chief teacher of the one composer whose reputation arguably eclipses even Mozart's, Ludwig van Beethoven.But screenwriter Peter Shaffer doesn't let this get in the way of a great story, and so we have a great movie, and Salieri, a measure of notoriety his own music never brought.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
To All Mediocrities,"Exceptional adaptation of the Peter Schaffer play.

Everything in this movie is grand. The music of course, but also the production, the sets and costumes. Top notch acting on all counts seal this as one of the best adaptations ever made. Admittedly, in strict comparison to the play, some important facets of the characters are missing, such as the depth of evil and conflict within Salieri and the sexual tension with Constanza. However, many a classic lines and scenes have been added to make up for it.

Too Many Scenes,"This mostly fictional account of the relationship between Mozart and Salieri, a journeyman contemporary composer, is well filmed but has ""too many scenes,"" to paraphrase Emperor Joseph.

The film's portrayal of Mozart as a vulgar buffoon is hard to reconcile with his genius for creating sublime music.

I have never understood why this film garnered the accolades it did.,I was assuming this would be a study of the composer that was focused on his music - instead what I got was 'Animal House' antics by the main character - Mozart.

Breathtaking! Stunning! Worthy of Every Award!,"There are few films out there even today that can match Amadeus' incomparable genius. For starters, the two leading actors played by Oscar and Golden Globe Winner F. Murray Abraham and Oscar Nominee Tom Hulce play Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, two rival composers. When Abraham speaks, you can't take your eyes off him whether he is elderly or young and promising and gifted as well. He saves his envy for the spoiled musical prodigy Mozart who is also goofy and childish as well. It's Salieri who begins to despise his rival without telling him the truth of how much he resented Mozart's musical genius and that God chose Mozart over Salieri. Anyway, the backdrop which includes the lavish costumes and art direction are unforgettable. The movie takes you to another place and time where the same occurrences of rivalries, jealousies, and envy can be a powerful weapon of hatred. Mozart naively believes in Salieri's friendship and support. I don't care for the casting of American actors like Jeffrey Jones playing the Austrian emperor. Cynthia Nixon playing the maid hired by Salieri to spy on the Mozart family. I thought Elizabeth Berridge was adequate as well as Christine Ebersole. British actors like Roy Dotrice (when will be honored) and Simon Callow CBE are equally the same. It really is Salieri's film overall told from his point of view. You can't forget Mozart's unique laugh and his desire for his father's love who wants him back in Salzburg than in Vienna. Salieri's father died while he was young. We don't see much of the women in the film but that is expected since you expect that women were still second class citizens. Salieri envied Mozart's genius as well as zest for life outside music.

"Phony-Baloney Mozart Shines When It's Fun and Games, but Withers When We Are to Believe His Genius","Give something that rhymes with Mozart and a kid today would say ""Old Fart!"" since Mozart is only reserved for those high-brow, supercilious opera-lovers who feign to appreciate actual music. Well, many people do pretend to be connoisseurs of art, but there are a few who can actually find a communion with music. One of them was Antonio Salieri, a decent composer but a brilliant connoisseur of music. To him, as he said it himself, Mozart was 'the voice of God', and Salieri could actually understand the genius' thought process behind writing the music. How would this man of extraordinary skills be of character? Would he silent the entire audience with his eloquence and profoundness, outside his music, as a person?In 'Amadeus', Salieri gets his answer; if the true Mozart were like this, which is highly unlikely, then he would think of these high-brows as 'dlo trafs!'. In fact, Mozart, in Amadeus, is a prodigy in music who never takes anything seriously. Salieri wonders how such a creature could possess such genius; he feels God has purposely avenged Salieri by bestowing upon him average talents while handing Mozart infinite capabilities. As a lunatic in his old age in an asylum, Salieri narrates his life to a priest. In the amusing scene, Salieri plays two of his compositions to the priest and asks them to guess the name of the song, but the priest isn't able to. Then he plays a very familiar tune and the priest immediately recognizes the tunes. Salieri sighs, and slowly tells him that it was 'not' his work, it was Mozart's. It does not come as a surprise here: when I type Mozart in Word document, I get no spell error, but the moment I type Salieri, it is underlined in red!Poor Salieri believes he has killed Mozart, and tells the priest about his lifelong dream to be a great composer and his contempt towards Mozart, the person while reverence towards Mozart's music. Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, is a fiendish, vulgar, lascivious and crude genius who later shows his soft side while Salieri is a passionate, soft-spoken Italian who then becomes two-faced, contemptuous, and monomaniacal and later lunatic. Mozart and his wife struggle to earn money while get fame and respect, while Salieri gets money and fame but struggles to earn talent. For Salieri, it is an internal defeat and hence he tries to bring down Mozart in whichever way possible while wholeheartedly lauding his music.Much of the film is shown from the viewpoint of Salieri, but then shifts to Mozart's own personal life and hardships. The maid has been thoughtfully kept so that Salieri is able to tell from Mozart's point of view, in case some would be wondering how Salieri knew so much about Mozart's personal life. When Salieri tells about his first experience with Mozart, where the latter is shamelessly caressing his lover under the table in the palace, Mozart plays by telling his lover then wife, Constanze to guess the words spoken by him backwards, then speaks all lewd words. It does feel out-of-place hearing some of the lines here, especially 'eat my s**t' and 'kiss my a**' but nevertheless funny. The scenes with the Count in the palace are absolute bananas, especially to observe the stark contrast between Mozart and the others. Even Salieri's constant plotting is very interesting and enjoyable, especially his most knavish act with Constanze.'Amadeus', however, fails to provide a thorough justification to its initial build-up. We know how Salieri loved Mozart's music but hated Mozart himself but the moment Salieri's role diminishes and the focus shifts to Mozart, it is difficult to actually sympathize with Salieri's guilt. It is a very common phenomenon, like if we have one actor playing a character for a period of time and then another actor takes his/her place and the audience feels a bit alienated. Also, Tom Hulce gave his Mozart a one-dimensional comic book quality that showed him throughout the 160 minutes of the film as a person of mediocre talents except when playing in those operas in the theater. It is almost impossible to believe that this Mozart was so profound, and 'Figaro' and 'Requiem' were his compositions. I'm not saying that an artist has to have that aura always; I have foul-mouthed, alcoholic, erratic friends who are good actors/musicians/composers/businessmen but these people had a certain quality in them that I could associate with their talent. And this erratic Mozart should have had that quality in him throughout the movie which could make me believe that he was the Mozart indeed. And the incongruous accent doesn't help either.Salieri is played beautifully by F. Murray Abraham; his effectively gives his character the shiftiness while advising Mozart and honestly while praising his music. But I found the climactic scene between the two characters to be somewhat underwhelming; I know it was difficult to execute, but it still had to have so many more emotions stirring up in such circumstances. This also wore off the effect of the grand catharsis, which is similar but not as effective as the endings in Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove' or 'A Clockwork Orange'. Much of this I find fault with Tom Hulce's sterile performance.Out of the supporting characters, only Jeffrey Jones truly succeeded in playing his character with the right comedic seriousness. Elizabeth Berridge was competent but inconsistent, her accent not helping much either. The only turkey, according to me, was Simon Callow and the c-word was completely unnecessary in the movie. The music itself was brilliantly performed, all of them. One could see the faults with Salieri's congested arrangements and feel the depth of Mozart's compositions, especially in the requiem for his father. And I discovered that these compositions did have words- I was dumb enough to think these singers were warbling just notes, no words!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""A perfect harmony""","Historical dramas have been many things in the history of cinema – tear-jerking melodramas, long-winded epics, painstaking biographies – but they have rarely been such good fun as this largely fictional black comedy set in 18th century Vienna. Sometimes mistakenly referred to as a biography, Amadeus is really a cheeky historical might-have-been, a storyteller's flight of fancy.The greatness of Amadeus lies largely in its source material, a play by the renowned Peter Shaffer, who adapted the screenplay himself. Shaffer's twin Anthony was behind some of the best thrillers of the 1970s, and Peter shares his brother's dark wit, but with a mind more towards the dramatic than the suspenseful. It's true that for Amadeus he has updated a baseless rumour and embroidered the truth extensively, but this tale of childish rivalry between two classical composers is simply irresistible. The exaggeration of the characters of Mozart and Salieri, the former into a giggling schoolboy, the latter a stuffy hypocrite, drives the story forward. Shaffer weaves the myth of their antipathy into a fascinating and humorous study on fame, talent, jealousy and ego. The emphasis on Mozart's operas as turning points in the narrative, as oppose to his many symphonies or chamber music, appropriately demonstrates music as storyteller and backdrop for action.Schaffer's play may be the mighty heart of this picture, but let us not play down the skill with which it has been brought to the screen. The first thing to make an impression is the lavishness of the sets and costumes, conjuring up the excessive glamour of the era, never totally clean, always a little dusty. Director Milos Forman however has such an ability to bring our focus in so totally on the actors that he can make us forget the extravagant backdrops. In example, for the interview scenes with the older Salieri, we move from the authentic clutter and bustle of the lunatic asylum, to suddenly having the background become a black and white blur, with F. Murray Abraham and the clergyman picked out crisply upon it. Still, the director does make clever use of the production design, a chandelier glittering eerily behind Abraham mirroring the fire on which he burns his crucifix. There is much cunning editing, not just of the image but also of the music, snatches of Mozart's compositions, accompanying such visual jolts as the appearance of Leopold, at other times disappearing in the middle of a scene, leaving a feeling of emptiness hanging in the air.The cast is a good one too. F. Murray Abraham gives a masterful turn, at his best in his scenes as the older Salieri, full of wry cynicism and weary regret. Tom Hulce's Mozart is massively theatrical, but it's a hammy performance for a hammy character, and almost as much fun as watching Charles Laughton in full flow. Good as these two are, I would love to have seen the leads from the first Broadway production, Ian McKellan and Tim Curry, reprising their roles for the screen version. The standouts really are in the smaller roles, especially a witty Jeffrey Jones portraying the Emperor Joseph II as if he was some slightly incompetent manager. The almost universal American accents of the cast may seem a little unconventional, but really considering these characters would in reality be speaking German is no more or less accurate than them all sounding English. Besides it seems the smaller parts have been cast for the expressive range of their accents, some sounding bucolic, others pompous, giving us the idea of character as opposed to where they might be from.Amadeus stands out amongst historical dramas for its mix of endearing wit and reflexive look at art and genius which is intelligent but never obscure. We are fortunate that it was produced in an era when production values were high enough to make it look stunning, after the days when censorship might have diminished its sharp edge and before the time when it could have been ruined by CGI cityscapes. This is cinema with every note in place.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
nice try,"I honestly cannot fathom the enduring popularity of this film.  It is over-produced, garish and vulgar, directed with a ham-fist by Milos Forman...and would appear to be only incidentally about Mozart's music.  I know, I know, the point is that hapless, buffoonish Mozart was also, ironically, a prolific and endlessly inventive fountain of matchlessly elegant, mostly joyous and altogether perfect music (though emphatically and unfortunately not the politically astute schemer that the plodding, envious and sinister Salieri was).  However interesting the conception of this film undeniably is as a dramatic device, would not an important additional point of a biographical picture about the life and times of a composer be to attempt to somehow relate that life to the creation of his music?  I don't imagine that this relationship was quite as arbitrary and incidental as it is presented here; the music itself, and its connection with Mozart's life and soul, is given pretty short shrift, in my opinion, and is not in fact a subject at all.  The screen  is instead filled to bursting, like an over-stuffed sofa, with broad cartoonish performances, frantic cutting, goggle-eyed camera work, and hideous wigs and make-up that attempt unsuccessfully to present a highly stylised re-creation of the Eighteenth Century.  Where in all of this indigestible and copious display is the soul and spirit of Mozart's matchless elegance, lightness and clarity, which was in many ways the definitive musical expression of the soul and spirit of the Eighteenth Century itself?  Not anywhere apparent that I can detect.  If you, as a filmgoer, want to experience a magically evocative and completely realised  stylisation of the 18th C. I suggest you view ""Fellini's Casanova"" (and ignore the dubbing and stilted performances).  And if you want to see a brilliantly expressive and gorgeous film about a Great Composer (Beethoven), and his times, his soul and his music, and his enigmatic life as an artist, then seek out, and savor, ""Immortal Beloved""(1994).  A magnificent film, and everything that busy, noisy tedious and empty ""Amadeus"" is not.  Sorry, but ""Amadeus"" stinks.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lush eye candy with a minor side effect.,"When the AFI released their 100 Greatest American Films of all time I was rather disappointed to find Amadeus at 53. This movie has the best and brightest set and art direction in cinema. The directing is fabolous, the camera is perfectly placed on every scene and moves exactly as it is supose to. Cinematography hasn't been this grand since The English Patient and Road to Perdition. Amadeus can best be described as a spectacular masterpiece and a must see for any serious film viewer.Amadeus is told through flashbacks by Antonio Saleri (F. Murray Abraham). Saleri was the court composer for Emperor Joseph of Austria during the Renaissance. He is at the top of his game and thanks God for all that he has been given. Emperor Joseph hears about Mozart (Tom Hulce), a musical prodigy that composed and wrote his own operas as young as four years of age. When Mozart comes to Austria to give a private concert, he mocks and completely outshows Saleri. After this we see Saleri sink into depression, enflamed with rage at God, and wanting to kill Mozart to reclaim his glory as the emperor's favorite.During the story we see beautiful operas and plays written and composed by Saleri and Mozart. The visual effects and the sound are absolutely stunning. The pieces that are played just add to the greatness and make it irrestible to look away or take in the music.Mozart was directed by Milos Forman who directed the Oscar winner One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and later to go on to The People Vs. Larry Flynt, two Oscar wins and one nomination for Best Director. What Forman didn't realize was that he was going to peak Abraham and Hulce's careers, thus putting them out of good work that they absoluetely deserve. Both actors were nominated for Best Actor in 1984, and low and behold Abraham won. Abraham was forced to work in silly action flicks during the 90's including Survivng The Game and Star Trek: Insurrection, and a small role in Finding Forrester. Tom Hulce's career was eradicated. Hulce appeared in nothing major to this date, and remember he was nominated for Best Actor, and by the way he is very talented.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Furthermore, Tom Hulce, who plays Mozart is also astonishing.Classical music, stunning direction, breathtaking acting, lavish sets, extravagant costumes and a story that is beautifully woven into all the grandeur of this film; what can I say this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen.

Amadeus remolded by Forman,"Was Amadeus a hippie, a hedonist, a proto rock-star, a rebel, or is Forman just portraying him as such to fit the patterns of his continuing cinematic exegesis of historical figures?  Forman was raised under two dire dictatorships, the Nazi and then later the Stalinist.  No doubt that such a background fostered in his heart a dislike for all formal authority, for legalistic structures, and inspired in his mind a love for that archetypical rebel figure, the one who does not so much fight authority, because he despises it, but through virtue of higher alligence, to his own personal vision or inspiration, simply comports his life as though authority did not exist.Mozart as presented by Forman fits this mold, and is a spiritual brother to Andy Kaufman, Larry Flint, and Randle Mc Murphy in Man on the Moon, the People vs. Larry Flint, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest respectively.  He is giving us the same character over and over again, and telling us the same story at different times and places throughout the ages. This is fair enough if Forman sees this as the essential struggle occurring within the confines of the cosmos, but does his vision also encompass the masses or is he giving us the anti- Tolstoy an view that history is driven only by the actions of a few isolated great men, visionaries and revolutionaries? Yes, I like this movie, but it does not give us the sweep and grandeur that would properly reflect the music of it's subject.  Ultimately it tells us more about it's author then it does about its main character.  Is this a case of the cannibalism of history in order to support a director's personal vision, or simple appropriation of powerful `symbolic' personalities in order to present a Manichean view of the universe? I cannot pretend to know.I know this, the film is energetic and amusing, like all of Forman's work that I have seen, and leaves the audience with a stronger feeling of connection with the misunderstood individualist visionary then it does with the gray world which is bent on crushing him, here represented by rival composer Salieri.  The best thing it can do is inspire an audience member to take the first few tottering steps out of hypnotic TV created reality and try to create a world of his own.  Why Forman hasn't gotten around to filming the life of Vincent Van Gogh is a mystery that remains unsolved.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An sensual assault.,"You have to hand it to Milos Forman, he really knows how to thrash out human experience on screen. With wonderful movies such as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The People Vs. Larry Flynt and Man On The Moon under his belt he truly is one of cinema's finest biographers. Amadeus is a curious movie, for a multiple oscar winner its rarely mentioned among peoples 'top lists'. Stanger still is the fact that its leading actors F. Murray Abraham(Salieri) and Tom Hulce(Mozart) never really achieved much in Hollywood following the success of Amadeus. A shame really as those who've watched it will know:Amadeus takes an objective view of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart by having Viennese Court Composer, Antonio Salieri narrate the tale. Salieri reveals his part in Mozart's demise and illustrates his legendary hatred for Mozart throughout the film. Yet underneath Salieri's hatred lies an admiration for Mozart's talent that stretches to adoration for Mozart's music. These conflicting emotions cause Salieri to conjure a fascinating portrayal of Mozart and his talent for the audience - Criticisms of the movie mainly revolve around the historical inaccuracies and the portrayal of Mozart himself....to these people I  say that all history is open to interpretation and that the movie itself is told from the perspective of Salieri(of whom little is actually known) who, for the purposes of the movie, resented the success and lifestyle enjoyed by Mozart - F. Murray Abraham's performance as Salieri was majestic, with his awe-stricken voice retaining an authoritative weight throughout the picture. Hulce is well cast as the giggling, and often arrogant young Mozart. Set largly in decorative opera halls and Royal Courts the sets are among the most lavish to hit film and are accompanied on screen by (inevitably) a glorious classical score(so make sure to turn up the volume) giving the audience a wonderful cinematic experience, both visually and aurally.

"""There are too many notes.""  There are too many scenes.","Shaffer adapts his play into film, which chronicles composer Antonio Salieri (Abraham) and his plot to ruin Amadeus Mozart (Hulce). Historically inaccurate, but then again it's not a biography. Even though Salieri knows Mozart is a genius, his jealousy craves the ranting towards Mozart's music, such as the Emporer's (Jones) criticism of one of Mozart's pieces having ""too many notes"". It appears Forman and Shaffer should have taken their own advice, as the film starts to drag significantly during the second half, mainly due to drawn out opera scenes. As the film comes to an end, the viewer can't help but feel satisfied by, not only a well-told story, but also (and more importantly) the brilliance of music contained in the film.

"Great Man, so-so movie","I think this bit of history is the tragedy of the Roman Catholic church as well as some more recent Christian churches in America that have lost the meaning of the word GRACE. Mozart (Amadeus) was one of the greatest classical music composers of all time. Yet he was murdered through the use of psychology by a crafty satanic jealous Catholic priest-Salieri. He could not see how God could give such a great musical gift to a man who he perceived as being toally immoral! Salieri denied the Christina faith and sold his soul to Satan like Dracula in the movie BRAM STOKER'S Dracula! Some of the world's most evil people are connected to the church! As witness to what manipuLators clergy are and were, the chess opening, The Ruy Lopez, was invented by a Spanish Bishop of the same name!So, I really think I benefit from not being accepted in church. And I think I have some evil Salieri in my own life, some smug self-righteous religious jerk who tries to destroy my life as well.

It's got director Forman's usual overuse of head shots and quick reaction shots, his usual reliance on audience reactions to carry the supposed impact of a star's performance (as seen also in his lackluster 90s bioflick, Man on the Moon), plus you've got a whopping case of historical falsification.  The whole thing about Salieri murdering Mozart is ridiculous historical fable that's been passed around by people for years, and has less validity than your average second gunner JFK story.  But viewers of this movie will, unfortunately, probably walk away from it thinking that Salieri was a bad, bad man indeed.  This is unfair to his life and his music, but the producers of this hero-worshipping (though also hero-deflating, in the modern ambigously ""realist"" style) flick couldn't care less.  I guess they just didn't see any other possibility for drama in the tale of the spoiled, brilliant musician and instead of concentrating on his professional laxitude and his obsession with sex (which did get an airing), they came up with the whole Salieri murder thing.

Everything is of highest standards in the film: plot, photography, choreography,music, acting etc. It is that rare case, when the words are not capable of expressing all the scale and beauty of the film. You have to see it, then to ponder on it, again to see it and so on. This is a real art: refined, elevated and human,inciting to fall to thinking, meanwhile giving an immense pleasure.Milos Forman, who I consider as one of the greatest movie directors of all time and with whom you have the highest possible chance to see a new masterpiece, has done an outstanding job. The film is not about music and the two composers, and therefore, can not pretend to be historically accurate (although I don't think it's far away from what was real). The film is about a genius and mediocrity, and their relationship. The film raises a question: why is that from the birth it is decided whether a man will be a genius or not. Further actions, the way of leaving, as well as personal characteristics, positive or negative, are less important. Forman masterly examines the human foibles, revealed in extreme conditions, and we start sympathizing with Salieri: it is even difficult to determine on whose side the director is. We support and like genius, but what we can do if the most part of the world is populated by the mediocre (ordinary) people? and in the final scene Salieri absolves the asylum inmates -and not only them- from the sin of mediocrity.Amadeus is a brilliant piece of the real art, shining out in twilights of today's depreciated art, including the cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It is great!,"I have seen this movie 6 or 7 times. I really liked it. Although there is some facts that they didn't happen in real life and Mozart wasn't too ""crazy"", I think the picture shows the genius behind ""the vulgar man"" as he called himself. That scenes when he writes his music are simply magnificent. The music inside his mind and he just writes it. Then how he is describing his own music. By the other side, there is no shown any pupil working with him. I know that wasn't the purpose of the director (Milos Forman), but it would be interesting at least if one of his pupils had appeared. That who finished the Requiem. But anyway, this picture is one of the best biographical pictures I have ever seen. Not for the facts but for how it is showing a ""GENIUS AT WORK""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Too Many Notes,". . . That's the way the Director's Cut struck me. Simply too much of a good thing, especially toward the end when the drama should be nearing its wrap up. We have extraneous scenes that only confuse momentum toward a dramatic finale.As for the film itself, it seems fundamentally skewed, with the author taking what appears little more that a footnote in a Mozart bio, and blowing it up to enormous proportions. The result is long on entertainment, short on history.Some films benefit from director's cuts; Amadeus does not. Fortunately, the studio cut version remains the better choice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best Picture?,"Quite simply, this is the movie the convinced me that the Academy Awards are nothing more than a popularity contest.  Not only does this film not deserve a Best Picture, it deserves little recognition except for the performance of F. Murray Abraham.  Save your time and money, see ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" instead.  At least the humor in that movie is funny (sort of).",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant,"This is possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  The movie is really about the mediocre composer, Salieri.  The title 'Amadeus' (Mozart's middle name) translated means 'gift of God.' It was Mozart's gift that has Salieri diabolically jealous.  In this way the movie becomes a study of his emotions.  As Salieri, F. Murray Abraham's Oscar-winning performance was the best I have ever seen.  The use of Mozart's music as the score is perfect. Don't stray from this movie because you think it will be boring.  'Amadeus' moves well, the narrative format keeps things going fast, it's also very funny in parts, and as the film approaches the ending it becomes very suspenseful and even a little spooky.  This movie is a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Classical music becomes FUN!,"I've seen Amadeus exactly twice now. Let's see, the first time I saw it was back in 1985 That was back when I was 16. I remember it being sort of boring, not exactly my type of movie. (If I recall, my parents didn't think it was so hot either). Well, 20 years later, I've watched this again, and my god, this is such a great and beautiful movie! The story essentially follows the last years of Mozart's young life, and his on again / off again feud with a rival composer, Salieri. Through the composition of several operas, including Figaro and the Death March, Mozart realizes that ambition can sometimes overwhelm the soul.F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart! Both are brilliant here, both deserved the academy award, but only Abraham got it. I DO like Hulce better. He's just simply amazing here. He really hasn't done anything since that closely resembles his performance here. The rest of the cast is great, including a real scene-stealer role from Jeffery Jones. He was known for his silly comedies, and this role was great to exposing audiences to another side of himself. (Oh, I could say something else here, but that would be too obvious).The costuming, decor and time period staging is done just so, but what really gets me, that this is one of the very few movies I've seen taking place in this time period that has a sense of humor about itself. I mean everyone doesn't seem to walking with a ruler down their backside, and it totally looks that living in this time period would have been, you know, fun!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The tragedy of Mozart's life,"In today's pop-fixated culture, it's easy to forget that the techniques of harmony, musicianship, and so on were invented hundreds of years ago by the classical musicians. Unfortunately, I would say by now that classical music has all but become the real alternative music these days given its minority popularity. As such, I was quite pleased to see a film about Mozart and his rivals in the world of music.It goes without saying that the film has a great soundtrack featuring many of Mozart's best loved works. It also manages to be dramatic without being too heavy. Salieri's angst balances with Mozart's silliness to keep things both entertaining, even humorous, while dealing with a dark plot of unfulfilled dreams, growing madness, and tragedy. All in all, a great film and a reminder of a time before Elvis was king.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"If you aren't deaf, this movie is definitely a 10!","I can recall no other movie employing music, especially classical music, so cleverly.Until 1984 I cared for only `classical' classical music, such as the 1812 Overture and Swan Lake.  But seeing Amadeus immediately piqued my interest in all classical music through its unique use of Mozart's music as not only a part of the plot, but also as theme music for each scene.Amadeus so moved me that I have read several books on Mozart's life.  I learned that Salieri once claimed he had killed Mozart.  However, he quickly recanted this.  Therefore, Amadeus is strictly fiction.  Once one recognizes that, he may enjoy the movie more as an entertainment than a biography, which it definitely is not.In fact, there are many theories as to how Mozart died.  One book even suggests that his wife, Constanze, poisoned him!  It is more likely, however, that he died of `natural causes,' which in 1999 could have been easily cured.Whatever the cause of Mozart's death, and whatever his personality might have been, Mozart's music is THE standard for all other classical composers. There will never be another like him.  And Amadeus gets this point across to people who aren't initially classical music fans.If this movie isn't a 10, there aren't any 10s out there!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Not only bad but an abject failure on almost every level,"I re-watched AMADEUS recently for the first time in over twenty years and, I must say, it is pretty terrible. The characters have about as much depth as those found in Coen brothers' films; the whole Mozart-Salieri is nearly totally fictional; the sordid, soap-operish (no pun intended) relationships between virtually every character are pure Hollywood pap but most importantly (and offensively), there is NO historical basis on which to portray Mozart as an over-sexed, philandering drunkard who took nothing seriously other than his own fame. Yes, I know a couple of pornographic-songs-as-bad-jokes were found in Mozart's notebooks but, beyond that, all evidence points to the fact ol' Wolfgang was ever the faithful husband (not to mention a deeply devout Christian, as well). And where did the writer come up with this idea that Mozart hated and was rebelling against Italian opera? If it weren't so prominent in the film I wouldn't take issue with it but, once again, it is completely historically inaccurate. Mozart idolized and emulated Italian opera composers and his sense of melody is equally rooted in that genre as in the German masters of his youth. In other words, the Mozart in the movie isn't even a caricature but, rather, a complete invention. Historic bone-picking aside, even if this tale were completely fictional and there was no historical figure called ""Mozart"", the movie is just awful. The corny make-up of the aging Salieri, the acting of virtually every character other than Tom Hulce's Wolfie (which is not to contradict myself, it is admittedly a good performance), the cardboard cut-out characters and melodramatic direction all add up to create a near total artistic failure.What's that sound I hear... oh yes... it's old Wolfgang turning in his grave.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Evil as a gimmick,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1984.  It is gorgeous, except for the introduction of evil in the persona of Salieri.  I was subsequently appalled to learn that this was a complete fabrication; the real Salieri was a colleague of Mozart's and was not the jealous, evil villain portrayed in the movie.  That entire plot device was artistic license to artificially dramatize the story; doing so at the expense of a real person's (living or deceased) reputation is unacceptable.  How much more I would have admired Peter Shaffer if he had not resorted to this gimmick and trashed a man's reputation in the process, especially a man who is no longer alive to defend himself.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"lush imagery, great acting","Every once in a while, Hollywood gives us a lush epic similar to the ones they made so often in the 50's.  Most of these films are not good.  Most of them are too long or are just ridiculous.  For ""Amadeus"" this is not the case.  Every wide-screen frame is lovingly packed with detail and color. It is perhaps the most beautiful movie of the 80's.  The script is impressive, and although the writers may not have been too true to history, they certainly appreciated the otherworldly genius of Mozart.  F. Murray Abraham does splendid work, and Tom Hulce is the ideal actor for the musical nut case.  (By the way, what's happened to Tom Hulce?)  The film is surprisingly witty for a period film.  Over all, ""Amadeus"" is definitely a fine epic worthy of butt-numbing for.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Glorious film achievement,"I have only seen Amadeus: The Director's Cut, so I cannot comment on the original version unfortunately. This film has reached the no.3 spot in my personal list of all time favourites. It is so gloriously enthralling to watch, it is a cinematic experience like no other. It is equally terrifying as it is hilarious. ""Do you believe in that? Fire, burning you forever after you die?"" ""Oh yes."" That short exchange between Mozart and Salieri, (no matter how inaccurate my quoting of it is, apologies if it is,) is mind-blowingly frightening. I think that this film is for lovers of great music, classical in particular, intellectuals, lovers of great cinema, and even I think, theologians. It is hard to tell, or it is for me at least, weather this film is a direct attack on God, or a fearful thought on his existence. The characters in the film certainly believe in him. Being a Christian myself, these themes were more poignant in my mind, although there are many others, including love, hate, morality, and the value of life. Overall this is an incredibly beautiful, endlessly enjoyable story, which really made me appreciate classical music more than ever before. I recommend this very highly and hope you enjoy and and enjoy thinking about its themes. It certainly left me thinking very hard, with Mozarts music playing in the background of my mind.

Great story but a tragic look at society's treatment of true genius.,"I love this movie and watch it every few months.  It is awesome and must be viewed with surround sound for the full effect.The story is compelling in the way it is told from Salieri's point of view. Salieri is an adequate composer in Vienna held in high position in the court of Emporer Joseph(Jeffrey Jones). But when Mozart arrives from Salzburg, suddenly Salieri feels threatened. Right away Salieri's image of what Mozart might be like is blown- seeing him ""rolling on the floor"" playing a childlike sex game with his future wife, Constanze. Mozart inadvertently insults Salieri at a meeting with the emperor and all the court composers so from that point on  Salieri is driven to revenge by jealousy and envy of his talent, which he hails, ""music already finished in his head, as if he were taking dictation.  Then I knew, this was no performing monkey, this was the voice of God, coming through this infantile buffoon of a man"".  (These quotes are not exactly verbatim, but you get the jist of it). This a well spent 158 minutes.  Although this is not an actual biography on Mozart, which was not the intention of Peter Schaffer or Milos Forman. The point that I derived from this film is the fact that society never appreciates true genius while they are in the present.  Mediocrity will be hailed in the present, but the true genius will be shunned (and you can see that fact true to this day).  That point is driven home as ""Amadeus"" comes to a close when you see Salieri being wheeled into the mental hospital claiming to be the patron saint of mediocrity while in the background, you hear Mozart's giggle, having the last laugh at all his rivals, in that his music will live on forever. I feel that not only did F. Murray Abraham deserve the Best Actor Award by the Academy,  I wish that Tom Hulce could have gotten it also.  It should have been impossible to exclude one, both performances played off each other perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Salieri Too!,"Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents.F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy...Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Enthralling, enchanting, edifying masterpiece","It is the early 19th century. An old man is thrown into an insane asylum after trying to commit suicide. He is Antonio Salieri and in the asylum he is visited by a priest, to whom he confesses that he killed Mozart. He then recounts his time as court composer to Emperor Joseph II of Austria. Mozart appears at the court and is hired by the Emperor to produce an opera. His genius is quite evident. Salieri is a devout Christian man and believes all musical talent and inspiration is given by God. Mozart's personal life and extracurricular activities appall Salieri. He cannot reconcile Mozart's talent and his lifestyle and sets out to drive him from the court. Initially his aim is to undermine him but over time his intentions turn deadlier.An enthralling, enchanting, edifying masterpiece. Directed by Milos Forman, who also gave us One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Ragtime and, later, Man On The Moon and The People vs Larry Flynt. Like in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, insanity is one of his themes, especially, here, the link between creative genius and insanity (this was also touched on in Man On The Moon).With this in mind, there's a lightness to the movie which propels it along. The movie could easily have been a long, linear, paint-by- numbers account of Mozart's adult life, but Forman gives his characters heaps of depth, and, as mentioned, creates a vibrancy which is very engaging.There is also plenty of darkness, and this plays off against the light on a few levels: insanity vs sanity, funny vs sombre moments, Salieri's faith vs the hedonism of Mozart (and Salieri's later doubts of his own faith). A wonderful combination of contrasts.Most of all, this is an exploration of creative genius, the genius that was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Forman, aided by Tom Hulce as Mozart, F Murray Abraham as Salieri and a wonderful orchestra and soundtrack, powerfully illustrates just how staggeringly talented Mozart was. For example, we have him writing down compositions without correction - he didn't need to play them, it was all in his head and perfectly formed. We also have Mozart dictating music he had just created in his head, showing his thought processes. His creative process is laid bare for all to see, and it is amazing.As mentioned, the soundtrack is great. Background pieces are produced well and chosen well.Both Tom Hulce and F Murray Abraham were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, and both deserved their nominations. F Murray Abraham's Salieri is a study in machinations and malevolence. Hulce is wonderfully over-the-top as the free-spirited genius Mozart. Abraham won the Oscar, but both are fantastic in their roles.Supporting cast gives solid performances. Among the cast are Jeffrey Jones, as Emperor Joseph II, and Simon Callow plus Cynthia Nixon in an early-career minor role.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent!! But far from depiction of truth,"Amadeus is an excellent movie in every sense of the word.Recreation of Mozart's heavenly music ,great acting performances by F.Murray Abraham & Tom Hulce,excellent costumes...& the list goes on.Viewer's should not be swayed away by the depictions in the movie.Mozart was well versed with compositions of every leading composer of Europe & was not God to create music out of his mind.Depiction of Mozart as an alchol addict and promiscuous are not correct.Moreover Mozart knew how to behave in front of the aristocracy.Antonio Saleiri was a great composer and never actually tried to destroy Mozart.In fact his attempt to suicide was not due to any guilt conscience but possibly due to the shock he received when he heard the news of one of his favorite disciple's untimely demise.However the movie would have been drab and boring if Mozart's biography was depicted.The plot is good and enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
*** 1/2 (Out of four),"There's a certain structure in Milos Forman's ""Amadeus"" which is bewitching in allegory, even if it proves somewhat shaky in execution.  Based on Peter Shaffer's play, ""Amadeus"" illustrates in flashback through narrator Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) the contradictive genius behind child prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce), a man with a gift for musical symphony underlying a childish, though unintentional facade.  Caught in a tug-of-war between 18th-century censorship techniques of the Viennese court of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) and his own regrettable appreciation of Mozart's revolutionary genius, Salieri embarks upon a subplot which occasionally results in him being lost in his own autobiography.  This flaw would be more glaring if it weren't for a magnificent performance by Abraham as a man slighted by divinity.The movie begins with Salieri's confession to a priest in a hospital following his suicide attempt.  After claiming to have ""killed Mozart"", Salieri proceeds to explain his motivations.  These originated with Salieri's childhood dream of becoming a ""musical instrument"" for God, only to be taunted by the Almighty through Mozart's melodious compositions. Aghast at the aspect, Salieri forsakes Him and proceeds to plan his own bitter destruction of the ""beloved of God"".Even if the film were nothing more than a costume epic, it would still be a marvel to watch.  Women in busts barely concealing their cleavage and men whose masculinity protrude through even the most rigid of wear personify the lust still inherent beneath all those layers of decoration.  Patrizia von Brandenburg's set designs are nothing short of immaculate with their lavish plethora of details.The film's goal to balance Salieri's jealousy with Mozart's musical martyrdom seems at times implausible.  If the story is seen through Salieri's eyes, how can it intrude upon Mozart's married life?  Indeed, during the film's central act, Salieri tends to disappear for long stretches at a time.Nevertheless, one could make the argument that it is necessary to detail both lives in order to show the turmoil between conservative aristocracy and Mozart's vastly underappreciated compositions.  Of course, like Forman's ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", the film makes inevitable comparisons to the modern-day debate of expression, including the emperor's traditional beliefs that there are ""too many notes!"" in Mozart's work.  This sort of modernized, countercultural philosophy is presented not only in Mozart's uninhibitedness, but also in various other elements: the unapproving father, the conservative establishment and the eventual degradation of classics into more accessible media, such as the vaudevillian treatment ""Don Giovanni"" receives.  Indeed Salieri, through the amazingly subtle actions of Abraham, sees the future and ""speaks for all mediocrity"" in condemning those whose extraordinary talents put others who are merely ordinary to shame.  This is an instinctual part of human nature: from schoolboy to occupationist, from 18th-century Austria to 20th-century America, there will always be those envious of one's superior talent.  But Forman and Abraham dramatize just how hard it is to pass the torch to potential scene-stealers.  While Mozart's music may lift us to otherworldly elevations, Salieri's story entrenches us into our own humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful film!,"There isn't a bad actor here, or a bad moment, really. And the music, the music! It's wonderful.

Likewise, the opera productions are by one of the great talents of the era, Twyla Tharp. The director Milos Forman has a short resume but it's impressive, including ""Hair"" as a kind of precursor and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" as proof of some kind of higher ability. (Forman hasn't always been on target, though, notably with his highly polished but pushy and almost abusive ""Goya's Ghosts,"" which has a similar structure to ""Amadeus,"" building a large world around a true rebel artist.)Anyway, a marvelous movie, a truly lovely experience, beautifully filmed, intensely envisioned, and acted with aplomb (F.

When you try v. hard to improve but what you achieve is work, not art; but others know exactly how to create perfection. They can't tell you how they make it but bong! there comes a piece of great art.The movie is so good that the characters give me strong feelings. I pity Salieri but dislike him for not being content with his own talent.My heart ached in the scene when Salieri was conducting his own opera (the one he invited Mozart to see). He was passionate in his work & he was soo happy when he heard the applause and when he's praised by the Emperor. Another person may already be content in his position but Salieri tortured himself so much by his jealousy. He ruined his own life. This character gives me so much mixed emotions. Both Salieri & Mozart give me mixed feelings. They can be lovable, hateful & pitiful AT THE SAME TIME! (the portray that Salieri loves dessert & the happiness he shows when he's praised give him a lovable side in his character) btw, the scene when Salieri helped Mozart to write down his music is v. successful to give me strong, mixed emotions.

There it is.,"Amadeus is an almost perfect realization of its central conceit.  If you accept that conceit (and I find it tremendously entertaining to do so, for the sake of the argument) Forman's picture plays it out flawlessly, assisted by phenomenal acting: Abraham's great brooding self-hating Salieri, Tom Hulce's hilarious embodiment of Mozart as a sort of 18th century version of Jerry Lee Lewis, not to mention Jeffrey Jones' brilliant portrayal of Emperor Joseph as a stolid, well-meaning bureaucrat trying ever so hard to be a good and creative philosopher king in defiance of his true (dull) nature.  The music is performed and explained in a way that non-classicists can follow and learn from.  A moving delight that rewards repeat viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
characters act to the music love it.,"I like this movie even if I didn't like how the wife performance filled a bit flat most of the time and I had to remember that this was based on a conspiracy theory and it's not real history even if it has a lot of real history in it.Interpreting I didn't really know who to root for but slowly I realized that villain composer was really entertaining and enjoyed every morni. He has of his speechos spiteful relationship with Mozart it is just so fun to ride him torture this guy who totally does not deserve it.And that portrayal of Mozart was really good. In the beginning I hated him I wanted him to suffer because he was such an insufferable break, but I begin to get sympathy for him and he was really sad when he slowly got tortured .What I enjoyed most about the performances was how over the top they could be like. Seeing the most angry Frau on a person and Mozart making the most hilarious laughs. It just went to 10 most of the time which were amazing for this time period because it feels like it was a play for how what's the top everything was.The way the characters act to the music love it.

Outstanding production although historically inaccurate,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. The movie is visually stunning and the music is great of course. F. Murray Abraham's performance was certainly of Oscar Caliber. I have given the move a rating of ""9"". I would have given this movie a ""10"" except for the inaccuracies and, in particular, the injustice to the character of Salieri. Salieri was not the court composer when Mozart arrived in Vienna; Gluck held that post. Salieri was the conductor of the opera. When Gluck died Mozart replaced him (Gluck) as court composer. Salieri's chief ""fault"" was his own self-deprecation. He often bemoaned his own limitations as a composer. It seems that if you claim to being a failure, people are willing to believe it to be a fact. Western Society likes ""winners"". In fact Salieri was a better composer than he thought himself, if not as great as Mozart, and was an outstanding musical teacher who's pupils included Beethoven, Liszt and Schubert.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good period FICTION,"REALLY late to the show - but this was a good period movie - wardrobe production & Abraham especially as an elderly Salieri.Other than a few actual names, & a few random events very loosely interpreted as reality - this is just a purely fictional movie that simply portrays Mozart as a sort of amalgamation of many composers of the era.Here is a quote from a bio on Salieri:""Even as his (Salieri's) works dropped from performance, and he wrote no new operas after 1804, he still remained one of the most important and sought-after teachers of his generation, and his influence was felt in every aspect of Vienna's musical life. Franz Liszt, Franz Schubert, Ludwig van Beethoven, Anton Eberl, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart were among the most famous of his (Salieri's) pupils.Salieri's music slowly disappeared from the repertoire between 1800 and 1868 and was rarely heard after that period until the revival of his fame in the late 20th century. This revival was due to the fictionalized depiction of Salieri in Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus (1979) and the 1984 film version of the play.The death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1791 at the age of 35 was followed by rumors that he and Salieri had been bitter rivals, and that Salieri had poisoned the younger composer; however, this has been proven untrue because the symptoms displayed by Mozart's illness did not indicate poisoning, and it is likely that they were, at least, mutually respectful peers. Despite denying the allegation, Salieri was greatly affected by the accusations and widespread public belief that he had contributed to Mozart's death, which contributed to his nervous breakdowns in later life.""There is also no indication that Mozart was suffering from 'daddy-issues' - or that his father was overly-controlling or overly-critical of his sons life. It appears that Mozart had natural talent & a prodigy-like ability with music at a very young age, which his father simply nurtured.Anyway, enjoy the movie, beautiful sets, wardrobe, & wonderful acting for itself, while aware that this story is 90% fiction.That said, I have this on DVD & watch it about once a year - which includes a very interesting & entertaining special feature of comments from almost all the production and several of the key actors.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A study in madness,"No character other than Captain Ahab in MOBY DICK comes close to the obsessive, egotistic, insanely jealous Salieri. The music is wonderful, the sets and costumes are grand, but the performances are what really makes this the powerful film that it is.Slowly we are drawn into old Salieri's madness until we at last understand why he did what he did -- but by that time, we see what a patheic creature he is. He is, as he himself says, the ""patron saint of mediocrity."" His insane anger against God causes him to destroy himself -- and yet, he is allowed to live in order to see his own destruction.

"From stage to screen, a gem.","This is a love or hate situation.I've had friends hate this film, mainly for the historical inaccuracies, and I've had people hate it because Mozart annoyed them. Personally, I am enthralled every time I see it.The original stage play script offers a few vignettes that are missing in the film, but the heart of why Amedeus was as grand a film as a theatre experience is in the details.The scenery alone makes this film gorgeous. Ditto the costumes and the interior sets.Not a few talents were in high form as well; first and foremost F. Murray Abraham. His work here will seal him forever as one of the cinema's finest dramatic actors.Tom Hulce is also a treat, but perhaps too-often overlooked is Jeffrey Jones as Emperor Joseph II. His simple and charming performance is delicate and intentional.Much could be said, but perhaps the most important advice for viewers of this film is to take it for what it is: a rare morality play from master film makers. This is a film to think about long after it's over.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Unlike allot of films made in the last 20 years, this was actually a brilliant adaptation from the original play.  Tom Hulce was a bit of an odd choice as Mozart, (his accent slipping a bit) but he was still very convincing as Mozart. The only thing that spoils the film is that most of it isn't factually correct.  I just wish Hollywood could make more movies of this standard.

A triumph-deluxe!,"Grazie a Lei, Milos Forman for your skillful direction.  Whatever a movie is supposed to be, Amadeus is definitely it.  Although the dialogue stumbles over some colloquialisms, the movie is otherwise extremely beautiful and well-thought out.  It made me almost regret my mediocrity and sympathize with Salieri.  Almost.I first saw Amadeus in my junior year of high school, after a friend recommended it to me.  It made such an impression that I decided I was going to go to the Mozart Music Festival in Salzburg the following summer. Probably what struck me most about the film was its dramatic portrayal of Salieri, a man who blended into the 18th century music scene so well, his history can only be linked with Mozart, and although not mentioned, Beethoven, one of his later pupils.  Watching Salieri struggle with his mediocrity created a pang in my side - how often are we all forced to witness genius and know that we can never achieve it?  What is even more interesting is the dichotomy between the side of him that longs to destroy Mozart and the side of him that worships every note Mozart composes. Mozart's character was more conventional in that it portrayed an artist who falls short of his work.  ""Your majesty, I am a vulgar man, but I assure you, my music is not...""  Even if the less than factual depiction of Mozart offends some people, the dexterous use of music alone is worth watching the movie.Go see the movie already, if you haven't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The 'paupers' grave was BS. It was common during that time for non-aristocrats to be buried in 'common graves' that were re-used 10 years later. 
The bitter rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, the basis of the movie & that Salieri killed Mozart are BS & most likely come from a Pushkin short story.

"Directors Cut : No denying now, one of the top 10 best films ever","Peter Shaffer's 'Amadeus' is back on general cinema release today - in Forman's original 'Directors Cut'. With an extra 20 minutes of added footage the film that blew me away as a kid did it again.I sat like a stunned 10 year old in and was blown away all over again - I sat and laughed at Mozart's antic's, marvelled at the absolutely amazing music (especially the scene's of Mozart conducting his Operas), and gasped as he descends into an illness and madness forced upon him by Salieri.This is cinema as it's meant to be - MASSIVE. Watching it again after nearly 15 years I saw how it's influenced today's cinema - most notably 'Moulin Rouge'. Weighing in at nearly 3 hours, and with the seriousness of the film it's certainly not for lightweights - the largly empty cinema (3 other people were in there I think) a testament to that fact. I think this is a sad indication of the current filmgoing public when the horribly terrible 'Reign of Fire' was showing to a nearly sold out audience at 1.30 on a Friday afternoon (the dragon's were nice tho).This is a film that people NEED to see. It's about genius, it's about love, it's about hate, it's about tragedy. It'll make you laugh, gasp, and cry. It really is that good. If your into music the whole spectacle will make your jaw drop - if your not into music you should see the film at least 3 times until you are. It's definitely one of my top 10 all time faves.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"If you want a biography, get a textbook. If you want a story, watch this movie.","The way the tag-line is written, the movie sounds like some Disney film. Amadeus. The man. The music. The magic. The madness. The murder. The mystery. The motion picture. Anyway, this movie is very great. The acting is great, the music is great, the scenery is great. It is just one of those lovable classic films.So I guess from just the title of the movie, you can assume that this film is based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A biography if you may say. However, this movie is NOT a strict biography of Mozart's life. The movie is not a musical biography like Walk the Line or Ray. So if you were planning to learn all of the small details of Mozart's life, you ain't getting that in this movie. In fact, the background of the movie is based a lot on superstition and creative thinking with the relationship between Mozart and Salieri. We start off with Mozart's life in the movie with him proposing to Constanze, who is later known to be his wife and only wife. Before Mozart got married, there was so much more to his life as a child with the abuse of his father and having to travel all over Europe that could have supplemented his movie. Because in this movie, we learn that Mozart was not exactly a nice guy to be with. He was a social misfit, all because of a childhood he never had which was replaced by his father making him tour over Europe and showing off his musical abilities.The main premise in this movie is about Salieri and the whole idea that he might have killed Mozart. Salieri tells the story from his perspective to a priest in an asylum about Mozart. Salieri was the most famous composer in all of England, but once Mozart came about, Salieri became a has-been. This got Salieri angry and the growing jealously of Salieri got him to the point where he dedicated his whole life to destroying Mozart. And like I said before, we do not know if this is true that Salieri did kill Mozart.But enough with the negativity. I thought the acting was brilliant. Tom Hulce acts well as the unattractive and rowdy Mozart. F. Murray Abraham being Salieri was also just as great if not greater than Hulce. I mean they were both persuasive with their acting and used the material they were given for their characters and played it well. Also, there were scenes in the movie that you can tell required a lot of hard work to create because they either had a lot of men and women in the scene or because there was a great amount of sound editing going on. The director's cut clocks at three hours, but I guarantee you that you will be spell bounded for those three hours. Because although the movie does not have a fast pace, it still keeps you locked in.I would say that the movie did have some scenes were it felt kind of 80s such as Mozart's antics and sexual insinuation that was placed in the movie. But none the less, this is a great story and I am glad that it was not a strict biography, because to tell you the truth, after watching this film, I would prefer this film over a strict biography. The creativeness that Forman and Shaffer add to it makes the movie only more special.Low eight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Whoever you are, you MUST see this film","This is without a doubt my favourite film of all time. I must have seen it hundreds of times but it never fails to enthrall me, and I'm always left with a lump in my throat at the ending.Tom Hulce is amazingly convincing as the hilarious, impish Mozart, and shows his versatility - he is alternately hilarious, engaging, arrogant, endearing, loveable, infuriating, and inevitably tragic.F.Murray Abraham is also terrifyingly convincing as the demonic, possessed Salieri, and acts well with Hulce. Please, please watch this film - although if you are reading this review you probably already have - it is truly wonderful.Without a doubt the best part of the film is when Mozart re-writes Salieri's little ode for him, to the astonishment of the Emperor, Rosenburg and co. (does anyone else detest Rosenburg with a vengeance??), and this is where we are first introduced to the famous shrieking laugh! I love that laugh so much, it never fails to put me in hysterics.Anyway, to summarise: Fantastic acting, wonderful soundtrack (of course), sumptuous costumes and backdrops, gripping storyline, range of emotions..... absolutely 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Stroke of Genius,"Accessibility is the Operative Word here, in this Glorious, Off-Center Presentation on the Genius, Influential, and Beloved Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Up until the late Sixties Classical Music was often referred to as Longhair. Meaning, of course, to the Lengthy Locks of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc. It was sometimes used as a Condescension, meaning out of date, Ancient, High-Brow and such.Twentieth Century Youths and most of the Proletariat were unfamiliar, or vaguely so, of the Music or the Musicians or the Compositions that languished in thick, dusty, and heavy Record Collection Book-Albums and were considered to be boring, long, and Anachronistic to Modern Sensibilities. This was the age of Jazz, Blues, Swing, Country and Western, Pop, Rock n' Roll, Punk, and Rap/Hip-Hop.The decision to approach Mozart with a Reverential Tweakness was an Inspiration on Director Milos Forman's part. It gave Access to the Music and the Man, and Created a new appreciation for the Moderns who generally Loathed Classic Music and Opera. The Movie took much Criticism for its Bawdy, Gonzo take on a Sacred Cow.The Film is Loads of Fun with an undercurrent of Tragedy that is Beautifully Shot, Impeccably Costumed, and Superbly Acted. But most of all it is Highly Entertaining for a Mass Audience including those with little interest in the Subject or the Subject Matter.Even those with some Contempt, found in this Movie a way to Appreciate the Master, His Music, and the Period. With its Outrageous Costumes, Outdated Customs and some Hip-Lip. Simply put, this is a Modernization of Madness, both in the Film's Style and those that make up the Story.

Historically inaccurate but sublime in every other aspect,"Amadeus is a great movie and gains in quality after repeated viewing. It's right up there in my top ten list. Why historically inaccurate? Well, I am a big Mozart fan and I've read all the published letters he wrote to his father. Believe me, if Mozart had a disliking to someone, he'd mention it to his father without having reservations. If Mozart ever mentions Salieri in his letters, he refers to him as his colleague and doesn't have one nasty thing to say about him. Salieri never commissioned or helped Mozart with the Requiem score nor did he poisoned him (which also has been rumored) nor did he work him to death. I feel sorry for Salieri because he himself had only nice things to say about his colleagues. I think he deserves better and wonder why he's being portrayed as such a villain. (Bad enough for him no one knows his music...) By the way: Mozart's outrageous giggle which everyone loved and was the onset of an imitation-contest in Italy was ""made in Hollywood"". If the makers of Amadeus would have read the letters he wrote to his wife and niece, they could have dispensed with the fabricated intrigues and use factual material that would make Milos Forman's Mozart look like a choirboy.

Epic film,"Amadeus is one of my all time unsurpassed movies.It's a biopic on Mozart. In terms of plot however it does not play like a biopic. The story is about as faithful to Mozart Amadeus Wolfgang as Forrest Gump was to Forrest Gump. Mozart in Amadeus is a drunken buffoon whose music talent comes so naturally it's merely something he does between scenes for shits and giggles. The real story is how green with jelly the films narrator gets. He hates Mozart yet we rely on him to tell us the story. At any minute during the film you expect the narrator to have a fit of jealousy and stop narrating. On the contrary it never happens because the narrator is a student of music. He loves Mozart's music as do we. This only further exasperates how jealous of Mozart he must be which in turn reinforces how funny it is.I love this film for its humor, for its music and most of all for its epic depiction of envy. No film or medium better encapsulates the essence of envy than what is presented to us in Amadeus in the form of Salieri.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
unnecessarily melodramatic,"This does less than justice to Mozart as a personality, being based on the facile premise that if someone is capable both of coarse behaviour and sublime music then the music must be produced in some sense unknowingly - without a full understanding of itself - a bit like the philosophical chimp producing the complete works of Shakespeare. But of course people, and probably geniuses especially, are complex; coarseness and spirituality can both be equally genuine expressions of the same nature (though probably not at the same time!).Of course the boorish Mozart is necessary in order to concoct this pot-boiler story about the resentment of goody two-shoes Salieri; but to make your main character a bit of an a-hole is dubious policy. Wouldn't a more realistic, less febrile treatment of the man, with Haydn encouraging him rather than Salieri out to nobble him, have been more satisfying in the end?There are moments where Mozart 'the voice of God' shines through (though it would be more accurate to call him the voice of yearning for God), but they're too few in a film that is too long. The music and staging are lovely, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good theories,"The bet of making a movie about not exactly the life of Mozart but the conflict between himself and a less talented composer, Salieri was well won.

Grand and ambitious but fails in execution,"Tells a great story about the lives of Mozart and his counterpart Salieri.

yeah everyone thinks it's a classic but..,"now most classics, i can very well agree with their status, but this one i just can't understand why it's so acclaimed.. critics love bringing down any historical film down to it's artistic licences, but i'm amazed at how this one is so over-missed.. now come on Mozart speaking in an American accent, and most of the cast using contemporary dialogue.. i don't care how great the subject matter or production design is.. but really i can't overlook that fact.. A Knight's Tale having a moment where they sing Queen's 'We Will Rock You' i can enjoy, that film isn't taking itself entirely serious.. but Amadeus is!!! and there cast using american accents and contemporary dialogue in film set in Europe hundereds of years ago, is one of the biggest plot points i could think of.. i just couldn't take the film seriously, and it was pretty boring.i'm not some ignorant movie goer either.. in fact i know a hell of a lot, so don't think i'm some 14yr old movie buff wannabe..This film is seriously over-rated. Milos Forman has made many a great film (Cukoo's Nest, Larry Flynt, Man On The Moon [all set in the 20th Century i might add!]), but this in my mind was one of his absolute worst.. it's as if he was lazy enough to just leave the boom mike in shot the whole time, and leave in sounds of the crew working behind camera. .it's just that ignorant a film.It has enough fans (and oscars), that i don't think my blasting of it is going to hurt it one bit, but if you're REALLY serious about films, (and i don't just mean someone who watches a lot of films, but someone who thinks about films every other second of the day) don't go into this movie thinking it's the absolute masterpiece everyone makes it out out to be, it just isn't... the accents and dialogue totally overshadow what could have been a truly great film! because everything else is top notch.. but i can't forgive such easy and obvious mistakes in such a high profile film!!!",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cinematic Perfection,"Amadeus is cinematic perfection.  I admit I have concluded Amadeus to be my favorite motion picture of all time.  Start to finish, this film is filled with so much.  I will attempt to name just a few of it's greater elements.Firstly, after reading a couple of serious, highly regarded and obviously heavily researched biographies of Wolfgang Mozart, I was shocked and pleased to discover that Peter Schaeffer and Milos Forman had clearly not only done mountains of research to perfect their sketch of this man, but these two men interpolated every little known nuance with exquisite perfection.  Thanks to them, Mozart is alive as real on the screen as if he were alive passing you by on the avenue today.  True, there are historical inaccuracies, but clearly they meant as artistic liberties, taken to create drama and flow (they demonstrate such intimate knowledge of all the little details that they are allowed to skew the big details).  The important point is that the composite picture of this man is a brilliant recreation of real life, to the best of anyone's knowledge.The acting is remarkable.  Not only are F. Murray Abraham's rushes unforgettable and poignant, but there are so many apparent accidents with respect to other casting choices.  Hulce's uncanny portrayal is exactly as one would have imagined him after reading any of the serious bios, to say nothing of that mad cackle.  Tom Hulce, of course, is not a prolific screen actor, but this rare performance is so incredibly strong, it is as if his entire life were tailor-made for it, and his contribution to cinema is as great as any actor's simply with this one role.  Roy Dotrice as Leopold Mozart is another seemingly accidental perfection.  Leopold is played with the precise mixture of intelligence, love, misery, and pathos to be the composite of how the real man is written about.  Once again, it is as if every player had done exhaustive research, conceptualized and made their character's lives part of their own psyche so that they act and react to new situations as if they were that person.  As for Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor, he was just wickedly funny.  All in all, the acting is simply astounding.The music of Mozart has been selected for the soundtrack by true masters. The pieces used are dazzling and truly encapsulate that dichotomous sense of bliss and horror that Mozart always strove to capture.  The music leaves Mozart-neophytes yearning for more, and long-time Mozart fans cheering their favorites.  When I first watched Amadeus, I belonged to the former group. I am now proud to say I belong to the latter, and when I re-screen Amadeus, I do cheer and weep tears of joy, bliss and shiver with terror at the marvelous orchestrations.  Salieri's analysis of the music is also fascinating, if subjective.The choice of Prague as the shooting location was brilliant.  Prague in 1983 (when this film was shot) was still part of the Eastern Block of countries and, as such, was untouched and unhindered by the West.  It's cobble-stone streets, cathedrals and tenements all still stood as they did in the eighteenth century, (and in all likelihood, as they did in the fifteenth century) without the desecration of Western-style neon signs, modern architecture or other such telling signs of the twentieth century.  In other words, it is the  perfect character to play eighteenth century Vienna; in a sense, another excellent casting choice.  Together with the flawless costume design, and all the perfectly selected character actors and bit players, the deception is complete.  We are all hypnotized into believing we have arrived in Vienna c. 1780's.I love every frame of Amadeus.  The plot takes liberties, of course, but that is the very nature of cinema.  Besides the above elements, the content is full of rich and substantial themes and sub-themes, leading the audience to further provocation: hatred, anger, mediocrity, the nature of savants, prodigy, beauty, envy, vengeance, the differences between (Salieri's fleeting) form (of fame) and (Mozart's lasting) substance (of fame), and the list continues.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
For those who do not think they like Classical Music,"This movie very effectively combines Mozart's music with the plot. This movie wouldn't have been anything without Mozart's music. As it is, it is an extremely well made film. I understand that this movie is not entirely historically accurate. I don't think it is supposed to be. It takes the elements of a historical events and creates a very powerful fictional story. All the acting is superb. Murray is fantastic as Salerei. He is so hateful, so spiteful, and yet so astounded by Mozart's ability. This movie looks amazing. There is so much detail and so much texture in each scene, you can almost smell the environment. The sets are as important a character as any person in the movie. The costumes are amazing as well. I think the greatest character in this movie is the music.

Amadeus -- Genius unleashed,"Okay, ""Equus"" (by Peter Shaffer) is clever and original but a little far out. But Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" raises the ante by adding enveloping universal themes in a compelling dialog deserving of its Best Picture Academy Award. Who could not be moved by Salieri, the court composer, who initially promises to devote himself and his music to God. Only to realize that he is and will only be ""mediocre."" He is merely blessed ""with an ear"", and the knowledge, to recognize the pure beauty of the work of the silly and vulgar Mozart. As Salieri's devotion morphs into a battle against God and His instrument, Mozart, and as Salieri's schemes succeed and fail by chance and design, the twisting of Salieri's mind is depicted with the painful whisperings and gestures of hands and face (of Murray Abraham) in a way rarely seen on the screen. Iago (from Shakespeare's Othello) has nothing on Salieri. Except that Salieri has fallen and knows it and seeks absolution. As you leave the theater, you may ask why health, success, and happiness comes so effortlessly to the wicked and why the righteous are often overlooked. Or you may ask why Salieri did not simply embrace and foster the beauty in his midst. Or ask why Salieri was not satisfied with the bounty of his life. Most of us are content to hear ""the duet change into a trio into a quartet into a quintet into a sextet with more complex harmonies"" without reviling the composer. But Salieri reveals our darkside that sees another's perfect dive, perfect pass, perfect statement, or perfect notes that prompt ""why not me?"" Of course, the meaning of ""Amadeus"" -- ""God's love"" -- is not lost on the viewer and only contributes to the 10 of 10 rating the movie deserves. Kudos to Shaffer, Milos Forman (director), F.M. Abraham, Tim Hulce (who moves way beyond ""Animal House"" here to create the mathematically musical facility and obnoxiousness of Mozart), and the lighting and musical contributors in fitting the puzzle pieces together so nicely.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliance born out of stupidity,"Amadeus is the fictionalized biography of one Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most famous classical composer to ever walk the Earth. It tells the story from the point of Antonio Salieri, a contemporary composer, whose name has been largely lost to history except for those that study musical history.It's an all-around excellent period drama. The costumes and the visuals are top-notch, the score of course features some of the most recognizable pieces of classical music ever made and the production values in general are without any flaw. So it would be a pretty good film even if there was nothing else to it. But there is. This is one of my favourite character studies ever put to film. The character of Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, is a fascinating one. In this film he's portrayed as a musical savant. A buffoon of a man, endlessly consumed by the vices of drink, flesh and luxury, yet within him play the bells of heaven. The arias of God himself make themselves heard through this wreck of a man. And Salieri, a man who has dedicated his whole life to God as thanks for his musical ability, absolutely despises him because of this. Why Mozart? Why not him? What glory has this man achieved to be worthy of the kind of music he's capable of producing?And yet, despite all his flaws, despite all the contempt we heap upon him through Salieri, Mozart has redeeming qualities. His passion for music is unparalleled. His ability and sheer skill is without equals. He has flaws, vices, heavy leanings towards sin. And yet, though his music, the world is a brighter place because of him. And that has to count for something.Amadeus places the story before history. There are many facts which happened quite differently. Yet it is a masterful story. Enchanting, deeply personal, philosophical and, above all else, captivating, it will make you weep for these poor souls captured in the webs of their own mortal failings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"A Beautiful, Breathtaking Movie","This has got to be my favorite movie of all time. The music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has never been so powerful. Perfectly cast and backed up with beautiful music words cannot describe how moving and beautiful this piece of art truly is.The actors cease to be actors, they transform into their characters, and the direction is wonderful. The story is captivating, and the flashback way to do the film adds a wonderful artistic element to it. While the movie may not be historical accurate, 100%, it doesn't hurt it in the slightest bit. It achieves in great lengths in storytelling.Watching the musical grandeur, and how the classical music can affect us all is amazing. But the movie digs deeper then that, questioning the musical intelligence, relationships with God, feeling inadequate, and people's fear of mediocrity. The movie is not a biography of Mozart.The words written in the screenplay describing music are amazing.See this movie, you will not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I remember when it first came out,"When this film was released in 1984 you literally could not escape from it ads were everywhere, all over the TV and print media. My usual impulse is to refuse to see any film that gets crammed down my throat hundreds of times before it even arrives in theaters, so it can be quite some time before I get around to seeing a movie even if the reviews are generally good. My impression from the numerous trailers for 'Amadeus' was that it was a farcical treatment of a real-life classical composer, starring a man with a stupid grin wearing a fright wig, accompanied by a lot of people in 18th century garb dancing in ballrooms.Yep, that's what it was. I finally watched it last night, 30 years after Tom Hulce's ventriloquist-dummy grimace first appeared on my TV screen. It was even the ultra-long director's cut which added about 20 minutes to what would have been a long film in the first place. I finished it, but I'm really not sure why. Obviously they spent a lot of money on it, F. Murray Abraham was good, and naturally the music was good, but I don't think it lived up to the hype and accolades. Maybe my taste is all in my mouth, but I don't regret not beating down the theater door to see it 30 years ago.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
So Many Notes,"What's so wonderful about this movie is its ability to get you into the mind of the composer Salieri. Through Salieri's distorted POV we come to love Mozart and are in awe of his genius, but at the same time are blown away by his apparent lack of understanding of his own genius. We can empathize to a certain extent with Salieri, but pity him as much for his own lack of understanding of his own talent and his obsessive jealousy. Forman's movie is captivating, exciting, dramatic, funny, educational and most of all incredibly sad and beautiful. It's a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of say the 3 Best movies ever made,"This is what I call an all time favourite of mine. It is one of those films that really show what a cinematic experience is meant to be; the possibilities a movie as a medium offers, are perfectly exploided here. Nothing is left out really: The actors deliver in spades, the cinematography is stunning, the dialogues seem just to be taken from a classic drama (without ever seeming misplaced in any way), the big magic moments we love movies for so much in which characters become aware of an unbelievable, maybe bitter truth or something like that flow richly. The unique, everytime you hear it breathtakingly beautiful Music of MOAZART himself is perfectly underlying the movie; especially the REQUIEM has a fundamental meaning to the movies storyline and conclusion. All I can say: Don't miss it; the recently realeased Director's Cut is a good chance to ""seize"" this strong artificial work.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great lesson in music appreciation,"People who like classical music or Mozart in particular will love this movie. Assuming, of course, they can get past some historical inaccuracies, weird giggles or any other slight on their revered legend.But what about the vast majority of people, who don't listen to classical music? Will this movie have any hold on them? Can someone who's been shaking their booty to MTV be thrown in classical waters and be expected to learn how to swim? If it's at all possible, this movie would be the one to do it. It's about jealousy, backstabbing, mealy-mouthing, blaspheming and stolen ideas. Who can't relate to that. Who hasn't had at least one of the above directed at them?People who swear they wouldn't sit for any classical music, do it all the time when they get moved by a ""classical"" score in a movie that stealthily conveys all the emotion of the story.Amadeus spotlights the creation of and appreciation of gorgeous music as seen through the jealous eyes of a competitor who knows in his heart he could never equal it.If you're at that stage where you're yearning for something more than the beat, the riff, the homey twang, go for a little music appreciation that will knock your socks off.

A piece of music history,"In the beginning we see Antonio Salieri attempting a suicide by splitting his throat.He claims he killed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1791.He tells his story to a young priest in lunatic asylum.Milos Forman has done an excellent job in bringing the stage play of Amadeus to the big screen.The original play is the work of Peter Shaffer, who also wrote the screenplay.He earned an Academy Award nomination.The film won eight of those awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor in a Leading Role.The play happened in 1979, the movie happened in 1984.F. Murray Abraham gives an outstanding performance as Salieri.Tom Hulce was nominated for an Oscar, and his portrayal as Mozart is unique.Elizabeth Berridge is amazing as Constanze Mozart.Roy Dotice does brilliant work as the father, Leopold Mozart.Richard Frank is very good as Father Vogler.Christine Ebersole is wonderful as Katerina Cavalieri.Jeffrey Jones does good job as Emperor Joseph II.Charles Kay is great as Count Orsini-Rosenberg.The young Cynthia Nixon makes a good Lorl.The story that is told of Mozart and Salieri is most fascinating, even though it's only loosely based on their lives.It is pretty unbelievable to watch this young genius battling with his final work, the Requiem, which was left unfinished.The music we hear in this motion picture is absolutely amazing.And the way it's used...This is a classic you don't want to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mozart through the eyes of Salieri,"The life story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart told retrospectively from the perspective of his contemporary and rival, the imperial composer Antonio Salieri, who at the end of his life is confessing to a priest in a believe that he is responsible for Mozarts death. Most of the story shows last years of Mozarts life, his character, his career, his personal life and his death. The technical part is done well, especially the scenery that makes a visual impression fantastic. Mozart's music is blended into the content of the film and is a great foundation for consistently strong atmosphere. It's a shame that some potentially great scenes were somewhat ruined with very bad camera work although Forman generally did very good job. Besides the historical inaccuracies that pervade the entire film, bad reactions were provoked by the choice of Tom Hulce as Mozart. Tom did great job, he gave his best and probably did all that was asked of him but he's just not suited for the role. Shaffer and Forman vision of Mozart is maybe correct, but it certainly is different from vision of biggest par of the audience. F. Murray Abraham is brilliant in the lead role of Antonio Salieri and was rewarded for it with Oscar and a Golden Globe. The movie won 8 Oscars and it's shares that number with movies like Gandhi and Gone With the Wind. The screenplay is very good in almost every aspect besides historical inaccuracies. The characters are wonderfully developed, the dialogues are strong and most importantly the story keeps viewers to the screen for the entire 160 minutes. This is one of the titles that absolutely no one should miss, but either before or after viewing, it may be good to read historically accurate story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fantastic !!!,"That incredible piece of pure cinema from the genius director Mr. Milos Forman would never have any corrections. That man had simply shot a movie already finished in his head. And what a movie - no one has ever done - replace one phrase from the screenplay and that would be diminishment, replace one scene and the structure would fall. Mr. Forman has embodied the spirit and talent of the natural boon Mozart in this breathtaking, heart-breaking movie. It is unarguably the best motion picture ever. It is a masterful combination of acting and storytelling, of sight and sound. A work of consummate artistry and craftsmanship. My favourite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
okay pog,"A quality movie that didn't bore me for a minute. 3 hours long, and worth every minute. ALthough some part seemed a little more rushed than others, the movie has excellent pacing with great performances and set disign. Maybe the movie was shot a bit boring, although it does has good lighting effects. So i could recommend this movie to almost everyone i know that likes movies. However, personally the story itself isn't really that interseting. They did an escellent job with trying to spice things up with fiction, while keeping the mojority true to history.

awesome,"As the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions.The movie won eight Academy Awards in March of 1985. The only reason it did not win nine was that Tom Hulce was nominated for best actor instead of best supporting actor. He actually was in a supporting role, and in a strange twist of irony, F. Murray Abraham won the best actor statuette; citing probably the only time when Salieri beat out Mozart in anything.The movie itself was shot in Prague where Milos Forman said ""(It) is a gem because it's possible to pivot the camera a full three hundred and sixty degrees and never encounter a modern vision.""

Historically Inaccurate garbage,"When one makes a big screen movie like this, one expects it to be at the very least historically accurate. It is not. Depicting Mozart as some douche who got music without trying is so wrong. He might have been a douche, but he worked hard on his music. One expected to see the struggles of the musician, both external and intenral of which we see none. All we see him is bedding woman after woman. One would expect the filmmakers to have done basic research on how mozart actually helped bring music to the masses instead of reserving it for the hoiety toiety of the court which is precisely why he was more popular the Sallieri. But do we see any of that? Nope. They have made this into a petty envy movie between musicians competing for emperor's attention. There is so much surrounding the life of mozart and the changes he brought into how music was written and for whom. But the moviemakers decided we need none of that. We are content showing mozart as some sort of old timey axl rose and call it a day. I seriously dont understand why people like this. It doesnt make them any more informed about the bare history let alone develops their understanding of music. People will come out with this misinformation in their heads and feel informed.

A Tale of Envy with Mozart,"What made this film work for me was to use a man who is not a well known classical composer (Salieri) and to create a fictional tale of jealousy toward a musical genius (Mozart). Not only does this film works well on telling a fictional biography, but captures the hate and jealousy that Salieri had toward Mozart very well without going offtrack. You see why he hates Mozart, you see his anger and he does what he can to end his career and to take out his competition. The storyline is great as it is; telling the story using flashbacks and partially going back to the present, portraying Salieli as an old man, looking back at his life, narrating his ambition and his emotions at throughout the flashbacks.There were a few moments that I thought were creative. One was the music; unless you have a passion for music or are a music teacher, you will be in the same situation as I am when it comes to actually reading musical sheets. However, what worked was as you see Salieri look through Mozart's music or Mozart is focused on writing his masterpiece, you hear the music that is being read or written. Instead of having the audience wonder what the score of the music was, the film plays the music so we audiences can hear the music ourselves. Another thing that was pretty creative was the mystery. At the beginning, Salieri confessed that he killed Mozart, his plot and how he killed Mozart remains a mystery until a tragedy occurs in Mozart's life. Another good thing about this film was the fact of despite having the colorful clothing and wigs, the film gave the feeling that the film was set during the time period.The acting was pretty great in this film; really liked the actors who portrayed the characters. Tom Hulce as the childish, but musically talented Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and F. Murray Abraham as the jealous and less-known composer Antonio Salieri. The other cast members portrayed their characters well and were neither a loose end. In a way, you will feel sorry for Salieri seeing how outclass and how mediocre he is compared to Mozart. As you see Salieri and Mozart in the same room for the first time, you see the Emperor playing a piece that Salieri worked hard and diligently on. As Mozart listens to the music and talks to the Emperor, he plays the piece, without the musical sheet and improves the music as he plays it. No matter how childish and talented Mozart is and how jealous and malevolent Salieri becomes, you just can't hate these two characters. Mozart is simply just Mozart and that is his nature to have the talent and you feel only sorry for Salieri.This film deserves to be called a classic, with a well-paced strolling about jealousy, great acting, and a fictional tale that involves a lesser-known composer against a musical genius. The film is long, but doesn't give that feeling of a long movie; actually felt shorter than the actual time length. If you like these takes of a fictional tale involving historical figures, then this film is for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not as good as I had hoped,"I saw this movie last Saturday and was pretty excited because I had read all the raving reviews and heard what a masterpiece it was. Then, when I actually watched it, I was like...what's the big deal about this movie?The bad things:It was WAY too long. There's nothing wrong with long movies, but only if the story is engaging and interesting. Amadeus was just slow and boring. In my opinion, there was no reason for this film to be 3 hours long. No matter how impressive and extravagant costumes and backdrops are, it does not make a movie exciting. This is a problem I've seen in quite a few big-budget films. About two hours into the film, I got very, very sleepy and I could barely keep my eyes open (okay, this might have been because I was watching the movie at 11pm).The good things:F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce both did a good job. I didn't see a single flaw in their performances. The brief scenes of the insane asylum were effectively disturbing. The costumes, scenery, style, etc, all seemed to be intact. Giving Amadeus that quirky laugh was...a fun idea, I must admit.So the bottom line is, I won't watch this movie again but I'm glad I saw it once. And 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' was a much better film by Milos Forman.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Not entirely sure how accurate it is, but its as good a theory as any, and it definitely makes a good movie! Tom Hulce in general I don't really like, but his portrayal of Mozart is incredible.

"If I could rate a movie more than 10, I would give this 100/10..Perfection means 'Amadeus'.","Why do we watch movies; Some of us watch them to have a little fun off our daily hectic lives, others watch them to learn something in history,music and art..Amadeus does both.Either you are a fan of Music Genre or not, It is an equally mesmerizing experience.There are only few instances when a great work of literature is transformed into a great movie, this is one of them.Peter Shaffer did a great job in converting a great play into the greatest ever screenplay.These ingredients were wonderfully cooked into a delight by Milos Forman.This movie could have become a wreck if direction,costumes and cinematography would be a little flawed but Forman takes you into Mozart's time and 16th century Vienna within a minute.The costumes,sets,Make up and attire all is perfectly portrayed.When you feel the essence, the magical narration takes you on a ride you will never forget for days after watching this classic masterpiece.Mozart's music lifts the movie to staggering heights but the story telling is so light and tense simultaneously that it takes many viewings before you individually praise expertise in every aspect of this movie.It has been a great debate which of TOM HULCE or MURRAY ABRAHAM (who won best actor Oscar for his role) were better as both were equally perfect as MOZART & SALIERI respectively but strictly speaking no one can decide.It is rarest of those acting treats when you see not one but 2 actors reaching perfection in art of acting.The rivalry, the childish nature and energetic humor of MOZART and contrasting cold/calm jealousy of SALIERI look so natural and spontaneous that you never can decidedly say who over powered whom.Many people have criticized the play and the movie for historical inaccuracies but if you read further research into Mozart and Salieri, now we know its not so inaccurate.But even if it is a little,who cares.The movie makes you aware of music of MOZART and gives a great lesson of mediocrity.Not all of us are talented to be world renown,even if we have resources,talent is born within,it cannot be stopped by power nor can it be created in an Emperors palace.This message is conveyed through Salieri and Mozart's story to us to learn and think about it.There is an interesting twist at the very end which I won't explain but it does best to put an icing on an already very sweet cake.This movie won 8 Oscars and I think no movie ever deserved better.And the lately released Director's Cut makes it a MUST keep for movie library of everyone who is fan of entertainment,music and drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The movie is more like a 1984-version of 2006's ""The Prestige"" where like-minded entertainers are pitted against each other and their careers' popularities. Even though most of the characters' stories are falsified for drama, it unfolds in a very entertaining way to some of the best music you could include in a film. The staging of the characters were brilliant, the acting was superb, and the costumes really look impeccable. They actually used all-natural lighting for the entire shoot, which makes you try and wrap-your-mind around how they achieved some of those shots, especially the lighting of the opera stage.

The Crowning Jewel of Milos Forman's Career,"As well done as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is, my pick for Milos Forman's best movie and my personal favorite movie to date is ""Amadeus."" Yes it is not historically accurate. Yes it is Americans and British actors playing foreign roles with no accents. Yes it is a ""stuffy period piece."" You know what? It is also an absolute masterpiece of a movie! The story manages to work on multiple levels. Yes the surface message deals with the ""price of revenge,"" but it is so much more personal than that. We see that Sallieri has become his own worst enemy purely because he cannot let go of his jealousy. He cannot just accept the skills of others and move on with his own already successful career. This is also paralleled in the life of Mozart, shown here as a childish genius who is trapped in his own prison of inflated ego in no small part because of his father. The film covers topics of faith, the fear of failure, the dark side of entertainment, the way class and talents are not in stone and more. It works organically and manages to be incredibly captivating.Forman manages to keep the story entertaining by running his characters through plenty of emotional gamuts. At times the movie is very dramatic. Then there will be incredibly funny moments. Then there will be incredibly thoughtful moments. There is never one monotonous tone and it keeps you on your toes to see how a scene will play out. He also manages to keep an optimistic tone in spite of the darker elements. This is not just a tragic and depressing look at the decline of Mozart's career. It is a celebration of the man and the time period, with all of their faults. We know Mozart's memory still thrives through his music so why just be sad about it.A lot of credit must be given to Tom Hulce as Mozart for that. Portraying Mozart as a boorish delinquent with a brilliant talent is not only pretty accurate (We know these people in real life), but the right counterbalance to the drama. Even as he drifts into insanity and ill health, Mozart is shown as a sympathetic character who has a consistent love for creating great music if not much else.We cannot forget F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Sallieri though. The heart of the movie, Abraham brings emotional weight and human traits to a character who could simply be a typical envious character. his character also has pure intentions for making music, but he never learned how to accept humility for other talented people. Sallieri is a controlled and calculating force of envy and self-loathing and we see it all on Abraham's face and through his line delivery. Also the fact he can effortlessly pull off playing both the young and old Sallieri is an admirable feat.The rest of the supporting cast works excellently in the film, but it is Jeffrey Jones playing Emperor Joseph II that steals the show. Though not nearly in the film enough, he carries a presence both as a royal figure and being a general music illiterate. He also works as a great foil for Hulce's more comedic scenes.There is so much more that can be said about this film. The cinematography is eye popping, the sets are lavishly ornate, the costumes are all precise designed, the editing moves at a comfortable clip, the make-up work is spot-on and the performances of Mozart's classics are first rate.I just could go on, but needless to say I wholeheartedly recommend this film. It is a stunning piece of work and well worth the time of any film buff or Mozart fan!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Life as a drama,"The historical record showed no supports for the murder of Mozart by Salieri. The addition of dramatic elements always make the artistic goods more controversial but tremendous. There should be a less implication without them.The adaptation of a noted musician raised 3 aspects as Humanity, Society and Ethical (or Philosophy) respectively. After the completion of narration, the ending appeared as various subjective views of Salieri, showing the non-talents kept alive, but did nothing in their survival. This implication about the long lasting but meaningless live is a critical master mind in this movie.Before the discussion of philosophical argument, just see the most apparent human nature first. The 2 main characters: Amadeus and Salieri, reflected the human weakness of arrogance, jealously and avarice respectively. It seems that a tragedy was a must when 2 genius met but possessing an extreme opposite personality. However, there was no point that Salieri to destroy Amadeus completely who started losing his flash and becoming a frustrating live. Salieri should not been jealous anymore after the Emperor Joseph II have felt bored of Mozart's creations (loving fresh is also an ugliness of human being). His persistence to kill Mozart was that he needed himself to be unique in the field of music; title about ""the best"" was so powerful for us to ignore all morality.For social issue, an inevitable concern about money for Mozart's family was encountered. Constanze played an incredible role of the supporting women behind a successful/strange man. The only thing which she couldn't stand on the same side of her husband was economical issue. Some stuff jobs were still to be accepted even Mozart was unwilling to do it. Anyway, Constanze had made the most appropriate balance between ideal and realistic world. On the other hand, the conflict between political views with artistic idealism was much stronger and hard to be comprised. Joseph II couldn't endure the trend of his territory being dominated by aesthetic and art, instead of the ideology created by his' government. The trend of the society should be led by the utilitarianism. Joseph decided to sacrifice the unique artistic innovation made by Amadeus; even he regarded himself as full of passion in art and culture.This movie tries to let audience realize that taking revenge was equal to demolish ourselves, like the destiny of Salieri: killing his musical talent, confidence and live meaning. What he did so much and spend just get nothing at the end (an idea of Nihilism). On the contrary, Amadeus was dead in peace with a beautiful trap held by Salleri (as Amadeus still believed that Salieri was his soul mate, he would be dead in upset and anger if he found the truth).In the view of religion, was believed in God get the permanent flash? Salieri rejected him and spent for the rest of his live as a fool. If he trusted him, why does a temptations of various kinds of desire be granted to him, so as to let him suffered from it, and finally let him (even all human) have a chance to leave God's embrace. It seems to be a joke with extreme paradox: Is it possible for us with totally pure heart while taking active role for world contribution? If yes, desire is a must (but chasing it cause serious tragedy). If vice versa, it seems that escaping form sin is the only mission for human. Is such kind of live meaningful and funny? So passive!Finally, some production style is interesting in the film. First, the handling of the scene of live operas was standardized with 2 kinds of shooting view: wide shot for the whole stage performance, while using close-up/middle shots for specific audience. Such arrangement clearly showed the dignity of the opera scene, and the feeling of different characters (especially for Salieri and Joseph). The low angle shooting of Mozart monitoring the orchestra, together the real soundtrack of him, also expressed the imposing art very much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amaedus was a Christian. End of story.,"No doubt that such a background fostered in his heart a dislike for all formal authority, for legalistic structures, and inspired in his mind a love for that archetypical rebel figure, the one who does not so much fight authority, because he despises it, but through virtue of higher alligence, to his own personal vision or inspiration, simply comports his life as though authority did not exist.Mozart as presented by Forman fits this mold, and is a spiritual brother to Andy Kaufman, Larry Flint, and Randle Mc Murphy in Man on the Moon, the People vs. Larry Flint, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest respectively. He is giving us the same character over and over again, and telling us the same story at different times and places throughout the ages. This is fair enough if Forman sees this as the essential struggle occurring within the confines of the cosmos, but does his vision also encompass the masses or is he giving us the anti- Tolstoy an view that history is driven only by the actions of a few isolated great men, visionaries and revolutionaries? Yes, I like this movie, but it does not give us the sweep and grandeur that would properly reflect the music of it's subject. Ultimately it tells us more about it's author then it does about its main character. Is this a case of the cannibalism of history in order to support a director's personal vision, or simple appropriation of powerful 'symbolic' personalities in order to present a Manichean view of the universe? I cannot pretend to know.I know this, the film is energetic and amusing, like all of Forman's work that I have seen, and leaves the audience with a stronger feeling of connection with the misunderstood individualist visionary then it does with the gray world which is bent on crushing him, here represented by rival composer Salieri. The best thing it can do is inspire an audience member to take the first few tottering steps out of hypnotic TV created reality and try to create a world of his own. Why Forman hasn't gotten around to filming the life of Vincent Van Gogh is a mystery that remains unsolved.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

We even had an assignment to prove these unacceptable embellishments.As for the acting, It was OK a little dramatic at times. Also the costume design was hideous.

Close to perfection,"As this film is more of a historical fantasy than a biopic, it's perhaps too much to ask for accuracy in all the events portrayed.  However, it is a fantastic film for summoning up the rococo decadence of the 18th-century European court.  The writing is clear and believable, and the author--speaking through the character of Salieri--shows a lyrical appreciation for Mozart's musical genius.  The cinematography is fantastic, and this film contains one of the most effective visual segues I've ever seen--the visual of Mozart's scolding harridan of a mother-in-law matched with the high-pitched notes of the Queen of the Night.  With one notable exception, the actors are well-suited to their roles and play them to perfection.The exception, of course, is Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's wife, ""Stanzie."" Clearly out of her depth in this role, she seems vastly more suited to play a Valley girl than an Austrian hausfrau; in many scenes she literally seems unable to grasp the meaning of her own lines.  Perhaps her substandard performance might not have been so obvious in a lesser production, but in this film she sticks out like a sore thumb.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Marvelous, but often cut to pieces","I have seen this movie several times. In the cinema and on TV. Each time part of the original movie was cut away... therefore the sudden disgrace that befell Mozart in Vienna became incomprehensable.The scene where he took too many liberties with a student is often ommitted...There is a gaffe that will only be noticed by collectors of orders and medals. In that amusing scene where Mozart improvises a march on a theme by Sallieri the emperor wears his breast star of the Maria Theresia Order upside down! In other scenes the star is worn in the correct way.

A Cinema Gem,"Amadeus is a masterpiece for several reasons: the costumes, the music and the creative use of flashbacks (and the odd flash-forward)to name just three.It is often faulted for taking liberty with historical facts; Saliari was only 6 years older than Mozart, and Mozart trusted him with tutoring his own children in music! The two may have been at odds at times (Saliari was after all Mozart's ""boss"") but this was perhaps a bit overplayed to deepen the plot. For example, Beethoven and Haydn had several personality differences (but who didn't fight with Beethoven at some point?!!!)but the musical world is filled with such events. I find it more likely that Mozart's frail constitution and lifestyle did him in...Oh, and Mozart had another living child at the time of his death...not shown in the film...I found the second half of the film a ""downer"" as Mozart went into decline, and the film missed a great opportunity to spook the audience with Mozart's involvement in Freemasonry (chilling ceremonies) and how this association related to ""The Magic Flute"".Rock Me SaliariAmadeus ended by turning the intended target, Saliari, from villain to star both on the screen and in reality. Although great liberties were taken with the history of music, at least the costumes and mannerisms of the period were introduced to a new generation, a testament to the enduring quality of Mozart's music. The silly thread of jokes and pratfalls saved the film from the serious threat of dryness that plagues many overly-serious productions. The anti-Saliari plot is paper thin; Mozart's self-destructive lifestyle and frail constitution did him in! Abraham deserved the Oscar, but it was sad to see Hulce go empty-handed; both performances carried the film to new heights. I rate it 9 out of ten for overall effect; it transported you into a different world for a few hours, which is what good cinema should do. Highly effective entertainment/education!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Pros And Cons of Amadeus,"Pros 1. F. Murray Abraham more than deserved his Best Actor Oscar for his unforgettable performance as Salieri. He makes Salieri's frustrations and jealousy completely believable and relatable even for people like me who have never been interested in becoming a professional musician. Tom Hulce, in my opinion, would certainly have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar if he hadn't unwisely been submitted in the Best Actor category. The decision to make Mozart silly and fancy-free was controversial but makes him more relatable and understandable.2. The entire supporting cast is great. Even Elizabeth Berridge, who is usually the Amadeus cast member who gets the most flack, does a great job as Stanzi. She shows Stanzi as a woman who gives Mozart when he needs, whether he needs a friend or a kick in the rear. I especially liked all the court members like the Emperor, Chamberlain Von Strack, Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Kappelmeister Bonno as they struggle with Mozart, a music force clearly after their time. Also worth noting is Karl-Heinz Teuber's hilarious appearance as the wig salesman.3. It's no wonder this film won Art Direction & Costume Design Oscars. The set design and outfits never fail to impress. This was the first big Oscar hit to win for Best Makeup and with the gorgeous old Salieri makeup, it's not hard to see why. The makeup doesn't look fake at all.4. It goes without saying that a movie about Mozart has awesome music. It's not hard to understand why Salieri thinks Mozart has divine music talents.5. This movie has no shortage of funny parts: Salieri falling out of a kid's bed, Mozart giggling sheepishly to Katerina Cavaleri when it's revealed he's engaged, the Emperor mocking Mozart's fixation on love, etc.6. The movie does have a happy ending: Mozart dies tragically young but will live forever in his music and as for Salieri: he fought the God and the God won.7. Best Line Salieri: (referring to Mozart's Serenade For Winds) On the page it looked nothing. The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse: bassoons, trumpets. Like a rusty squeezebox. Then: high above it: an oboe. A single note standing there unwavering... until a clarinet took it over and sweetened it to a phrase of such delight. This was no composition by a performing monkey. This was a piece i'd never heard. Such longing, such unfulfillable longing.What's wrong with Amadeus? Not a dang thing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Two geniuses: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Milos Forman,"When Forman left Europe in 1968 he was a quite famous Eastern-European director mostly among the young because of his early masterpieces like: 'The Firemen's Ball' (1967) and 'The Loves of a Blonde' (1966). But when he arrived to the United States, he was just a young Eastern-European director and he had to prove his talent what he did in the 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1976) and 'Hair' (1979). He was one of the biggest and most appreciated director of Hollywood in 1984. This year he decided to make a movie about the life of Wolgang Amadeus Mozart. He decided to go back to Prague and make the film in his homeland, which he left 16 years ago. So this film is not just a fabulous film about Mozart but very important in Forman's life, because he could return back to his home, which was still suffering from the communist tyranny that time. And this detail is so essential in an Eastern-European people's life, because only we, the Eastern-Europeans, can understood that how hard the life of a Czech, Hungarian or Polish people is, if they have to leave their country. He decided to shoot in Prague instead of Vienna or Budapest, because in Vienna there are lot of modern buildings and in Budapest the communication possibilities weren't good enough that time and the price was too high. The Habsburg Empire flourished at the dusk of the 18th century, it was one of the biggest and most powerful empire in Europe. At this decadent time Mozart becomes the most applauded composer of Vienna. He was the indispensable guest of the huge and fabulous balls. Soon he becomes the reason of the intrigues of the royal palace, and the object of Salieri's jealousy. Salieri's (the royal composer) feelings about Mozart are very complex, because in one hand he hates Mozart because of his childishness, but on the other hand he admires him because of his talent. He can't get rid of this complexity all of his life even in the asylum (the pictures of the asylum are very strong, brutal disgusting but beautiful). This rivalry is noticeable between the two actors, F. Murray Abraham (Salieri) and Tom Hulce (Mozart). They were both nominated for the Best Actor Oscar but this time F. Murray 'Salieri' Abraham won. Tom Hulce's performance is also outstanding and he should have won an Academy Award too. This was the hardest decision in the history of the Oscar and nobody could have made a right decision. The costumes and the set design are also terrific. And the cinematography! Miroslav Ondricek is considered to be one of the best cinematographer since his early collaborations with Forman. And he got the Academy Award and became one of the most appreciated cinematographer in Hollywood and made such film like: 'Awakenings' (1989), 'Valmont' (1988) etc. When geniuses meet the result of their collaboration is a masterpiece. And this time that's happened. It's an essential movie of the 80s, all-time classic and the best of Milos Forman's.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The rise of genius and what comes then,"This may be a major topic for mankind's existential orientation. As soon as something special is recognized it is admired at first. But then someone is disturbed by something lying in the undescribable. Suddenly envy starts to take control. It seems to be the fate of the outstanding persons that they don't have much time left. The mediocres can't endure the outstanding and so they do everything to damage them. It's as Mr. Tyrell says to Roy Batty : ""A candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long."" And Mozart burned the whole musical universe in his 35 Years. It is important that this film shows Mozart's genius and that his music is still an immortal touch to heaven. I heard that Salieri is underrated as a composer and don't believe that he envied Mozart so much. But to me that's not important. It's a movie (and what a wonderful one). It shows (as Mozart's music) something beyond small-mindedness. A general statement of human psyche. And how the film shows it. Every second is something special. We come to see the heartbreaking downfall of a real gift to mankind and as Salieri is revited to Don Giovanni we have to witness every moment of it. In a sad way it's wonderful. Ah, yes; F. Murray Abraham is brilliant (and got an Oscar, right so), the same with Tom Hulce and the rest of the actors. Here everything is brilliant.

I watched the director's cut which is about 3 hours and to watch a film 3 hours long I had to think a lot before watching. But I must say that it was 3 hours of pure fun. The acting from both the main characters is superb. The story keeps you attached to the film always(mainly because of the acting.).

Sublime,"It's been years since I watched this movie and I forgot just how spectacular it is. There are few films that leave you pondering at the end, just taking in what you've seen after the credits roll.The direction, the acting, the sets, costumes, all fabulous and larger than life. And of course, the music, oh the heavenly music! Utterly captivated throughout the entire film, watching F. Murray's Abraham's portrayal of Antonio Salieri was quite simply, beautiful as it was cruel. You felt his pain, his anguish, he despised and revered Mozart as he despised and revered God for his predicament. Watching Salieri battle his own personal demons, his sincere longing to be known as a great composer, his frustration at his mediocrity and honest recognition of it, yet whilst he loathed Mozart, he loved him, rather was in complete awe of him and was the only one who truly understood the sheer magnificence of his work.The scene where he picks up Mozart's work, seeing the realization on his face as each time he delves deeper it becomes ever more apparent what a genius Mozart was, no corrections, no revisions, 'as if he had just written was what dictated.' The direction, hearing the music piece by piece as it is composed, I felt like Salieri, a mediocrity witnessing the sublime, heavenly talent of an evolving prodigy.There are few films that leave such an impression on you, this movie was a journey, an education, I gained a new found appreciation for classical music that I never had before because I was too naive.This masterpiece was breathtaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

How not to handle jealousy,"To me, the main theme is how someone with limited talent deals with someone else who is more talented.  Salieri is a popular mainstream composer, with a good income and power in the Viennese musical establishment.The difference between Mozart and Salieri becomes apparent at their first actual meeting.  Salieri worked very hard at a small piece with which to welcome Mozart.  Mozart hears it played once, very badly, and is able to reproduce it accurately and to improvise a continuation, discard it, and improvise a better continuation.  (The actual piece is a march from Mozart's opera ""Idomeneo"" -- and is used in Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"")Salieri is immediately struck with jealousy -- how dare God give such talent to ""that dirty-minded creature"".  He works to put down Mozart, with considerable success.  His jealousy rules his life, and leads to his madness.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Entertaining and Legend !,"it is my first time to watch a movie about music (not musical). this movie more likely a combination of drama-biography with music aroma. i didn't know too much about Mozart, all i know he was a rare-borned human whose can see the world as a ""tone language"". but i really enjoy this movie, and this movie was one kind of movie (ex: 2001:ASO) that i can re-watch it over and over without losing my interest even a small piece.the first scene not attract me too much. it starts with a dark screenplay style, a confession of a man who killed Mozart, then he turns out crazy. i just said ""wow, not bad at all, this movie has a flow-back-and-forth plot, i some kind like that plot anyway"". then, in the prison (for mental-sickness) the story untold, and a long journey of our music-legend man has began !the storyline really interesting, not losing it's grip until the end, it is light but entertaining also casual. these what make this movie great. this movie also enjoyable to any age-range and have a rich story. i personally tough this movie is the best in it's genre (biography) by far.Mozart character played really good, i mean near the highest potential and of course im not saying the act was bad, but not the greatest. i even mesmerized by Mozart character. it is amaze me, it's like im get into the movie to witness it. i don't know if this really true from the historical aspect or not, but as far i can say, Mozart is a unique character and it's like i can also feel the envy that coming to the Salieri. this movie mesmerizing.the set also beyond average. decoration is beautiful. it is old- kingdom and old-fashion set but interesting in the eye. the castle, Mozart's house, inside the kingdom, and the environment of Vienna. it show us Vienna in 19th century really convincing and i wanna sucked into the movie to witness and enjoy it. the decoration-set as i know, was the best two of all movies i watch (right below once upon a time in America).the costume-design really supports the greatness of it's decoration.all i can say for who read this, this movie is excellent. maybe not have a good cinematography as citizen kane or apocalypse now, but it is very entertaining from the other aspects. one of my 25 favorites. 10/10 thanks for the readers",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Amadeus is a symphony fuelled by envy, lust and greed.","Ohhh yes, the 180 minute behemoth that is Ama-flipping-deus! This is exactly what I wanted and more. A loud orchestral musical score, lavish period costume drama and outstanding performances. I got it all. Clearly not enough reviewers talk about this 1984 Best Picture winner. Not sure why, it's masterfully crafted. An illustrious rivalry between Court composer Salieri and young newcomer Mozart that's so tiny in scope, but epic in scale! Where do I even begin with this beauty!? Both a visual and aural treat that celebrates the work of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The sublime music is beautiful interwoven into the narrative which makes the biopic absolutely spellbinding. Salieri is just as fascinating and important as Mozart. Played phenomenally by F. Murray Abraham, Salieri is maddened with envy after discovering Mozart and his divine musical gifts. He literally utilises any means necessary to see that Mozart fails as a composer, but beneath this cold exterior is an individual who yearns for greatness. The fear of his work being forgotten and diminished by a far superior talent. It's a bittersweet tale, one that hauntingly resonates with me. Tom Hulce was impeccable as Mozart, the laugh alone was stupendously charismatic. Forman's direction was perfect, embedding luscious operas into a savage rivalry. Using classical music to push the story forward. It was just sublime, it really was. The period costumes were accurate and authentic. Vienna's rich and lavish lifestyle was conveyed eloquently. The script was sharp and injected plenty of charisma into these characters with many subtle humorous moments. The first act does take a while to get going, but once the ignition is on Amadeus is the gift that keeps on giving. So so so close to perfection.

"Just like Mozart's music, this movie is a joy for everyone","This lengthy biopic of one of the most renowned musician is filled with sad, depressing, exciting and touching moments but not a single dull one. Hell, I neither have a fascination nor knowledge on operas which constitute the majority of runtime. Every aspect of the movie has something exciting about it, be it the point of view, energy levels, actors I had no idea about etc, etc.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls the life, times and his troubled relationship with a prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) he couldn't compete with and resorted to destroy him. Mozart's passion and pure genius is identified by his father Leopold (Roy Dotrice) at a very young age and prepares him for greatness, but the tremendous expectations, his poor business and social skills leads to gambling and alcohol addiction also taking his supporting wife Constance (Elizabeth Berridge) down with him.The best part about the movie is the point of view that of Salieri who alone saw Mozart's true potential and genius and was the most affected by him. The way Abraham explains to the priest about beauty of Mozart's music, how he was never able to compete and how a God fearing just man like him resorted to low politics and scheming is one of the best performances you could come across. While featuring medleys of Mozart's popular compositions, the background score stays competent enough to make a mark of its own.

Amadeus Made Classical Music Hot--Based on One of the Great Rumors of Music History,"In recent decades, classical music has lost much of its appeal in the United States. Its reputation among young people is that it is stodgy, high-brow, and boring. But in the midst of this perceived dormancy, Paul Shaffer and Milos Forman decided on another tactic: using the power of cinema to release the power, drama and excitement of classical music. Their answer was AMADEUS, a semi-fictionalized account of the opera scene in Vienna, Austria, during the late 18th century. Although many of the finer details are fictional, the film captures a larger historical picture of the exhilarating atmosphere of the late 18th-century. At the time, the arts were climbing toward a pinnacle in Europe, and Amadeus shows how music played an unrivaled role in high culture.At the center of the film are two historical figures who were the most dominant musicians in Vienna in the late 1700's: Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The former was possibly the most popular, the most financially successful, and the most beloved composer of his day. He held the highest positions in music, including the coveted Imperial Kappellmeister, which he held for 36 years. And now most of his accomplishments and compositions are all but forgotten outside of musicological circles. The latter figure was ill-mannered and childish--an alcoholic and a spend thrift. He received only modicum pay for mediocre posts, never attaining the kind of notoriety in his lifetime as Salieri. And he died at the young age of 35. And yet his half-dozen or so operas along with many of his symphonies, concertos, masses, and chamber works are now regarded as some of the greatest music ever composed. His name has become synonymous with music itself, along with Beethoven and Bach.The play and movie by Schaffer is based on a few sources: a smaller work called ""Mozart and Salieri"" by Alexander Pushkin, the memoirs by Da Ponte, who wrote several Mozart librettos, and a strange legend passed down in musical circles. The legend says that Salieri confessed to Beethoven that he had in fact murdered Mozart.(Beethoven moved to Vienna the year following Mozart's death in 1791 and studied under Haydn and then under Salieri.) There is much dispute among musicologists concerning the validity of the legend, as well as the relationship between Salieri and Mozart. There is evidence that Salieri and Mozart collaborated on several projects. Simultaneously, there were intense rivalries between composers at the time, each trying to win royal favor which would turn into financial support for future projects.Although the legitimacy of this legend has never been substantiated, the movie is a drama characterizing Salieri as a musician who recognizes and becomes jealous of the genius of Mozart. He blames God that he was denied the talent bequeathed on a much lower order of primate, mainly Mozart. Salieri then tries to thwart Mozart's career, fearing that Mozart's genius will eclipse his own reputation. And then, Salieri conceives a hideous plan...The entire film is a confessional flashback in which the older Salieri, played with superb subtlety by F. Murray Abraham in an Oscar-winning performance, tells the story of the decade in which he and Mozart premiered their operas in Vienna in the 1780's. His confession is to a priest after a failed suicide attempt, presumably because of his guilt surrounding the death of Mozart. Unlike the coolly refined Salieri, Mozart, played by Tom Hulce in an Oscar-caliber performance, is a giggling undisciplined adolescent who avoids most of his responsibilities, except for his music. But the fact of Mozart's undisciplined attitude toward his life only infuriates Salieri all the more.As much as the characters, the other star of the show is the music. Amadeus chronicles several of Mozart's most important operas, including The Abduction from the Seraglio, The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and The Magic Flute. The highlights of the operas alone are well worth the price of admission. There are even moments explaining how Mozart wrote music in which it seems music ""came"" to him, almost dream-like, and he would write it down as if he was taking dictation. And the film also includes a couple of compositions by Salieri.The movie is an absolute triumph of cinema, combining all the best elements of a bygone era: the costumes, the architecture, the sets, the characters, and the music. As a side-note, the film was shot in Prague where several Mozart operas, particularly Don Giovanni and the Marriage of Figaro were huge triumphs. There has never been a better movie about classical music, but I hope there will be one to at least equal the spectacle that is Amadeus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

If you're after an authentic, bone-dry biography of Mozart, this isn't going to be it, and it is not intended to be, but it will likely make it to the top of the list of your all-time most favorite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Top 5 favourite films of all time,"The comments that talk about historical accuracy really annoy me. As a historian I would normally agree, but this film is based on a play, that is fictional in plot but with true side stories, music and quotes. It's amazing.Little side note for the acting of Tom Hulce... if you watch it carefully you can see how incredible the performance is. A shame he was competing with his co star for the best actor Oscar!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
My Favorite Film of 1984!,"Amadeus, without a doubt, is my favorite film from 1984. Looking in from the outside, the movie looks to be a dark, disturbing tale about the feud between legendary composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. In reality, while the film has some extremely dark moments, it is also light-hearted and quite funny. The casting is perfect. Tom Hulce as Mozart is one of the best casting of all-time, and it comes out of nowhere! The costumes are fantastic. Should I even mention the music? This film made me appreciate the fact that Mozart is one of the greatest minds in human history.In 1975, a movie was released called One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. That movie was one of my favorite films that year and also won Best Picture at the Oscars, just like this movie. Both films were directed by Milos Forman. Forman directed the heck out of the movie. Each scene was expertly staged and meaningful. Considering the world was entering the MTV stage, Forman took a giant gamble creating a three-hour long movie about classical music. That gamble paid off. I liked where he chose to shoot his film- in his native Czechoslovakia. Even though the film is set in Vienna, Prague had the scenery of what the world would look like two centuries prior.People question whether the film is historically accurate or not. From the beginning, Forman and writer Peter Schaffer made it clear that the film is only loosely based on history. Most of the movie is just a drama made to entertain. The central premise of the film is the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri. While sometimes competing against each other for commissions, the two men were actually good friends. Salieri is depicted as a loner with a religious heart but was actually a married men with eight children. So, before you decide to critique the film on its accuracy, well this what the filmmakers intended.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is in love with Wolfgang Mozart's (Tom Hulce) music. He finds it divine and out-of-this-world. Salieri, who resides on the court of Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), desperately wishes he were as good as Mozart. As a devout, religious man, he believed his talent was to praise God. He receives the shock of his life when he discovers Mozart is actually a vulgar, and rather self-centered man. He asks God why this creature deserves even better musical gifts than himself. He takes it to himself to take revenge on Mozart...and ultimately God.The movie is a period costume drama and they can be somewhat dry and stuffy if not casted well. The casting here is absolutely genius and it makes the film fun as ever. If you seen Tom Hulce's performance in Animal House, you would not expect him to play a composer. Mark Hamill was originally considered but Forman thought his Luke Skywalker persona would be a distraction. Hulce's casting is genius. He played Mozart like a 60's punk hipster, and it worked so well. That laugh, though. Very unforgettable! On the flip side, F. Murray Abraham plays Salieri with such intensity. He commanded the screen each time he was on. Whether he was imitating Mozart's father (was played wonderfully by Roy Dotrice) or just giving the overview of the story whilst in the madhouse, just stay for his performance. I also liked Elizabeth Berridge's performance as Mozart's wife, Constanze.Do I really need to mention the music? When performed well, Mozart's music is like heaven. Mozart is a genius and it amazes me he was able to create such magic at a young age. Just to think in today's age, we get Taylor Swift. Who am I to judge? There is a reason why he is one of the greatest minds in history. If you like classical music or not, you will not forget Mozart. Forman did a wonderful job in making sure Mozart's music help tell the story.Amadeus is a film that asks important questions. If you know someone who is better than you, how would you react? How would you feel? Would you do anything? Such as murder the better person, as the film suggested Salieri did in the opening scene. Jealousy is the big theme that drives the movie and it allows us to feel for Salieri when the film ended. The character of Mozart is why the film is allowed to breathe with light-heartedness and humor. History remains to be seen whether Mozart was a crude person or not or had that infectious laugh (which I hated at first). Anyhow, this is my favorite film of 1984. It delivers a blend of emotions, is well-acted and well-directed, and the music is excellent as we should expect. Apparently, the Academy agreed.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A perfect piece of cinema,"I wouldn't stop myself saying that Amadeus is one of the finest movies ever made. It is perfect in every way.Part of it is the subject matter. It is about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the famous composer. Of course, it lends itself to be the vessel of some of the finest music ever written. Mozart was a genius, but, much like his music, his entire career was filled with superfluities. For every Don Giovanni, there is a piece that should have been forgotten. But the movie is only three hours, so it showcases only the best of Mozart.It is a very fictional movie, one in which a mediocre composer, Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), fawns over Mozart (Tom Hulce), envies his talent and plots his downfall and death. The academy loved the 1984 movie, giving it 8 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role for F. Murray Abraham (though I believe Tom Hulce deserves it more), Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay from the play of the same name. The reason I say that Tom Hulce deserves the Oscar over F. Murray Abraham is not because Abraham didn't give a brilliant and nuanced performance, it's that Hulce simply is Mozart. Like Ben Kingsley is forevermore the face of Gandhi and Sean Penn is Harvey Milk. There are some roles people will always be, and that is the way it is. When people think of these real people, they see these actors instead. And also, this, of course, is a period piece. But it is arguably the most interesting you will ever see. It is light, it is dark, dramatic, romantic, beautiful and human. It is balanced, and that is really what makes a perfect movie.Each piece of this film is vital. All three hours. Every second is perfect. Every note is in place. The editing is tight, genius. Each element lends itself to the whole, and to the detail. Look at the movie for pleasure, and you'll be rewarded. Scrutinize it and you'll be amazed even more. There's nothing not to love about this movie. When you sit there, after three long hours, and want even more, there's something very, very special about the movie.This is a perfect piece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Visual and aural treat,"I first saw ""Amadeus"" in early 1985, by which time it had already been festooned with 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture. I saw it again in the summer of 2002 when it was re-released as a director's cut, an additional 20 minutes taking the total running time to a full three hours. The extra footage does not make much difference to what was already a stunning work, but the digital remastering can only help the appreciation of a glorious performance.Peter Schaffer reworked his own play to create the screenplay for this psychological and musicological struggle between the young genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) and his much less well-known contemporary Antonio Salieri (1750-1825), while Czech director Milo Forman returned to his former homeland where Prague provided brilliant settings evocative of 18th century Vienna, including the Tyl Theatre where in fact the premiere of ""The Magic Flute"" was held. Indeed the film is veritably a visual and aural feast with sumptuous costumes and sets and plenty of Mozart's sublime music.I still have some difficulty with the casting of American-accented and eternally giggling Tom Hulce as the farting but fabulous Mozart, although he is undeniably impressive. However, it is F Murray Abraham as Salieri - a man consumed by jealous over the other's precocious talent - who gives a breathtaking virtuoso performance. Inevitably, when one revisits a film after so long, one notes the subsequent career of the actors. Tom Hulce seemed to disappear, Abraham never obtained a similarly challenging role, while Cynthia Nixon (who played a maid employed to spy on Mozart) has found fame of sorts in the hit television series ""Sex And The City"".",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amadeus,"From the most important contemporary Czech director Milos Forman, whose sole work I have watched before is THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT (1996, an 8/10) and he has gotten hold of two Oscar wins for BEST DIRECTOR, one for this film and another one for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975), which seems to stay in my must-see list forever.Being illiterate to classic music, my ignorance surprisingly doesn't spoil my appreciation of this biographic masterpiece about Mozart and Antonio Salieri, a one-sided chicanery between the innocent genius and the jealousy-driven lesser-known. Scrupulously structuring, with a cut- back opening starts in the asylum, a lunatic Salieri recounts his rivalry with Mozart to a young priest who hopes to receive his confession. The story is told with intermittent elucidations from Salieri (facing the priest), to stress on the contexts of his love-and-hate battle with Mozart, whom he reckons sent by God to test his devotion and loyalty, and when he has been continuously humiliated and eclipsed by Mozart's unparalleled talent, his feeble mental state commences twisting the God's will and scheming to destroy Mozart covertly, which he has finally succeeded, but also boomeranged on himself, what's more impressively done is Mozart, even till his eternal rest, is still unaware of Salieri's shenanigans and ironically believes him as his best friend.Accompanying by Mozart's canon, the film is pristinely remarkable in almost every facet in spite of its 28 annual rings, screenwriter Peter Shaffer concocts an intriguingly dexterous storyline without confining his two protagonists into a stereotypical mire of good and evil, which are exemplified in both characters with an intelligent instillation. The two leading actors, the Oscar- winning F. Murray Abraham (whose trashy post-Oscar career is a mystery to me) and his fellow co-nominee Tom Hulce (whose ebbing post-Oscar nomination career is another case here) are beamingly satisfying to watch on screen, Abraham has more angles to show off Salieri's manifold flaws and inward confrontations; while Hulce's droll invention of an eccentric nonconformist prodigy requires more grit and artistry in my opinion (now my mind is clogged up with Mozart's squeaky and hysterical laughter). A baby-face Elizabeth Berridge and a restrained Jeffrey Jones (who could have thought he was quite handsome in his youth) have done their best bit to be the foils as Mozart's money-seeking wife and a congenial Emperor Joseph II with a meretricious taste in music respectively.Since now most biopics are in a stasis of narrative sterility and vapid resources, this film could be used as a textbook reference, picking a different position, leaving more room to let audience to do the assessment, or simply finding a more contradictory pair of a legend and his/her antagonist.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the greatest films of all time.,"Based on my experience, no film has provided the audience with a more accurate portrayal of arrogance, jealousy, hatred, and madness.You witness F. Murray Abraham gradually slip into insanity as his desire to be better than Mozart engulfs him. Tom Hulce is brilliant in this film as you watch his work take over and destroy his life. The film has an overtone of irony and atheism that comes to fruition with Mozart's unfinished composition followed by his funeral.This film gives the viewer a realistic look at life: You're born, You do great things, You are unappreciated, You die. If you are religious the last scene will leave you with the question ""If there is a god, why would he torture me like this? What did I do to deserve this?"" Which is a very important question to ask.If you are an artist, you will be able to relate to these characters better than any other film. This has been my favorite film since I was six years old and I don't foresee any film ever taking it's place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Salieri's Movie,"The modern has to be reminded that at the time of Mozart's death--at age 36--Mozart would have been regarded as something of a failure. Only a handful of his work had ever been performed in his lifetime. He did die impoverished, he did have a pauper's funeral in a common pauper's grave. He was a vulgar person, given to scatological humor, he was given to drink--and for a small person, alcohol would be more disastrous than for a larger person. (These details are well documented.)Salieri, on the other hand, was highly successful, acclaimed, and honored by the court for his musical talent.The canard about Salieri poisoning Mozart has been around since Mozart died.Salieri asks the question: How could God give someone as vulgar as Mozart genius while he, Salieri, dedicated his life to pious living in thanks for the musical talent God had given him. The viewer starts the movie towards the end of his life and he confesses that he murdered Mozart and as the film unfolds, it turns out that Salieri thinks he killed Mozart by overworking him on ""The Requium."" (This despite, in reality, Salieri had no hand in Mozart's production of ""The Requium""--that is a piece of liberty with reality.) Salieri could not be a genius but he could nurture a genius--or so he thinks in his last delusional days in an insane asylum. And Salieri--in the movie--is aware of the irony that Mozart is a genius lacking in the external trappings of genius, while he--Salieri--is a mediocrity but honored with the trappings of genius.I thought the movie excellent and worth having in one's private collection. Performances were first rate, theatrical renderings of the Mozart pieces were interesting. To ask whether the details of the film accurately reflect reality is to miss the symbolic and anagogic import the movie asks regarding the nature of creativity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
As big and dramatic as anything Mozart ever came up with,"Music, especially that of the classical variety, is capable of both great bombast and startling subtlety. So is ""Amadeus."" The film has such a grandiose scale that it is surprising to find that director Milos Forman has time to bring out the subtle nuances in the story. It's not quite perfect, and maybe a tad long (at least the director's cut is), but ""Amadeus"" is a wonderful film.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a pious composer with minimal talent, is a huge fan of the hottest thing in 18th century music: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Salieri loves the music, and is eager to meet the new genius...that is, until he meets him. Meeting Mozart is the ultimate slap in the face. Mozart is like the modern day celebrity stereotype: a hard partying, hard drinking, conceited jerk who chases anything in a dress. Salieri is so enraged that a man like this was blessed with so much talent, while he, a man who is making music for God, has so little. So Salieri begins orchestrating Mozart's downfall...This is not a true story, and it wisely never claims to be. Playwright Peter Schaffer took a rumor whose credibility is, at best, tenuous, and created a whole new story with characters that indeed lived. The filmmakers have taken the mantra, ""never let the facts get in the way of a good story"" to heart.The film is splendidly acted. F. Murray Abraham is nothing short of brilliant as the tortured Salieri. Here is a man who has given everything to write music in praise of God, only to have the promised talent go to a man who is so spoiled and crude. That would drive anyone mad. For his part, Tom Hulce makes a cartoonish character into a surprisingly three-dimensional individual, to the point where he becomes...dare I say it? Sympathetic. Elizabeth Berridge is also good as Constanze, Mozart's wife. She loves her husband, although she has a greater intuition about who his friends and enemies are. Jeffrey Jones is surprisingly good as Emperor Joseph II, the idiot king of Austria (he criticizes one of Mozart's operas for ""having too many notes"").Director Milos Forman is a terrific director. I liked ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" and based on this, I'm going to forgive him for ""Goya's Ghosts."" Forman has an eye for period detail, and we are fully transported back into the time of Mozart. It's not just how everything looks, but how people act. Sitting in chairs in the opera house, fire swallowers on the streets, etc. The only flaw is that Mozart's madness is told, but why it happens is not adequately explained.""Amadeus"" is a wonderful film, plain and simple.My rating: PG for brief nudity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Greatness and Mediocrity,"Note: this is a review of the 2002 Director's Cut which adds about twenty minutes of additional footage into the film.""Amadeus"" may be one of the greatest films of all time. It has all the great subject matter for a tragic drama; envy, greed, revenge, lust, religion, and music. F. Murray Abraham does a fantastic job as Antonio Salieri, one of the finest performances ever put to screen. It is through Salieri's eyes that we see all of the triumphs and backhanded scheming that he does to try and do everything in his power to prevent Mozart (Tom Hulce) from achieving his greatness. And you can sense the absolute humility and torture that he is subjected to as he has just enough innate talent to be one of the few to comprehend the level of Mozart's genius, but not quite enough to replicate it for himself. Tom Hulce is also very good as Mozart in his film, his obnoxious laughing is one of the many things that gives this movie a lot of charm and character.Direction, set design, costume design, cinematography, and directing all have to be applauded as well. This is a beautiful film. It's not meant to be historically authentic but it has enough ingredients of history in it to prove itself as a spicy historical fiction between the two men.Absolute must watch from me, one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Mozart's colleagues and audience may have passed such judgement as the conceited man... or is he really?

But how to come out of it is a challenge to mankind.The movie is not only tremendously beautiful and ingeniously crafted, but a movie that also invites one to reflect his/her own experience of Salieri.AMADEUS is much, much  more than entertainment.

Damn near perfect,"For some reason I never imagined that an almost three hour movie about famed composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart could be that good. Well I was incredibly wrong. Unimaginably, unfathomably wrong was I. Milos Forman's 1984 Best Picture winning film is a masterpiece. It tells the story of, obviously, Wolfang Amadeus Mozart and his life in Vienna as the drunk babbling genius whose fame and talent drove him mad. Subsequently, it's also the story of Vienna's royal court composer Antonio Salieri who is driven mad with jealousy for Mozart and his God-like composing talents that Salieri has prayed for his whole life. The film is an incredibly tale of greed and jealousy, as well as a sweeping epic that celebrates the work of Mozart on a grand scale. Even if you're not a fan of classical music, which I am not, you should still love this film for the genius that it possesses.Amadeus is a film wrought with ingenious subtleties to its plot and characters that make it incredibly impressive and fantastic to watch. The character of Mozart is portrayed so perfectly by Tom Hulce and it's one of the most well written characters I've ever seen on screen. The character goes through three phases through the film's three acts. In the first act he is the artist just trying to get recognized for the immense talent he knows he possesses. In the second act his talent becomes solidified throughout Europe, and he begins to push the limits of artistic expression. Much of the second act is spent with Mozart disobeying the royal court so that he can express the most artistic freedom he can. He becomes the embodiment of what every progressive artist wants to be. His character speaks volumes to anybody with a creative streak, and it absolutely floored me. The second act ends with Mozart conducting a performance of Don Giovanni and it is, without a doubt, one of the most moving and incredible things I've ever seen in a film.And then we reach the third act where the expressionism and talent comes crashing down on Mozart as he drives himself mad and digs his own grave for himself. We see the fall of this epic character and it is brutal. We all see it coming, but as Mozart begins to slip away from reality it is absolutely tragic and we feel a part of ourselves die with Mozart as he crumbles away in his misery.But then we have F. Murray Abraham's Oscar winning performance as Antonio Salieri which is spectacular and was just another element of the film that absolutely blew me away. His performance is damn near perfect and, once again, the character is written so incredibly well and the relationship that develops between the jealous Salieri and the oblivious Mozart is fantastic. There are scenes in the film where Mozart and Salieri are talking and Salieri is doing his absolute best to hide his seething hatred for Mozart. I can't adequately describe the excellence with which these exchanges are pulled off. You really just have to see it for yourself.Amadeus is an absolute must see. I mean it with every fiber of my being when I say that this film is a masterpiece. It's superbly directed, ridiculously well written, and stunningly acted by every member of the cast. Amadeus is truly what I would call a near perfect film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on January 27th, 1756","The most recent version of this film I saw was the three hour, R-rated, director's cut on DVD, which is most likely the only version I have seen. I never got a chance to watch it in the theaters when it originally came out. I do not think I saw it on cable or on VHS. So, it wasn't until the DVD release that I really saw this film over the last 10 or 15 years. Anyway, from what I understand, this DVD version is much more loyal to the original screenplay, than the PG-rated, theatrical version, so I guess I have the correct version needed, in order to get the full impact. However, the idea of watching the original theatrical version does intrigue me, so I'll have to do that some day for comparison purposes.Also, in the case of director Milos Forman, I have seen, multiple times, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Man on the Moon (1999), both being very good films. Forman handles this film, almost the same way he handled the other two films. Similarities, such as opening up the film, where the main character is already dead, as witnessed in Man on the Man (1999). From that point, in both films, we then see their life story through flashbacks, which eventually culminates the story back to the beginning (or is it the end?). In the case of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), it is the idea of a genius in a nuthouse, that actually makes you think of Jack Nicholson's character, as being almost synchronously aligned with Wolfgang. What it basically boils down to is, Milos Forman, was a good choice to direct Amadeus (1984).Now, let's address the elephant in the room, for those who aren't really familiar with this film. Of course, I'm referring to the opera and classical music aspect of the film. Forget what you think of classical music. Don't even think about the opera side of all of this. And, nothing against the world of opera either. I just want to make it clear to those, like myself, who aren't really into opera/classical music, not to be afraid of seeing this movie, because it's not about the classical music, it's about the movie itself. In fact, in most of this film, there are mostly scenes, where there is no music at all, because its not so much about the music, as it is about the man, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. And, let us not forget that, Mozart is still one of the most recognizable names in world history. Everyone knows who Mozart is.There is a reason this film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won 8 of them. It's already in the United States National Film Registry. This period piece takes place in the late 1700s and the film-makers deliver excellent sets, costumes and art design. The performances by the cast is astounding. F. Murray Abraham, as Italian composer, Antonio Salieri, earned his Oscar. It is something to behold as we watch his transformation throughout the film. It almost feels like it is more a film about his life, so much as, Amadeus' life. Tom Hulce as Wolfgang, who was nominated for Best Actor, but didn't win, does give the performance of his career in this film. Elizabeth Berridge is excellent as Mozart's wife, Constanze.It is amazing to think a film, with this kind of subject matter, came out during MTVs heyday and still managed to be the critical hit of that year. That is a tremendous feat. A year after this film was released, German music artist Falco released his pop hit ""Rock me Amadeus"". Although this film was apparently the inspiration for Falco's hip tune, they really have nothing to do with each other. But, what this confluence created was, the two aspects (movie and the song), became locked together and in the last 40 years since, they are almost hand-in-hand, thus giving the film that MTV credit it was looking for in the 80s and hopefully inspiring others to see this movie today, 40 years later.8.4 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A film of rare feeling and magic,"Very rarely does a film come along like this one. I remember seeing it on the BBC. As a young boy, at the time I liked Stallone and Arnie action stuff.. This was so far away from my ""zone"" that it was ridiculous. I happened to catch it right at the start and just sat down to watch.The voice of Salieri immediately spoke to me. This film in a way, is about the gradation of talent; one man who is gifted above all others ( or so he thinks) and is humble and grateful to god for his gifts, is suddenly brought to the realization that there are a few people, so far above him in talent, that he cannot even understand their method or genius. With humility he thinks ""this genius Mozart must too, be a humble, hard working man who has striven greatly for this level of talent to manifest. Of course Salieri is soon disabused of this fact. Mozart like most true geniuses creates so easily and naturally that he in a way is almost contemptuous of the toil which others must endure, to produce works which pale in comparison with his least trifle.The film is told in flashback by Salieri at the end of his life, confined in a madhouse, confiding to a young priest. He thinks that his actions lead Mozart to his death and is both proud and tormented by this. He is aware that Mozart is a ""true"" genius. Salieri has been flattered all his life with this word and he too, realizes that his great gift is the ability to discern the real thing when it is before him. He both loves and hates Mozart, as he both loves and hates himself , for being good but not great, but good enough to know good from great and being on the wrong side of the divide.This film is filled by amazing actors and every small role is memorable and brings something to it. I don't wish to cheapen the film by giving a synopsis of the plot, but I will say this - you will rarely spend a more splendid, enlightening and fulfilling couple of hours. You will go away thinking about classical music and the idea of genius and envy and you will maybe even hum the strains of Don Giovanni.. who can say fairer than that?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Best of class, and worthy","It should be noted that the playwright Peter Shaffer titled Amadeus a ""fantasy"". In fact, it is just that. It becomes a Man vs. God morality play, where in order to make the dialectic work, Salieri must be portrayed as an admirable person, and Mozart as a cretin, albeit a genius. That is the fantasy. Nothing we know about either Salieri or Mozart supports such characterizations, other than Mozart's undeniable genius. In fact, once past his striking normality (so much for the theory that madness and genius always walkhand-in-hand), we know that Mozart was a clear eyed judge of musical worth, and one of the best friends one could ever have). Moreover, we know this: Mozart was probably the greatest musical genius that ever lived, and Salieri was a routine 18th Century musician chiefly known through Pushkin's play and Rimsky-Korsakov's opera as the man who poisoned Mozart (a contention generally dismissed as false).That said, this is the finest film of its genre ever produced. Get past the characterizations, and focus on the events, as they are mostly faithful to the truth, and thus lend an essentially worthy character to the film. Those familiar with the circumstances surrounding Mozart's death, for example, and more significantly his funeral and burial, will find their treatment in this film almost supernaturally accurate. Milos Forman was either a true Mozartean, or else he really did his homework. In this film, it is as it was.The fantasy is worthy and well done, but it is essentially faux. The events depicted, however, are mostly dead-on, and they reveal not only a fascinating and compelling portrait of the age of the Viennese Enlightenment, but also the stunning appearance on that scene of the man that Goethe believed to be the greatest genius that has ever lived. It is almost uncanny how this movie captures the flavor of life in the musical firmament that traces its global humanist phenomenology to Mozart, the first free-lance composer that ever lived.But at its soul, this film is gorgeous, and magnificently captures the astonishing, unmatchable glory and humanity of the music of Mozart, which has done more to elevate the spirit of those who hear it than the works of any other man that ever lived.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Rock Me Amadeus,"What can i say that hasn't already been said? It's a fantastic film, and i can look past the historical inaccuracies. Peter Shaffer never intended it to be a 'documentary', it's a drama. Just as Pushkin (I think it was him!) wrote a play called ""Mozart and Salieri"" on how salieri had poisoned Mozart, which in the day was a popular rumour (since disproved). It's entertaining and spectacular to watch, even if you aren't a big fan of classical music. I think it's a wonderful way to bring it to the masses...after all i saw the film first when i was 13 and it spawned my now 10 year obsession with Mozart and his music. Salieri i can relate to. Who hasn't felt the desire to do something but felt inadequate ""Why implant the desire like a lust in my body, and then make me mute?""...salieri ignoring the fact that he himself was quite talented...i certainly can't write an opera, he wrote 40! I love the depiction of Salieri's battle with God, and the title could not be more appropriate ""Amadeus"" which means, beloved of God. You can empathize with both characters, Abraham and Hulce give such depth to the characters. We see that Mozart is a childish, vulgar man, in his outward attitude but when it comes to his music he is nothing but sublime and beautiful. Salieri is an insecure, talented man who seems to feel sort of like the 2nd favourite child. The scene near the end when Mozart is composing the Requiem is almost breathtaking. It lends to the imagination what the composition process might've been like for Wolfi, but most importantly it demonstrates the complex layers of Mozart's music and how well they all fit together. He writes beautiful melodies, but the structure of his music as a whole is what makes it truly amazing ""misplace one note...and the structure would fall"".",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A solid period piece,"This movie tells the story of Mozart through the eyes of his rival Salieri. It is a sumptuous period piece that is one of the better films of the eighties (though that is faint praise).Milos Forman's direction perfectly captures the grandiose, larger than life figure of Mozart. Equal strength is shown in representing intimate encounters and grand performances. Thanks to the efforts of the behind-the-scenes crew the film effortlessly transports us to 18th century Vienna. It's no surprise to note that the film won Oscars for Set Decoration & Costumes. Presumably, the fact that the film's score wasn't nominated for an Oscar must have been related to the fact that it was all previously composed. Had it not been, the score would certainly have increased the film's Oscar count to nine.One of the film's eight Oscars belongs to F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri. His was an excellent performance, certainly worthy of the accolades that it garnered. The other performances are good though it's a bit odd to see Larry 'Pinto' Kroger from ""Animal House"" as Mozart. Kind of like if Jason Biggs (of ""American Pie"" fame) were to play Bach.If there's one area that I think could use improvement it's the script. The film is a little long and tends to drag a bit, particularly if you're not much of a fan of opera. The personal stories are fairly satisfying though I felt that there was some indefinable 'spark' missing that would've propelled the plot into greatness.Minor quibbles aside, the movie earns high marks for its excellent production values and memorable performances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Genius in Music,"This film 'Amadeus' was not all about Mozart. It is actually about Salieri and his obsession with the great composer. But why this film is called 'Amadeus'? In fact the word Amadeus in Latin means 'Loved by God' which is Mozart's middle name. It is a perfect title because Mozart has so much talent that one would believe that he is loved by God so much.When Salieri first wants to meet Mozart, he is looking for a sophisticated young man. Then he finally meets him, he thinks he is crude, rude, out spoken child. During the whole movie Salieri starts to question God and why he does not give him talent, but yet Mozart. Salieri wonders why God loves Mozart and gives him so much talent when he is such an ignorant man.I loved the film and how Tom Hulce portrayed Mozart. He did a wonderful job and was so out there. I believed him and really thought I was in that time era. Also the music was fantastic and so dramatic that it added to the movie greatly. The setting was amazing and the costumes were so detailed. I loved the fantasy hats!! F. Murray Abraham did an outstanding job at playing the role of Salieri. He did the perfect job at holding back the hate of Mozart, that you would in fact not think he was acting. It was a very inspirational film!!What I didn't like about the film is that they did not get all the facts about Mozart correct. One of the things was that he had four kids and not just one. Also the fact that Salieri was not much older than Mozart, but in the film was portrayed a lot older. There wasn't much that I did not like. What I did not like about Salieri is he was a very grumpy man. And the fact that he hated Mozart but was yet there for him. Mozart was a fascinating character and a little crazy. maybe a little too crazy. Again Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham did amazing jobs on playing the roles of these two characters.Overall the movie is inspirational and captivating. The music that Mozart writes in this film is amazing and wonderful on the ears. It is a true story of jealousy and love. I would recommend everyone to see this movie if you like music. I rate this film 9 stars out of 10!!! Word Count: 414",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Marvelous Motion Picture!,"I never knew much about Mozart, just only his music. Despite the inaccuracies I have heard about this movie, it sheds a unique and brilliant light upon the man. Tom Hulce is simply wonderful as Mozart. He's clever, ingenious, funny, eccentric, and even naughty. I'm very surprised that he did not get the Oscar for Best Actor.F Murray Arahams is great in his role as a selfish, envious, competitive, and career driven colleague of Mozart, but I did not find him to be as believable as Hulce. Neither were well-known actors back in Amadeus's release, but it is fair that one of them won. On a side note, I think this movie would not have been good if it had a well-known Hollywood cast.Director Milos Forman, famous for ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", captures the film astonishingly, specifically with the opera sequences that pan back and forth between Mozart conducting and the actors on the stage performing. In addition with the opera sequences, the art direction, costume design, and the work of the cinematography is exquisite to the point that I felt like I was seeing Mozart conducting in the 1700s.This movie has it all. The Man. The Music. The Madness. The Magic. Marvelous! The Oscars were right on what this film earned. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A masterpiece of a movie,"I just finished watching the Director's Cut, which I had never seen before. It may be 3 hours long but so worth it. It's rare for me to like this type of movie, even less for so many scenes to get strong emotional reactions from me; so it's no surprise that it always makes the lists of best movies of all time. It may or may not be historically accurate but it is an amazing story nonetheless. I am not familiar with the rest of the 2 main actors' careers but I am willing to bet they never came close again to the magnificent performance they give here.
As a note, I am also willing to bet that if this movie was made now, everyone would have some sort of silly fake British accent. I don't know why this is the trend these days and this movie clearly shows how unnecessary it it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Utter nonsense,"Yes, of course, uneducated people (from one very specific country) love this nonsense. They also believe Falcos Rock me Amadeus is the peak of viennas culture. Well, were to begin? Mozart as a clown. His giggle is infantile. His behaviour before the court would have had him whipped. The wigs are... punkish? The costumes ridiculous. Salierie on the other hand is a bitter, envious moron. Nothing of this is even remotely historically correct. First of, Mozart was a serious composer. He practiced hard since childhood, hours after hours. He wrote critical and philosophical letters. On the other hand, Salieri was a serious composer with more than 40 operas written by himself. He was held in highest regard, by Mozart and other contemporaries alike.And don't get me started with the first scene, the so called ""march"" composed by Salerie for Mozart. Mozart enters the room and plays it by memory. Everyone is astonished. Why? The piece is so childish, even a monkey without any musical knowledge could have played it by memory. And do I have to mention that composers that time almost never conducted themselves? And the way he conducts. Ah... forget it. At this point I was sure, that neither the makers of this movie, nor the cast had any musical education themselves. In essence: Don't waste your time with this nonsense.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Tale of Two Musicians,"Amadeus(1984) is an epic journey into the obsession and perfection driven music life of the legendary Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  The story is told in the third person narrative by Mozart's rival, Salieri.  The film at first suggests that Mozart was murdered.  This changes as Salieri is presented as a tormented and guilt ridden man.  Milos Forman does a great job in recreating the Vienna of Mozart's time.Presents Mozart as a talented but goofy and obnoxious young musician. Salieri in his early life believes in god until he sees the greatness in a person that was obnoxious and rude.  Salieri resents god more than he hates Mozart and takes this anger out on Mozart.  F Murray Abraham gives a performance of great tragedy and high emotion.  Amadeus(1984) is half true and half fiction.What the film says is that its easiler to identify with mediocrity than it is to identify with pure genius.  After all, pure genius is something  that is a rare quality among human beings.  Even a rarer quality in the field of art and artists.  Mozart was a genius whose music at times rubbed people the wrong way.  It was his genius that gave him room to be goofy and obnoxious.Tom Hulce was the perfect actor to play Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  He portrays the famous artist with a mixture of goffiness and perfectionist behavior.  Mel Gibson tried out for the role of Mozart.  He would have been wrong for the part because he could not give this role justice.  Elizabeth Berridge as Mrs. Mozart is a mature counterpoint to the gifted but immature Amadeus Mozart.Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Andy Kaufman have many things in common.  First, the two artists did things that were ahead of their time and not well received by everyone.  Second, both upset people with their antics, behavior, and manners.  Third, both were driven artists who wanted to be the best of their craft.  Finally, both died at the age of 35 and in tragic cercumstances.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A fantastical film that I absolutely adored,"I decided to watch Amadeus because I thought it was a comedy of some sort and I just wanted to watch something to have a good time. I really was not expecting the masterpiece that I was about to watch.Amadeus is a wonderful film that portrays the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It portrays it in such a way that you are always paying attention and it never gets boring.The film is told through the eyes of Salieri. Another musician who was jealous of Mozart. I thought this point of view was absolutely astounding. Because although I loved the character of Mozart, I loved even more the character of Salieri.He is a man obsessed with being the best at music and he has offered God a lot of things in exchange for that. Actually, I really enjoyed his relationship with God. How he thought God communicated with him and sent him messages through other people.Many people don't like the film because of some historical inaccuracies, but you have to take into account that the character is told through the perspective of someone in a mental hospital. It is told through the point of view of a madman.I really loved how the film progresses. Every characters begins high up and starts its decent. For Salieri it is his madness. For Mozart, it is his alcoholism. And Mozart's family starts having money problems.They portray Mozart in such a different way. This movie shows how he is a genius, but he is no gentlemen.Another thing I really liked is how Mozart thought of music. He heard the music in his head when he was writing it. I thought that was a really nice touch. Specially in a scene in which he starts hearing music when he is talking to his mother in law.If I had one complaint it would be that it is too long. Im pretty sure that some things could be cut out. The problem is that I don't know what. Everything is amazing.If you love a good film, you should definitely watch this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Existence of a Madman..,"Amadeus is a movie about the life of Amadeus Mozart. The film depicts the troubled life that Mozart led and the people who affected his career most significantly. I thought the movie was put together well, with quite a few comedic moments which helped to soften the movie's heavy plot.The movie is constructed in a flashback method from Salieri's perspective. Mozart believed Saliari to be a trusted friend. It tells of the life of Mozart and how his brilliance often hindered his ability to have social relationships with his peers. Don't be scared yet though. The movie is not a dry documentary on the life of Mozart. It is a story about his life.I really enjoyed the movie. The costume design was fantastic. The wigs and costumes were very elaborate and set the mood for the movie. The humorous parts of the movie were well placed. They sustained the movie through its dark parts.The only thing I did not like about the movie was the opening scene. I do think that the scene with Salieri trying to commit suicide could have been more detailed. I felt as though I had to piece together the beginning instead of just enjoying it.My favorite character in the movie was Constanze Mozart, played by Elizabeth Berredge. I thought she did a great job of portraying the relationship between herself and Amadeus as sincere. During most of the movie, when their relationship seemed to be teetering on the edge of destruction, they continued to have a deep understanding of one another. I especially felt as though I could relate to her character, because it was realistic. Often times in films, relationships are characterized as always having a happy ending. It was refreshing to see a role where the relationship between two people is so troubled and yet we sense a feeling of acceptance between them.If you haven't seen this movie I definitely would recommend it. It gives a new twist to the story of Mozart's life. It is certainly not boring and mundane, as some films about historical figures may be. It has dramatic parts and very funny parts which combine to create a movie that almost anyone (with taste!) would enjoy. ********* nine out of ten stars!!!!""Looks and talent don't always go together, Katerina"" (Salieri speaking to Katerina, the woman he is attracted to about Mozart)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""That was Mozart. That! That giggling dirty-minded creature I had just seen, crawling on the floor!""","""Unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat"" and at the same time one of the greatest composers in history - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Milos Forman's film ""Amadeus"" on IMDb is classified as a historical biographical drama. It is debatable whether we can consider this film a historical biography, considering that it is mostly fiction. The characters are historical, but their lives and relationships are mostly the fruit of imagination and artistic freedoms. Drama it is, and yet, I don't remember the last time I laughed so much watching a drama. Although essentially tragic, this story was conceived and realized in an incredibly entertaining way, full of humor and gags.Mozart's fictional biography is presented from the point of view of Antonio Salieri, the court composer of the Austrian emperor. Salieri, one of the key figures of the late eighteenth-century opera, is presented here as a musical mediocrity. He longs to touch the divine through his music, lives in celibacy (in reality he had a pack of children), and is completely dedicated to his work, but he lacks talent. On the other hand, Mozart is a spoiled, vulgar, irresponsible, and self-absorbed brat, who lives a bohemian life, and is adorned with an unprecedented talent for music. He composes divine masterpieces as if he were writing them at the dictation of God himself. Salieri perceives this as God's injustice. Consumed by complexes and jealousy, he renounces God and decides to take revenge on him in the only way that seems available - by sabotaging and destroying Mozart. As he plays a devoted friend and benefactor to him, he intrigues behind his back until he drives him to premature death.This idea originated during his lifetime. A short time before Salieri's death, it was rumored in Vienna that he had poisoned Mozart, which Pushkin used in 1830 as the basis for the play ""Mozart and Salieri"". Later, Rimsky-Korsakov turned this play by Pushkin into a short opera, and in 1979, this story took its present form in the play ""Amadeus"", by Peter Shaffer. Five years later, he adapted it into a screenplay, for which he won an Oscar, one of the eight that this film got.I can't comment on the Oscar for the best picture, because I haven't seen any of the remaining nominees. Forman's Oscar-winning direction is flawless, and if you've seen the film, the Oscars for set design, costumes, and makeup go without saying. There are two more left.The music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in itself guarantees the nomination. And when it is so skillfully incorporated into the film, the Oscar is guaranteed. It is interesting that the performers in the film really play what we hear. When Tom Hulce, who plays Mozart, performs his compositions on the piano, his fingers accurately hit exactly those tones we hear in the film, even in the scene when he plays lying on his back, with arms crossed over his head. This actor spent half a year rehearsing Mozart's compositions on the piano, in order to perform them flawlessly on film. However, he only remained in the nominees for the best actor in a leading role, and I must admit that I didn't particularly like him with his Jim Carrey-ish performance.Although Tom Hulce plays Mozart, he essentially isn't the main character in this film. The main character is the character of Salieri, who was magnificently portrayed by F. Murray Abraham. Salieri is a man who drowns in complexes, jealousy, and injured ego, completely dedicated to his ""revenge"", but at the same time he is the biggest and most sincere admirer of Mozart, in whom he sees the greatest musical genius and whose compositions he sees as the embodiment of divine beauty. Torn between these two impulses, he slowly sinks into madness and, after Mozart's death and own failed suicide attempt, ends up in a madhouse. Decades later, a priest comes to the sanatorium and the whole movie is actually the confession of a dying man, torn between remorse for the injustice he did to Mozart and the feeling that he himself was a victim of God's injustice. Although Tom Hulce bounces before the eyes of the audience, trying to keep the spotlight on himself, the way Abraham presented his, essentially tragic character, is the most powerful of all the impressions that this film has left on me.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Brilliant Work From All Concerned,"Having purchased the directors cut and seen the film again for the first time in 20 years, I was amazed at how well it has held up and has refused to become dated. F. Murray Abraham, whom I first encountered in the Richard Dryefus Film, The Big Fix, gives the performance of a lifetime as the frustrated mediocrity, Salieri. Every nuance, every emotion, every single moment of subtext that passes across his face is a revelation. As a teacher of high school theater, I have often wished I could meet Mr. Abraham to tell him how much his performance moved me. Tom Hulce, as Mozart, gives a much broader, but equally affecting performance. Elizabeth Berridge, as Costanze, is perfect in her vulnerability. Milos Forman creates the correct mood with every set up, and the production design, costumes and make-up are fab. As has been stated, the movie is completely Salieri's. It's Salieri vs. god and Mozart is a vehicle for that, along with providing the perfect scoring to underpin each and every scene. I love this movie so much, that we are doing it for our high school's fall play. While the Peter Shaffer script and screenplay are much different, as befits the different media in which they are presented, they are equally powerful.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Mozart, Oh Mozart!!!","Too many bangs! Well, they don't come any better these days. Did the camera ever capture such ephemeral emotions, or did it switch to CG... well folks, this movie has too much of impossible positives, and the world can only handle so much (believe me, or read your newspaper). I'll proceed chronologically... gluttony succeeded by deflation, innocence succeeded by truth, and, guilt succeeded by absolution. Imagine a magician of colors playing to an audience of the colorblind but one. Imagine a gossamer apparatus touched by the imperfect. How does one restore back the magic? Perhaps the perfect can only come out of the imperfect. Mayhap our enemy only waits for us to spread our arms. Some things can't be undone, but some things are just meant to be.

Rocked by Amadeus!,"While not completely historically accurate, ""Amadeus"", gives a glimpse into the life and death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The story is told in first person by Antonio Salieri, a popular court composer for the Emperor of the Austrian/ Hungarian Empire at the time. Salieri begins his story as a confession to the death of Mozart to a local priest many years after the fact.Salieri, portrayed by F. Murray Abroham, recalls his initial meeting of Mozart and how he could not believe that someone of such great musical genius could be so immature. A man of God, Salieri, could not believe that the God would make his chosen child such an ignorant buffoon. The plot thickens as jealousy enrages inside of Salieri for Mozart's incredible talents, and his inability to match them.I believe the acting by both the lead roles in this film were top notch. Tom Hulce and F. Murry Abroham did an excellent job portraying men that no living generation ever new. The comic relief added to keep the film light I think was an ingenious move, Mozart's laugh, while no one really knows what it sounded like, kept the movie light and not as dramatic as it could have been. The music in this film I think just added to the film, I not only enjoyed the fact that they used actual Mozart compositions, but also that they used the perfect selections at the best points in the film. When the movie was dark and somber they chose a piece that reflected the same, when the film was light and playful the music reflected the mood.While I enjoyed the acting of both leading roles, I believe that Tom Hulce should have at least attempted a German accent as that is where Mozart was from. An American accent only made the movie seem less realistic. While the film's historically inaccuracies added to the drama of this film I would have enjoyed a little bit more accurate portrayal of Mozart's life. He had four children, in the movie they only depict that he had one. Also, Salieri in his own was extremely famous for his time, as was probably more famous than Mozart, at the time. The jealously that is described on screen was most likely never present. Overall, this film is a must see. While most people know the name Mozart, not many know the tragic, short life he lived. This movie does a fantastic job at portraying what kind of man Wolfgang Mozart was and what a musical genius he still is. I would defiantly give this movie 10 stars, the captivating acting in this film by Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abroham make up for the minor historical inaccuracies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

""Possible.""Man, this film is such a ride. You would think to yourself, wondering if you should watch it, ""well...it's a three hour long film about Mozart. Wouldn't it be exhausting? How good can it be?"". Well, ladies and gentelmen, it can be excellent. And it is.Amadeus tells the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (it's not historically accurate, it's based on urban legends and stuff) from the point of view of the old Antonio Salieri, another composer from the same era. It follows Salieri as he grow more and more hateful towards Mozart, and what it leads.This film is so packed, and it has so many things going on. It's about art, god, jelousy, regret. And it discusses all of these in such an interesting, thought provoking manner. The story is intriguing, and it made me go ""wow"" more than once, keeping me on the edge of my seat. The score was really on point, and the dialogue as well - but the acting. Oh, the amazing acting. Especially Hulce and Abraham as Mozart and Saliery...the acting was truly astounding. The relationship between the two has so much depth, and is so interesting. I could go on and on about it a long time. The set is also quite amazing, and the whole film is really immersive. I truly think that this movie has a lot going on, but not too much - each idea that pop up throughout the film is presented in a subtle, thoughtful manner, and I really appreciate that.If I have any problems with this film at all (which I wouldn't say I REALLY have), it'll be its length - yeah, it's a bit exhausting for some people to sit through three hours and watch this kind of film, with all the opera scenes (which I did like a lot but I did find them, at times, a bit too long).Anyway, I don't have any major problem with this film - it truly is an amazing piece of cinema, in my opinion.

A grand piece of work!,"Now I never been a big fan of classical music.  However, that didn't stop me from liking this film.

Amadeus is a masterpiece of spectacular performances, a great story, and music, heavenly music.  The costume and make up art is incredible in this movie as is the score which takes the place, truly of a third character in that when the main characters feel a certain way the music truly portrays it in a sympathetic fashion that hits you inside.

Great Film,"Mozart is played by young Tom Hulce and in one of the few times that two actors from the same film got nominated in the same acting category, Hulce and Abraham were both up for Best Actor and Abraham won as opposed to both of them canceling each other out. It really would be hard to live on the difference in their performances, without a good Mozart and an equally good Salieri, the film would not be the masterpiece it is.And it did win for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman and a flock of other Oscars, all well deserved.

Riveting and visually stunning biopic.,"The first time I heard of this movie was in an episode of The Simpsons. In one scene, Marge tells her kids about Mozart's life, only to be criticized by Lisa for using Milos Forman's Amadeus as a source, since said film supposedly contains few true things. That may be the case, but as long as Amadeus remains one of the best motion pictures I've ever seen, why should I care?Amadeus is a beautiful film, which deservedly won the Best Picture and Director Oscars for 1984. Most of its genius is to be found in Milos Forman's ability not to be distracted by the vastness and splendor of the production design and the costumes and focus on the intriguing plot and well constructed characters.This is obvious already in the beginning, which is one of the best ever filmed. We see a priest enter an asylum to speak to Antonio Salieri (Academy Award-winner F. Murray Abraham), once a famous composer, now a disgraced and abandoned madman. When the two meet, Salieri starts playing the piano to test the priest's musical knowledge. After two failed attempts, he finally finds something the churchman recognizes, as the latter eagerly says: ""Oh, that's charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote it"". Salieri's answer? ""I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang... Amadeus... Mozart..."". And so the story begins, told in flashback by the Italian composer.Mozart himself doesn't actually appear until about 17 minutes into the film. In fact, the strings are constantly pulled by Salieri, who starts his narration by recalling his difficult childhood and his prayer to God that he be allowed to spread His will through music. Naturally, such a thing doesn't happen. That privilege is awarded to young Mozart (Tom Hulce), who's in Vienna to perform for the Emperor (Jeffrey Jones). Imagine Salieri's surprise when he discovers that such talent can be found in a kid. Imagine his total astonishment when he realizes the ""enfant prodige"" from Salzburg is in reality a foul-mouthed, rude womanizer. The shock is too much for the envious Italian who, despite recognizing and admiring the perfection and superiority of the rival's work, vows to destroy him by any means necessary.The movie was shot almost entirely on location in Forman's home-town Prague, which perfectly captures the magic, but also the low points, of Mozart's life: from marvelous palaces and theaters to distasteful ""night-clubs"", Amadeus is a visual roller-coaster, never letting the eye rest amidst the settings of many fascinating (and shocking) events, events that form a haunting tale of jealousy and bitterness, masterfully incarnated by Abraham, a very talented actor who has sadly been confined to supporting parts ever since (his best post-Amadeus work? The Inquisitor in The Name of the Rose). Shame, because he has all the right qualities to carry an entire film. Also unjustly forgotten after this movie is Tom Hulce, who succeeds in making the great Austrian musician look like an annoying, occasionally drunk, constantly laughing (oh, that laughter is terrible) brat.Few films, particularly biopics, manage to stay interesting for all their running time. Luckily Amadeus is such a film: at almost three hours, it's consistently captivating, inspired and inspiring.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent film,"I would have preferred to have seen more of his thought processes though, because Forman's glimpse of how Mozart applied his genius is extremely exciting to watch, but short lived. Characterisations are brilliantly engineered. Salieri is scheming and yet outwardly indifferent to Mozart. We can see that he loves the music of his superior, and yet is torn apart by his own inadequacy. Inadequacy is a fitting word for Salieri's skill as portrayed by Forman, who wanted to give the greatest contrast possible in terms of the virtuosity of the two men, without making Salieri look like a complete cretin. He is, after all, known as maestro Salieri. Constanze Mozart (Elizabeth Berridge) is on first appearances a giggling girl, and yet through the course of the film we are shown that she is very shrewd, and is ruthless when dealing with finance. Roy Dotrice's Leopold Mozart has a masterful air, and maintains an oppressive paternal hold over his son even after his death, the analogy being the use of an enveloping cloak. The cloak is used as part of Leopold's street wear, but is also part of the costume of the statue in the first showing of Don Giovanni, where Salieri is certain that the imposing figure of the giant statue represents the recently deceased Leopold. In short, Forman presents us with a marvelous psychological essay on weakness and power, both superficial and real. This is obviously no average biographical motion picture, but a film conceived with an intelligence nearing that of it's subject. We are shown Mozart's virtuosity several times, which again provides wonderful excitement. He not only plays variations of his music thought up on the spot (at the party scene) but plays them in the styles of other composers, upside down. He infuriates Salieri by arranging a welcoming march actually written for Mozart (and taken to be wonderful by the Italian up to this point), showing off his outstanding skills whilst looking around at the assembled courtiers and cackling with glee. Those who have watched this scene with me have either laughed or smiled in sheer wonderment at a majestic combination of music, acting and direction. This film is a gem, combining sometimes ridiculous comedy with deep tragedy. On the negative side, it would benefit opera buffs more than concert goers, because opera is the dominant musical genre of the movie. (Specially designed opera productions have been woven into the film; greatly extending it's length but adding that extra colour and vibrancy). The film becomes heavy and slow moving as it nears its astonishingly refreshing conclusion at the lunatic asylum, noticeable largely due to the contrast with a lighter beginning. This may test the patience of some viewers, but once the credits roll, I guarantee that the majority of those who have watched Amadeus will be struck by the passing of such a wonderfully colourful and rewarding masterpiece, and will not want to move from their seats until the tranquil piano concerto fades away. The film deserves all its eight Oscars, and I give it 9 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Miraculous,"This has got to be my favourite film of all time.A masterpiece,a delightful film from start to finish with injections of humour and sadness interwoven throughout. Milos knew this man as if he was alive at the time of direction and proceeded as if Mozart guided his hand and eye.Many an oil painting which could have been hung in the greatest galleries throughout the world from many stills which I,m sure were intentional from this film with such masterful direction.How many of us recognise the jealousy if we,re honest with ourselves has Milos picked out and shown from saltier I (I know I,ve spelt that wrong ,Mozart wouldn't have made that mistake)
Recognising brilliance and hurting seeing it ,again a brilliant stroke from Milos.
How many students have loved and learned from this film?
I recall seeing Oscar night on tv an constantly Hearing Amadeus Amadeus reward after reward ,but alas it wasn't till some 15 years later I actually sat down and watched this film.Bought on dvd then blu ray and still never tire of this wonderful tale of a true genius.well done Milos.R.i.p.

Amadeus - Best Film of 1983,"Not only is this the Best Film of 1984, but it also includes two of the best performances one will ever see in a film. The film is visually impressive, and the music, of course, is without peer. That alone would be worth the price of admission. However. The performances of F. Murray Abraham, as the scheming, narcissist, Salieri, and Tom Hulce as the unworldly talented, but tragic Wofgang Amadeus Mozart, are unforgettable. I saw the film almost forty years ago, and I still remember the angst of Mozart, and the preposterous pretensions of Salieri. I even remember the line spoken by the silly King Joseph, (wonderfully played by Jeff Jones) when asked what he thought of Mozart's musical debut ""Too Many Notes!"". You have not seem the best film ever made about classical music until you have seen this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fantastic movie,Great acting captures the passion these classical performers had for music. Stupendous performances and a gripping story. It is quite inspiring to witness the life of Mozart and see how undervalued a man of such talent was. It shows the jealousy and bitterness of people around us deterring us from achieving greatness. They dynamic between the actors is very nuanced and captures the complex relationship often experienced in life. This movie is a classic that will stand the test of time. It also reveals a alternate view on the classical performance world that most people don't know about. It is quite educational in addition to entertaining.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Good,but not great","I just watched the directors cut version last night. I have never seen the original version. The acting is great by all concerned,and I'm really surprised to see that none of them went on to ""big"" film starring roles after this movie.I won't get into the historical accuracy discussion,but it looks like in the end he was buried in a mass grave,and I have a hard time believing that. How could a man as famous as Mozart have been buried in a mass grave? Does anybody know if this is true?To me,the movie was enjoyable even when it wasn't all that interesting because of the quality of the acting from all involved (not just the stars),and because of the scenery. I am not very knowledgeable about classic music,and think most of what I hear on classical radio stations is about as exciting as watching grass grow. Yeah,I like certain Mozart,Beethoven,Bach,and especially violin pieces out of eastern Europe that I have heard played,but most of what they wrote is like Scotch whiskey or rap ""music"",a acquired taste.This is related to the only parts of the movie I hated,and that was the opera scenes. If your idea of good music is some woman singer shrieking at a pitch that makes dogs ears bleed,you may love it. If you don't like opera,this will definitely take away from your movie enjoyment. In fact,I suspect the reason this average movie got such high ratings is because of all the opera fans taking it as their own. The rest of the music is tolerable,and my biggest complaint about it is the rare times something popular is being played they only play a few notes of it. It is this high-pitched shrieking in the opera scenes that causes me to give this movie a 5.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Rusalka's twenty-fourth film review: A bawdy genius,"Of course, when Amadeus came out in the theaters, it was hailed as a triumph on just about every level.  It followed the prototype of big, splashy epic-like films of the early to mid-1980's (Gandhi, Out of Africa, Chariots of Fire) but this one was a bit different from all the others.  Not only was it a film about a real person, the back-bone of the film itself was its music.  And what glorious music it is!Amadeus was based on the stage play of the same name by British playwright Peter Shaffer.  It opened in New York in 1980 and starred Tim Curry as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  It won the 1980 Tony Award for Best Play and so it would only be a matter of time before Hollywood would come to call. Everything about the life story of Mozart cries out to be told in a grand epic-like film style and structure.  From the origins of Mozart's travails as he attempts to be Court Composer to Emperor Joseph the II of Austria to the writing of what some consider his finest work, the Requiem mass, it's all here.  Of course, as we all (should) know by now, much of Amadeus as both play and film is highly fictionalized.  Shaffer does a grand thing by having us want to believe the fact that Antonio Salieri actually kills Mozart, but in the end it is up to our imaginations to wonder if we are seeing the truth or not.Recently, the Director's Cut was released with an additional twenty minutes of footage cut from the original (1984) release.  If anything, the newly recovered footage draws out the story, but it also puts a bit more meat onto the bones of the life of whom many people think is the world's greatest composer of classical music.  We leave the theater (or the couch) feeling sated in our quest but always wondering could it have been true...or is this merely a great fiction just sculpted to look as if it was meant to be true.Amadeus was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, winning eight including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Set and Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Makeup. It was also nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing.My rating: 3 and a half stars",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Mediocrities, I Absolve You!","The great epic biopic, about the great epic artist himself. What's so fascinating about it, is it's style. It's refusal to be pretentious. If that's not enough, it mocks pretension by using Antonio Salieri. He's just so insufferably envious of Mozart, that he inadvertently kills him. Even after death, he can't get over how inferior he is to the master. What a great antihero. A jerk to end all jerks. Adding to the ridicule that makes Amadeus so unique, is Mozart himself. Without prior knowledge, you'd leave the film thinking that this whole time, he was an idiot savant. But perhaps, Mozart is just as colorful as his punk rock wigs... at least that would be what we all would hope for. While I don't think it's Milos Forman's best film, it's a magnificent achievement, and for the grand majority of it's 3 hours, it's engrossing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Watch it, enjoy it, love it! Repeat!","To be fair, this movie doesn't even touch the more known Mozart's works, yet it's a glorious way to celebrate his music, if not his legacy.The story is told by a seemingly mad man, Antonio Salieri, the Emperor's teacher who loves music more than anything else in this world. He has a lot of ""self-image"" issues, and when he's faced the reality of Mozart's existence, he's lost his faith in God, and himself. The abstinent musician, falls in love with Mozart's work, while simultaneously proves his-self unworthiness. That's a hard paradox for his appreciating jealous mind to handle. So, the double identity, as a coping mechanism to his respective mediocrity begins. He is allegedly Mozart's best friend, who little ""Wolfie"" knows, has sabotaged his work and even made an indecent proposal to his wife. Secretly, he's Mozart's biggest admirer. He confesses it many times himself.He's broken in his soul, more than Mozart was ever broken financially.
Try to love Costanza, ingenuous woman with a heart of gold who loves Mozart very much. Mozart himself is portrayed like a very proud, bold and almost pertinent man-child who has no respect for anything but his music, not even money; profligately throws his life away in debts.Beside the fantastic acting of the two important roles, costume design, music, makeups, and whatever else this movie has excelled to set the bar, Milos Forman's way of story telling is yet another masterpiece of his that puts Amadeus high up and close to his other masterpiece; One flew over the cuckoo's nest. He, once again, shows a great deal of artful directing, having mastered directing a big crowd. 2:40 hours and not even once you feel bored when watching this movie. Also, he's decided on giving Wolfgang a signature laugh that stays with you, that I promise.Back to the story, the priest is broken in the end, just listening to Salieri's subtle sinister; imagine Salieri's torture for 32 years living that story.It's such a good movie, and this is not only my opinion, the Academy has acknowledged this radiant of a movie with a lot of trophies.Do yourself a favor, watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
There's more than one angle to any one given scene. This is fantastic.,"I don't know how this movie does it but it doesn't feel like it came out in 1984. It feels like it could have been released today. The acting, the set design, the costumes - it's all marvelous. Following Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, from the perspective of Antonio Salieri, an Italian classical composer, is a good angle for storytelling and I just wished we had more of him losing his mind and going crazy as he slowly fades into the shadow of Mozart's genius. I don't have a lot of knowledge about their careers and how accurately the movie portrayed their stories, I feel there were some points they had to bend but at the end of the day, both Salieri and Mozart left a remarkable impression in my head.I don't know if it was intended but the movie is remarkably quotable. One of the most memorable for me was, quite ironically, about a poor man not being able to concentrate for more than an hour. As I watched the three-hour-long director's cut, I couldn't help but giving a slight laugh at that point. Dare I quote myself again, but a huge part of this movie succeeding in being quotable is the charming dialogue that it provides. The movie truly blessed us with wonderful dialogue. These movies that take it back a few decades or centuries always hypnotize me with their dialogues. The King's Speech (2010) and Witness for the Prosecution (1957) come to mind when thinking about movies that have a similar effect.I kind of love that Mozart was displayed as a goofball that had a lot of talent. You wouldn't really expect that from a world-class composer. At one point, I even thought about joking that he (or the actor, portraying him) kind of looks like John Travolta without the accent and with a killer laugh. Oh yeah, that laugh still resonates in my head and I can hear it at the most inappropriate moments now. Mozart's personality in general was just fun to observe and remember as this movie is about how Salieri remembers him, it's probably that his childish demeanor is a bit hyperbolized but that just leaves it even more entertaining.If I'm not mistaken, Antonio Salieri was even more famous than Mozart during his peak. His admiration with Mozart and later, envy that he felt almost feels like a draft from a great science-fiction novel but also feels like something that could happen to anyone. Salieri's fate is a bit sad since he was almost forgotten until the 20th century while Mozart's art remained heart through the centuries after his death. Though this movie made me quite interested in Salieri. Of course, it made me interested in Mozart too but I've heard about him and listened to his work before, while Salieri is a bit alien to me. In fact, this whole movie portrays classical music and operas in a good light, which actually makes me want to see one. I just really miss live entertainment - concerts, cinema, opera - anything would do now.Guess there's no secret that I like this movie. Although it is a bit long, even the theatrical version is 160 minutes long, and the movie does start dragging a bit towards the end. I would say that the first two-thirds of the movie fly by really quickly as there's always something interesting to inspect or a powerful new composition comes up on the screen to refresh our interest. It only gets a bit out of touch with me when it dives deeper into Mozart's problems. Though the ending with Salieri trying to transcribe Mozart's genius and writes down the Death mass, as envisioned by Mozart, felt amazing and his final set of monologues in the madhouse was just a good way to end the movie. I can't really imagine a category of subjects that wouldn't enjoy this movie in the slightest. If you're patient to sit through this, you're going to have a good time seeing Mozart from the memory of Salieri and how their work conflicted.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Lovingly crafted, musical, emotional drama","F. Murray Abraham and Thomas Hulce star as Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, respectively, in this lavish period piece. I say ""lavish"" because among the film's greatest strengths is its visual style, including the sets, the costumes and the cinematography.The film is a slow-burning drama that focuses on character emotion and its connection with the music of the composers in the film. We are always peering deep into the souls of Salieri and Mozart as they live with their passion for music. Salieri is particularly fascinating because of his deep admiration, hatred and jealousy of Mozart all at once; he speaks of his music with great reverence, yet bears a deep grudge against God for making the composer of such music a man as arrogant and childish as Mozart, though Salieri himself needs to look in the mirror.The music is integrated beautifully with the film, either as simply its score, or to correspond with a character reading or imagining certain musical pieces. It's a consistently beautiful film, but it can drag on when it takes its time with a scene; the drama isn't tense so much as it is in a constant state of rising and falling emotion, much like the music itself.It's a very good film, but if I had to, I'd say that watching it must be similar to going to the opera, an activity that I can only speculate upon, since I've never been; kind of boring, but beautiful and meaningful all the same.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

All the actors did the best with their parts. I remember the scene where Mozart's maid cries before Salieri...just look at her facial expression. The horror is so real! Or when Salieri reads Mozart's manuscripts: that is the look of a transcended man; Salieri looks like he just had an orgasm. This movie has a lot of strong points, but the acting is the best of them.

His Mozart is a spoilt child in a grown man's body, striding heedlessly through the world, expecting it to conform to him, and living far beyond his means. He is as far behind everyone in social skills as he is ahead of them in music.But few of us can identify with that kind of genius. Salieri, on the other hand, is someone we can see in ourselves, albeit our worst selves. Every frame of Abraham's performance reveals some new moment of humiliation - some fresh, sickening glimmer of anguish that feels all too familiar. His is the destiny of all mediocre talents in this world, thriving under the shade of some far-superior, a God-like contender, whose genius cannot be challenged or conquered, but only be appreciated with a sense of awe. Hence, Salieri's proclamation to the world:""I will speak for you... I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint. Mediocrities everywhere...I absolve you. I absolve you. I absolve you. I absolve you. I absolve you all.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
How exactly di this film win so many awards,"I'm not sure what people are smoking or what the director was smoking, but when you look read up on the actual history this movie was is so far from accurately portraying the real story it's maddening. Worse than that, however, they don't even do a good job of telling the the story they're trying to tell. In fact I'm not even sure what story they were trying to tell because the movie is literally such a mess and honestly hard to watch...frankly it's only redeeming quality is the music. Also the acting is not that good especially from the lead, but I suspect it's because of the way they ask him to portray Mozarts character.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
transcendent performance,"I consider Amadeus to be one of the 2 or 3 best movies I've ever seen for a variety of reasons.  The direction and cinematography are flawless, the script is brilliant (seemingly never wasting a word, with every scene moving crisply), and the casting is extraordinary (note the excellent performances by Elizabeth Berridge, the priest who takes Salieri's confession, and of course Tom Hulce).  However, for me, what sets Amadeus apart from many other very good movies is the incredible performance of F. Murray Abraham.  I can think of a number of great individual performances (Brando in ""On the Waterfront"", Paccino in ""Godfather I & II"", Di Nero in ""Raging Bull"", Nicholson in ""Chinatown"", off the top of my head), but none that moved me as much as the Salieri Abraham created.  The emotion, and wit he imbued the character with are just amazing.  I don't wish to spoil anyone's experience with specifics but the creation of a man who, I feel, has an ocean of bitterness covering up his genuine guilt and desire for repentance is something to see.  Often we get to see emotions like rage, desperation, and love portraid brilliantly in films.  Rarely do we get such a showcase for the far more subtle feelings (frustration, pettiness, repression, etc.) that Abraham so deftly displays. The blackness of Salieri's soul is not the normal kind of evil that movies throw at us to the point of exhaustion, but, when revealed, it is no less chilling to the audience (or to his confessor, who's facial expressions in one particular scene of revelation are also masterful).  There are a lot of people responsible for this fantastic film, but what keeps me coming back is the desire to see Abraham's once in a lifetime performance again and again.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Biopic Unlike Any Other,"If you were to ask me what are my favorite biopics on well known musicians or composers, one immediate answer would be Amadeus. Based on the play of the same name by Peter Shaffer (who also wrote the film's screenplay), this film won multiple oscars in 1985, one of which being best picture. But what exactly makes this film so special to not only me, but to so many film buffs and critics alike? Well, given that the film is a fictionalized depiction of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, it doesn't actually focus on his whole life. Instead, the central focus is told from a lesser known composer who knew the lad, Antonio Salieri.The main storyline revolves around Salieri loving Mozart's incredible work but resenting the man's obscene and repugnant behavior. Due to not being as good as Wolfgang, Salieri becomes jealous to the point of taking vengeance on the young composer. What makes Salieri so intriguing as a lead is how spiritual he is, as he fell in love with music after getting close to the lord. So upon seeing that the lord bestowed such miraculous talents to a raunchy individual, his bitter perspective of Amadeus makes for great rivalry. However, the film also showcases Mozart's own struggles regarding his personal life with a concerned wife and father and getting his visions out with the emperor's approval. This contrast proves how even though Salieri wishes he was in Mozart's shoes, it wouldn't do him any good since the rival's life was no better than his.Then there's the actors, who really help convey the right emotions and charisma to each given character. F. Murray Abraham represents Salieri as a very down to earth and respectful admirer of music, but he also captures his stubborn animosity towards Mozart through subtle emoting and expressions. Tom Hulce clearly had a lot of fun playing Amadeus whenever he would act goofy and immature, but he's also able to sell the character's inner worries and passion in a very relatable way. Elizabeth Berridge is able to bring a good mix of heart and pathos to Mozart's wife Constanze, which again, proves how Mozart's life was not as grand as Salieri thought. The other actors are either appropriately subdued or lively in their own regard, but the main actors are the glue that resonate with viewers the most.While the film may not be completely accurate to the real story of Mozart, it is highly detailed in terms of getting the 18th century time period down. The costumes by Theodor Pistek look very fashionable for their day, and one can tell how much creativity was put into them. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography recreates the film to resemble the aforementioned century, from the color scheme to the establishing sets and shots. It's almost as if we're viewing what that century looked like back then. In fact, some of the operas performed in the film were even shot on location at the original Count Nostitz Theatre in Prague. Not to mention, musical professors and scholars have said that not one note in this film is misplayed, so this flick might be the right choice for a music class.Needless to say, Amadeus is not only well crafted in nearly every way, but it also succeeds in telling us how stubborn some people are. No matter how much you envy someone whose better than you, that should never be a reason to let it consume your well being. Sometimes, you just have to accept the fact that you might not be as accomplished in your passion as someone else, and then you can move on with your life smoothly and rationally. So if you haven't seen this flick yet, definitely give it a watch any time. Remember, it's not called Amadeus because it focuses specifically on Mozart. It's called Amadeus because it focuses on another composer's view on Mozart; think about that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This film made me fall in love with film,"I think I was 10 or so years old when I saw this film for the first time (early 90s) and it is exceptional. This film made me fall in love with Mozart, with music, with film. All the stars to this one. <3",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am your champion!,"The story of what music meant to an aging ""Patron Saint of Mediocrity"" told to a young priest by our afflicted Soliere after being committed to a sanitarium.

The symphonies and operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart hauntingly decorate the jealous and humorous results of those surrounding the King and his minions in their attempts to corral the young, but gifted, composer. Tom Hulce (as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) is absolutely passionate about his perfect music and F. Murray Abrahams' Soliere is a genuine gift in expressing many a musicians frustration of never reaching Gods' ears with ones works.

A Rarity,"There are so few films that qualify as revelatory over repeated viewings (yeesh, this sounds like a snob piece straight out of the New Yorker). I can add nothing to the nearly unanimous kudos of the previous reviews except to note that Amadeus is one of those rare films that allow the medium to be called an art form. It's enormously entertaining (Foreman & Co. deserve credit for making gross historical inaccuracies so excusable) and deservedly earned it's 8 Oscars. Personally I would rate it alongside The Godfather (and II), Chinatown, The Hudsucker Proxy, The Best Years of Our Lives and Fargo as meeting my standard against which everything else is measured. In a world that gave us Porky's 2 and made Will Farrell a star, projects like this are still capable of being made.

"Mozart, simply a genius","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was one of the most skilled composer and musician of all time. When he was only six years old he played for the Austrian Empress, later being still a child he played for the French and English royal families, and wrote his first symphonies. He had such an ear that he could remember any piece just listening once. In addition, Mozart's life was a real disorder, although his incomes were high he usually spent more than what he earned, he was also a heavy drunkard and liked to have fun with women other than his wife. I think that Mozart was a child who never matured. All these aspects of Mozart's life are well described in the film of the Czech director Milos Forman. Unfortunately the film concentrated more on Mozart's deeds in Vienna, and nothing was shown about his travel to Italy, where he wrote two operas. The unproven legend that Mozart was killed by Antonio Salieri was shown with some thoughts and ideas of the director and writer of the film. Up to date nobody can really assert that Salieri really poisoned Mozart, the only thing one may accept is that Salieri was really jealous of the extraordinary Mozart's skills, but to kill him is another story, a bit strange. The most shocking fact in the film, probably it is true, is that Mozart was buried in a common hole without any grave for him. Although with his disordered life he contributed to his poverty, such a genius just put in that hole is to me an injustice. The film has some polemic issues, but one must acknowledge that it is a sound work and an important contribution to make Mozart's life known.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
My favorite movie of all times !,"I started to play piano at age of 5. I didn't know much about composers till I was a kid eager to play difficult parts. Mozart has been my inspiration for life. Now, when I travel I put Mozart's Requiem in my headphones and listen this over and over again. I remember when Amadeus has been filmed in Prague, I used to live there and later in my life I was able to work with some of the crew member working on this film. I love this movie, it never gets old. I always find something more amazing and interesting. Its beautiful, clever, touching and I won't get enough. Now I open Netflix and watch it again.

Salieri absolves you,"The character depicted in this film is entirely unrelated to the composer known as Mozart. Yes, the music and acting are superb. Yes, the pacing, editing and photography are top notch. Yes, the writing is, for the most part, brilliant. ""Amadeus"" would have been a great film as a character study of a fictitious composer loosely based on Mozart's life. Subtract out the silly nonsense, add a little depth and nuance to the character, and you would have an excellent character study dichotomizing two very different types of artists. Friends, yet competitors. One supremely gifted but erratic and eccentric. One highly skilled but perhaps jaded and not so inspired. There are many different, more compelling ways a film like this could have developed if it had been based on a purely fictitious character (which it basically is anyway) and had a story a bit more grounded and believable. If you're going to attempt a historic bio, at least make a minimal effort to be accurate. ""Amadeus"" may as well have been directed by Oliver Stone as outlandish as it is. For a real bio, read Maynard Solomon's ""Mozart."" He forever destroys the eternal child myth presented here. For those of you who enjoyed this movie despite the ""creative"" license taken at the great composer's expense, Salieri absolves you...That idiotic laugh says it all.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"In a word, beautiful","Amadeus is a film that defies the years, just like what Salieri says of Mozart's music; they play Mozart, but not Salieri.  The key to this film is the music.  Mozart will always be known for his gift of music, and this Best Picture winner seeks to do the same.It is interesting to note that while not one note of Mozart was changed, Salieri's music was made ""better.""Amadeus is also about human conflict, and Abraham's portrayal of Salieri as the tortured, jealous, conspirator who ranks among the greatest backstabbers of all time.  Brutus among them as well.Amadeus is a tragedy, and a miracle of catharsis it is too.  Watching it we are held in the firm grip of dramtic irony, unable to cry out and change what is developing on screen.The most beautiful scene in the film (arguably, ever filmed) shows the genius and mediocrity side by side, squabbling over the Requiem, Salieri to slow to follow Mozart.  This scene is so poignant.  Even in death, Mozart is still better than Salieri.As a whole, the film reverberates throughout time.  It is a timeless film of unique quality unlike anything ever before.  Amadeus is astounding in its depth of character, movies of today have quite a bit to live up too.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

 I very much enjoyed it. The acting was entertaining I love the ridiculous attitude of Mozart and how to everybody around him seem he's crazy/odd. Such example would be his laugh it's very awkward and uncomfortable, no one says anything though because there is no doubt to them he is an artist and they have to respect for that. This all comes off as appealing to the story. Very fitting for the story of Mozart.

This was really a film about an artist and it was displayed perfectly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant and Breathtaking,"Very few movies have permanant effects on viewers...but this was one of those for me.  I resisted seeing the movie in the theater when I was a child, because I thought that I would be bored to tears.  Finally, many years later, it was on television and I decided to watch it as I worked a jigsaw puzzle.  I got maybe four or five pieces put together....and then I was enraptured in this tale of lust, love, jealousy, murder and music.  I have seen this film over 100 times and undoubtedly know all the lines by heart. I never tire of it or the soundtrack.The film portrays the ""hero"" as an absolute jerk, which most historians agree that Motzart was, or was at least percieved that way.  It is a film about a man who was at the top of his craft, but lacking in almost all other areas.  Enter into the fray a humble man, Antoni Soliari, who wants nothing more than to ""sing to God"" -- if only He would bless him with great talent. For Soliari, the frustration of watching such a ""creature"" be so succesful while he tires away and receives less praise from his peers is more than he can stand.  He feels resigned to be a ""mediocrity""The movie never really says whether or not Soliari kills Motzart or not -- and that is to the films credit.  Perhaps the most memorable part of the movie (other than the great laugh of Tom Hulce/Motzart) is the last line of the movie, when Soliari is being wheeled away from the priest whom he just confessed to.  He say, ""I will speak for all mediocrities.  I am their patron-saint"".Very few films have risen to the level of this achievement -- but NONE have surpassed it.  10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The best 'thing' about this 'costume drama' was the music.,"I was induced to watch this film by one of the actors. I had avoided it for over 30 years, but finally one winter's evening I decided to 'give it a go'.Extravagant, glitzy, trashy, vulgar (very Hollywood), it bore very little resemblance to reality. The only actor who impressed me was Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor Joseph II : not an easy role to play. The script was witty in a very superficial way, but was enlivened every now an again by a snippet of Czech directorial genius.The part of Mozart was cringe-worthy. Hollywood wouldn't dare to portray coprolalia (if indeed Mozart suffered from it) on screen, so instead he made silly little giggles which were neither convincing nor shocking. This interpretation, like the whole script, seemed to me meretricious.It is a tragedy when brilliant directors are bought over to Glitzland to have their talents diluted with crap. First Polanski, then Forman. Let us rejoice that Jan Svankmajer remained in Bohemia and made some of the best films ever, and that Tarkovsky got diluted only by the Swedes.I know that the main script-writer was the dramatist of the original and celebrated stage play, which I never saw (living 300 miles from a posh theatre), but shame on him if Forman and co. Corrupted his text, and shame of him if they did not.For anyone wanting (a) good entertainment, and (b) Mozart's music (not in snippets), I would recommend Joseph Losey's Don Giovanni.'Wolfie' (Wölfling) may have had Tourette's, or BPD or 'autism' (a condition which is now widely-enough defined to include the whole human species plus some dogs and other creatures in captivity), but this portrayal of him did him no favours.Thank goodness that Peter Schaffer didn't get to triviialise Brahms!",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Celebration of art at the highest level,"Those Salier's description of Mozarts' music, it was a blissful moment for me as I was glad I saw this movie in the cinema. I had mild interest in classical music until this movie showed me the great appreciation. I hated Opera until this movie came along. What about the setting? So beautiful. Each scene is like a painting itself. One very haunting and sad yet beautiful scene at the same time I thought was a transition from Leopold crumbling of the letter to the scrambling frighten deers.Abraham & Hulce gave those two musicians forceful identities. Abraham's performance is so passionate. Though I haven't seen the play, I doubt anyone can imitate Hulce's laugh so wickedly. Wonderful direction was done by Milos Forman. Peter Schaffer's writing is purely great theater, mixed with comedy and great imagination. Who cares if much of it is fiction. Also kudos needs to be given to the stage choreography Twyla Tharp who is known in the Broadway world.The only drawback was that I was so spoiled by the near perfection of the theatrical version, I became so nitpick on the editing in the director's cut. I felt a bliss just thinking about the movie. I know it had a great influence on many people. It was a shame that AFI dropped it off the recently revamped top 100 movies list.

Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham: Careers that never were,"Why would any actor perform to the best of their amazing abilities in a fabulous, moving movie just to then perform in mainly mediocre movies later on then retire from the world stage? Ending on a good note is good for a mediocre actor (cue Kristen Stewart, Please!!!) but I felt that Tom Hulce had so much more to give.With Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) giving us the prologue, the story is based on Salieri's jealousy and envy for Mozart. Mozart (Tom Hulce) is about to compose a piece at a palace in Vienna (Home of the musicians). Whilst eager to meet Mozart, expecting him to be a talented, humble and grateful young man, discovers that he is actually a lewd, immature deviant. After witnessing Mozart perform, then seeing him memorise an entire piece of Salieri's music almost instantly then play it to him, he grows jealous of Mozart as he realises that god has chosen a simple, undeserving boy rather than a devout, dedicated religious musician (himself) to be bestowed with such talent. Salieri then devises a plan to get Mozart to write an absolutely perfect piece of music, his requiem mass, then dispose of Mozart and take the credit for it. He would finally gain his victory over Mozart as he will dispose of him and god as he must now watch Salieri get the recognition he finally deserves. Only time will tell if it will work...There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie. Coming from me, thats a rarity (check out my other reviews, I'm not kidding I always find something negative apart from AC3). Every actor is brilliant and as I mentioned Tom Hulce is amazing and I can't understand why he retired so soon. In short this movie is well worth seeing time and time again.

An Omnixperience,"Peter Shaffer's masterpiece projected on film in the best way possible by the extremely talented director Milos Forman. I've never felt like this for any movie before. It's indescribable. F. Murray Abraham brings an astonishing performance, and so does Tom Hulce. The majority of the scenes are on the comic side, but those dramatic ones aren't missing. Wolfie (Tom Hulce), like his wife Costanze (Elizabeth Berridge) called him, is that childish mastermind, who modesty doesn't apply to throughout all the movie, yet it gives you joy watching him perform. Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) on the other hand is portrayed in two personas: young and old. They're quite different from each other. The young one is his position as a court composer for the emperor (Jeffrey Jones), and his old one is that of the narrator of the story. The emperor, now that I mentioned it, is a pulled-back, not-so-obvious character and his performance is hilarious, in my view. What's really about this movie that shouldn't be missed are the operas.

A mesmerizing movie,"Does it really matter that it's not entirely historically accurate? For one thing, this movie isn't about history- it's about passion and genius. For another, I saw this movie knowing that it wasn't completely true to life, but I loved it anyway. Because what really matters is how Hulce and Abraham draw you into their characters, not permitting your eyes to leave the screen. What really matters is the fact that the movie is very entertaining in its own right- with its humor, both dark and light (I laughed every time Mozart laughed, and then even at Mozart's dad's mask), along with a witty and quotable screenplay (""I may be a vulgar man, but I assure you my music is not""). What really matters is how Forman combines everything to really show us the passion Mozart had for his music and how Mozart was a touch above Salieri when it came to music- Salieri could recognize how extraordinary Mozart's music was but could not create it himself. My favorite scene is when Salieri helps Mozart write the end of his mass. Forman wisely does not distract with anything extra and simply shifts back and forth between the two characters, allowing the actors to do their work with their faces. When I was watching this movie again for the second time, I had forgotten about that scene, and watching it again, I could not take my eyes off the TV.

"Still one of my top films, if not THE top favorite of mine.","I am a musician and had enjoyed classical music as a kid, but never really gave it much emphasis.  In 1984 I was watching the American Academy Awards show and witnessed this film win eight Oscars and was intrigued.  When I found out that it was re-released in the theatres I went to see it right away and was so assaulted and engulfed by the sights and SOUNDS.  Then the music of Mozart itself moved me in such a way that I delved deep into classical music throughout my college years.  Milos Forman put together two outstanding actors, an incredible costume and wardrobe director, a phenomenal screenplay (let's not forget that this was a Broadway play first), shot the film around incredible architecture, and combined all these elements to support the music.  The film is gratuitously generous with the music of the man himself.

"""I speak for all mediocrities in the world, I am their champion.""","Amadeus opens with the suicide attempt of Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) leading to a confession that has been weighing on his heart for years. Salieri, a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), lived his life insanely jealous of his exceptionally gifted counterpart. Salieri confesses to the Priest sent to converse with him after his suicide attempt, that he devised several plans in order to stunt Mozart's success. Salieri was fiercely jealous of Mozart's ability, and how seemingly natural that ability came to him, as Salieri devoted his life to composition mastery yet couldn't hold a candle to Mozart's compositions. Salieri promised his chastity to God in hopes of being imparted the gift of music by the hand of Christ. Salieri enjoys a comfortable living and career as court composer to Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The envy of Salieri eventually engulfs his entire being; he is dumbfounded as to why God could choose such an immature, petulant child to instill his most precious musical talents in. His envy has led Salieri to wage a war against the Christ he devoted his life to, and an urgency to bring about the downfall of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Amadeus is a beautifully striking film, thanks in no small part to its reliance on natural lighting. Amadeus was filmed solely using natural lighting and it benefits immensely from this choice. Amadeus taught me that lighting in a film can have the most dramatic impact, even acting as a character on its own. I am moved by the lighting every time I watch the film, and it is my favorite part of revisiting it. Amadeus achieves a curious feat, it is a biopic in which one cares little about biographic inaccuracies. There are no historical records to indicate that the relationship between Salieri and Mozart was contentious as it appears to be on screen, yet, the story is so engaging that the audience is not tallying the mistakes the film makes. It's more than an engaging story, however, that keeps the audience from becoming upset at the miscues the film fires; Amadeus strikes the delicate balance of giving each principle character their due in the film. Mozart and Salieri are deeply flawed, yet gifted individuals and Foreman brilliantly expresses both sides of each man.Salieri makes a deal with God at a young age promising to devote his life fully to Christ in exchange for divine inspiration of his musical compositions. Salieri begins his devotion by solely studying music and vows to remain chaste, exercising extreme monastic-like discipline in his daily life. Salieri is pleased with the gifts he feels have been handed to him by Christ until he becomes aware of the superior expertise of Mozart. Salieri becomes obsessed with the idea of Mozart and anticipates the day in which he can meet the one God has given such musical talent to. When he finally meets Mozart, Salieri is shocked and disgusted by how juvenile the prodigy is. The interesting aspect of Salieri's repugnance is that he is so revolted by Mozart's childlike behavior, yet his fixation on the composer comes across like a son and outshone by his father's (God's) favorite child. Salieri knows he does not possess the talent Mozart does, yet believes himself to be more deserving of the superior talents. He begins to unwind right before the audience's eyes, decomposing from the realization that he has lived a life promised to another, yet, intensely unfulfilled. It is this great multi-layered portrayal of a jilted man that earned F. Murray Abraham an Academy Award for his role as Salieri; the role also won a Tony for Ian McKellen's brilliant portrayal of Salieri on Broadway. F. Murray Abraham played the part wonderfully and deserves each of the many accolades he received for his turn in the role. The standout for me, however, is the multi-faceted Tom Hulce. Hulce plays the childlike, workaholic, unsophisticated, professional composer. The rapid-fire shifts between facets of the boy genius are extremely well-acted by Hulce. A performance that necessitated so many opposite mindsets is no easy feat, yet one Hulce mastered with ease. As brilliant as Abraham and Hulce were in their roles, it would have been interesting to see Ian McKellen and Tim Curry reprising their stage roles in this film. (I wonder why neither were selected to star in the film having given acclaimed performances on Broadway)Amadeus has a myriad of factors that could work against it. The film is three hours long, is narrated, involves heavily on flashbacks, and shows several compositions-operas mostly, of the featured composer's works. Yet, given the issues that may arise from these aspects of the film, Amadeus does not suffer for them. Amadeus is excellently paced, brilliantly illustrated through narrated flashbacks providing an in-depth look at the people involved in the story, and are wonderfully brought to life by seeing the pieces the composers worked so tirelessly on.Salieri referred to Mozart's natural music ability as if he had been picked to take musical dictation from God, this seemed to be supported when Salieri saw original copies of Mozart's work that showed no marks of corrections or signs of error. As Salieri is working with Mozart, he is taking dictation from the ailing Mozart, and having trouble keeping up with him or even understanding what he is to write; Mozart can hear the melodies he is creating in his head, a skill in which Salieri does not possess. It is never clearer than in his final moments with Mozart that Salieri, while being a gifted composer, has nowhere near the natural aptitude of his counterpart, Mozart. Given that the film is told from Salieri's forsaken viewpoint, Amadeus is a narrative that explores the raw emotion of a man who devoted his life to an art form that abandoned him and is the most painfully beautiful illustration of such I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of those movies that you'll never forget,"Movie Review: Amadeus (1984)""Amadeus,"" directed by Milos Forman, is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the greatest composers in history, through the eyes of his envious contemporary, Antonio Salieri. The film brilliantly combines historical drama with elements of psychological thriller, creating a captivating narrative that explores themes of genius, envy, and the pursuit of artistic excellence.At its core, ""Amadeus"" is a character study of two contrasting composers: the prodigiously talented yet irreverent Mozart (portrayed by Tom Hulce) and the respected yet tormented Salieri (played by F. Murray Abraham). The film opens with an elderly Salieri confessing to the murder of Mozart, recounting the events of his life that led to his downfall. Through a series of flashbacks, we witness Salieri's obsessive envy of Mozart's God-given talent, which drives him to plot the young composer's demise.Tom Hulce delivers a mesmerizing performance as Mozart, capturing both his childlike exuberance and profound musical genius. F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri is equally compelling, portraying the character's inner turmoil and moral descent with nuance and depth. The dynamic between the two leads is electrifying, as Salieri's admiration and resentment toward Mozart fuel the film's central conflict.One of the film's greatest strengths is its lavish production design and sumptuous cinematography, which transports viewers to 18th-century Vienna in all its opulence and decadence. From the ornate palaces of the aristocracy to the candlelit theaters of the opera, every frame is a visual feast for the senses, immersing viewers in the rich tapestry of Mozart's world.Of course, no discussion of ""Amadeus"" would be complete without mentioning its unforgettable musical score, featuring some of Mozart's most iconic compositions, expertly woven into the fabric of the narrative. The film's use of music is not only a tribute to Mozart's genius but also serves as a reflection of the characters' emotional states, heightening the drama and intensity of each scene.""Amadeus"" is not just a biopic; it is a profound meditation on the nature of creativity and the price of artistic success. Through Salieri's tragic journey, the film explores the corrosive effects of envy and the fleeting nature of fame, challenging viewers to confront their own desires and aspirations.In conclusion, ""Amadeus"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its historical setting to offer timeless insights into the human condition. With its unforgettable performances, stunning visuals, and exquisite musical score, it is a film that continues to captivate audiences decades after its release. Whether you're a fan of classical music or simply appreciate compelling storytelling, ""Amadeus"" is a must-watch for cinephiles everywhere.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Between the love and hate of God,"When it was suggested to Milos Forman to make a film about Mozart, one of the most famous classical composers, he was, well, reluctant. A period biopic with wigs and music of the 18th century didn't seem to be the right choice for him nor for a larger audience. Only when he saw Peter Shaffer's play, a highly fictionalized account of the rivalry of Mozart and the Viennese court composer Antonio Salieri, he immediately understood its potential - and turned it into a masterpiece. Strangely enough, the period biopic with wigs and decades old music became a box office hit as well...The reasons why ""Amadeus"" succeeds, simply put: Shaffer knows how to write a dramatic story and Forman how to film it. The inaccuracies are easily forgiven and we soon accept Mozart as the ingenious but always broke goofball and Salieri as the scheming man in the background, driven by his simmering jealousy. Both of the leads, F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart, portray their characters with dedication, passion and unrelenting fervor when the script demands it - after ""Amadeus"" they will always be remembered for those two roles. But a perfect production is more than the cast: Mozart's music of course stars prominently in the picture, placed in highly effective conjunction with cinematographic delicacies Forman serves one after the other sculpting Mozart's fragmented life into a magical whole. While plentifully used the composer's pieces are never repeated thematically, so that the viewer really gets a glimpse into the complete array of the genius' mind, into the playfulness, the love for his craft, the commitment he exudes, all assets on which his secret opponent eventually will break. ""Amadeus"" might be a biopic paired with wild speculation, but it is highly dramatic yet entertaining, elevating and tragic. And high art - cinematographically, story-wise and musically divine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Director's Cut - too many words,"I'm not sure why directors are not the best judges of what should be kept and what cut from the final versions of their movies, but the director's cut of this movie, like so many others, shows that they often are not. Perhaps it is because they are too involved in the work to see it objectively?When this movie first came out in 1984, I saw it in the theater 20-30 times. Each time I marveled at how well it was made.Until tonight, I had not seen it since 1984, as I didn't have any desire to see it on TV. It was run on PBS tonight, however, and to be social, I watched it with my sister. I was also curious to see the director's cut, which is evidently 20 minutes longer.It was easy for me to spot those extra 20 minutes, the only scenes I did not recognize. They were, primarily, the two scenes dealing with Salieri's suggestion to Costanza that she return later and spend the night with him if she wants him to see that Mozart gets the appointment as music teacher to the princess, and the two scenes dealing with the wealthy noble with the noisy dogs who is looking for a music teacher for his shy daughter. The second pair of scenes really adds nothing to the movie. The first two cast Salieri in even a more negative light. None of them is in any way necessary, and the two scenes in the country do slow the movie down. At 160 minutes, the movie never dragged for me. At 180, with those extra 20 minutes, it did sometimes seem to dawdle.The 160 minute theatrical release is a true masterpiece. The 180 minute director's cut isn't terrible, but I can think of no reason to recommend it for a first viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amadeus' Music & Mysterious Life,"Amadeus was a precise and basic film that portrayed Mozart's life. The film overall was a historical view on Mozart's music and also personnel life. It had a remarkably outstanding cast as well as the setting and costumes. The film accurately showed what Mozart's life was about and how his music was truly genius. However, the story involved not just Mozart, but also his family, friends, and colleagues which gave a vast outlook and opinion about his life. The story was told from Antonio Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham), who told the story from what he felt or believed. The story gave flashbacks from Salieri's point of view on Mozart. This could be inaccurate due to Salieri's feelings or bias toward Mozart. Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) played an extraordinary role as a frail and silly musician. His characterization and role proved to be extremely realistic. His facial gestures, movement, and humor contributed tremendously to the film. Amadeus had many speculations concerning if Mozart was really the way he was as the film. Or if Mozart and his father really had a close relationship. It is very difficult to tell, yet the film had a phenomenal way of portraying an idea of what it could really have been. The environment and atmosphere made the film to become very credible. The costumes and makeup/hair design was very traditional to the people of that colonial era. Amadeus is a very moving film that clearly illustrates the dramatic life of Mozart. This film is an inspiring and breathtaking work of art that has won eight Oscars and many other awards. In recognition of its terrific performance, Amadeus has become one of the most original movies of all time. It has wonderful twist with different characterizations that make it an impeccable five –star movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Too short and too good,"This film is so good, interesting and entertaining that I would like the movie to last forever. The strong point of Amadeus is that we wish the best for the 2 characters, Mozart, a childish adult who thinks only of his own success and Salieri who wishes the misfortune for Mozart however we understand the two points of view. The dialogues are interesting, the performances of the 2 actors are memorable, the cinematography is beautiful and the realization of Milos Forman is excellent and of course the music is sublime. What to ask for more. One of the best movies of the 80's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I felt like the film was insulting my taste in music,"For this film to even work in the first place, you need to be on board with the idea that Mozart is a good composer. I'm not. I don't like Mozart. I think his music is bad. There are some classical composers whose stuff I kind of enjoy, and there's some Mozart that I kind of like, but most of it is annoying and long-winded and busy. All of the moments in this film where Mozart was artificially praised for being some prodigy or genius just didn't really work with me. All of those moments where Salieri was agonizing over his inferiority to Mozart didn't really make sense. When Mozart changed up Salieri's march, I thought he made it worse. When Emperor Joseph critiqued Mozart's music by saying it had too many notes, I agreed with him. Apparently these were not the correct reactions that I was supposed to have.This movie wasn't fun for me to watch. I was feeling like I was being talked down to the entire time for having a taste in music that was completely different from all of the supposedly sensible characters in the film. It felt like I was being sneered at and judged for not recognizing Mozart's ""true genius"" or whatever that's supposed to mean. It's two-and-a-half hours of of frustrating, pretentious, boring snobbery, and I did not have a fun time watching it, and I will not be watching it again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mozart for those not in the know.,"I was so wary of watching this movie at first that I would leave the room every time my mom watched it. I thought it was just another dull, trite historical epic just dripping with pretention. Boy, I could not have been more wrong.This Oscar-winning film takes the story of the much-beloved Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and tells it through the eyes of a madman, his bitter rival Salieri. After slitting his own throat at a ripe old age, Salieri finds himself in an asylum, telling the story of his great feud with God, to a priest. Of course, he's angry as hell. Why wouldn't he be? God has forsaken him, and given the talent that he craves to the magnificent Mozart.Don't get lost yet, though. Mozart is hardly a role model in this movie. He's a drunk, an irritable fellow, he cheats on his fiancee with a ditzy diva, and also manages to insult every authority figure in town. But despite all that, he's still one of the most endearing and charming male figures I've ever seen. He wants so badly to succeed, and do the one thing he loves, making music.Elizabeth Berridge also steals the show as Wolfgang's young wife, Constanze. She tries her hardest to make him happy, but being not much more than a child herself, sometimes gets herself into some rather interesting situations.Ultimately, it's hard to say if it's Salieri who did the deed he claims to have done. But I recommend this delightful movie to anyone, anywhere, fan of Mozart's music or not. Make sure and see both the original and the director's cut, in that order, too. ;)",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Beautiful scenery and eccentric Mozart portrayal.,"This is a beautiful movie about the life of Classical era composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), and how court composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recounts his envy towards Mozart for his brilliance in composing music, and his taste for revenge against the composer whom he sees as childish and arrogant.Set in Austria but filmed in France and the Czech Republic, this film captures the majesty, beauty and charm of the classic homes, castles, statues and structures of the time. Tom Hulce gave an eccentric portrayal of Mozart - childish, arrogant, annoying and brilliant all at once, which made me shockingly wonder if Mozart behaved like that in real life. F. Murray Abraham gave a disturbed, powerful and dramatic performance as Salieri. Him using Mozart's difficult relationship with his father Leopold (Roy Dotrice) into making him feel guilty of being a bad son is a captivating subplot that only enhances the intrigue of the plot.The magnificence and splendor of the classical music played in this movie is a joy to listen to, and it helped engage the audience in experiencing what it's like to live in the 1700s Europe.Overall, a masterpiece of a movie, rich and vibrant in its day and continues to be an iconic piece of cinema history.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great film that is hard to watch,"The plot of this film requires Mozart to be portrayed as boorish, annoying git. Hulce turns in a great turn doing just that. If anything he is too good at being annoying. Pretty much every time Mozart laughs you will want to stab him or your own eardrums. While that is precisely the point of the story it can make the film hard to watch in places. Fortunately the rest of the material is so compelling that you can usually overcome this issue. The film at least is great to think about.A lot of this has to do with Salieri being such a compelling figure. Through his envy and mediocrity but also his social graces the film presents a compelling version of the problem of evil. Given Murray's tour de force the 3 hours are just utterly engrossing.It also helps that the film is very operatic. Lush visuals, striking direction and great selection of music makes this film feel appropriately larger than life.good film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great film about a great composer and time in musical history,"A lot of writing isn't necessary to praise a great film, and ""Amadeus"" is just that. The novel approach used in this film works beautifully. A major character in the plot tells the story of Mozart and his great music. F. Murray Abraham plays the Italian composer Antonio Salieri wonderfully. It is through his eyes that the story is told.Abraham won the best actor Oscar in 1984 over the film's co-star, Tom Hulce, who also was nominated for best actor. Hulce's performance as Wolfgang Mozart was as good - even better than was Abraham's role. This was not the first time that two leading players in the same film have been nominated for the same award. It is a rare occasion, and even a much rarer one when both of the leads give outstanding performances. It's too bad that the Motion Picture Academy couldn't make a double award in such cases.""Amadeus"" is a delight for many reasons. The best, of course, is the music. Parts of many great Mozart works are played throughout the film. That makes this great film as much an enjoyable listening experience as it is a wonderful story to watch. All aspects of the movie excel - from the detail in the cultural settings and costumes, to the camera and film production.Any such biopic will naturally be fictitious, especially with the many incidental details in a subject's life. Perhaps the biggest aspect of fiction in this film, though, has to do with Salieri. The film clearly shows him as a much less auspicious composer than Mozart. But Salieri had a major career and influence on opera of his day. He was a renowned and talented composer, conductor and teacher who wrote operas in three languages. He held a number of key music posts. Even though he stopped writing music by middle age, he had several famous pupils, including Beethoven, Schubert and Liszt.Salieri's music did fade into oblivion within a few decades. And Mozart's continued to soar in performance and popularity. But with this film, Salieri's music enjoyed a revival in the classical world.There may have been some rivalry felt by Salieri toward Mozart. And there likely was some envy over Mozart's talent. But there just as likely was a modicum of professional respect between the two men. Although few could match the musical genius of Mozart in creating masterful works in his time, many accomplished conductors and players performed his music. Salieri was among them.This film is a delight. One can't help but wonder how much more great music the world might have had if Mozart had lived beyond his youthful age of 35. The movie is a must for any serious film library.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A timeless classic and must see cinema.,"Amadeus was written by the wonderful playwright Peter Shaffer, who I met in Manhattan as an acting student. A kind and charming old man, he was moved to tears by the then premiere of his niece's play. Shaffer's works involve a great deal of practical dialogue, and we often cold read them to each other in class. The success of Amadeus onstage lead to the film adaptation; an enduring production criticized for its historical inaccuracies. It's true that this film takes liberties with what we know of Mozart, but I believe that creativity enriches the movie, especially since we're informed this is fiction.Amadeus's introduction oozes character and vulnerability, quickly enchanting the viewer. F. Murray Abraham is completely invested in his part, and the passion with which he works is inspiring. Tom Hulce devised his character's unusual laugh, which you will hear in the film. His portrayal is boisterous and energetic! In order to trigger genuine feelings in an audience, an actor must honestly live the script's moments as if they were his own genuine experiences. While watching this film, notice how natural the actors appear: their poses are ordinary and their gestures mundane. You can recognize their feelings because they aren't embellishing.Every aspect of this film is peak cinema and among the highest quality that Hollywood achieves. The acting, at times, may feel very eighties, due to lack of European accents and the American ensemble. This is, however, a small defect in an otherwise flawless film. Amadeus teaches us how love becomes envy due to wounded pride, how we often see others as a threat, and how very destructive we can be to each other. Winner of endless accolades and eight Academy awards, Amadeus is essential cinema and a timeless classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Great Film,"""Amadeus"" is one of the great films of all time. It is a fictionalization of the later years of Mozart's life, though it does contain many actual happenings from his life.Mozart (Tom Hulce) is a musical genius who possesses some juvenile qualities. He is impetuous, immature, naïve, given to fanciful behavior. At the same time, he is a gifted musician and a driven composer. His marries a young woman named Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), who proves to be dedicated to her husband.Wolfgang lives in the shadow of his father, Leopold (Roy Dotrice), who groomed him from an early age for musical success, escorting him throughout Europe where he performed for crowned heads and ecclesiastics. Mozart's devotion and desire for the approval of his father never waivers, even after Leopold's death.The story of the film is told--primarily in flashback--by Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), another composer in Vienna, a man who both worshipped and despised Mozart. This duality of feeling is the focus of the film. Salieri--more than anyone else--recognizes the genius of Mozart's work, but finds Mozart the man to be a repudiation from God, to whom he had dedicated his life. Mozart's vulgarity offends Salieri, causing him to vow enmity toward God.Everything about this film is superior: the music (naturally), the cinematography, the acting, the writing, the costuming, the makeup, the lighting, etc. The performance of Tom Hulce is brave. Jeffrey Jones, who plays Emperor Joseph II, shows why he may be the most underrated actor in Hollywood. F. Murray Abraham's performance is inspired.In at least three scenes, Abraham as Salieri describes Mozart's music with an adoration that is palpable, blessing the viewer with a rarefied experience. Through him, we experience the bliss that Mozart's genius permits. Mozart and Salieri have a complex relationship that ""Amadeus"" explores beautifully. It certainly deserved the Oscar for Best Film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A lavishly staged epic,"Disclaimer - this review is for the directors cut of the filmQuite possibly one of the most underrated directors to have worked in the industry, Oscar winning director Milos Forman created a grand epic for the ages with his lavish and operatic Amadeus, a mostly fictionalized account of the life and times of legendary composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his made-up rivalry with fellow musician Antonio Salieri.Setting in for an at times self-indulgent runtime of three hours, Forman rushes nothing as we set about learning the intricacies of F. Murray Abraham's (in a role he would never better) Salieri's obsessions with Tom Hulce's (also in a role he would never better) Mozart, a man he feels is unworthy of the God given gifts he has been allotted concerning his musical powers.It's the type of epic film we wouldn't get in today's climate, one that is alive with impeccable costume design, sets and over the top performances, that for this tale perfectly suit as we follow Mozart and Salieri through significant years in their lives and in turn live amongst their music and mindsets that could only be prevalent in the minds of a genius, teetering on the edge of their sanity.A god fearing obsessive, Abraham gets a lot to do as both a middle-aged Salieri and a suicidal elder statesman recanting his life's story, while Hulce (with a near-maddening but often hilariously annoying laugh to boot) creates Mozart as an at first detestable man child that morphs into a sad but honest portrayal of a man whose talents weren't always appreciated at the time, creating the perfect storm of mental state of mind that wasn't contributing to a healthy life.Amongst these meaty character examinations and explorations is an absolute feast for music fans and in particular opera lovers, with Forman dedicating ample screen time throughout Amadeus to showcase the incredible music and theater of the times.Whilst almost 40 years old, this 8 time Oscar winning spectacle holds up spectacularly well in today's climates with its ageless music and thoughtful construction contributing to create a film that feels as though it would not be bettered by today's technological advancements.There's a lived in feeling to the films locations (often shot in the very venues Mozart and Salieri played in) and Forman's dark humor and execution is prevalent throughout the piece, giving Amadeus a wickedly fun undertone that helps support its more repetitive or long-winded sequences.Final Say -Not the Mozart biography some may be seeking, Amadeus is an inventive and lovingly crafted account of two very different musical geniuses whose music continues to live on to this day. Filled with some grand-standing and memorable performances, Forman's well-regarded feature is deserving of its place among the great Hollywood epics.4 tasty desserts out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

None of the characters where likeable, especially found Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart dislikable. Not only in terms of immaturity but also *incredibly* annoying with an even more annoying laugh that almost gives SpongeBob SquarePants a run for his money.

So much talented collaboration collaboration from every field: Peter Shaffer, Milos Forman, Tom Hulce... all provide beautiful key elements that lift Amadeus to the highest shelf on my meager DVD rack.The DVD features an interesting set of bonus materials, such as a music-only rendition, but the video quality to me seems not quite up to par with more recent DVD releases. The disc also uses only one layer, and must be flipped halfway through.Despite these very minor setbacks, there are few better ways to put your home theater system to the task of delivering a thoroughly enjoyable yet somewhat disturbing suggestion of Mozart's life and death. Was it rheumatic fever, or was it the music itself? The answers are not here, but you will find a a screen full of fabulous costumes against a glorious soundtrack.

Perfect,"Amadeus is complex as it is comic at times. This movie is an incredible illustration of the power of forgiveness and reconciliation. While at the same time it demonstrates jealousy and greed on the other end of the spectrum. Milos Foreman is unique and creative in the way he brings the story of Wolfgang A. Mozart to the screen. Mozart in the movie is portrayed as this naive but celestial sent prodigy. Whose genius is sometimes out shadowed by his pranks, and ""infintile boy"" behavior. But do not think that his music is comic, it is anything but that! In his music and in the film is portrayed with such seriousness, grandeur, and humility that it was quite the opposite of Mozart himself. Saleri is methodical in his story explaining by a confessional account of how he loved and hated Mozart. But most of all, the music is beyond imagination, each segment in the movie shows and tells how Mozart develops these mercurial and mysterious pieces that capitulates us how he truly was a genius at his work. All the actors did an incredible job in portraying the people that were more or less in Mozart's life. To see this movie is a must, it will move you and make you laugh at the same time. But it will not make you laugh at the person portrayed in the movie, rather, it will make you appreciate how much he loved to live life and expressing it with music. Mozart's music in one way is a celebration of life; love, joy, hate, jealousy, immortality, death, and forgiveness. The list is not exhaustive but it does portray the inner subconscious feelings that we practice everyday. This movie explains this and it does with such accuracy that in Mozart's words are perfect, no more no less than I require! This movie will go down as timeless and sublime in movie history.

Inspired,"IMDb Top 250: 82After you've seen a few, biopic can become fairly repetitive. They show a scene or two about the topic's childhood, the show a few moments that craft the subject's character, show the breakthrough, optional fall from grace, and death. The film is linear, well made and wins some Oscars..But here's Amadeus, a film that could've easily dropped the more interesting aspects of the play and done a linear narrative. But it keeps the perspective of Salieri, long after the action takes place, in the asylum. That adds a whole layer to the film. Also, not having the camera follows Mozart's every move shows that even in his prime, a composer isn't the center of the world.Amadeus is an impossibly lavish film: like the similarly timed- Barry Lyndon, costumes and makeup are luscious, and the sets and decorations are grand. The opera scenes are incredible. Visually and technically, the film is marvellous.Then we get into the characters. The film focuses on the one-sided clash between jealous Salieri and childish Mozart. It makes the film more interesting than simply showing Mozart's life. I found the clash relateable: there's always someone who's better than you at anything, though they may not be the eccentric Mozart is.I found it wrong that everyone speaks in a plain English accent, while making reference to ""our language, German"". Also the film runs long, longer than it could have. And lastly, I don't know what to get out of it. The end is quite nihilistic. Mediocrity. You lose.

Very powerful music,"This is a beautifully made movie. I wasn't expecting a movie like this to be funny and powerful at the same time. F.Murray Abraham is excellent as Antonio salieri. You can truly understand how jealous he feels towards Mozart. Basically, Salieri is the top composer in vienna, but when Mozart comes along, he feels angry that Mozart has a much better gift for music than he. Salieri is then determined to destroy Mozart. The music used for the movie also plays a big part. There is also a lot to do with god as well. Salieri is angry at god for blessing Mozart(who is very big-headed and annoying) with such devine gifts that he so desperately wants for himself. Even though Salieri may sound like a bad person, you actually feel sorry for him. When he first meets Mozart, he tries his best to welcome him by writing a piece of music for him, but Mozart, not exactly meaning to, sort of critices Salieri's music for being repetitive, so makes his own changes to it.So really this is a very powerful film with great performances from F.

Wonderful,"This film might not be the most historically accurate of all times. We might never know if these things did or didn't occur. But this movie is great nonetheless. I can't remember watching a film as dramatic as this one. Although a little too long, it's still very good and manages to catch our attention.The story is told by Salieri. He was already a composer by the time Mozart was born. Nevertheless, his work wasn't as popular as the latter's work. That obviously brings envy. And that is the main idea about this film. As we see Mozart in his last ten years (All his work and progress) we also see how Salieri's fascination and admiration turns into hate. With incredible performances by the main characters, this movie shows us the nature of men. How far are we willing to go when we envy someone? A masterpiece that must not be overlooked. Although this movie is not meant for everyone, it's still one of the best movies of all times",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What else to say.,"It shocks me to see this so low on the rankings (well 88 top films of IMDb). This movie is damn near perfection. If you haven't seen it, do it now. If you teach in film school, show it. If you have loved ones, show them.Just watch this movie.The art direction is superb, the acting is phenomenal, Tom Hulce's laugh is delightful. There is so much to love, and so much to take it.I highly recommend clearing your day and your mind because it requires both, especially if you watch the Directors Cut which is masterful.F. Murray Abraham is an absolute delight, and deserves all the praise he received for the film. And much like the Salari and Mozart, its ironic but not unjustified that Abraham and Hulce went head to head for the leading role Oscar.If only both of them could win.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A magnificent but totally fictional film, and almost an insult to Mozart and Salieri.","After seeing this movie, I feel that I do not really know how to review it. It is impossible to deny the enormous quality of Milos Forman's work, the movie is really good and almost mandatory for classical music fans. However, we must not forget that it is just a movie, and is widely based on a Broadway play, not the real life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Indeed, all the events and historical figures were not depicted with justice, and the film acts as an insult to the memory of Mozart and Salieri.In fact, the weakest point of the film is its partial script, full of untruth, based on Peter Shaffer's play. Here we see Salieri, consumed by the remorse and convinced that he killed Mozart, telling his life and his coexistence with the genius. We see Mozart in his eyes, as a despicable and womanly homunculus whom God unfairly endowed with a musical genius and vocation that Salieri's envied. The script, in contrast, transforms the Italian master into a religious fanatic of debatable talent, without morals or character, despite having reached the pinches of professional realization thanks to a musical king, in a court dominated by Italian tastes and musicians.As it is easy to see, the movie exaggerates and invents immense about the characters, the result of the great ignorance we have about them. In fact, we don't know much about what Mozart was like in intimacy, and much of what we know comes from debatable sources. Salieri is also an unknown to us, and ironically the film helped to arouse interest in his music. I have nothing against the creative freedom of the scriptwriters or the need to fill gaps in information... What really seems wrong is that such gaps allowed what, if Salieri or Mozart were still alive, would be certainly considered a gigantic defamation and offense to the good name of both. Being a historian, this is something that I simply cannot accept or excuse.About the cast, I can say that I really liked the performances of F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce. Both were truly good, they filled their characters with charisma and strength, tumbling the rest of the cast and giving strength to the story. Also, Elizabeth Berridge and Roy Dotrice deserve a praise for the work done, being the only two actors who managed to stand out and get out of the darkness where the cast was dipped thanks to the two protagonists.But it is at the technical level that the film stands out in a more notorious way: cinematography is beautiful and the way the film captures and takes advantage of the light is truly impressive, and even more so if we consider that efforts have been made not to use artificial lighting. That is, we almost only see sunlight and candlelight. Remarkable! Also, the costumes were very well executed and are full of details, even though I can consider that there are some mistakes and omissions and that everything was thought more from the point of view of aesthetics than of historical rigor. As for the sets, I have nothing to point out. Prague's choice as an alternative to Vienna was very smart, and much of the movie was filmed in many amazing locations, giving the movie an additional touch of likelihood and realism. And of course, being a movie about such a genius composer as Mozart, the soundtrack could only be his.The film won eight Oscars. It's impressive, and I think you won't see something like this so soon in the Hollywood Awards: Best Movie, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Adapted Script, Best Art Direction, Best Costumes, Best Sound and Best Makeup. It has also won four Golden Globes (Best Dramatic Film, Best Cinema Script, Best Dramatic Film Actor, Best Film Director) and four BAFTA in technical categories (Best Sound, Best Makeup, Best Editing and Best Cinematography). It is an enviable result. I just regret that the movie is not preceded by a warning note, stating that the story told is fictional, even if the characters are not.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Defining greatness,"How does one truly define a great movie? Different individuals tend to like different aspects of a movie in a different way,however, one thing is always constant with pretty much everyone when encountering greatness=that endless linger of what was experienced and never-ending lasting images in your head, that light-headed feeling when leaving the theater being totally speechless, that feeling of must see again, and finally repeat watching redeeming factor. Very few movies like such come out so when one does it makes it that much more special. Yes I'm reffering to AMADEUS- the greatest movie of all time. For TRUE movie connoisseur/lovers I pose this question: If given a situation where one needed to show a motion picture to an individual who has never experieced the joy of silver screen, which movie would you choose? ""AMADEUS"" is so well done it hurts. It has countless qualities but the one I like to use the most because it is so very rare when it comes to movies is ""healing power"". I saw this movie as a kid when it came out in 1984 and had such a profound experience on me that I went back to see it three more times. I was eleven back then and today AMADEUS is just as special. One could go on forever and talk about this movie and its awesome acting, writing, cinematography, but it is even so much more than that!! Deep inside I realize there will never be another motion picture so perfectly put together like AMADEUS!!!!",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"epic, tragic, comic, MUSIC!","Among the other wonderful films of Milos Forman, ""Amadeus"" reigns supreme. It is a masterpiece of the highest caliber, a film that flows like a gentle stream on a midsummer's eve as angels dance in the softly moonlit sky. It also has fart jokes.There is not a moment that feels unnecessary or tedious, there is nothing to add or subtract as this film is, like the finest of Mozart's operas, a pitch perfect masterpiece. The performances are astonishing and often humorous, the script is filled with wit and intrigue, the cinematography is astounding, dropping the viewer in the middle of the 18th century in a manner that is enjoyable for the most modern of audiences, and the music is, of course, brilliant. Brilliant, brilliant, BRILLIANT!-a word that describes this film with total accuracy. It is not only a brilliant film, it is a brilliant film about brilliant people, and the entire concept of brilliance itself. It is a celebration of one of the most brilliant artists ever to grace the world, and it captures his struggles, triumphs, comedies, and tragedies in a manner that is no less than BRILLIANT!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I could not believe my ears or my eyes.,"I was going through all the movies that had won the Oscar for best picture and my streak of having watched most of them ended at 1985. I had not seen Amadeus or even ever heard of it. So i rented this DVD with reservations about watching some preachy drama about the life of Mozart but boy was i surprised after the first 5 minutes, that's how long this movie takes to grip you.. grip you very tightly. I have never experienced this kind of delight at the very beginning of a movie. The acting is great, The director deserved his Oscar many times over and the costumes are just breathtaking but all of it fades in front of the Music, the music that is timeless, the music you probably didn't even know was composed by the great Mozart. This story transcends time and connects to you on a personal level, its a story about jealousy, brilliance, passion, music, mediocrity, selfishness and above all creativity. Some of us have to chisel hard to get out the best of us but some are just born with the perfect composition. This movie gets a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Beautiful Composition on Every Level,"I am absolutely allergic to calling anything a favorite; it's just too singular, too limiting. People always ask ""your favorite food, favorite actor, favorite dog,"" etc., and to everyone's annoyment I steadfastly refuse to pick one favorite of anything. I don't do favorites, totally resist anything that labels and pigeonholes me to a spot.Until I saw Amadeus.I honestly cannot contain my love and enthusiasm for this amazingly beautiful movie. I do not need a gun to my head to claim my all-time favorite movie, hands down, the one and only Amadeus.(Still, I have no ability whatsoever to pick a favorite food, actor, dog, or anything else.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Falling in Love with Mozart all over again...,"I absolutely adore classical music, and Mozart has always drawn me in. I had done the ""cute little book report"" on his biography for seventh grade, deeming him as a genius and giant of his day. One of those big, stuffy composers seated under a wig and a dim light at his piano, ""taking dictation from God."" This film warps that entire image.My father, too, is big on classical (Masters degree on the piano), and he warned me that this is NOT what the real Mozart was like. More like a Hollywood-ized version of him. Well, authentic or not, this film is hilarious and brilliant, and I would prefer to think that old Wolfgang knew how to let his ""hair hang down"" and giggle in that maniacal way that Tom Hulce seems to enjoy doing over and over in the film.Never thought I would laugh during a movie about Mozart. Never thought I would care about him beyond his music...or be moved by his personal defeats and triumphs.F. Murray Abraham is astonishing. He plays Mozart's jealous-ridden rival, constantly at a war among envy, rage, and reluctant but inevitable admiration for so phenomenal a musician.This movie is a favorite. I hope it becomes a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A sumptuous delight !,"I first came across this film two years ago and all i can say is, fantastic! I grew up listening to classical music on my dads big stereo, anything from Tchaikovsky to Gustav Holst, i was enchanted and hummed along while my dad beamed that his girl liked ""real music"" this film is true eye candy. Im completely in love with Mozart's bubbly, zesty character. He is adorable and lightens the whole film...even though sympathy does go to Salieri, the composer living reluctantly in Mozart's shadow. I also want to point out the beauty and enchantment in Mozart's wife and best friend, Constanze. I love Elizabeth Berridge as this character, she has such an enticing way about her, she is completely gorgeous as the ever loving wife, sweet and innocent and a little naive....im completely fixed when she is on the screen....All i have to say about this film without spoiling it is this is a truly amazing work of art....a mix of beautiful music and cinema, along with delightful characters and sumptuous sets and costumes. Don't ever look this one over as i nearly did....you wont regret it,",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
All biopics about creative artists are virtually identical - this one excepted,"Thank heavens there's none of that tortured genius stuff.  You know the line: X is a great composer, but what makes him great is that he pours out the innermost secrets of his soul when he sits down to write music, music which burns with blah, blah, blah.  Mozart here is a professional musician of abnormal talent, but his talent is no more a part of his soul than, say, his political beliefs are, and his character has neither more nor less depth than Salieri's does.  When Mozart suffers it's for the same mundane reasons that everyone else suffers.  This allows Forman and Shaffer, for once in history, to tell a different story about a composer.The legend of Mozart and Salieri is an old one now and this movie is really the story of the legend.  Considered purely as a legend it's one of the best stories I know of.  (Considered as fact it's false.  This makes no difference to the aesthetic worth of ""Amadeus"".  A legend is a legend.) Salieri is a mediocrity who ascends to some measure of success by dint of hard work and perhaps a little bluff.  Mozart is a genius who composes better music than Salieri ever could, without any effort.  Salieri's unique torture is that he is the only person who can see this - indeed, Salieri is in all respects the only clear-sighted person in the entire film.  Salieri is SO clear-sighted that when he later expresses the belief that divine intervention was responsible for some of the things that happened, I am inclined to believe him (in the film, that is; not in real life).  ""I'm a vulgar man,"" says Mozart at one point.  ""But I assure you, my music is not."" Mozart really is intolerably gauche, but all in all no-one understands him so well as Salieri does.Many of the events seem like padding in retrospect but a particular kind of atmosphere has been so carefully built up that I'm reluctant to suggest that any particular scene was unnecessary.  One thing I think ought to have been omitted was the section detailing Mozart's ""vaudeville"" compositions.  All it does is reinforce the most ridiculous and irrelevant of Shaffer's themes. Mozart's worth, Shaffer is saying, was best suited to and best appreciated by the lower orders of society, by the Common People.  Aristocrats just didn't have a clue and preferred to listen to stodge.  This (a) is a tiresome cliché, (b) is the complete reverse of the truth and (c) undercuts the pure beauty of the Mozart and Salieri legend to some degree (since it's essential that Salieri be the only person who realises Mozart's worth while Mozart is alive).This is a minor quibble.  Forman and Shaffer have so adroitly avoided the dreadfully hammy postures of classical music movies that I can forgive this inconsequential slip.  They've even avoided the temptation to simply quote all the best bits of Mozart's music.  Music is instead chosen for its dramatic effectiveness and appropriateness.  Compare ""Amadeus"" to ""Immortal Beloved"" in this respect.  ""Immortal Beloved"" merely has a better soundtrack.  ""Amadeus"" is by far the better film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great,"My favourite bit is the part at the beginning, where Mozart improvises an ""improvement"" on Salieri's music - without even seeing the score!This film may be seen as ahistorical - but if it is, it is based on old myths. Even Beethoven believed that Salieri killed Mozart. In fact, at one time Salieri was let into an asylum, just as in the film, claiming that he had poisoned Mozart. He later denied it. But nonetheless the film can be seen as historical in that Salieri is mad at the time, and watching the film we are seeing the past through temporarily insane eyes.There are some indications to suggest such an interpretation is correct. For example, Salieri thinks he killed Mozart at the beginning of the film - yet at the end of the film we see he has done nothing of the sort - he mrely plots to kill Mozart, who dies of overwork and illness.In other words, don't knock the film for being too fictional. It can be seen as a view of Mozart through the eyes of Salieri who is temporarily mad.Jonathan Lim",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Wonderfully entertaining  period drama,"the basic plot: A boorish, but unimaginabally gifted young talent named Amadeus Mozart arrives in Vienna from Salzburg , and soon marries Constanza Weber. His rival and other court composer and teacher, Salieri , a mannered and polite man, but with mediocre talent, tries to ruin him by exposing unlawful plans for opera, and then by having him write a funeral concerto which he believes is for himself.This is told in flashback by an old Salieri in an asylum to a priest.The praise:Thoroughly entertaining.F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce are both excellent in their roles as Salieri and Mozart,and Elizabeth Aldridge and Roy dotrice do their parts as Constanza and Leopold Mozart well. The film is both comic and powerfully full of bittersweet drama, especially during the last part in which Mozart is writing the funeral concerto. Full of poignant nararation by F. Murray Abraham, in an excellent role which won him an Oscar, it also has a feel of masques, decorative follies and elaborate costumes, architecture and hair that characterize the period. The message that the movie gets across is that you can not judge a persons character  by their talent, and along the way you listen to a lot of great music and the genius of Mozart is explained . The ending in which Salieri proclaims himself King of mediocrity is classic.The flaws: A little too long.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An exquisite experience,"A brilliant treatise on artistry and ambition, ""Amadeus"" tells a largely speculative story about the professional rivalry between Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  The historic accuracy is questionable, but that hardly matters as the film is not a meticulous attempt to recreate the Vienna of the Classical Era, but a thoughtful commentary on the arbitrary nature of genius and fame.The comparison and contrast between the sober Salieri (F. Murray Abraham, whose performance is the driving force of the film) and the vulgar, petulant Mozart (Tom Hulce, whose work here is second only to Abraham's) is in itself worth the price of rental.  Both men are passionate souls, driven by their own ideals of artistic perfection.  But while Salieri prays in vain for a brilliance that elludes him, Mozart's talent for music is so effortless that at times he seems to take it for granted.  Did Salieri descend into madness and engineer the death of a man he both admired and despised?  Or did Mozart simply burn himself out with the fire of his own genius?  Was the creation of some of the world's greatest music by an impish, rude man a manifestation of a perverse sense of humor in the Divine?  The movie prefers not to answer these questions, leaving the audience to carry away its own opinions on the matter.Then, of course, there is the music itself--some of Mozart's finest works (including one of my favorites, the Mass in C Minor) are highlighted in the production.  The operatic staging by Twyla Tharp is marvelous, as are the voices used for the scenes.  The costumes magnify the differences between Salieri (somber blacks and browns) and Mozart (garish colors and a variety of outlandish wigs).  The end result is facinating, haunting, thought-provoking, and unforgettable.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
