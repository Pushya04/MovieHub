"Underrated, horribly Underrated.","This is an excellent movie-I enjoyed every moment of it. The dialogue is sharp, the events unfold nicely, and the ending ties everything together. In short, this is a movie that deserves to be remembered.Sure, there are a few missteps, like the scenes that *could've* been funny (the penguin scene, for example). But the Hispanic character really stood out; his presence added a lot to the film.Bottom line: give this movie a shot. It's both hilarious and fantastic.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Good Sandler Comedy,"Henry Roth is a man afraid of commitment up until he meets the beautiful Lucy. They hit it off and Henry think he's finally found the girl of his dreams, until he discovers she has short-term memory loss and forgets him the very next day.At first, I just liked some of the usual humor: the use of spam to make me believe we were really in Hawaii. And also Rob Schneider, who is often the funniest person in Sandler's films. (He is still good here, though perhaps not at his best.)I was pleasantly surprised that amidst the stupid humor was an actual story about love and the growing bond of two people. There could have been a variety of ""Groundhog Day"" jokes. And indeed, there were some. But the character Sandler plays is actually quite sweet. Who knew?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Enjoyed it.,"This is quite simply a very enjoyable film. It's not, perhaps, a great film, but it is fun and it left me feeling pleasantly content. Basically this is a romantic comedy about a man (Henry) and a woman (Lucy) who meet and fall in love, there is just one problem: Lucy won't remember, tomorrow.It is easy to pick holes in films and yes there are things wrong with this film:-The first 5 to 10 minutes do seem a little out of place: I understand the need to set the scene, but couldn't help feeling that the pace and characterisations didn't quite fit with what was to come.Some of the characters take away from the story: Doug (Sean Astin) is a little over done and comes across as more damaged than his sister. Perhaps the worst, though, is Henry's female (?) assistant: this character was a mistake and did not belong in the film.In the end, these flaws don't matter: the film is enjoyable and that is what counts.The plot, even if somewhat contrived, is clever and in the context of the film believable: there is a good beginning, middle and surprisingly satisfying end. Some of the difficult aspects of the film are not ignored but properly dealt with. Clearly it is easy to read a sordid side into the idea of a man meeting a beautiful woman each day in the knowledge that she will forget everything and they can start again tomorrow. This is covered and Henry is asked some pointed questions; without giving anything away, his answers worked and leave us, the audience, able to enjoy the film, without any unpleasant nagging doubts or feelings of guilt.Don't analyse or pick holes; just watch this film. Chances are very good that you will enjoy it. It is a fantasy a bit of escapism: a first rate piece of entertainment and hopefully it will leave you, as it did me, feeling pleasantly content.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is what you call a 'feel-good' film,"The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: Henry Roth lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment. Then he meets Lucy Whitmore. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn't even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn't overly stupid, but it's not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film's true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to Henry who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with Lucy, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. Henry's character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with Lucy, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn't really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn't even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Romance
The fish doctor,"Not being an Adam Sandler fan, we avoided this film when it was released earlier last year. The premise sounded too much like ""Groundhog Day"". We took a chance the other night when it was shown on cable, and frankly, we found the movie entertaining. There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, ""Punch Drunk Love"".Drew Barrymore and Mr. Sandler had worked together before to surprisingly good results. They show an easy chemistry between them that serves the movie well. The idea of making Adam Sandler an aquarium doctor offers a lot of possibilities; his scenes with the walrus are hilarious.The supporting cast plays well together. A surprise was Rob Schneider, not one of my favorite actors, either, but in here, under the direction of Peter Segal, he delivers. Sean Astin, as the lisping brother on steroids is quite effective, as well as Blake Clark, as Lucy's father. Dan Aykroyd puts an appearance as the doctor who treats the young woman who has lost her long term memory.Watch it without any preconceptions, as probably it will surprise you.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
If I could do this...,"Okay, so ""50 First Dates"" is mostly silly, but they do a good job with it. Honolulu veterinarian Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) falls for Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), only to find out that, due to an accident, her memory only lasts one day, so she won't remember him the next day! How will Henry cope with this? The movie gravitates between goofy and sensitive, but never gets mind-numbing; Adam Sandler always has something up his sleeve, and he and Barrymore have a great time with the material. As is often the case in Adam Sandler's movies, one of the characters is an embarrassment to everyone else (in this case, it's Rob Schneider as Henry's whacked-out friend Ula). Great fun.Oh, and one more thing: don't watch ""50 First Dates"" if you haven't seen ""The Sixth Sense"" first.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Never mind the sucky parts, this is what love is","See, I am a married man. And watching this movie, at home on the sofa with my wife whom I love above anything and hopefully always will, almost brought me to tears and easily did her. This movie, no matter all the overdone/overacted characters and the fact that Adam Sandler is probably the worst person in the world the act crying, is simply the best description of love ever. To have the energy to every day win over the heart of the one you love, is what we all should do, though ever so often don't have the energy to.I believe that movie criticism often nitpicks too much on technical details or other such stuff of -actually- little importance. Show me a person who is not moved by this film and I show you a person who knows zip about real love. Real, I mean. I am not a religious person and this made me feel closer to what people often call God, whatever that is. Maybe I exaggerate, but I want to. And no work of art, of any genre, can be asked to do any more. On scale of 1 to 10, this goes to 11. (Can you see?!)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Different, Enjoyable Movie","6 July 2004. After a rather lame beginning that reflects the old Adam Sandler's more obnoxious character that he was well noted for, the movie eventually settles down to a rather innovative, creative, entertaining movie that captures the lovely and seasoned acting of Drew Barrymore and a maturing comedian Adam Sandler. While not much in the way of character depth nor real substance, this lightweight but clever movie plays on Groundhog Day and other Momento devices that contribute to a rather fun and enjoyable movie.Hopefully Drew will begin to expand on her future roles and Adam will begin to enter into a Tom Hanks, Robin Williams maturity phase that will really demonstrate what Adam is made of.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazingly Good,"Take a little ""Memento,"" Add a generous helping of ""Groundhog Day,"" and even a little of ""Sommersby"" and you have ""50 First Dates"". Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler create a synergy that neither has been able to capture with anyone else. Together, they produce a romantic team comparable to Gere and Roberts, Day and Hudson, Grant and Loren and Tracy and Hepburn. My wife and I watch ""The Wedding Singer"" at least once a year. While ""50 First Dates"" is a superior movie, I don't know if I can take the melancholy ending again.For once I'm grateful for the Khamakazee antics of Sandler's acting ensemble, particulary Sean Astin and Rob Schneider.  If Schneider wasn't playing such a farcial role, he would be a natural for an Oscar. Certainly the animals add a lot to the farce. The goofy humor makes the basically tragic scenario not only bearable but almost pleasant. It's also genuinely funny.Sandler convincingly plays a marine biologist(!!!)in Hawaii who enjoys ""entertaining"" the ""mainlanders."" Sandler doesn't date ""locals"". He wants nothing to interfere with his dream of studying walruses. He discovers Barrymore having breakfast in a local bar and grill. What captures Sandler's attention, even more than her beauty, is Barrymore's creativity. What Sandler doesn't know is that Barrymore has brain damage. The brain cells which move short term memory to long term storage are destroyed. She forgots everything she's learned during the day while she sleeps. So, Sandler, the lothario who forgots his relationships with mainlanders after one week finds himself in love with a woman who forgets hers in 24 hours. That's writing genius, something you don't see very often, and Sandler, Barrymore, and Sandler's acting troupe handle it perfectly.Though my wife is physically handicapped, my mother has severe short term memory loss. So, I really related to the trajedy so expertly portrayed in ""50 First Dates"". It's not often I give a movie that leaves me this sad a ""10"". The last time, I believe, was ""Sommersby"". Nonetheless, ""50 First Dates"" is a ""10,"" since there is nothing about it I can suggest that make it better.P.S. Looking forward to the NEXT Sandler/Barrymore collaboration.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious,"50 First Dates is a very funny movie and for Sandler its one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a womanizing marine biologist afraid to commit, who falls for the woman of his dreams, played by Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, she has a brain disorder that makes her forget everything that happened the day before whenever she falls asleep, so every day, he needs to win her over and make her fall in love with him anew. The plot is nothing new as this movie is a cross between Memento and Groundhog Day both very good movies. What makes this movie work is the chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler since they work so great together and make the film fun and also this film is better then Sandler's last effort Anger Management. Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. Drew Barrymore is very good in her role as Lucy and she makes up for the horrible Duplex. The supporting cast is also very good with the best being Sean Austin. Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. The last main part of the cast is Dan Aykroyd and his role isn't very memorable. This movie has good intentions and some sad moments like when Lucy finds out she can never have her memory restored or when she sees pictures of herself from the accident. However, there's also some gross humor so I think this movie can appeal to everyone under the age of 21. Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty enjoyable,"While Adam Sandler is supposedly the star of this movie, the actual shining star is Drew Barrymore. The plot isn't really thick, but what she makes of her character in that confined environment is great. Another factor is of course the chemistry between Adam and Drew. And although it isn't the greatest on-screen pairing (not even close), it still creates enough believable buzz to work as a romantic comedy with a slight twist.That all being said, the jokes are hit and miss, like with many Adam Sandler movies. Even his regular comedy friends get their screen time and if you're a fan of his, than of course you will like the movie no matter what I or others will write. But as stated above, this is/was a pretty decent watch (even for me)",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
More than what you think.,"This movie is so much more than what you think! It takes you on an emotional roller coaster. It is both hilarious and touching.I would recommend this to anyone that likes comedies or romantic comedies. I wouldn't recommend it for children, though. Some of the humor is too mature.Even if you're not an Adam Sandler fan, you'll love him in this. Same goes for Drew Barrymore.I love this movie, and I didn't think I would. The movie turned out to be more than what I thought. And it will be more than what you think, too!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very sweet feel good film,"I will admit right now, I am not an Adam Sandler fan. However, I found this film to be surprisingly enjoyable. It is sweet and cute in places, and while certainly not a masterpiece it is above decent. A vast majority of the jokes work here, and that was great to see, and the direction was surprisingly subtle. The camera work was good making good use of the gorgeous scenery, and the soundtrack was lovely. I had little problem with the performances; Adam Sandler gives of his more likable performances, and Drew Barrymore is the persona of sweetness as his love interest. Out of the supporting performances, Rob Schneider guarantees a number of laughs, and Sean Astin comes close to stealing the film in places. But it is the chemistry of Sandler and Barrymore that shines through despite the flaws that mar it from being more than enjoyable.While Dan Aykroyd has a small appearance, it is sadly one that isn't particularly memorable. The plot isn't exactly original, and certainly isn't the most interesting one ever. And the script does have its ups and downs, and is predictable. Overall though, it is a sweet feel good film. It has its flaws, but it is a brave attempt at a romantic comedy, and mainly because of the chemistry of the two leads it mostly succeeds. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A unique yet touching concept,The story serves a really rare medical condition as the base of a quirky yet very touching romantic story. To be able to make someone fall in love with you again every single day is a herculean effort if we really think about it. Presenting this concept in a comedy really brings it to a very fun level. I really like the early parts where Henry would do over ad over his mistakes with newer and newer ways. The practical jokes are very much entertaining. I really like how Lucy bludgeons Ula in helping Henry. All the side ingredients also fared well. The things with Alexa and Doug comes in well and funny to the end. The acting job is a very goo overall. Adam Sandler manages to be still funny amidst the story that is more focused on the romantic and touching side. Drew Barrymore acted out great as the girl who gets her memory wiped out clean every single morning. Having additional big names such as Sean Astin and Dan Aykroyd sure didn't hurt this movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming,"Adam Sandler plays a ladies man who falls for adorable Drew Barrymore, only to discover she suffers from a short term memory disorder that causes her to forget everything that happens today. So the next day she relives today over again. Sweet, endearing, funny romantic comedy. Sandler and Barrymore are both great and continue to display the wonderful chemistry they had in The Wedding Singer. Guys, it's not all sappy romantic stuff. Although I personally don't mind that. There's plenty of comedy here, too, with a fine supporting cast that helps bring the laughs. Rob Schneider sucks but everybody else is fun. Love Joe Nakashima's small part. It's a great movie that should put a smile on the face of anyone but the grouchiest among us.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Interesting premise, but completely Sandler-ized","OK, let's get the obvious comments out of the way: ""Groundhog Day"" bladibladi ""Memento"" blablabla ""The Misadventures of Death And Phug"" blabla. Yes, this movie is about a person with no memory, repeating the same day over and over again. This has been done before, but it's not a cliché - and anyway, the angle of this movie is a lot different than those three, so let's just give all that a rest.In actual fact, I found the concept of this movie interesting - a real twist on the old love story fare. Man With Fear Of Commitment Finds Woman With No Memory - it's a fun little jigsaw. And, for all intents and purposes, the skeleton of this movie works fine.But. BUT! This is where I get annoyed. This movie is crammed full of pointless and annoying cheap gags. I don't know if it's just me, but I am not particularly appreciative of super-intelligent cutesy animals who understand everything said to them in plain English and respond with a suitable adorable sound/flipper gesture. Animals don't act like this. They never have, they never will. It p***es me off. Also, the movie just HAD to tack on some meaningless gross-out moments via the horny and androgynous Slavic assistant and (hold on to your hats and glasses) somebody getting showered from head to foot in walrus puke. Ah, the subtlety. And will somebody shut the old Hawaiian guy up, who has no function in the movie other than saying ""hilarious"" cuss words?I think the writer of the original screenplay is pretty horrified at how his movie was represented. I would have been.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Movie For All Seasons,"Lets face it, when Adam Sandler needs a hit movie, who is he going to call, Drew Barrymore of course, and indeed why not, after the sentimental success of The Wedding Singer, anything these two bright young things appeared in together would be nothing short of pure gold.A perfect case in point is 50 First Dates. Now as a rule i would never break out in a fever to go see anything with Adam Sandler's name attached to it, however i broke the rule when i first went to see The Wedding Singer, which contained many charming and heartfelt moments, as well as the comedic, aside from that one the only other film of note on Sandler's resume for me anyway has been Billy Madison.Like all good things that come to pass, in between the misses more than hits, along comes the last to date pairing of Sandler and Barrymore. A movie i missed on it's theatre run but more than made up for it by viewing on DVD then subsequently purchasing it.A lighthearted take on the notion of amnesia, with the emphasis clearly billed around a love story. We watch as local Hawaiian vet, Henry Roth, played by Sandler stumbles through existence, dating and dumping female holidaymakers, all the while searching for that perfect one. Into his life comes Lucy played rather charmingly by Drew Barrymore.Of course loves young dream could never run smoothly, remember we have 95 minutes running time on this movie, So as soon as they have met and broke bread, the dawning of a new day arrives, but not without it's hitch. Without giving too much away, just in case their might be someone out there who hasn't seen this film, regardless of the hiccups that ensue throughout.We are party to many highlights, which include Rob Schneider as Henry Roth's less than able sidekick Ula, Jocko the Sea lion and many many more. I personally never tire of watching it, not to the extent of reaching fifty times but i do regard it as a breath of fresh air, even if Adam Sandler parlays his usual bag of comedic tricks, but hey the late great Chris Farley did the same and it worked.Truly a movie for all seasons, and a must if you are in a relationship.

prefer action movies but...,"first i have to say, I'm a guy. give me mindless violence, car chases, and explosions, and i'm going to be happy with any movie. i don't normally go for a ""romantic"" movie of any kind, even with drew barrymore in it, although she is an impressive talent, and definitely not hard to watch in any movie. but this one is, well, different.what gets me with a lot of romance movies is that, all that happens is romance, and it gets really. really stupid after awhile (geez, you guys, get a room!!). the other thing is that, everyone overcomes the adversity (often what brought them together in the first place) and they live sappily...i mean...happily ever after. if they don't, it's a tragedy, and everyone leaves all weepy eyed over them. 50 first dates does neither of these things.first, the adversity of drew barrymore's character surviving a serious accident, which her father blames himself for, leaving her with brain injuries that, by the diagnosis of the doctor, are not going to be repairable (as opposed to most of the movies ""it's possible"", and they do recover). this proves mostly that, if the person isn't going to recover and become perfect again in the other movies, the romance is over. this movie, right from the start, tells you she isn't going to recover, a fact that adam sandler's character doesn't seem to be bothered by. he remains by her side, despite the fact that she doesn't know who he is at the start of every day. his handling of this situation is not only insightful, but down right inspirational (and totally comedic in many cases).it has the romance, but doesn't base the entire movie on it. for the guys, it even has the violent scene, as she protects her ""unknown"" boyfriend from his attacker ""ula"", beating him with a baseball bat while chasing him across the field. it shows the seriousness of the injury, as she watches a video of newspaper clippings telling her what she's lost, but also gives you rib-cracking comedy when, upon waking up in the morning and finding a ""stanger"" in bed with her, she proceeds to knock him unconscious, prompting her brother's comment of ""maybe i can't kick your *** but my sister can"".if more romantic movies were like this, i'd like more romantic movies. it doesn't end as a tragedy, because it isn't. but she doesn't end as perfect either, showing that, in his eyes, she is perfect, and that's what mattered. telling us that it's okay to see the one we care for, and overlook the imperfections. a message movie that doesn't harp on it, or make you feel sorry for her. i can handle that.all in all, a movie i could watch again and again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
good chemistry,"Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a lying, womanizing, veterinarian in Hawaii. He meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) and falls for her right away. Only Lucy is suffering from short term memory loss and can't remember him the next day.Sandler and Barrymore make for a lovely couple especially for a rom-com. I just don't understand why Sandler feels it necessary to push his character into unlikeable territory. Why does he have to be so sleazy? And can Rob Schneider get any more annoying? The only good thing from Schneider is that hilarious Happy Gilmore swing.Adam Sandler is relatively under control in this movie. He should just be a nice guy who meets a nice girl.

A very entertaining film,"When ""50 First Dates) came to theaters, I really wasn't interested enough to go see it. When it came out on video, I waited about 2 months to see it until it came down to the $1.99 rental price.Was I surprised! This movie was so entertaining to me, that I wound up buying it. I only buy about 5 or 6 videos a year, so you can see that I really must have enjoyed it. It won't win any Oscars, but it will make you feel good when you watch it.I am familiar with the condition that Lucy has here having a cousin who has a similar problem and has had it for several years. I was really concerned with how a production company can play a condition like that for laughs, but, somehow, they pulled it off. They treated the subject matter with dignity showing that the people who have this terrible condition can (and do) have somewhat normal lives. My cousin does it the diary way. She doesn't lose her memory everyday, but at different times. She has gone as long as 3 months in retaining her memory and has lost it on other occasions after 4 hours.I am not a big Adam Sandler fan, having always thought he was a bit ""over the top"" in his other films. I thought he was going to do this in this film as well after the first few minutes of the movie. However, when he is shown in the diner with Lucy, he shows that he is really a nice guy who, deep down, wants to find a relationship that is fulfilling with a pretty girl.Drew Berrymore is another actress that I don't particularly care for most of the time, but she is really a sweetheart playing Lucy. She is just so lovable in this role, it's hard to believe that she has the Demons in her past.Rob Schneider is very good in his supporting role as is Sean Astin as Doug, the 'roid raging brother of Lucy.Again, not an Oscar winner, but well worth the $15 or so to purchase it at WalMart.Marty",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nice film with stunning ending,"It's been interesting reading the other users' comments on IMDb. A lot of people have their prejudices: ""this turns out to be typical Sandler"", or, ""this is not what we want from Sean Astin"", or, ""Rob Schneider - yuck!"". Seems that many have their own ideas how the film should have been before they see it.I rarely watch these spongy Hollywood comedy/romances so I had little in the way of expectation (I didn't even know Rob Schneider was in it till I saw the credits at the end, nor did I know that Sean Astin had been in the Lord of the Rings as I have studiously avoided seeing those films). Probably as a result, I thought both Schneider and Astin were great. In fact, Schneider and his kids were hilarious in every scene. The scary thing is, if I'd known it was Rob Schneider beforehand I might have judged him more severely. Don't ask me why, that's psychology folks, but it shows how difficult it is to be objective sometimes, and it certainly paid off to approach the film without any prejudice.Anyway, the story is engaging enough - it even makes you think a little: what would it really be like to wake up each day and not remember the recent past? You know how sometimes you wake up and wonder where you are (or who you are)?... it's not totally unrealistic (as opposed to Groundhog Day, which was just fantasy) but not totally serious at the same time. Drew's performance - a bit silly, a bit serious - was in perfect balance, and this balance between silly/serious was echoed throughout the whole film quite successfully. Some people have criticised the use of cute animal characters, but Sandler has to play it straight for most of the time, and the animals (plus Schneider) provided the necessary balance. Very nicely done, I would say.A slight feeling of repetition in the middle is the film's only real flaw, but any weakpoints are forgiven by the time we reach the stunning ending. Stunning is not too strong a word - I don't think anyone was expecting the final scene, in which the story - and Drew - provides a very satisfying, beautiful and thought-provoking moment that will (if you are a person of reasonable sensibility) stick in your mind for some time. This final scene was marvellous in the way it captured and tied up all the elements of the story very quickly and with just a little low-key dialogue - with Drew, in fact (and understandably) being lost for words. To imagine this scene being repeated every day is fairly breathtaking.Recommended.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Better than I Remembered, Though Not Quite as Funny","There are certainly touches of the Sandler productions we've come to despise here (non-essential jokes, unfunny third-tier characters, Sandler casting himself as a perfect romantic figure). The difference is this is when he still cared, with a main story and central characters that are cute, engaging, and bursting with humor.

"Not what I'd call funny, but...","I can't claim to be at all into Sandler and his nasty style of ""humor"", and this definitely is extremely disrespectful and awful towards a couple of groups(especially unfortunate victims of brain injuries). However, on the occasion that this actually goes for being genuine and tries to have its heart in the right place, it succeeds. The drama works, and there is downright sweet stuff in this. It does also contain its share of sap, and in an odd sort of way, it does manage to be something of a standard romantic comedy(meaning, if you're going for that and you either enjoy or can at least stand the nature of the rest of the material, you may very well like this). The jokes and gags are all crude, most are cruel, often offensive, many are disgusting, and for the relatively varied material, you have to wonder why they had to go to the well so ridiculously many times on so much of it. Acting is quite solid, for those allowed to do so. The characters are typically there to be fodder, for us to laugh at, though several of them are nicely fleshed out. This has good enough pacing, and holds at least some great directing. There is occasional mild to moderately strong language, a little violence, and only hints at sexuality, in this. The DVD contains an entertaining and interesting commentary track with Segal and Barrymore, three featurettes(two of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), five deleted scenes with the option of hearing the director's thoughts about them as they play, a teaser for Adam's next album, three music videos, a blooper reel and a few trailers. I recommend this to fans of those who made it and/or the genre. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Standard feel-good rom-com,"The key to whether you should watch this film is how much you can stomach Adam Sandler. If you think he's great you'll love this. If you can't stand him then you will probably not find much here to distract you from that.Personally, I've never been a fan of his. But I watched this because I quite liked the idea of this film. Let's face it - it's not often you get a movie about a woman (Drew Barrymore) who is involved in an accident which leaves her with a 24-hour memory span so that her would-be boyfriend has to make up ways to 'meet' and make her fall in love with him every day. So I watched it, and it was OK. A good few laughs plus some nice 'aaaah' moments and a pleasing soundtrack thrown in as well.Downsides? I could have done without some of the annoying sidekicks. Admittedly the two leads couldn't have sustained the whole film on their own, but for me there are a few too many 'quirky' hangers-on, playing - largely unsuccessfully - for laughs. The exceptions to this include the slightly more classy turns from Dan Ayckroyd as the doctor, Blake Clark as the girl's father, and the show-stealing walrus who is the star attraction at the zoo where Sandler's character works as a vet.So overall, 50 First Dates is not great, but it doesn't pretend to be.

The woman (Barrymore) is stuck due to a mental impairment that prevents her from retaining new memories. The man (Sandler) is stuck because, smitten with her, he resigns himself to the same fate. Day after day he takes her on a romantic first date, knowing she'll never remember him in the morning.The filmmakers could have played this a number of ways. They could have played to Barrymore's strengths and made on those edgeless rom-coms in which everything turns out fine in the end. They could have played to Sandler's strengths and exploited the idea for cheap, crude laughs. They could have opted for the black humour and narrative fun of 'Groundhog Day.' There are certain filmmakers who would work this idea as a tragicomedy.The problem is the filmmakers never choose one of the above paths. They try to negotiate them all. Therefore, despite some promise, we get a painfully uneven film that never resolves the issue of whether to take itself seriously or not. We get scenes that belong in a harmless rom-com, we get scenes that belong in a bittersweet drama, and we get scenes involving Rob Schneider and a barfing walrus. I doubt anyone could meld these into a cohesive film.To understand why this doesn't work, consider the ending. The film concludes with a 'solution' that is presented as sweet and romantic. But it's not. Consider the dilemma Barrymore's character would wake up to every morning. Throughout the film, Sandler's character is presented as decent and well-meaning but what he does at the end is selfish and cruel.Of the four stars I awarded, three are for Barrymore who tried hard to hold this mess together with sweetness and charm. In the end, though, this movie is just too poorly conceived.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Slightly above average for a romantic comedy, genius for Adam Sandler","There are some serious problems with ""50 First Dates"" but thanks to some good chemistry between the leads it works enough of the time to warrant a mild recommendation. The plot follows Adam Sandler as Henry Roth. He specializes in picking up vacationing women and then dumping them right before they go back to their regular lives. One day Henry meets a woman named Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). The two hit it off and set up a date to meet the next morning but when Henry approaches her, she doesn't remember him. Turns out one year ago Lucy was in a car accident which left her incapable of forming new memories; every day she wakes up thinking it's Sunday, October 13. Despite her condition, Henry is smitten. Against the wishes of her family and despite the warnings by her friends, Henry attempts to romance Lucy over and over.When the movie is focused on the romance between Henry and Lucy, it works. Sandler and Barrymore have some good chemistry and there's a genuinely romantic idea at work here. Who wouldn't want to be loved by someone who would go above and beyond to make sure they were happy, even if it meant suffering and getting their heart broken every night? Thanks to her bubbly personality, Barrymore convincingly plays a woman that is a lot of fun to be around and would be worth the time and effort required to have her fall in love with you daily. Sandler also does a good job, playing a guy that falls hard for the girl and manages to make himself seem worthy when he doesn't resort to coddling her like everyone else. Sure at first he's an unrealistically talented ladies man that's basically a scumbag (and not a particularly clever one at that) but I warmed up to him eventually. The two leads make a good couple and their characters are well developed with some subtle touches (for example, you know that Lucy loves elephants not because she says so, but because she's constantly painting them). This is what manages to save the movie from the dreadful comedy that is typical of the Happy Madison brand.The romance and the couple involved are charming, but whenever the story focuses on the ""comedy"" side characters, you want to fast-forward through the film. Typical of Adam Sandler's brand of humor these are all either weird ethnicities, are physically deformed, unattractive and/or speaking in funny voices. I absolutely hate this kind of comedy. Yeah I know it appeals to some people, but so does a well-placed kick to the crotch (oh wait, there's some of those in the movie). Here's what you can look forward to cringing at: Rob Schneider as Ula, a marijuana enthusiast with a weird eye that hates his wife; Sean Astin as Marlin, Lucy's lisping, steroid-addicted brother; Lusia Strus as Alexa, a dimwitted marine biologist (or marine assistant, whatever) whose gender is unclear, and a bunch of other one-joke characters that contribute nothing worthwhile to the film. If the story could have just disposed of these time-wasters and the sub-plot where Henry is a commitment avoiding womanizer (which gets suddenly dropped about a third into the film anyway) the whole thing could have been very sweet and very romantic. I can picture it now, the doomed romance, the question of ""does love conquer all?"" We might even have a bittersweet ending, reminding us that it is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all because who could really keep up this elaborate romance for the rest of their life? Someone out there please rip off this movie and forget to include all of the comedy! I have very mixed feelings about the movie overall. I even get some inner dilemmas that are totally unrelated to the general plot of the movie! As a responsible adult, I feel like I should be obligated to take away a half star from ""50 First Dates"" for having a lame joke that involves spoiling the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" but the movie also has a scene where Rob Schneider gets brutally beaten by an aluminum baseball bat-wielding Barrymore, so I think those two cancel each other out.In the end there is enough in the film that works to make it overall a pleasant experience, particularly because the further into the story you go, the less Adam Sandler's traditional humor is present. It's too bad the film makers lacked confidence in their love story because it really could have been great and as is, it's just OK, with the good chemistry and compelling love plot raising it to just above average. If lame humor that at times involves a walrus projectile vomiting, constant references to sea animal genitalia and a lot of mean-spirited humor is exactly what you're looking for, you'll have a great time (though I wonder if you'll appreciate the love story). If what I just described seems like utter rubbish it is... but that stuff doesn't last too long and by the end you'll have mostly forgotten about it so you'll still have a good time thanks to the leads.

Don't forget about this one,"You know, this movie was actually worth remembering. Sandler does a funny take on an actual syndrome in which a person has extremely limited short term memory. In this movie, Lucy Whitmore's (Drew Barrymore) memory cache is cleared every 24 hours. Her father and brother do all they can to make her life normal, they do a daily routine to set things up as though every day was the day after her last memory. Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) throws a wrinkle in her life when he tries to woo her in spite of knowing of her memory problem.The story made for some very funny situations, and the Sandler/Barrymore duo is a good combination (definitely a whole lot better than the Sandler/Ryder combo). The movie doesn't blow you away, but it provides some good laughs and a heart-felt ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Favorite Sandler Comedy Ever,"I can't begin to say how much I like this movie. Barrymore is better in this than the Wedding Singer. It is a Sandler comedy so I've rated it with the idea in mind that it's purpose is to make you laugh and also tells a great, albeit unlikely story. Sandler is superb in movies he doesn't write. I don't like most of the movies where Sandler has had a heavy writing credit. Those are usually too sophomoric to be enjoyed. The music is great, the setting is great, the story is great and the characters are hilarious. I often wonder how people can take things so seriously. I mean if you read the synopsis or see the trailer for a movie Sandler is in and it looks like a corny comedy then go in with the right attitude. I watch this movie every time I see it on because it is just enjoyable. Barrymore can be mesmerizing at times. I can't think of a single character that is annoying.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable despite a tough to believe plot,"50 FIRST DATES is a very enjoyable film--especially as a date movie. However, it's also a film that also has a plot that is completely ridiculous and unbelievable, so you really need to be able to put aside your critical side and just sit back and take the movie for what it is--a nice romantic-comedy.Adam Sandler is a tough actor to pigeonhole. On one hand, he's the guy who made such obnoxious comedies as LITTLE NICKY but on the other, he can make some enjoyable comedies (WATERBOY) and probably his best film was another romance starring Drew Barrymore, THE WEDDING SINGER. Considering how successful and sweet this film was, it's certainly not surprising that they'd return for another try.This time, the plot is very unusual to say the least. Adam plays a rather shallow womanizer who becomes totally infatuated with a woman who is just about impossible to get to love because she cannot remember anything that occurred after an accident. In other words, no matter how much he captivates her and makes her love him, when she awakens, she can't remember anything from the previous day. While brain damage can create an individual with impaired short-term memory, the way the illness is portrayed is pure fiction....as is the idea that any guy could see a future with anyone with such an injury. It's sure fun seeing Drew and Adam together, but you just can't take the plot seriously at all.My advice on this one is to watch it. And, if the plot is too much to handle, switch it off and try something else. However, if you stick with it, nice acting and a nice quirky romance might just make it worth your time. Oh, and guys, this is a great ""chick flick""--even if you don't like it, your special someone very likely will.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

50 First Dates - 1 Viewing only,"'50 First Dates' tells the story of Henry Roth (Sandler) who falls in love with Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) but there is just one problem. Lucy relives the same day again and again so Henry must find a way to make her fall in love with him every single day.Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are perfect for the roles and they have a lot of chemistry between each other. This really helps the film seem real but the film itself has it's weaknesses. The story takes a while to really kick into gear but when it does the film vastly improves. One flaw with the film however is that the jokes are hilarious with some making you cry with laughter but they are just too few and they have lost all their fizz by the time the final quarter of the film has arrived. Sean Astin and Rob Schneider co-star as Lucy's brother Doug and Henry's best friend Ula. Astin's character is next to useless in the film and has no real purpose to the storyline except the odd giggle. Schneider's character Ula however, is absolutely hilarious and the real star of the movie.'50 First Dates' seems like a brilliant film idea on paper and it does work pretty well on screen.

The worst film I have ever had the misfortune to sit through aside from 'The Family Man',"This film came as no surprise to me because I generally can't stand Adam Sandler- he can't act, he's not funny and he's got an irritating voice. But aside from him I honestly saw nothing good about this film- it was predictable and boring, bordering on stupid. That said, the only gag I laughed at was when the walrus threw up but that was not enough to redeem this film for me. Those who like it, fair enough, I'm not trying to be rude or anything. I'm just stating my opinion. But to those who haven't seen it, I say DON'T, unless you happen to like Adam Sandler films. Most people I know loved this but I couldn't wait for it to end- maybe it was just me, but is there anyone else who hated it too?",,Anonymous,Romance
"What do Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Memento, and Groundhog Day have in common?","Well, nothing really, but if you mix them all together you get this movie. Sandler and Barrymore delivered a wonderful romantic comedy with The Wedding Singer, the vast success of which made me more than a little skeptical about whether or not they could successfully play different characters than they played in that movie and still be convincing as they fall in love again. And again. And again. And again.The psychological realism of Lucy Whitmore's (Barrymore) problem is beside the point. We already know that short term memory loss doesn't happen on a daily schedule, let's not split hairs here. The point is that her 'condition' (a great homage could have been made if it had been described that way in the movie at some point, by the way) provides a constantly re-booting stream of possibilities for Adam Sandler to act cute and make us all grin ('Sorry I'm not better looking') as he tries to stop being the gigolo that he is at the beginning of the movie and tries desperately to find a way to make Lucy fall in love with him permanently.If you can get past the requirement that you have to believe that any character played by Adam Sandler is a womanizer, then you're well on your way to enjoying the movie. Sandler puts in sort of a mixture of his traditional roles, which tend to include either a lot of sarcasm and anger and fart jokes if he's in a sophomoric comedy like Billy Madison or Big Daddy, or a hopeless and lovable romantic, desperate for affectionate attention but unable to communicate his intentions with women. And while there is plenty of gross out in the movie (consider a scene, for example, where Sandler's co-worker, Jennifer, who is a gross-out ploy him/herself, is covered from head to toe in the flying vomit of a gleeful walrus), Sandler's character pretty much sticks to his determination to win Lucy's heart for more than one day at a time. Yes, there is discussion about walruses having the largest penises in the animal kingdom, but is that really important when you have scenes like the one where Lucy and Henry (Sandler) both catch each other dancing in joy about their first successful encounter in the restaurant in the beginning of the movie?Of course the typical Sandler cast members are all here. The incomprehensible coach from The Waterboy plays the part of Lucy's protective father, Rob Schneider, as usual, plays distantly below his comedic abilities as a goofy character who wears too-short shorts and has discolored eyes and a bad accent, and Dan Aykroyd also makes a clever cameo appearance, while Sean Astin delivers yet another embarrassing performance as Lucy's insecure and bulky brother with an extreme lisp. It is indeed strange and unfortunate to observe what happens to child stars when they stop being cute.The movie makes clever use of videotape to remind Lucy every day of who that guy is in her bed with her, and makes a pretty charming conclusion to her ultimate, and necessary, decision that it's not fair for Henry to have to put up with reminding her who he is every day. The major problem with the movie, however, is that it suffers from the confliction of the characteristics of the character we're supposed to like. This is exactly why Bad Santa didn't work, we were supposed to root for a guy who literally had not a single solitary redeeming value.The movie starts off by showing what Henry Roth's (Sandler) daily life is like, living on a tropical island and routinely bedding sexy tourist women looking for some horizontal accompaniment during their vacation. As he's trying to rid himself of a beautiful woman, he tells her that he's a secret agent who must avoid her for her own protection. Sure, the piece worked pretty well by itself in the theatrical trailer, but when it's attached to the rest of the movie it presents Henry not only as an un-trustable womanizer, but it also makes him out to be a complete moron to think that any girl with a thought in her head would buy such a nutty story. Character change is important, but it doesn't have to be from one extreme to the other.The result of combining this character with the much more interesting story of Lucy's memory disorder is a romantic comedy that's not as funny as a more deliberate, low-brow Sandler movie, and barely romantic at all. Lucy's memory disorder could have provided the premise for a far superior movie had it been made as a drama and without Adam Sandler. It's as if Sandler wandered onto the set of a dramatic film about her problem and he turned it into this. The interactions that Lucy has with her family, and especially the palpable care that her father clearly has for her certainly deserve a better movie. It tries to do too many different things and ends up doing none of them well.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Entertaining but not Excellent,"I have to say first of all that Drew Barrymore is my favourite actress, she is not only very very pretty, but extremely charismatic and talented. And her wonderful essence shined through as always in this film. I also adore Adam Sandler- he is very very funny and charmingly silly and all his great characteristics donned the screen. However, this movie was a bit of a disappointment for me. I do admit that it was entertaining and the story line kept my interest from beginning to end, but if it wasn't for the two amazing stars in it -Barrymore & Sandler- this movie would've totally sucked. I guess I was offended by the way the story made fun of amnesia and short-term memory loss. I kept thinking throughout the whole movie that if someone really had this disorder, it would be completely and utterly awful! I know that comedy is meant to make light of certain negative things and I did laugh often, but I would immediately feel guilty... so I constantly had mixed feelings about everything that was going on in the film. The setting is in Hawaii and therefore the movie brings you to a warm and welcoming place. There is also a great collection of '80's & '70's songs scattered throughout the film that is also very comforting and nice to hear. There are many good qualities about this flick, but if you are very sensitive like I am, the issue of making fun of a mental disorder/physical disability may offend you- so be prepared. However if you can look past that, you can find yourself having a good time.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

so so,"50 First Dates is a watchable, sort of funny but nothing more. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have genuine chemistry.

The movie gets off to a slow start, with Barrymore's father and brother trying to tell her it's the same day all over again day after day. This part of the movie is not believable because sooner or later she would catch on. The second half improves because it has more of Barrymore and Sandler together. Still, I am not a big fan of Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore. Sandler plays the same character over and over again.

An imperfectly good movie,"Fifty first date has a lot of potential. In fact, in some sense, the movie succeeds in realizing the core theme: persistent and undying love for someone in spite of the daunting condition of a short term memory; nothing hurts more than to be forgotten by someone you love. Moreover, the creative measures the protagonist undertakes to help his lover remember him are moving and touching. Overall, the dramatic and romantic elements of the movie are wonderful, but the comedic elements are typical Sandler humor extraneous to the film's essence. For many reviewers, Sandler's style of humor has a corrosive effect on the film, but I think the strength and message of the film endures in spite of its flaws. I would add this this movie would easily be the best romantic movie had Sandler decided to make this into a romantic drama than a romantic comedy. This doesn't mean he should do away with any comedic elements. There were some decent ones, but he could easily get ride of a lot of bad comedic moments. Moreover, Sandler is capable of doing drama as evidenced by his decent performance in drama movies like Reign Over Me and Punch Drunk Love. It would have been one more decent drama performed by Sandler. Unfortunately, it is too late and the flaws will remain permanent parts of the film. Nonetheless, I still think this is a good movie which is quite underrated due to the recent and understandable backlash against Sandler.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sandler's First Foray Into Romance (With Chaotic Results),"In his earlier efforts, Adam Sandler was known for his goofy comedy in movies such as ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Billy Madison"", and even ""The Waterboy"". With ""50 First Dates"", however, Sandler tries to add a bit of emotion into his juvenile sense of comedy. The result is closer to chaos than consistency.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Hawaii-based ladies man Henry Roth (Sandler) living the bachelor life by churning through one woman after the other. When he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), however, everything changes for Henry. The reason? Due to short-term memory loss, Lucy relives the same day over and over again, never remembering the events of the previous 24 hours. Thus, Henry must decide whether to take advantage of this situation, or help Lucy live a happier life.The trouble with this movie is that Sandler's crude sense of humor does not mesh well with the more heartfelt tone of the overall picture. It is almost as if two movies are going on at the same time...one where Sandler cracks sexual jokes with his buds (of which again include Rob Schneider), and one where Sandler interacts on a more personal level with Barrymore.It would have taken a great directorial effort to make this juxtaposition work, but unfortunately Peter Segal just wasn't up to the task in this case. The movie actually needed to focus a bit more on the ""serious"" stuff and leave off some of the crudeness. Had that happened, it would have worked much better due to the intriguing ""memory-loss"" concept.Thus, I was solidly underwhelmed by ""50 First Dates"". It isn't unwatchable, but it really can only succeed as an adolescent ""date movie"" for those new to Sandler's comedic persuasions. It may make you think/feel on a deep level for a second or two, but those moments are quickly abandoned for another crude joke or sight gag.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Clever Existential Romantic Comedy,"What would happen if you met a soul-mate by accident in a café, hit it off really well, made a date for the next day, and then, when you met her, you notice that she does not remember you at all? This happens to Henry (Adam Sandler), who is completely confused until the café owner pulls him aside and lets him know that Lucy (Drew Barrymore), the girl in question, has brain damage from an auto accident which causes her short term memory to be erased every time she goes to sleep for the night. Henry is discouraged to realize that, if he wants to get to know Lucy, he has to hook up with her fresh every day, and on a bet with one of the cooks in the café, he does this until he realizes something extraordinary is happening--he is falling in love.Enter a premise for a romantic comedy that seems a little weak on the surface, but actually turns out to have a lot behind it. The idea is clearly inspired by the now classic Groundhog Day, with its notion of an endless existential loop, and actually asks the question of whether a person can somehow manage to develop a coherent existence if they have to start fresh every day. Henry and Lucy recreate their relationship every day, and the question is whether it can possibly last.The film is fun--not only because of the performances of the leads, but also a set of supporting characters who clearly are up for the situation. Sandler gives a really good performance--the irony of his character is that before the relationship, he has a phobia about commitment, and once he has met a woman for whom this is not an issue, he actually wishes more and more that he can have a long-term relationship. The relationship actually goes through the normal phases--getting more and more serious as time goes on, with Sandler with the aid of Lucy's family finding more and more ingenious ways to reacquaint Lucy very quickly with the specifics of her life each day. Can it work? Obviously you need to see the movie to find out.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Every once in a while she finds out the truth and is very upset till the next day when she has forgotten. Henry gets the idea to make a video for her to watch in the morning that tells her the truth.

The way of her family to protect memory-loss Lucy, which they pretend as if the day hasn't proceed since she gets into an accident, might be viewed as too much at times, but her family literally cherishes her from bottom of their heart.From this film, I figure out that we need to spend a day without regret, we'll never know what would become of us the next day.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming and Fresh Sandler Romantic Comedy,"""50 First Dates"" features Adam Sandler in a more subdued comedic role than he has previously exhibited in films. His performance in ""50 First Dates"" is much akin to ""The Wedding Singer"", which is a pleasant deviation from his recently zany roles in outrageous comedies. He is teamed once again with Drew Barrymore, and (you guessed it), they once again develop a romance- yet is a romance really a romance when one of the partners cannot recall your name the following morning? This is a clever premise, set most curiously in Hawaii (perhaps the director felt a tropical setting was appropriate for the ""sweet and temperate"" plot): a man named Henry (Sandler) falls in love with a woman named Lucy (Barrymore), and despite their peculiarities and differences, they manage to really hit it off on the romantic course. That is, until the following morning, when Henry goes to meet Lucy in the diner and is acquainted with consternation: ""Who are you?"" Yes, Lucy appears to have a memory problem, short-term amnesia, where she cannot recall any events of the previous day. Why does Henry continue to woo Lucy, even after acknowledging that their (conscious) romance can only last a day? Perhaps love at first sight... So ensues a series of hilarious attempts by Sandler to woo and eventually form a romance akin to ""Groundhog Day"", where the same scenarios are carried out day after day until the man with the prerogative (or disposition thereof) finally decides to make important, helpful use of the situation. This is a sweet, charming, sometimes too sentimental, sometimes too implausible, and even smart, romantic comedy, featuring some delightful performances by Sandler and Barrymore, who once again prove their status as a romantic team in movies. The ending lacked much resolution, but at least it ended on a good note. Overall, I definitely recommend ""50 First Dates"" as a decent romantic comedy, and a handbook on how to make the girl of your dreams, who believes you are invisible or nonexistent, fall in love with you, time and again. *** out of ****",,Anonymous,Romance
A nice light hearted rom-com,"50 First dates is a romantic comedy movie directed by Peter Segal and stars Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Rob Schneider, Blake Clark and Sean Austin.Though it's a little difficult to get convinced for the plot the movie is still entertaining and enjoyable. The movie is sweet at times and the movie gives you a feel good feeling.Acting is good and Barrymore is impressive. Sandler was equally impressive. Screenplay is good although mostly predictable. Direction is good.Overall it's a light hearted romantic comedy movie with funny but heartwarming scenes. A must watch for rom-com lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
7 First Stars,"This move is a little out of Sandler's repertoire but it could be one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth: an ocean-cuddling bachelor who manages to enchant single women on their vacations in Hawaii, whose character also manages to use typical movie bachelor cliché.Though this side of Sandler is well under-developed because he soon falls for a woman (Drew Barrymore) who is living a Truman Show-esque life with the same day re-inacted by her stern but then soon loving father and her obnoxious brother who often makes a fool of himself when displaying muscular pride.Although the characters in this film sort of have a schizophrenia, due to the fact characters change insanely quickly, this film is indeed in its own. This is the romantic comedy unlike others. The humour is quirky and very little, with the walruses overused to display humorous inclination in Roth's life.Though of course we expected a happy ending from the start (what is a Rom Com without one?) but this film is sure a success. Occasionally funny but unlike Sandler the humour isn't forced down our throats. We aren't laughing at his over-portrayal of an extreme character, we're looking at a guy who realises he wants to use any means possible to get the 'girl of his dreams'.The film has unnecessary parts of it and Rob Schneider's part again was just absolute ridiculous, pushing stereotypes to the extreme in unfunny ways (Big Daddy his best attempt) but despite quick-changing characters this film is immense.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still one of my faves. After all these years.,"I know this is such a goofy unrealistic movie. I'm totally okay to suspend reality for a couple hours. I don't even know how many times I've watched this. So many weekends it's playing on a television I leave on for our cats haha. I'll be walking through the house, just going about my day and stop and watch if it's on. It just so damn sweet. I have always loved Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler. I love their chemistry in all their movies. Read not too long ago they were working on another one. Fingers crossed. The other characters are great too. Perfect setting for this one as well. At times it just makes you feel the sun on your face. Even the rainy days are beautiful. The animals are a nice addition and the music is just great. I am old now and maybe this reminds me of simpler times, when I first watched it, 20 years ago. Who knows. All I know is it's just so sweet and it's funny. Appropriate for most ages, and that's sure more than you can say about most movies in 2024. We've all been through a lot the last several years. If you need a feel good movie, this one might just do.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Only offers short term fun,"As I am not a fan of Adam Sandler and his type of humor, this film is no exception to the rule. Sandler plays a young man in Hawaii who is afraid of commitment until he meets a young girl who suffers from short term memory loss after an accident. Finally, Sandler's character commits to help this girl, and he falls in love. This is pretty much the same mold that his other films portray. If you enjoyed Sandler's sense of humor and other films, then you will probably enjoy this one too. The comedy can be funny in some places, but it is crude in others, but only expect to remember the jokes in the short term (no pun intended!). The humor, however, is not quite as crude as some of his previous films. As I am not a fan of Adam Sandler and this type of comedy, I have to rate this one a 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Groundhog Day"" meets ""When Harry Met Sally..."" via ""Memento""","50 FIRST DATES (2004) *** Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Rob Schneider, Sean Astin, Lusia Strus, Dan Aykroyd, Amy Hill, Blake Clark, Allen Covert, Maya Rudolph, Pomaika'I Brown. 'Groundhog Day' meets 'Memento' via 'When Harry Met Sally' could've been the pitch for this better than anticipated high concept romantic comedy vehicle for the appealing chemistry laden coupling of a womanizing Hawaiian veterinarian Sandler and artist Barrymore, whose short-term memory impaired by a car accident has him endlessly meeting cute and pitching woo to get her to fall in love with him all over again. What sounds like a one-trick pony of a screenplay novice scribe George Wing makes some nice choices for his characters in moving the plot along with a joke-a-minute pacing that surprisingly works from the get go. Nice to see Sandler reign in his frat boy image and his pairing with Barrymore  very sweet by the way  should be a regular thing not unlike Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan of recent memory. Funny and sweet.

"Pretty good, all in all","In spite of some bad reviews I decided to watch this because I thought it would be more like Sandler's one good movie, The Wedding Singer, and my instincts were right. This does have much of the same tone as that movie, although it's marred by some of the cartooniness that makes most Sandler movies intolerable.I like the premise, which falls somewhere between Groundhog's Day and Clean Slate, as Sandler has to make a girl with short term memory loss re-fall in love with him every day. While I find it hard to accept Sandler as a lady's man (I also find it hard to accept him as a phenomenally successful actor, so I guess I'm out of sync with the American public), he and Barrymore have a good chemistry that makes it work.What keeps this film from working as well as Wedding Singer is the aforementioned cartooniness, represented by Ula, who seems to fall into the category of, ""if someone's really ugly and has a weird accent then they should be ridiculed"" and pathetic bodybuilder Doug. These characters feel completely out of place amidst the movie's low-key charm, as though they wandered in from one of Sandler's low comedies.There is something generally unfocused about the movie. It can also be seen in an odd throwaway shot of the auto accent, which adds absolutely nothing to the movie, like the character of Ula. Wedding Singer had a very definite vision of what it was going for and Dates suffers from a lack of that vision. But it is moderately amusing and rather sweet, so all in all it's a good movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nothing beats a first kiss,"Nothing beats a first kissHenry (Adam Sandler) lives in Hawaii, works as a veterinarian for marine animals, and spends his free time on one-night stands. Then he meets a local girl (Drew Barrymore) who radically changes his attitude about being single, but the very next day he realizes that she has a memory disorder and that she wakes up every day without remembering the previous one. Most people would give up in disappointment, but Henry decides to win her over every day.You probably know what to expect from a movie starring Adam. You will not see technical qualities here. The typical Sandlerian humor is also nothing special. Cheap jokes will be hilarious only to children, although I have to admit that I laughed out loud a couple of times. After all, it's not just Sandler here in charge of comedy, there are also Rob Schneider and the legendary Dan Aykroyd.But ""50 First Dates"" is a romantic comedy that focuses more on romance than comedy, and it turned out to be the right move. The film is extremely emotional and shows only the best aspects of human nature, and the chemistry between the main characters is catchy. Maybe this movie is trying to catch you on basic emotions (not to say pathetic) and fairy-tale outcomes, and it has no touch points with reality, but it does it very effectively and you really have to be made of stone not to get caught at least a little bit.If you want to relax with a ""feel good/guilty pleasure"" movie, you won't be disappointed with ""50 First Dates"".6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Groundhog Day"" Meets ""Memento"" -- NOT","Expected to see ""Groundhog Day Meets Memento"" as a subject of one of the moronic viewers here (although ""See It 50 Times!!!"" never seemed like a possible refrain so thought I'd try to jump that gun.Taking the former's premise, penultimate bachelor/hound Sandler has to woo brain-damaged Drew every day in a (totally) different way...Why he does this (in that totally different way) is never clear.  Why she doesn't respond exactly the same way every day isn't clear either.Which is okay.My wife and I saw this the day it was released, and we were vacationing in Hawai'i, on Oahu, where some of this is filmed (and where all of it is set).We'd just visited the Sea Life touristy park where Sandler's character is purportedly one of the marine biologists.Side note: there are no walruses on any island of Hawai'i, so the entire opening comedy blitz is lame.  Sea lions yes.  Walruses no.As for the film, it really couldn't be more manipulative.  Some of the comedy yanks a laugh, many of the scenes with Barrymore draw tears.Schneider's fairly good as a native Hawai'ian but his character is as stereotypical as you'll find (see the Honolulu Star-Bulletin for 2/13/04).Oh yeah -- Sean Astin isn't a Hobbit here.

50 First Dates is on the small shelf.,"First, let's forget about the facile comparison between this movie and Groundhog Day. Anything with Bill Murray in it is just to annoying to be taken seriously. Second, this is nothing like Groundhog Day, anyway. It's much better. And don't for an instant listen to the idiots who are comparing this movie to Memento, still the most overrated, vapid, pointless, gimmicky, dull, worthless movie ever to be hyped into the public psyche. But I digress.Drew Barrymore is undoubtedly the most adorable woman in movies today. She's beautiful, bubbly, child-like and yet sexy. In short, she's perfect. If Meg Ryan is getting too old to do all the Meg Ryan movies, no worries. Drew is there, ready, willing and able to become America's cinema darling. And she's cuter than Meg.But what about Sandler? Isn't he a crude, obnoxious, fart-joking, hooligan who isn't as funny as the thinks he is? See, you're still thinking about the OLD Adam Sandler. This is the new Adam. He's funny, sensitive, vulnerable, and yes, adorable. In short, he's matured as an actor, making the pairing of Adam and Drew the best romantic comedy pairing since the aforementioned Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.The story is fairly simple. Drew has a problem with her short term memory, and Adam loves her but has to convince her to fall in love with him all over again every day. But the story isn't in the telling, it's in the watching. Drew and Adam flutter around each other like butterflies, dazzling in the sun, as the delicate journey from being strangers to becoming lovers is repainted every day. And yes, there are fart-jokes and vomit-gags enough to make any Sandler fan happy.One thing that makes this movie so enjoyable is the amazing soundtrack. I can put the DVD on and simply listen while I surf, and the music alone is delightful. But what really makes the movie is the way it starts where you would expect it to, a typical Sandler movie, and then floats beautifully higher and higher into the realm of cinema gold. It isn't until about midway through the movie that you realize you've got more on your hands than you expected, and by the end of the movie, if you aren't crying you should ask for a refund on that therapy you've been taking, because you haven't learned to express your emotions at all.Maybe half a dozen times a year I find a movie that enters the list of my favorites, and I can pull them off the shelf and love them all over again for years to come.

Could Have Been A First Rate Romantic Comedy If It Had Been Taken Seriously,"To be perfectly honest, I feel almost guilty giving this movie only 5/10. It has a lot of potential as a romantic comedy and there's a lot of fun in it, but for all the good points about this movie, it has a lot of weak points as well, that can be summed up as follows: Adam Sandler! I shouldn't be too hard on Sandler, I guess. I mean, he didn't produce this, or direct this, or write this. But he did star in it. From a strictly personal perspective, I simply don't care for Sandler; never have and never will. And even though I can't hold Sandler responsible for how this movie is put together, how it's put together and the fact that it fits Sandler to a ""T"" just reinforces to me what the problem with him is. It seems to me that he wants to be taken as a serious actor (the movies I've seen him in always seem to have something of a ""serious"" subplot to them) but I wonder if he just doesn't have the confidence to think he can pull it off, and so ends up falling back on the more juvenile plot lines that his movies will be largely remembered for.This could have been a truly first-rate romantic comedy. The plot is probably nonsense from a medical point of view, but from a comedic point of view it's OK. Lucy (Drew Barrymore) suffers a brain injury in an accident and suffers short-term memory loss, which means that she remembers nothing since the accident, and she wakes up every day thinking it's October 13. (Sort of like ""Groundhog Day,"" except that Bill Murray's character knew he was repeating the same day over and over again.) Everyone around her protects her from reality by going along with what she remembers. Then, one day, Henry Roth (Sandler) enters the diner where Lucy is having breakfast, and they fall head over heels. The next day he's back, and so's she - but she doesn't remember a thing about him. The movie then proceeds with the premise that the love-stricken Roth has to convince Lucy to fall in love every day with a man who to her is a complete stranger in order to keep the relationship going. And that basic premise is good, and it works very well, and to give credit where credit is due Sandler plays the part well, when he's taking it seriously. But therein lies the problem. This is an Adam Sandler movie, and it has to fall into typical Sandler-style juvenile thinking, which is displayed largely around a couple of characters.Why does Lucy's brother Doug (Sean Astin) have to be a lisping steroid-abuser? It would been far more effective had he been just another serious, caring and compassionate person in Lucy's life trying to protect her, and the character of Ten Second Tom (Allan Covert) is meaningless. Setting them aside, though, my real pet peeve then appears: the character Ula (Rob Schneider.) Ula grates on the viewer and is totally unnecessary to the movie's development, and serves no purpose whatsoever - absolutely none - except to get Rob Schneider a paycheck. As to Sandler's Henry Roth, I have no problem with him being a veterinarian, even a vet who specializes in walruses (someone has to, I guess) but the trained walruses in the movie kind of give this a sense of being an adult-oriented kiddie movie.What a shame. It's really a good idea for a movie, and if its producers, writers, director, etc. had chosen to treat it as a more serious romantic comedy, it could have reached great heights. Drew Barrymore was superb as Lucy, alternatively being in love with Henry and then hating him (depending on the day) and portrays brilliantly Lucy's fear and shock at discovering the reality of her existence. Dan Aykroyd's talents were largely and unfortunately wasted as Lucy's neurologist, Dr. Keats. Lesser known Blake Clark was convincing as Lucy's protective (and over-protective) dad, and Sandler himself did very well when he was treating this as a serious movie for grown-ups. But the whole typical Sandler-Schneider thing just got to me and I can't give it any better than a 5.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
uneven romantic comedy,"In '50 First dates' - which might well be subtitled 'When 'Memento' Met 'Groundhog Day'' - Drew Barrymore plays a young woman whose short term memory has been destroyed in a car accident a few months prior to the time of the story. As a result, Lucy wakes up every morning still believing it is the day of the accident, while every night her memory of that current day is wiped away while she sleeps. Her father and her brother have devised an elaborate charade to avoid her finding out the truth, assuming that she will live a much happier life if she is kept in blissful ignorance of her condition. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a veterinarian who's deathly afraid of commitment and figures Lucy is the perfect woman for him. He can woo her afresh every day, secure in the knowledge that their relationship will never have to advance much beyond the getting-to-know-you stage - though this doesn't make for a very logical plan since winning her over day after day requires a lot more work and effort than a conventional relationship ever would. Nevertheless, this seems to Henry to be the ideal setup, until, of course, he begins to actually fall for the hapless young woman, revealing that he is not quite the callous rogue he appears to be on the surface.Your enjoyment of '50 First Dates' may be predicated on just how willing you are to accept brain damage as a source of mirth and high comedy. If you are somehow able to quell the queasiness that comes with the premise, you might be charmed by what happens in the film.This is basically a gimmicky, one-joke comedy that indulges in far too many distractions to be very successful. There is, admittedly, a certain sweetness to many of the scenes involving Barrymore and Sandler as they try to make a go of this highly unusual courtship. The final scene, in particular, has a kind of offbeat poignancy that feels both daring and satisfying. However, the film is populated by a whole host of annoying characters who work overtime to deaden the charm: Lucy's steroid-obsessed brother, Henry's creepy co-workers, and even an anthropomorphic walrus who high-fives his trainer, mugs for the camera, and vomits on cue - and whose sizable genitalia serves as the source for one of the many lowbrow gags that run through the film.In 'Punch Drunk Love,' Sandler proved that he has the potential to stretch as an actor. Barrymore has yet to make that case. Her wide-eyed, innocent ingénue shtick has become a trifle threadbare by now. It's time for her to take a leap of faith into more challenging roles and show us what - if anything - else she can do.",,Anonymous,Romance

The directing, music, editing, etc are not focused on at all. Overall, the film was...""eh"". Sorry Sandler, but almost every joke in this movie is absolutely pointless. Nothing to laugh at, yet heartfelt from the first frame to the last. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one.

Natural Chemistry,"At its core, 50 First Dates has an incredible amount of heart. The love story between Henry and Lucy is beautiful and real.

The next day when Henry returns for their second date, Lucy acts like she does not know him.

So Henry sets about a daily task to make Lucy fall for him anew every day.

Loved Hawaii!,"For once I'm grateful for the Khamakazee antics of Sandler's acting ensemble, particularly Sean Astin and Rob Schneider. If Schneider wasn't playing such a farcial role, he would be a natural for an Oscar. Certainly the animals add a lot to the farce.

So, Sandler, the lothario who forgots his relationships with mainlanders after one week finds himself in love with a woman who forgets hers in 24 hours.

That being said, I have no problem with the ridiculous plot-line. I pretty much expect it with an Adam Sandler movie. The problem with this movie is that its not funny enough to overcome to horrible plot. Normally, you accept the bad story line because all you really expect out of the movie is to laugh and enjoy it. With this movie, however, it seems like the creators wanted to make this like every other romantic comedy, where the love story is more important than the comedy.

Cute date or girls'-night movie,"""50 First Dates"" is one of the more enjoyable romantic comedies made in recent years, relying a lot on Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler's chemistry to carry off the out-there but original plot. The idea of Sandler's Henry Roth being the irresistible ladies' man that he's presented to be in the first few minutes is a stretch and thankfully falls away soon after he meets Barrymore's Lucy. What puts this movie above a lot of other Adam Sandler comedies is that, unlike many of his other love interests that might as well be named ""Love Interest"" for all they have to do with the plots, Lucy is an actual character who has a journey to go on too. The viewer really wants to see both main characters overcome their obstacles and come together at the end.The supporting cast, however, is not as strong as it could be. Blake Clark delivers a fine performance as Lucy's doting, protective father and Dan Aykroyd has a nice extended cameo as her doctor. However, I don't buy Sean Astin as Lucy's steroid-enhanced, lisping brother; and Henry's sidekicks androgynous Alexa and Ula (Lusia Strus and Rob Schneider, respectively) are good for a gag or two but don't really serve a purpose. Meanwhile, Amy Hill as Lucy's surrogate mother Sue is sadly underused.It's not a perfect movie, but it's a good movie that leaves you smiling at the end.",,Anonymous,Romance

Happy ending?,I won't give anything away but I thought this film could have gone somewhere else.  It was funny and kind of crude.  It was what you expect from Sandler and he is a very funny guy.  Drew was good and played her role well.  The film was okay and had some good laughs but I just felt it missed something. Oh well check it out if you have a chance it is a good date movie.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Charming, motivating and leaves you with positivity","Don't fall for the lower ratings from critics. Romcoms have never been popular with them and the movie is too ""simplistic"" for their taste.The movie is an old fashion love story with no cosmetics, sexism or villains. Of course, it's fictional (and so are all the Superhero movies by the way) so don't really go by the medical inaccuracies (it's not like Gamma rays are going to create Hulk).Overall, it is a charming plot. It's a happy version of ""The Notebook"" and ""A walk to remember"".",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Cried,"This movie is funny. It's packed with magnetically funny characters and the actors have great timing. The Sandman and Drew work great together and Schneider and Astin steal the show. The Hawaiian backdrop is gorgeous. I am a huge Minnesota Vikings fan and I love that my team is part of the movie, even though I have no idea why.But what I really love about this movie is the love story, I was surprisingly and, at times, overwhelmingly touched by Henry and Lucy's plight. During the conclusion, while Israel kamakawiwo'ol's version of ""Somewhere over rainbow"" plays gently, I had tears running down cheeks. Like a lot of Sandler movies, there is a beating heart mixed into the silliness. I heard this one loud and clear.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst movie I've ever seen.,"This movie is the theatrical equivalent of Chinese water torture - slow, tedious, annoying, painful. The plot consists of a tragic and utterly depressing backstory that's dressed up as a candy-coated romantic comedy. The characters consist of what I guess are supposed to be wacky and hilarious people and sea animals, but the lines are poorly timed and/or written and the personalities so far-fetched that they are completely shallow and unrelatable. Rob Schneider should be a spokesman for an environmental activism group, because he is the king of recycling. The jokes consist mainly of walrus penises and other toilet humor. You know the writing is bad when they bring in animals as actual characters. Don't waste your time and money, do something more exciting like sort your loose change in to piles ordered by the date they were minted.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Such a great romantic comedy,I really love this movie. The chemistry between Adam Sandler and Drew Berrymore is really really nice and I think they enjoyed doing this movie. The Story is somehow sad (I will not spoil) but both of them and also the other support actors like Rob Schneider and her brother and father are playing very nice. The movie has some really funny moments and you will enjoy watching it with your family or girlfriend if you haven't seen it yet. In total it is not the average Adam Sandler comedy but more like a romantic comedy WITH Adam Sandler. I have watched this film already countless times and it gives you always positive vibes.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like an old car with a new Earl Scheib paint job.,"""50 First Dates"" is about a brain-damaged woman (Barrymore) who has short term memory loss such that she wakes up every day unable to remember the previous day and therefore thinks every day is the same day. Such is the premise of this Hawaiian flavored flick in which the always deadpan Sandler grapples with the memory issue while trying to fall in love with a woman who greets him daily like a complete stranger. Add some kookie characters, some pretty Hawaiian scenery, a few cute marine animals, and some very ordinary music and you have one uninspired formula romcom which is nothing special but should be a pleasing time-passer for young adult females and Sandler and Barrymore fans.

"Emotional, sad romantic movie, but a lot of funny moments","Yes, this movie did have some cool funny moments and was enjoyable to watch.

Special only for the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore,"This film is typical Adam Sandler fare,with Sandler playing the usual type of character that we expect to see.It's the usual juvenilistic, sophomoric Adam Sandler in action.I must admit there are a few of his films(but certainly not all) that I consider guilty pleasures.This one falls into that category for one reason only:The great chemistry between Sandler and Drew Barrymore.They worked so well together previously,that you naturally expect the same here.In that regard,you will not be disappointed.It's not as good as their previous outing together,but it's great seeing them together on screen nonetheless.The story does have a little sweetness to it,but overall,it's nothing special.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

50 First Dates,"A harmless feel-good romantic comedy with Adam Sandler on usual form as a bit of a commitment-phobe. That is, until he meets ""Lucy"" (Drew Barrymore"") and he really thinks he has found true love. The snag is that she has some pretty serious short-term memory issues and so each time they meet, he has a sort of first date groundhog day to get through. This is a bit of a one joke movie, though some of the daily variations inject a little extra to the, sometimes laboured, prevailing theme. Decent enough performances from the leads - with a strong supporting cast (including Dan Ackroyd, Sean Astin & Rob Schneider) - make this a watchable, if forgettable rom-com.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lovely romance story,"What do you will if your crush doesn't remember you? I guess we don't have patience like the guy in this movie. Every day makes her love him, maybe just fiction but I think this is the purpose of the movie. We were married, and we were dating but maybe we have forgotten the feeling when love. We stick together for a long time so don't realize the importance of each other. The best scene of the movie is the man making a video for his wife and she can watch it after waking up. This video is about the journey of how they love, they were married, and have a child. So if you are in a relationship remember the advantages of your partner every day to respect their value of them.

"Slightly more charming than most Sandler pic's, but that's not saying much.","Adam Sandler is known for making goofy comedies, where he acts silly, and rude, and somehow this still charms the viewing public. I've come to realize the likability of Sandler's character does not make his movies any better, considering his most likable character was in ""Little Nicky"" and that was a terrible picture. However, he is slightly more likable here, than in most of his other movies, and though this is a dumb, and not extremely funny comedy, it has a charm to it, somewhat from him, but more from Drew Barrymore who plays a good lead to level out Adam's goofiness.Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a player, and constantly gets with women, only to lie to them to get out of the relationship. One day, when eating breakfast, he meets a girl named Lucy (Drew Barrymore) who he falls for. He soon comes to realize that she has only a short term memory from an accident she had, and she forgets everything after the accident after every day. He tries to win her over everyday, and mildly amusing comedy ensues.As I've mentioned already, Adam Sandler was okay in this one, but nothing special for him. His character is better than in some of his films, but it's still his typical smart Alec jerk. Drew Barrymore is sweet and works well with Sandler, but she doesn't bring anything huge to the project. Her father is played by gravely voiced Blake Clark, and her brother is played by Sean Astin who has gone from a hobbit to a steroid junkie with a lisp, and both of these actors are good. Rob Schnieder plays Sandler's friend who works with him at the zoo, and he can be pretty annoying, but he makes little kids laugh. Finally, there's Dan Aykroyd who's in this for some reason playing the doctor that helps Lucy. He's not in much of it, and his jokes are pretty stupid.This is slightly above most of Sandler's other films, but it still only manages to reach mediocrity.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for language, crude and sexual humor.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A comedy, which at times wanted to be a drama but didn't work out to be the perfect dramedy","Well its February of 2004 and there was only one film that opened this weekend. So I can't say I had much of a choice this weekend except to see 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. I don't know what to think of Adam Sandler anymore. His career started out good with many funny guilty pleasure films like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and The Wedding singer. Then he went to the Waterboy, which was one of the worst films I have ever seen, and then went on to do some so/so films like Big Daddy & Little Nicky. Then every film after Little Nicky as been worst than the next, first with Mr. Deeds, then the awful Punch Drunk Love, then the animated disaster Eight Crazy Nights, and finally the incredibility stupid Anger Management. So needless to say I was very hesitant to see his new film 50 First Dates. The trailer to me didn't look like something I wanted to see but I figured he was teaming up with Drew Barrymore again and I liked the Wedding Singer so I figured what the hell I will give it a shot. I am sure it can't be that bad. So continue on reading to read my thoughts on 50 First DatesSo I walked into the local AMC Theater tonight (Great Product Placement huh) to see 50 First Dates at the 5:20pm showing. The film started and the basic story is this, Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth who is a playboy that sleeps around with all these different women and maybe a guy or two since that's what the film was stating in the beginning. Henry does this because he is scared of commitment so he figures sleeping around would be the best way to never have to commit. Well one day he sees Lucy (Drew Barrymore) at the dinner where he normally goes to eat his meals. He immediately falls in love with her and is no longer afraid of commitment. He only finds out later that Lucy suffers from Short Term Memory Loss and this is were the fun is supposed to start. To me the film seemed more like a Farrelly Brothers comedy than anything else.Well Adam Sandler is back at it again, same role as always, playing the immature guy who then all of a sudden grows up because he finds true love. Don't believe me watch Mr. Deeds, Anger Management; even films I liked of his like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore all have that love story. Well Adam Sandler does the best he can and by now if you like Adam Sandler you see him do the same thing over and over again and still go home happy. Drew Barrymore was pretty good in the film, although I liked her better in the Wedding Singer. She has a very likable character in the film and the way they write her character you feel very compassionate for her. I also think that Sandler and Barrymore both have great on screen chemistry. The supporting cast in this film is what really drove me nuts and which caused me to not like the film as much I probably would if they haven't been in it. I normally like Rob Schneider (yes he is my guilty pleasure for comedy) but in this film he was intolerable. I wanted him to go away. He annoyed me. His role was so dumb. He played this guy name Ula who was an always-high adventurer. Then we have Steve Astin who played Doug, Lucy's Brother in the film. I didn't get the joke in his character. He had a lisp and took steroids.. To me the character was very annoying. Well then they had this transsexual character, which seems to be the new latest joke in the Sandler films, again another badly written character that I would have been more than happy to do without.Newcomer George Wing wrote 50 First Dates and I have to assume that he sat down with Adam Sandler and revised the script a bit because there were some very Sandler moments in the film, which we all know he had to put in himself. The film itself seems like something the Farrelly brothers would have done. They usually take a serious disease or syndrome and turn it into a joke. I didn't think a lot of the jokes in the film worked. It was like they were first making fun of the syndrome and the character with the syndrome and then all of a sudden they want us to feel bad for the character. Granted it worked for some people but it didn't really work for me. Jen thought the film was sad and I thought of it more as a sappy way to get you to feel bad for the character. Either way is fine but I didn't care for them trying to mix my emotions. I didn't want to laugh at the character and then feel bad about it, which is basically what the film aimed to do. The Henry Roth character was decently scripted and so was Lucy's character. All the rest of the characters should have been thrown away. It was a so/so script some of it worked, some of it didn't. This film is like a version of Memento if it was turned into a romantic comedy.The film was directed by Peter Segal, who directed a total of six feature films, 50 first dates being the 6th. The first three films he directed I really enjoyed those being Naked Gun 33 1/3, Tommy Boy, and My Fellow Americans. Then he went on to direct the awful Nutty Professor 2 and Anger Management. So with a director who's first half of films I really enjoyed and the second half of films I didn't really like at all its hard to judge him. Mr. Segal did a great job of capturing the emotions of Lucy in the film. I also think he did a really good job with filming on location in Hawaii. He really caught the beautiful landscapes. I can't really blame the director for the things I didn't like about the film. Well I guess I can because in the end, he probably could have reviewed the film and taken some of the pointless and unfunny characters out.So in conclusion, I wasn't thrilled with 50 First Dates but it was all right. I must admit it's a hard film to hate. You really start to feel for the Lucy character in the film. The movie was passable at best in my opinion. Jen, on the other hand, was happy with the film and stated that she will be purchasing the DVD for our collection. I can't say anything more than it was a so/so movie. A few jokes worked, many didn't. I actually laughed 2 or 3 times throughout the film and I smiled a few times. I guess that's the best way to judge what I thought of it. So my final thoughts if you like Sandler give this movie a shot I am sure you will enjoy it. If your not a huge Sandler fan or aren't a fan of his at all there are better films to see. The highlight of the film for me was seeing the Johnny Depp Secret Window trailer again. This film would be best at a rental level at the local video store when it hit shelves sometime in the future. My final rating for 50 First Dates is a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Movie,"This film is okay..It has a few good jokes and a story which is at the one side funny, at the other side unbelievable..In my opinion after a few sequences the film gets a bit ""boring"" for me... the jokes get unfunny for my humor..But Adam Sandler is an actor for such movies and he makes them as funny as they are or can be..

So so,"I think this film, sort of falls right in the middle between bad and good. There are times when you almost want to turn off, because it can get really boring and dumb, and other times, when you almost feel like crying because of the emotion that the film carries. However, never do you feel the need to own this movie, or watch it every week.Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, star in their second romantic comedy together, as two people who are attracted to one another from the first day they meet. However, Lucy (Barrymore) has to be reminded of that fact every single day. She has short term memory loss, and it's up to Henry (Sandler) to convince her each and every day that he is the love of her life, and she of his.Picture 'Groundhog Day' only not as funny, cute or sweet. It's a really bad remake of that I guess. It does have it's moments though, of being sweet and cute, just not enough of them to make this one of the more worthy 'Happy Madison' productions. If you're a Sandler fan, I'd stick to 'Gilmore' and 'Wedding Singer', and if you're a Barrymore fan, stick with, 'Angels', and 'Mad Love'. This is not a better film for either actor, and I'm not terribly impressed with it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
My favorite romantic comedy,"My favorite romantic comedy. One of the very few movies and the only romantic comedy I've cried to. Demonstrates the lengths a man is willing to go to in the name of the woman he loves. 50 First Dates is a heartwarming and hilarious romantic comedy that will make you laugh and cry. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have amazing chemistry as Henry and Lucy, a couple who fall in love despite Lucy's short-term memory loss.

Another miss for the memory loss love story,"I am a big believer that someday, somebody somewhere will finally get this idea of a memory based love story right. The 2004 darling 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' would make too many film fans say that it has already been done effectively, but frankly these people are wrong. Eternal Sunshine should have been so good that it hurts, but thanks to lazy writing and less that great direction, Eternal Sunshine failed. So what about this film then? Well, 50 First Dates doesn't have acting to it's credit like Eternal Sunshine did, but it's certainly a lot more fun. In the end though, it misses the mark just as much as Eternal Sunshine, but for different reasons. Basically, this is a film of two sides; on one side, it's a breezy romance and just about every scene with Sandler and Barrymore on screen together is a delight, as are the scenes that deal with Barrymore's memory loss. However, the other side of the film shows why rom-com's so often fail, and that's the lame joke side. Another thing I believe is that comedy is good way to portray a point, but not this sort of comedy. The silly humour distracts the audience from the central theme and that is where, and why, this film fails.It's a huge shame that this film didn't hit the mark. There's lots of genuinely touching moments on display, and the two leads regenerate that partnership that made The Wedding Singer such a fun ride. I don't often say this about fun films; but the film isn't serious enough. The comedy angle adds to the film during the scenes when Sandler makes Barrymore fall in love with him, but there's just too much childishness. Adam Sandler has started to mature a little since films like 'Happy Gilmore' and 'The Water Boy', and it shows in his performance. Many film buffs dislike Sandler, but I respect his ability to carry a film, even if he's not that great an actor. He did a fine job in P.T. Anderson's 'Punch-Drunk Love', and he shows some of that here. Ironically, in fact, Sandler is one of the less silly things about this film. Barrymore has basically been doing the same thing for the last decade and she does it again here. Still, she certainly isn't bad and it's nice to see her on screen with Sandler.I was really expecting to be writing positive things about a film that deals with love in a fun way, but in spite of the fact that it has good elements and a definite point; as I've said already, it spoils itself. The film is worth seeing for it's leads and lighthearted tone (it's set in Hawaii!), but I can't warmly recommend it. Ah well...maybe next time.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie!,"One of my favorite romance comedies especially if I'm having a bad day. I love the setting, the beachy vibes, and the music is great. It's witty, romantic, and fun. My favorite part is when she hits Adam Sandlers friend with a bat. Hilarious! This movie really shows the meaning of true love. He kept a smile on Drew Berrymore's face a lot. I just love her blonde hair. I enjoyed seeing the sea creatures as well, I think his job was pretty exciting. You can feel and see how much he loves her. The chemistry between them was fun to watch.There are a few movies I watch over and over again. This movie is the only romantic comedy on that list.Sean Astin has his funniest role, Drew Barrymore is obviously perfect, Adam Sandler is hilarious, Rob Schneider as a stoner with a million kids is so good, the funny co-worker with the Slavic accent... everyone is so good.I always laugh and tear up when I'm watching this, even though I've seen it a million times.Oh yeah...and there's great music and adorable animals too.

"Amazing concept with beautiful chemistry between the leads makes it a delight to watch, but is ruined by tasteless humour and some repetitiveness","Well, what can I say? This film was enjoyable for what it's worth. I really relished the sweet chemistry between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. The story or the subject matter was interesting, just as much as it was tragic. I thought Sandler was pretty good at his dramatic and romantic side of things. He can be pretty charming when he's romantic. Barrymore was admirable, as usual, and she was excellent at being witty, emotional and serious. The two just shone on the screen. For a romcom, this had a really beautiful musical score. It really complemented the dramatic scenes.My biggest gripe were two things: The humour, which was just terrible, unfunny and they just didn't seem appropriate in the movie. The old Asian man at the café with the terrible one-liners really made me cringe in embarrassment. Unfortunately, such cheap, unfunny, spontaneous interjections by random characters were rather scattered in the film, especially that Pablo Picasso line in the art class scene, which was totally extraneous as it was unfunny.Rob Schneider and Sean Astin, both decent actors, played really ridiculous, annoying, Scary Movie-esque characters that were unnecessary in a film like this. Now Adam Sandler's bland humour was rather toned down in this, but he did his typical arrogant and cocky moments which just turned me off. I was really taken aback when he called Lucy's father an a-hole on the boat whilst he was riding away. That was so out of his character and it betrayed his good relationship with the father (even though he didn't say it to his face). But again, they just wanted to add in more tastelessly irrelevant, irreverent and Sandler-style arrogant humour.That all said and done, I only laughed at Alexa, Henry Roth's assistant at the aquarium. She was actually a good comic relief. Not sure if it was the actress per se, or perhaps the writers just somehow know how to write comedy when it came to her character? Because only she made chuckle. They should've stuck with her as the comic relief. No need for other ""comical"" characters who just made me scoff in frustration, really.The other gripe was that it was a bit repetitive in the earlier scenes when Henry was trying to win over Lucy, such as the scene in the roadway where he pretended that his car was wrecked, and the scene after where Rob Schneider's character pretended to beat him in order to get Lucy's attention. They went on and on.If the unfunny little scenes and one-liners, and as well as the repetitive, wearying scenes where Henry refamiliarizes or ""re-meets"" with Lucy were omitted or trimmed -- So this mean the movie would be 10 minutes shorter or so -- It would've been vastly improved. I would probably give it an 8 rating. It would've worked much better as a romantic drama with some light humour here and there. It really did not need the crude humour. But hey, in the 2000s, crude humour was a fad.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Average rom-com,"This is one of the many films that people rave about that I thought i'd give a watch.I can see why they like it. It's easy going enough, and has two engaging stars at the centre of it. But it's really a one joke film, that is funny for the first half, before becoming wildly sentimental in the second.It also goes into the familiar pitfall of being vulgar at times also, which is off-putting, but that seems to be the way with modern comedies.It was a passable enough 90 mins, but I can't say i'd be rushing to watch it again.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie has absolutely everything you want in a romantic comedy,"50 First Dates (2004) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched with my wife on cable. The storyline follows a man who works at an animal park who one day runs into a beautiful woman at his favorite restaurant. They hit it off right away and have a fantastic day together. When he runs into her the next day she has no memory of meeting him. He discovers she suffers from short term memory loss from an accident and looks for ways to be in her life despite her condition.This movie is directed by Peter Segal (My Spy) and stars Adam Sandler (The Waterboy), Drew Barrymore (Fire Starter), Rob Schneider (The Hot Chick), Dan Aykroyd (Ghostbusters), Sean Astin (The Goones), Allen Covert (Grandma's Boy) and Blake Clark (The Waterboy).This movie is well written and an underrated gem. This movie is the definition of a romantic comedy and one of the most unique ever to be added to the genre. The condition is well depicted by Barrymore and the family and I adored the German assistant, the local family, the workers at the dinner and the father/son duo. Every character is well acted, written and has fantastic dialogue and are entertaining within the various circumstances in the storyline. The love story is tremendous, and the situations are unpredictable, hilarious and there's moments that bring a tear to your eye.Overall, this movie has absolutely everything you want in a romantic comedy.

A poorly-constructed formula comedy,"There's nothing wrong with a formula comedy. If well done, a formula comedy can be extremely satisfying even if we know what's coming (Eg. ""Seventeen Again""). However, this film's wooden, shallow employment of the standard devices of the genre left this viewer not only unsatisfied but seriously annoyed.First and foremost, the characters in such a film have to be likable enough to allow the audience to root for them. The Adam Sandler character was extremely unlikeable. Further, he wasn't redeemed or forgiven so much as his flaws were simply ignored. I found myself feeling sorry for Drew Barrymore's character, because she would be ending up with Adam Sandler's character. It would have been better if his character would have received some poetic justice in the end.Second, the construction of this type of comedy often requires the suspension of disbelief. The plot set-up in this movie made no sense whatsoever. There has to be SOME logic even in a fantasy.Third the use of comedic devices such as crazy side-kicks and periodic vulgarity were over-used and very very, poorly done in this film. Not one was worth a laugh.I don't think I'm over-analyzing this film. I have enjoyed a number of Adam Sandler films, and I usually like Drew Barrymore too, but this one was flat at best.

Better than his other movies.,"Normally I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler's work, that's why I try to avoid it as much as possible.

We found ourself in this position and we decided to watch it anyway.Although they used the same kind of teenage humor in this film as they always use, it wasn't as much present in this movie as in the others. There even were some good jokes in it. This made this movie not as annoying and a lot better than other movies in this genre. The love story between a man who lives and works in a dolphinarium and a girl who never remembers anything from what happened a day before was well portrayed.I'll probably never become a real big fan of Sandler's work, but this movie made me see that the man has some real talent.

Likable,"The film has great production and visuals though with a satisfactory story. The character of Henry is depicted as a playboy character at the beginning but nothing of what we see of him actually affirms this idea.Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are believable as their characters. However, they did feel a little generic and didn't express much emotion. Also, maybe it is the the script development, but I didn't feel like Henry showed much passion or reason for chasing after Lucy (except to make a film out of it). A number of characters ask him this too, and he doesn't give a clear answer. Love at first sight perhaps. Ula (played by Rob Schneider) is Henry's cousin and is pretty much just there for comic relief. His tight shirts and extra short shorts are a sight to behold.The story overall is presented in an orderly manner, going chronologically while sometimes fast forwarding in time. The montages and editing is done in a clear and concise way with little confusion between jumps. There is also some great landscape cinematography in the film, with sunsets and nature settings as the backdrop.I also liked the interactions with the animals. I'm sure they are mostly computer generated imagery but it does look very realistic. Unless it is real in which case the animals are really well trained! It's hard to tell nowadays between what has been manipulated by the computer and what actually occurred before the camera.Regarding the concept of the story, it is definitely an intriguing one. I am not entirely sure of the accuracy of what is presented in the film, and am mainly re watching this for a psych class. There is such a thing as losing the ability to form new memories after an accident (anterograde amnesia) which occurs due to damage in the temporal lobe.

Gross-out humor makes this story quickly waste away,"Adam Sandler can have a certain charm that helps him to carry a movie. We especially saw this in Punch-Drunk Love, but also to a lesser extent in The Wedding Singer where he starred alongside Drew Barrymore, who not so coincidentally is his co-star in 50 First Dates, the latest in Sandler comedy.The premise is something like this: Sandler plays Henry Roth, a philandering marine veterinarian in Hawaii who happens to meet and fall in love with a girl named Lucy (played by Barrymore). He's excited and with a moment's notice pretty much ready to drop everything he had going in life up to this point. Only thing is, the next day Lucy doesn't even remember Henry. As we soon find out (if we hadn't already from the trailer and talk all over the internet), Lucy has no short term memory and every time she falls asleep, she forgets all that happened in the previous day. What's more, her father and steroid-obsessed brother with a lisp (played by Sean Astin) make sure that Lucy doesn't realize that she has this short term memory loss, so every day they go through the same actions as all the days before just to help out their sister who won't remember it anyway. If this sounds interesting, it could be, but read on...The promise that such an idea holds is quickly wasted amongst the gross out humor that Sandler's movies (with the exception of the two I mentioned at the outset of this review) hold. We have a pretty serious thing going on here in Lucy's life and humor about Walrus testicles, she-women, projectile vomit, and wet dreams mixed in. It's really quite a distasteful mix. The scene where Henry finds out about Lucy's condition is just plain bad as well. It's delivered as some kind of giant surprise complete with flashbacks and the like, like you would see in some kind of suspense movie. But of course all seriousness is quickly lost.The performances of Sandler and Barrymore are good. As comedies go, they make one of the better on-screen couples to be found. It's just the presence of all the other actors around them that screws things up. Most minor characters in the story possess absolutely horrid acting skills and quickly throw off the level of believability.Honestly, the conclusion to 50 First Dates could have been pretty powerful had it not been for the 90 minutes of the movie that preceded it. If this movie was handled differently, it could have been a good one. But in the hands of those who made 50 First Dates, it certainly wasn't.4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kiss,"I really love this comedy and often review it. And it's not at all about the actors or a good plot, but about the external attractiveness of the picture. This movie is like a candy: when you open the wrapper, you will not see a mustard truffle, but a nut candy, delicious and sweet, thanks to which you will develop a lot of the so-called ""hormone of happiness"".The cast is wonderful. In my opinion, this is the best role of Adam Sendler. For the first time, his grin and stubble on his face don't annoy me. I've always been skeptical of Drew Barrymore, but after this role I fell in love with her. I'm not talking about Sean Estin at all. He is such a versatile actor! When you see him on the screen, you involuntarily smile.Humor abounds in this movie! All the jokes are funny, there are few vulgar ones, which pleases, and the twists and turns of the plot are very diverse, and I, not a special fan of comedies, was only pleased.Clearly, the creators have a great imagination. One crying Adam Sandler and Drew with a bat make you smile, and it's worth a lot.Resume: this is not a banal and stupid comedy, of which there are many now, but an independent movie that is pleasant to watch, and more than once.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Odd premise for a rom-com, but it works","Drew Barrymore as the amnesiac Lucy, is wonderful in this movie. She's sweet, vulnerable, and yet strong in her own way at the same time. Adam Sandler drops his routine ""ornery annoying dumb guy"" persona, and he adapts well here, playing his Henry character as noble, sensitive, and amiable. The two characters are pleasing and easy to identify with.The good work of both leads helps this offbeat premise work. A young woman suffers from a condition caused by a traumatic injury where her daily memory is erased each night when she goes to sleep; she wakes each morning thinking it's a day a few years earlier. Her family insulate her in this fantasy, for obvious reasons. This is where suspension of disbelief is necessary, as plot holes dealing with how Lucy's life would be are easy to catch. Most obvious: as time wore on, wouldn't Lucy be shocked, waking to see her parents had aged by several years? And if she sees a mirror, she'd notice her own aging. It's hard to imagine living like this, which is why this movie actually moves more toward a drama than a comedy.However, in all rom-coms, love conquers all, even the daily obliteration of the relationship. The behavior of people doesn't seem likely, and the ending opens a lot of questions, so giving the movie poetic license again comes into play. This movie is just about romantic fantasy, so for the sake of enjoying the flick, those questions are best left unasked.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
objectionable racist trash,"This movie stinks to high heaven.  The script is so unfunny that no-one over the age of 7 would find it amusing.  The acting is so bad that even Along Came Polly looks good beside it.  The direction is sloppy.  Overall, every scene is utterly predictable.More seriously, this movie is ideologically offensive.  For a start, it's deeply racist. According to this film, native Hawaiians are dirty, lazy, stupid, and socially unsophisticated.  Additionally, the movie never misses the chance to make a homophobic wisecrack, even throwing in an androgenous zoo worker to create even more opportunities for seriously cheap jokes. To make matters worse s(he) is given Viking hair - evidently in the director's opinion, people from Northern Europe haven't got beyond the Viking era yet.Leaving aside the fact that you will be so bored that you'll want to shoot yourself 30 minutes in, I don't believe any responsible parent would want their kid to see this film.  It's the kind of objectionable trash only a family wedded to the Ku Klux Klan would enjoy. That it can get a 6.8 reading on IMDB is a serious indictment of public taste.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Strong central performances, let down by irritating minor characters","I went to see this film tonight without much hope. After all - Adam Sandler?! He gave a reasonably good performance in The Wedding Singer, but hasn't done much of note since.I have to say that he surprised me, and I was impressed by his strong, self-assured performance. Drew Barrymore also gave her usual accomplished performance.The central premise of the film - that Henry (Sandler) has to woo Lucy (Barrymore) anew every day due to her short-term memory loss - is an intriguing one, and handled extremely well by the two leads.However, the presence of Rob Schneider as a Hawaiian local and Sean Astin as a steroided-up fitness freak (complete with oh-so-funny comedy lithp) really dropped the quality of the film several notches.The ending (although Hollywood Happy Ending) was treated reasonably well, and helped prevent the film from being a complete waste of time.If only someone would realise that Schneider just isn't funny...(and neither is Walrus vomit)",,Anonymous,Romance

"Not a great Adam Sandler movie, but still watchable and entertaining","After a string of truly poor comedies(Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, and Anger Management), Adam Sandler somewhat gets back on his feet with this silly, but good natured comedy. Sandler plays sea animal veterinarian living in Hawaii who enjoys having several short flings with tourists. He spots an attractive Drew Barrymore in a diner one morning and strikes up a romance with her. He goes back again to meet her the next morning, but she has no idea who he is. He realizes that her short term memory gets erases every night and she starts out with a clean slate every morning. He figures that she is worth his time, so he tries to go back to the diner every morning and win her over again and again.

The Moose Hole - Review of 50 First Dates,"Ah, love! Isn't it grand? Many men find special things to do for the one they love like buy them flowers, candy, or jewelry, while others take them out for a night on the town complete with dinner and . an Adam Sandler comedy? Yeah, it's true, Adam Sandler is releasing his new comedy out on Valentine's Day in an effort to save all adolescent males from being dragged to another Kate Hudson/Julia Roberts/Reese Witherspoon lackluster romantic comedy . Okay, he's not doing it for those exact reasons but you get the idea.  But some movie-goers might be asking, when seeing the trailer for 50 First Dates, `Haven't we seen this before?' Yes, Sandler's new romantic comedy is being released on the exact same day as The Wedding Singer was five years ago, complete with Drew Barrymore as his love interest . Is Sandler in a desperate effort for the good days that film sparked? Possibly, especially after moderate hits like Mr. Deeds and Anger Management and flat-out flops such as Little Nicky and Eight Crazy Nights. Could it be that the movie-going public is getting the same romantic comedy, only repackaged? Maybe Sander is becoming too commercial but only box office numbers will tell.The story follows a young man who falls in love with a beautiful woman who can never truly love him back thanks to her short-term memory loss. Henry Roth is the ultimate stereotypical ladies' man who woos young women tourists, shows them a good time, but dumps them soon after the have sex. The problem is that Henry has a serious problem with commitment, especially after his college sweetheart dumped for a guidance counselor, and that is why he can never fall in love with a native Hawaiian girl but that all changes when he meets Lucy. He meets her in small restaurant and they seem to hit it off right away but when Henry meets the next day at the same restaurant, she doesn't remember him at all. He learns from one of her friends that Lucy was involved in a car accident a year ago and lost her short-term memory from that point on. Lucy's father and brother try and protect her from men who know of her condition and are just looking for a one night stand but Henry is adamantly determined to make her remember him, no matter it takes. The story for 50 First Dates is . well, you don't know what it is, really. It feels like a combination of Groundhog's Day, The Wedding Singer, and Joe Versus the Volcano, all packed into one film but leaving nothing but mixed reactions. It's hard to tell what the filmmakers really wanted from this film as if they couldn't decided whether they wanted an emotional drama or romantic comedy and, in the end, they just decided to splice the two genres together and make whatever it came out to be.The two leading stars of The Wedding Singer are back in this new film but the question is whether or not they still have the same on-screen chemistry they had five years ago. And the answer would be, yes, but separately, they are on different ends of the spectrum. Adam Sandler, who started his movie career off with such wacked-out comedies as Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, seems to have matured greatly since his early years as a comedian and has expressed some interesting acting talent on-screen. How is 50 First Dates different for him? For one, he isn't blowing up with anger like all his other films and, second, he continues his level of serious performances in comedies like in Big Daddy. It seems his dramatic performance in Paul Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love did him some real good, which he shows off in the more emotional aspects of the feature. Drew Barrymore, best known for her role in Steven Spielberg's E.T., has really grown up since her early roles but hasn't improved much in the area of her performances. Granted she demonstrates real chemistry with Sandler, but alone she doesn't give anything better then her lower-browed romantic comedy roles like in Riding in Cars with Boys or Never Been Kissed. And, whether this was intentional or not, Barrymore manages to slut up an emotional good-bye between her and Sandler in the rain by not wearing a bra and bearing her soaked breasts, even if only for a few seconds. Not trying to hark back to the Super Bowl, but this shows a serious level of immaturity, if intentionally placed.Overall, true romantics will find this predictable premise delightful while others will be wishing they had short-term memory loss. The biggest problem for the film is its lack of consistency, in that there is no balance between its heart-warming emotional sequences and its, at times, gut-wrenching comedic moments. While on the subject, were scenes like the barfing walrus or the butt flecking from Sean Austin (never thought you ever hear that, right?) absolutely necessary? Not to say it was all gross-out humor, 50 First Dates manages to actually pack in a relatively decent amount of hilarious highlights that weren't featured in the film's trailer, unlike Sandler's last film, Anger Management. Note, though, the use of the word 'decent' as several comedic scenes went off without even the slightest giggle. And though the film comes in at a not-too-bad one hour and thirty-six minutes, the repetitive story elements makes it feel at least thirty minutes longer then it actually is. If you are neither a fan of romantic comedies or Adam Sandler, save yourself the sixteen bucks (along with an additional fifteen for snacks) and take your girl to a play or a musical or something more entertaining then this.My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: C+)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
In a word: Bad,"While this movie did have a couple ( and I mean just a couple ) good laughs, mostly it was filled with juvenile, toilet humor ( not that this is always bad ) which had nothing to do with the story itself. It looked to me like the main story wasn't long enough, so all kinds of dumb jokes were thrown in to stretch it out. Rob Schneider's role should have been completely left on the editing room floor - added absolutely nothing to the story. I suppose that is what I found very disappointing about this movie - it started out with an interesting idea, but got bogged down in the usual dumb jokes that usually fill an Adam Sandler movie. I really expected a lot better from both of them after ""The Wedding Singer"" ( by far, Sandler's best movie ).",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

50 First Dates: 6/10,"Shoot me, because I think Adam Sandler is pretty much a funny guy. I like his movies and I think they're funny, and he's enjoyable on SNL, and even in his more dramatic work () he still was funny. However, I was a little trepidatious about going to see his latest movie, 50 First Dates, mainly because it was released in February. While I didn't expect it to be a hysterical masterpiece, a la Happy Gilmore, it was an enjoyable romcom, a perfect early year release.Sandler plays Henry Roth, a vet living in Hawaii. His typical relationships are with tourists; he's afraid of commitment (which movie character isn't?). That is, until he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore). The problem is that she has short-term memory loss, so every day he has to impress her again and again. It's not as easy as it may seem, though.This movie plays like a cross between Groundhog Day and Memento. It's like the former because he has to change something every day. And it's like the latter because of the short-term memory loss. But it's nowhere near as good as them, because it doesn't have the charm nor the intrigue of either of them. Instead, it's some typical Sandler humor (including a vomiting walrus!), some other types of humor, and a simple, sweet story. The plot is relatively simple, with just that one twist, which not only is a cheap gimmick but adds to the plot.Personally, I liked Sandler more as a loose cannon than mild-mannered nice guy. Some moments of his are really great (the aforementioned walrus was so overdone I actually laughed), with a couple moments of true hilarity. Some jokes, however, fall flat, and it seems that they forget that Sandler is a comedian, not a romantic. Their romance isn't completely believable, but it sufficed. His movies that have the romance on the back burner always seem to work better, but that's just my opinion. As is usual Sandler fashion, Rob Schneider comes in for a supporting role, and to tell the truth he's great. As a drugged-up Hawaiian guy, the material writes itself. It did disappoint me, however, that the trademark line ""You can do it!"" wasn't in there at all.Everything I learned about antereo-grade memory loss I learned from Memento, but I'm ecstatic that they didn't go for the cheesy ""she remembers him after he says he loves her!"" Hollywood stuff. In fact, Barrymore did convince me that she had the ailment, and Sandler played his usual self. Sean Astin, as a steroid-using lisping body-builder, is just too odd to comment on, and Dan Aykroyd, in a small role as a doctor, has one great line, but that's it. 50 First Dates is a simple movie, nice to sit through, with some good laughs in the middle of it, but nothing that'll stay with you throughout the rest of your life.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 on appeal for crude sexual humor and drug references.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Please, I think 25 would have been more than enough!","I like Adam Sandler. At least I used to until he fell into the business of doing movies just because they're there. Like so many ""Something About Mary"" movies before this (cute, sexy, virginal blonde girl meets doofus, bungling, but adorable guy who wants her at all costs), the entire plot (if you can call it that) was exhausted in the first 15 minutes. Absolutely nothing original here. They thought that they'd take the success of Groundhog Day, turn it upside down (the star stands still while the calendar moves), and have a hit. It didn't work. Add to this, textbook acting by a moronic dad and a stupid brother (that can't even spell act) and the heroine actually comes across as the best actor in the film. I guess that after you saw the credits go by, you'd sympathize with Adam and like the movie. Hmmm...Maybe I was jaded when I saw this on an eternal flight from Germany to Los Angeles. But after 10 hours in the air, it was only slightly more entertaining than the crying baby next to me as I sat in a middle seat.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Interesting Premise could have been better,"Adam Sandler stars as Henry Roth, the leading man whose womanizing ways change when he falls for a younger girl Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore. The concept of the film is relatively simply but it is quite interesting, how the film could have been (for better or for worse) seems to be cut from the same cloth as the lame line of humor, but the romance story that develops around the idea actually achieves a certain level of charm. A major reason why Adam Sandler comes off fairly well in the film is the rest of the cast simply stay out of Barrymore's way whenever she appears; her effortlessly beguiling performance generates both smiles and genuine poignance.

Sandler fans may like it but generally it is weak and not particularly funny,"As unlikely as it may seem, Henry Roth is a wow with the ladies and living on a tropical island means he gets to have short relationships with many beautiful tourists who are there for only a short time. This has bred a fear of commitment into him but a chance meeting with the beautiful local Lucy threatens to change that. They share a breakfast and Henry is smitten, agreeing to meet up the next day. However the next day she has no memory of him and he finds that he has to win her over again and again.In fairness to Adam Sandler he is not to blame for me not really liking this film. You see he made it clear from the very first scenes that this was going to be a film just like all his other films, with the same slightly crude and childish sense of humour and the same broad and basic approach to plotting and character development. In a way it is the same as putting a warning sign on an electrical panel to make sure that you don't go into unless you know you can deal with it. And so it is here with a film that relies on crude characters, cute kids and animals to get laughs and seems totally at sea when asked to deliver anything other than the most simplistic and formulaic of emotions. The plot awkwardly mishandles the central concept so that it is never convincing even on the very simple level that the script needs it to be.For fans of Sandler though there are laughs to be had. Personally I didn't laugh more than once or twice but others may find it differently. That said though, I was surprised by how much the clunky plot took away the scope for the usual laughs and it was noticeable. Sandler plays the same character he always play with the same performance he always does. I found it hard to believe he could get all these women but he suits the material I suppose. Barrymore is stuck with a hopeless task. She needs to bring out feeling and pain in her character to make it work but she is in a film where this doesn't really matter and when she tries it, she is actually taking away from what the film is trying to do. Schneider does his usual stuff; he is crude and amusing but it is hardly wit. Astin's character is great fun and he works it well although why Dan Aykroyd bothered is beyond me.Overall then a fairly basic and obvious film. If you like even the weaker Adam Sandler films then you will like this but otherwise you should probably just avoid because it is nothing different from his usual stuff and does as little as you expect it to do.",,Anonymous,Romance
Don't think you like Adam Sandler? Try this one,"This is only the second Adam Sandler movie I've actually looked forward to seeing. The first was _Punch-Drunk Love_, and that was something I was eager to see more because of P. T. Anderson than Sandler, but was pleasantly surprised by Sandler's performance.This time around, I went in knowing that Sandler had it in him to entertain me, and he did a good job. His schtick is much more in evidence here than in _Punch-Drunk_, and I imagine from other comments that this is much more of a typical Sandler vehicle. However, it is a very sweet story with a lot of humor and heart, and would be a terrific first Adam Sandler film to see if you don't like him.Drew Barrymore is delightfully fun as Lucy, believably delivering all kinds of unexpected character details like ""feelski"" and the way she asks questions about all her old friends. Blake Clark and Sean Astin do the best they can with their rather thinly drawn characters. Clark, as usual, lets his voice do most of his acting for him, but he's a treat here as Lucy's father; likewise, Astin takes a turn at using a distinctive vocal style to give his character depth, but unfortunately misses the mark and winds up being just another caricature in a movie that already has 3 by the time we meet him (Alexa, Ula, and Nick the cook).It is really in the relationship between Lucy and her family that the main weaknesses of this story come out. It seems to me that given how much time the filmmaker spends showing us what a user Henry is, everyone is entirely too trusting of him, though that is probably just a side-effect of the way the movie skips over time as Henry becomes part of their lives. Still, after Marlin's ""anybody who's alright with that ain't alright with me"" comment, he seems amazingly quick to accept that Henry means well.I was also disappointed that we never got a payoff from Marlin's photographing Lucy's paintings before painting over them each night. I wonder if that got left on the cutting room floor, and if so why. I thought it showed a real sense of appreciation by him for who she really is. I was also a little disappointed that once the idea is introduced that Lucy can be told the truth, it apparently *never* occurs to anyone that she might be most comfortable hearing the truth *from herself.*This is one of those movies that from the first time I see the trailer, I start wondering, okay, good set-up, but can they end it right? Well, here's where this movie really does remind me of _Punch-Drunk Love_, because for one thing the ending is very satisfying, and for another it arises out of the character's own strengths instead of relying on something out of the blue.Original grade: 8 out of 10. Very good: something I'll want to see again.Revised grade (3/7/2012): 7 out of 10. Worth seeing, but once will probably do.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

One could cite the reality of head injury related memory loss and criticise the film for not properly tackling the seriousness and horror of the situation, but it is not meant to be a serious film about head injuries but a COMEDY!

Undateable!,"Here are 50 reasons why I should have stood up `50 First Dates':1) Adam Sandler was no Mr. Sandman as an island gigolo who falls for an amnesiac who cannot remember her experiences of the previous day (which scarcely enough resembles my monthly series entitled `50 Last Hangovers'.)2) `Who plays the amnesiac?' you ask.  I forgot! Why? Because her performance did not cause enough brain chemical reaction to transfix itself in my cerebral cortex. Ok! I will stop brainwashing you on the negativity of her performance and tell you who it is: Drew Barrymore.3) Director Peter Segal, who also guided the disciples `Anger Management' & `The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps', is no directorial professor and actually needs to take some courses on director management.4) George Wing's vapid screenplay is of the not-right wing party group.5-50) it sucks!

A decent romantic comedy,"Sandler and Barrymore have real chemistry together.....as in the sweet, boy next door / girl next door kind.  They proved it in Wedding Singer, and have done it again. Anyone put off by the walrus jokes and anything else with sexual undertone is just plain prudish. Sandler is certainly a loyal friend to Rob Schneider, but couldn't a bona fide Hawaiian have been recruited to play Schneider's part?  Surely there are humorous, uninhibited Hawaiian men who could have done justice to the role. The Alaska scenery was absolutely breath taking. I liked it; I plan to buy it when the video comes out.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
good family film,"50 First Dates/2004/***Main Stars: Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore Sean AstinGood film! For Adam Sandler fans this film is yours to see!

Still in my personal opinion one of the best romance movies of all time.,The movie has just the perfect mix of charm and humor and is also a great example of how love trumps all.While there might be some minor flaws here and there it is just so incredibly engaging that you feel you're one with story and just don't want it to end.There might be people who will disagree with my opinion and thats fine but for me this film is 10 out of 10 and probably my favorite Sandler movie ever.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If you have a chance to make a miracle like ""50 first dates"",would you do it?","Well,when you were one of students in the middle school,your teacher asked everyone in the class who has a girlfriend,in China,few persons hold their hand in the air because of shyness.But there is only one classmate did it in our class ,and the teacher praised him.Actually,i guess there must be many other guys regretted not to face the truth.In this movie,you probably think Henry just wanna have sex with Lucy firstly.But in fact,henry isn't let us down,he always keep in love with lucy,with his pure,honesty,or something else's love.He respect his real love and just for fun with his past female partner.So we can make sense that if one fall in love with somebody,not only did sex between them,but there're more else sincerely emotion between them.True love you meet with has just two or three times in your life,just pay more attention to your lover now,to value her,and hope you'll have the final happiness!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sandler shows his third alter ego,"50 First Dates is Sandler experiencing with the romantic genre, while slightly tilting it towards the dramatic side, with an essence of comedy. It tells the heartwarming, if not mildly depressing tale of a Marine Biologist who falls in love with a woman who was in a car accident, and suffers from short term memory loss where her memory is wiped clean the next day.She can still remember everything that happened the day before her accident, but she is unable to remember anything that happens in the present for more than a day. She is stuck living in what, she thinks, is October 13. The woman is Lucy, played by Drew Barrymore, and the Biologist is Henry, played by Adam Sandler. Despite her current state, Henry is head over heels in love with her, and desperately tries to make things work between them by constructing a scrapbook for her to read every morning, a tape to watch, and by having her father, Blake Clark, and brother, played by Sean Astin, who drops the funniest lines in the film, try to tell her everything about him again and again.If a condition like this really existed, in the film it's a merge between short term memory loss and amnesia, the question is who would it be harder on? The person who has to suffer it, or the relatives who must deal with it. In the film, it shows the father and the son of Lucy going through the same daily phase of rearranging everything from repainting the wall they let Lucy paint to refilling the shampoo bottle. It just so happens that October 13 is her father's birthday, so they have to go the trouble of reliving it over and over again.The story is charming, yet some of the comedic elements are a little out of place. The film has more characters than necessary, and tends to get focus more on them rather than furthering Sandler and Barrymore's wonderful chemistry. Adam Sandler's best friend is played by Rob Schneider, who is not funny at all in the film, and the ""Alexa"" character whose gender is never disclosed is an unnecessary and ridiculous distraction.Also, the film seems a bit distended from the idea of this condition. Is this supposed to be cute and funny, or a serious and saddening? There are times when the film pokes fun at the illness (IE: ""Ten Second Tom""), and there are times with Lucy where feels genuinely serious. It's almost like Sandler is saying, ""yeah, it's sometimes sad, but c'mon, how do you not laugh at it?"" With those quibbles being said, I can still say 50 First Dates is a great change of pace for Sandler. It's the second Sandler film I have really enjoyed, with the first being Funny People, and, at the rate we're going, will probably be his most sincere. If this is the best we'll get than so be it. I can live with that.If I can compare old Sandler with new Sandler, it's easy to broadly state that his new films are humorless failures, but 50 First Dates is like the better version of one of his more recent comedies, Just Go With It. In Just Go With It, Sandler was playing a similar character; he preyed on young women just to get them in bed before abandoning them blind. Later on, he met a woman who he really did care for, pretended to be married, and still acted like a selfish, uninspired cad while putting on a nice guy face. Here, he is genuinely sincere, and not snarky and underwritten like his future character. We really go on to believe he cares about this young girl.The ending is probably the saddest, yet most optimistic conclusion to any Sandler film yet. It appears to be happy, but when closely examined there's still a layer of sadness under it. Director Peter Segal, who directed the fun farce Tommy Boy (which is briefly referenced here), tightens his strings a bit to bring us a warm and simple drama with some characters we like and others we wish were shifted a bit out of focus. 50 First Dates isn't perfect, but it shows that Sandler is capable of doing a mostly serious role, and doesn't need to incorporate his two famous alter egos; the BIG, strong tough guy or the little, weak baby.Starring: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Rob Schneider, Blake Clark, and Sean Astin. Directed by: Peter Segal.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
My 100th review: 50 first dates.,Adam Sandler film also starring Drew Barrymore and Rob Schneider. The film is about a guy who thinks he has found the right women ( played by Drew Barrymore) but then finds out she forgets everything after one day. So he sets out to win her heart every single day. The movie is extremely funny and does not re lie on the fact she only remembers stuff for a day for all its good humour. The movie is a must watch for fans of Adam Sandler and even for people who do not like him will probably enjoy this fine made piece of comedy. Overall I think this film is a must watch for fans of good comedy as it has every cast member at their extreme best ( cameos standard lower down excluding Rob Schneider) and the humour KICKS ARSE. I rate this film 73%.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I also love seeing the familiar faces from most of Sandler's previous movies appear in this film, someone who stands out to me is Sean Astin, what a turn around from playing Samwise Gamgee!It's a definite must see for all the romantics out there, I give the movie a 7/10!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Too many dates, too few laughs","Sandler plays a Marine Biologist who spends his time having brief affairs with women while they on in vacation or so we are told in the opening segment of the film.The film is set in Hawaii, although I am not sure with all the reggae music played throughout the film.We only see Sandler once trying to woo a woman holidaying in the island.The rest of the time, he has been smitten by Drew Barrymore, a lady he has met in a breakfast café and has fallen for her.The problem is, she suffers from short term memory loss and each new day she forgets who he is and what happened yesterday.Your heart goes out to her father and steroid enhanced brother who have to repeat information each new day.What looks like an interesting take on a romantic comedy genre just runs out of gas and gets rather dull.Sandler is trying to hit all the sweet spots that his audience now expects. Rob Schneider, check. Some 80s music with a reggae twist this time, check. Some gross out humour, check.However Sandler is not a strong enough actor to carry the more depth required when dealing with the brain trauma issues raised by this film and cannot match Drew Barrymore in the acting stakes.It is not all Sandler's fault, the script is not edgy enough, although it wants to subvert the rom-com genre, it gets too repetitive leaving this viewer slightly bored.Kudos to the film-makers for having an ending that does not go for the easy option.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Couldn't. Possibly. Hate. This. More.,"I sort of watched 50 First Dates this morning, while i was waiting for laundry to finish. I say 'sort of' because i loathed it so much after the first 10 minutes that i watched in horrified fascination for 30 minutes and then, feeling slightly queasy, skipped through the rest in 5 minute chunks just to see how this heinous festival of suckage could possibly be brought to a conclusion that hadn't made it famous throughout the known universe as the most cringe worthy waste of celluloid since ..well..actually the last Adam Sandler film.Only 'Little Nicky' was worse than this, though I cant say for sure because I never made it past the first 20 minutes of that, (the part where it was deemed hysterical to have breasts growing on someone's head) after realising life was too precious to waste on such compellingly awful dross.I hesitate to dignify '50 First Dates' by analysing it, even for the purpose of this commentary, because analysis seems to somehow to endorse its poorly executed and insultingly simple minded premise.From the opening scene where Henry is seen to be a opportunistic wide boy and congenital liar who has abundant and casual sex with any tourist stupid enough to fall for his drooling halfwit persona: 'Uh, I'm a ..ya know..uh..secret agent, so I cant see you again', I assumed he would get his come-uppance and learn the error of his ways in a predictable retribution/redemption scenario. Unfortunately this was not to be, as he is in fact rewarded for being a shallow dullard by winning the ever-so-cute mental patient of his dreams.Some notable scenes which provoked uneasy gastric reminders of my breakfast were when he punishes his co-worker for eating his roast beef sandwich by asking her to put her face next to a walrus's mouth and makes it vomit over her; when his horrendous Hawaiian stereotyped surfing, pothead buddy dresses up as the aforementioned mental patient cutie by wearing a mop head as a wig and a coconut bra and licks his coconut 'nipples' for no apparent reason than to make a cinema audience of 11 year old boys snicker; when an entire ward of brain damaged patients fall about laughing because someone mentions the phrase 'wet dreams'.Why did her good natured, steroid-taking brother need to have a lisp? Why did his friend need to be blind? Why were all the Hawaiian women clinically obese? It smacked of 'Let's all laugh at the freaks' schoolboy humour, devoid of wit, style, kindness or relevance. Why did a random character on a beach, whom we hadn't met before, and never met again, suddenly snicker and say 'I have to go for a tinkle'. Were they THAT hard up for dialogue?I normally would have gone about my business after this talentless garbage was over - after all its not as if i paid to see it. But I logged onto IMDb to see if other people had been similarly appalled, and instead found pages of praise! This naturally enraged me enough to attempt a tiny redressing of the balance. Anyone with an IQ higher than that of cheese should really not see this movie. Its too late for me - but save yourselves!",,Anonymous,Romance

"Sweet romantic comedy, and one of Adam Sandler's best movies","I have to admit it, despite Adam Sandler is among my favourite actors, I can't deny he has made some wretched movies (such as GOING OVERBOARD and JACK & JILL). However, when he has good scripts and directors he can do great and likeable movies like CLICK, this one and the other movie in which he co-starred with Drew Barrymore before this one, THE WEDDING SINGER.Here Sandler plays a womanizer that works as a veterinarian in the Hawaii and after going to a bar for a while he becomes infatuated with a woman (Barrymore) that unfortunately has short-term memory and so she can't remember anything that happened to her the day before thanks to an accident. So Sandler tries his best for helping Drew falling in love with him every day like the very first time.This time the plot is not very serious since the idea of a guy that wants a future with a woman that suffers of short-term memory is very hard to believe especially in real life. So my advice on this side is relax and take the movie for what it is.Sandler and Barrymore have lots of chemistry together. Rob Schneider here is surprisingly good and comes off as the best of the supporting players. Dan Aykroyd's role unfortunately is very small but at least he steals the scenes in which he is in. The soundtrack is very likeable with its many covers of famous songs from the 1970s-1980s by the Police and the Cure. All in all, it's a sweet and delightful romantic comedy that despite not being perfect, it manages to please its target audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Barrymore finally ends up with the guy who made her fall in love everyday. the movie has a gentle flow in it and most of the scenes have really good Hawaiian and tropical music in the background which makes it all the more romantic.The director has used locations in Hawaii and Oahu really well to add to the effect.

So-so date movie,"`50 first dates"" isn't Adam Sandler best work, but it was a huge improvement from Anger Management. The movie consists of very funny characters, and it was nice to see Sean Astin do a different kid of role. Usually he plays the cry baby in his movies like Rudy and lets not forget Lord of the rings. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandlers movie chemistry is very good, and pretty convincing.I liked this movie because of its light headed feel, and shooting this film in Hawaii really gives me that light headed feel that I really enjoy when it comes to watching this type of comedy. Another reason why I liked this film when Rob Schinder and Adam Sandler are in the screen together, those two actors are hystericalWhat I didn't like about this movie is Drew Barrymore ""dramatic"" little episodes. I can't stand all the crying and the sobbing she does through the movie. The reason I can't stand all the crying and sobbing, because its an Adam Sandler comedy.

Negative paradigm of Post traumatic stress disorder.,"Has anyone considered the Pineapple may be a symbol of a hand grenade?Adam Sandler is doing the work of excavating a personality crushed under a psychological trauma so heavy it continues to influence a persons thoughts and feelings years past. But in Drew's case, there is no ""event"" such as a grenade explosion to mark the trauma, only the same psychological ""stuckness."" Drew has a state of mind that is the outline of a post traumatic stress disorder, without and actual event inside her mind.So, without being able to address an ""issue"", in the classic Freudian sense, to help a person to possibly be free of it, Adam must approach it again and again, on a daily basis, with out any noticeable results, until the effects of his actions build up within the subconscious enough to finally surface out to the conscious, or external world (i.e. in Drew's paintings.)In short, love can be transmitted subconsciously, and it is nice to see this shown or explained in a film. I suspect this kind of subtle influence is a forte of both Adam and Drew, and the film is a welcome treat for those of us who handle psychological burdens. We often do not see the results of our work for years, and often times ever.Thanks Drew and Adam.(Also the side characters were great!)",,Anonymous,Romance
Good film,"I loved the Asian characters (Amy Hill, etc) in this film. Finally a film that does justice to Hawaii. Unlike other films that constantly disparage and stereotype people of other colors, this film actually embraced the culture of Hawaii.The characters are well-developed and aren't simply the clique caricatures we usually have to suffer through. Like Drew isn't just a flaky girl sidekick. There's some emotional depth to that character when she reveals how much she internalizes her feelings because that what a good friend does. Sure they are exaggerated at times, that's expected since it's a movie, but somehow George Wing the writer keeps it realistic where I could see this sort of thing happen in high school. And the clichés usually seen in teen movies like when the house party goes horribly wrong, gets trashed and the protagonist gets in major trouble are thankfully bypassed. The love story is also believable as Adam Sandleer deals with it as a normal guy might; it's not completely awkward. When Drew and her have misunderstandings, they are plausible and the reactions are real enough to believe.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

At times pretty hilarious,"This rom-com cross between Memento, Goodbye Lenin and Groundhog Day works pretty well, although the ending was a bit of a downer...Henry (Sandler) is a womanizer (hard to imagine, I know), who only has one night stands and then leaves the woman whomever he's with. But one day, he falls in love with the local Lucy (Barrymore) when they meet up in a cafe having breakfast. They hit it off and agree to meet again the next morning, but things take a turn from here on.It turns out Lucy has lost her short-term memory after an accident, and can remember exactly one day. Every day she thinks it's her father's birthday, and her father and brother work with it so things won't upset her. It's a good excuse to eat a birthday cake every day I guess...So every day Henry has to conquer Lucy again, and in the meanwhile gets to know her pretty well (comparable to Bill Murray in Groundhog Day).

The idea of falling in love again each day has some potential, unfortunately the script goes all the time the easy way, combining bad taste and bore. The cinematography does not exceed in quality vacation commercials. The humor, if we can call it so is worse than in TV comedy series, reminding the 60s animals series for children.

Sandler learns to act,"I wasn't going to comment on this film, but having voted (in the daily vote segment) for ""your favourite Adam Sandler movie"" and seeing how poorly ""50"" polled - well, I just couldn't resist the temptation.Sandler, on screen, often projects a goofy character immersed in slapstick. Sometimes the character works; most often it doesn't. I love ""The Wedding Singer"" but feel that it indicated that there was more to come from Sandler. ""Happy Gilmore"", well... A feel-good movie with ridiculous caricatures within a ridiculous plot.""50"", however, shows an actor apparently comfortable with, and in charge of, a sensitive portrayal. The premiss of the film is much that of ""Groundhog Day"" but original in its portrayal of problems which, later in life, are associated with Altzheimer's Disease. Living each day as if it is one's first is poignantly shown in the closing scenes. Life has passed regardless of its memories. And each day contains its own amazing happenings. Each day should be lived for its own sake.Perhaps this is why I like ""50 First Dates"" so much. ""Yesterday is history / Tomorrow a mystery / But today is a present."" Sandler presents a character so much in love that he overcomes the perceived familial need to keep his love in an eternal cocoon - eternally locked inside a day that all around her will do everything to protect and thus preserve.

"When Rob Schneider has the best performance in a film, you know you are in trouble","I went to this movie expecting to like it.  I usually enjoy Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler had good chemistry with her in ""The Wedding Singer"".  50 First Dates starts with a sad premise (a person with short term memory loss), and then adds a ridiculous idea (that someone would try to meet this person and ""reromance"" her on a daily basis, after she forgets him) to attempt another ""romantic comedy"", which, as usual, was not romantic and not funny.  Fortunately, Rob Schneider (who is usually weak) is quite hilarious in his sidekick role, to keep the film from being a total waste of time. The rest of the cast seems to realize this film is a lost cause and sleepwalks through the whole affair.  I gave this film a 5/10 for Schneider's antics, plus some good performances by the trained animals (and, no, Sandler is not included as one of the animals).  Probably best to wait for cable on this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
No.. just no.,"I most definitely preferred Adam Sandler when he was doing movies like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and even Eight Crazy Nights. This is a romantic comedy, and like nearly all romantic comedies, has extremely cheesy moments. The only things that save this movie from disgrace are Rob Schneider, Sean Astin, and the person who played Sandler's coworker. These 3 characters are pretty damn funny. Besides that, this movie is not worth the time and money it takes. 5/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable comedy.,"50 First Dates (2004, Dir. Peter Segal)Henry Roth (Sandler) lives in a Hawaiian paradise with the company of endless women with no strings attached. This is until he meets Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore). Both Henry and Lucy enjoy the company of each other and feels the start of a serious relationship occurring. Approaching Lucy the next day, Henry is confused when Lucy fails to recognise him. This is the moment Henry discovers that Lucy actually suffers from short term memory loss and can't remember each individual day. Henry won't let this stop him and is prepared to make her fall in love with him all over again, each and every day.Both a mixture of romance and comedy combined with a slight sad element makes an enjoyable comedy. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are their usual best, but the highlights of the film go to Rob Schneider and his hilarious character.What the hell is your problem? - Jet Skiier (Brian L.

Sandler and Barrymore win hearts again.,"""50 First Dates"" is a movie far better than I expected.  It probably would have made an excellent date movie on first released, and certainly worth a trip to the new release section of your video store.The basic premise (assuming you haven't read a thousand other post)is Adam Sandler, a Hawaiian ladies' man who tends to aquatic animals for his job and repairs his boat in his spare time, finds himself falling for Drew Barrymore, a young lady with short-term memory loss.Perhaps most surprising is the movies unwillingness to compromise on the handicap, and working toward a solution that is realistic but sweet and romantic and occasionally heart breaking. It is comparable, easily, to ""The Wedding Singer"", and at many points shows the actors maturity, though Adam still seems to have difficulty with more extreme sincere sentiment.I would rate the movie higher, but individual performance are sometimes weak.  The total, however, is greater than the sum of its parts, and most people should stay moderately entertained through the movie.  The only thing keeping me from rating it an eight is that it doesn't seem to have strong purchase power, though once turned on you're not likely to turn it off.A 7 on a ten point system and  7.4 on a hundred points.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extreme Movie,"This is an extreme movie in multiple respects.First, the general plot idea is extremely good. This could have been one of the most charming love movies ever.Second, Drew Barrymore is extremely ideal for her character here, extremely charming, kind and funny.And third, all this gets extremely wasted. For the script is full of tasteless jokes, and the male half of the twosome is designed to be the greatest possible a***. The only thing one really wants after a while is to see him die a very painful death.To make that disaster even more complete, Sean 'Samwise Gamgee' Astin plays a stupid bodybuilder here, who gets kicked in the ass by everyone, including his own father.To me, it looks as if the people making this movie tried to create something like a second 'There's something about Mary'. But in that movie one liked Ted, Mary's admirer, or Warren, Mary's brother, and the Farrelly brothers where great to walk on the slim line between good and tasteless jokes. In 50 First Dates however, one hates the admirer, the brother is a cause for sadness and the jokes make you feel sick.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Goofy romance comedy,"Henry, played by none other than Mister Sandler, lives a moderately fulfilling life in Hawaii until he meets the woman of his dreams. Only to learn about her extremely rare medical condition that makes starting a life with her seem nearly impossible. The rest of the movie follows his pursuit in winning over her father and finding out a way for the two of them to work out.When I first saw this movie I was very pleasantly surpised by the complete change in direction of Adams perseived personality through his life choises and actions. This really made him a 3 dimensional character to me. The two main actors personalities have a very realistic dynamic that always makes me feel like they're soulmates on set and outside of the industry.Overall, a great movie to watch when you're bored but not up for something too heavy. If you liked Blended, I'd definitely reccomend this to you.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ok, but not a Sandler classic  (**1/2)","Once again, here's an Adam Sandler movie with a nifty idea, a likeable cast and all the potential in the world to be a good, fun comedy. But it doesn't quite get there.I really like Adam Sandler, both as a person and a comedian. The problem is, only three of his movies are any good: ""Happy Gilmore"", ""The Wedding Singer"", and of course ""Punch-Drunk Love"". The first two were just good comedies, plain and simple, while the third was a spellbinding, artsy, dark romantic comedy that utterly confused his core fans (maybe they were wondering why Rob Schneider never turned up in a stupid costume).""50 First Dates"" is by no means as terrible as Sandler's worst films, like ""Anger Management"", ""The Waterboy"", the hideous ""Mr. Deeds"", or ""Along Came Polly"" (oops, that was a bad Adam Sandler movie that happened to star Ben Stiller instead). But it's not nearly as good as it should be.Sandler plays Henry, a ladies' man living in Hawaii who meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in a local restaurant and they like each other. So he's surprised the next day when she doesn't even know who he is. The deal is that over a year earlier, she was in a bad car accident and has lost most of her short-term memory due to a head injury. She remembers everything up to the accident, but can't remember anything afterwards for more than a day. In an effort to keep her happy, her family and friends try hard to keep her re-living the same day over and over. There are a lot of good qualities in ""50 First Dates"". The ways in which Lucy's family and friends try to keep her happy is really very touching, especially on her ""bad days"", which they are also prepared for. And as they proved in ""The Wedding Singer"", Sandler and Barrymore have good, goofy chemistry. They have a few genuinely sweet and romantic scenes together.Unfortunately, the negatives almost equal the positives. There are tons of jokes and lines that fall dead flat (you could have heard a pin drop in the theater during some of the ""funny"" parts), several annoying secondary characters, and the uneasy feeling you get when a movie is trying to be really cutesy AND cram in unnecessary toilet humor at the same time.Still, it's not a bad time. Even the worst Sandler movies have great soundtracks (this one features Bob Marley, the Beach Boys, and some Cure covers), and there is surprisingly bittersweet ending, given a huge emotional boost by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's gentle ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World"" (which was also used for the closing credits of ""Finding Forrester"").It's not all that good overall, but still, I have generally warm feelings about seeing it, which means the good stuff is staying in my mind longer than the bad, so I guess that counts for something.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sweet story stuffed behind puke and Rob Schnieder,"50 First Dates50 First Dates marks the on screen reunion of Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler who co-starred in The Wedding Singer.  In this one, Sandler plays a Hawaiian aquarium worker who has a propensity for showing single female tourists a good time during their visits.  Barrymore is a local who has no short term memory.  They fall in love, but with one catch, it has to happen for the first time every day.I am somewhat split on my opinion of this one.  The problem is that the story is sweet and almost compelling, but is veiled behind a combination of toilet humor, sex jokes and Rob Schneider.  The only thing that got a legitimate laugh out of me was the character of Sean Astin.  Both Barrymore and Sandler are in fine form and do a good job of making the love story authentic, but in my opinion cannot save this film from its far from effective juvenile comedy.Over all grade: 5",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Winging It,"Of screenwriter George Wing the IMDb report that he spends months of outlining, telling his story to anyone who will listen, before actually writing anything. One wonders what kind of people Wing had listening and how many they were. One suspects very few and of limited cerebral franchise. One guesses most of these monologues were aimed at cold walls. Add to that the fact that this 'gem' was floating around years before it was picked up and you have something extraordinary, albeit not in a good way.When Sandler's 'almost good' he's just about tolerable, but this is not talent in any sense of the word. Barrymore is sweet and as with The Wedding Singer (which far surpasses this turkey) she makes the movie by setting the tone.No movie can run its full length without one or two gags that work, and this one doesn't fail there either, but as you're watching you're bound to ask yourself how many people wrote this schlock (it was only one) and how little contact they had with one another throughout the writing process and why oh why did the studio insist none of the writers be told what the others were writing about?And as for suspension of disbelief - forget it. Any minute now this movie is going to redeem itself, you'll be thinking as you worm your way to the tortuous denouement. But it doesn't.",,Anonymous,Romance
Adam Sandler versus Ben Stiller,Does anyone else think that Sandler and Stiller are very similar when it comes to acting?  Maybe they both went to the same comedy acting school.Watching Adam Sandler in this movie made me think that Ben Stiller and Sandler are very similar actors who star in very similar films.  I think if Ben Stiller had done this movie it would have been a very similar film and he would have acted exactly as Sandler did.The only thing I can say for Sandler in relation to this movie he has shown that he has some other creative talents besides acting which he put to good use in the making of this movie.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A RomCom with actual romance and comedy,"Look, I'm a 40something year old dude. I don't do RomComs, which is probably why I'm just now seeing it for the first time...15 years after its release.This might be the happiest and saddest movie I may have ever seen. Not gonna lie...I teared up a couple times and I laughed a lot, too. Somehow Adam Sandler (Henry) manages to be incredibly believable in his devotion to Lucy. Oddly enough, one of the only other RomComs I've ever enjoyed in my life was The Wedding Singer. That was a more typical Sandler movie, but he and Barrymore definitely seem to have some sort of on screen chemistry that makes their characters feel more real and that is felt abundantly throughout this movie.There were a few times throughout where the movie felt like it might slip back to the ""usual"" romcom story and also a few jokes that are typical for Sandler, but all in all, I didn't feel like I was watching a romcom or Sandler...I was simply watching a pretty good movie that hit across the emotional spectrum.

Tolerable Enough Adam Sandler Comedy Movie,"After watching 50 First Dates (2004), this is the point where Pete Segal unfortunately started directing movies where there's almost nothing to work with.Positives with 50 First Dates (2004):
Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have great chemistry as always and while it's not as good as their chemistry in Wedding Singer (1998), it works in this movie. The movie's concept is good enough for what they were going for and it works.Negatives for 50 First Dates (2004):
The comedy is very hit or miss in this movie. Also, Rob Schneider plays a Hawaiian Character in this movie and I was very offended by this character and I'm not even Hawaiian, it was to the point where I literally skipped every scene with his character.Overall, 50 First Dates (2004) is yet another tolerable enough Adam Sandler Comedy, but that's not really saying much.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boring waste of time and money...,"Wow, this movie sucks! I don't know who writes all the praises and good reviews about it but they're all lies, that's for sure. I'm not afraid of a romantic comedy and like both Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler (though I'm not a huge fan either), but this movie doesn't have five minutes of worth in it. You can see literally ALL the jokes in the trailer and the rest just stinks. I almost fell asleep during watching it; the first 20 minutes were plain painful, then it became slightly better, but it was still boooring. Lots of scenes in the movie have no purpose at all, they're just there.I was particularly disappointed because - judging by the trailer and votes on IMDB - this seemed like a good one with a good storyline.

Daja Vu All Over Again!,"The title of this comment is not that I hate this film. The title of this comment is basically the premise of this film. Henry Roth is a man who leaves woman after he dates, kisses, or have sex with them because that's not what he's looking for. He wants to meet a woman that'll be perfect for him. He finally meets Lucy in a restaurant. They get along together great. Henry finally thinks he found the perfect woman but there's one problem: She has a short-term memory that forgets him each day she meets him. This film is hilarious with Rob Schneider. The on-screen couple, Sandler and Barrymore, is great. This film is funny and heart warming but sometimes makes you feel sad. The ending could disappoint a few people but it was satisfying for me. One sad thing is that it reveals the ending for The Sixth Sense. So if you're going to watch this film before watching The Sixth Sense, you might be mad (like me) because it reveals the ending for it.

One of the few Adam Sandler movies I liked.,"My favorites of Adam Sandler are still his skits on Saturday Night Live and I don't think he's as consistent on the big screen, mostly because of his choice of screenplays, but this was a good script for him. Aside from a forced opening involving a seal throwing up for desperate humor, most of this isn't unpleasant and shows Adam Sandler telling jokes or involved in slapstick without trying too hard. I also enjoyed his reuniting with Drew Barrymore as a short term memory waitress at a restaurant that Sandler falls in love with and is willing to do anything to keep her and find ways for her to remember him. This is like Groundhog Day mixed with Memento and it seems to be a cute and funny movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Easily One Of Adam Sandler's and Drew Barrymore's Best.,"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore scored high in classic 90s comedy, The Wedding Singer. Their second collaboration tops that, making it one of the best movies either party has done.Henry Roth (Sandler) is a vet from Hawaii and is the ultimate bachelor who gives girls the best first date of their lives, then ditches them. When he meets art instructor, Lucy (Barrymore), he realizes that he's finally ready for commitment. The catch? Lucy was in a car accident one year before and suffered a rare brain injury where she attain any new memory after the day of the accident. She lives everyday thinking it is her father's (Clark) birthday. They go on a series of dates, that is truly funny and heartwarming.This is the Adam Sandler I miss. He does wacky and immature comedy that plugs many laughs, and still gives a wondrous life lesson. The problem with him today is, he can't find an even balance between the two. The Grown Ups movies had good lessons, but weren't funny and the second one made no sense. Blended has a nice serious side, but was not funny at all. 50 First Dates is hilarious, makes sense, and has great seriousness that it needs. The main idea of this is that love has no boundaries. Henry doesn't mind that Lucy forgets who he is everyday, because he loves her so much and is willing to do anything for her. This general premise has been done, but 50 First Dates is nearly at their levels as a whole. The comedy and moral are at all-time highs for the two stars.3.5/4",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Well, I Have To Admit, I Saw This On a First Date With a Girl","Okay, that has nothing to do with anything, but I couldn't think of any good titles. Basically, the movie is about this guy who, in relationships with women, loves 'em and leaves 'em, yet he falls in love with a girl who has short-term memory. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore put in par performances as the leads.One of the things that got me angry about the movie was that one of the funniest parts of the movie was in the commercial. I hate when they spoil great moments. Oh, well. It was pretty funny, fairly standard for a romantic comedy, but it made me want to go to not only Hawaii but Alaska as well. The end was not exactly what I was expecting (I was thinking cliche), but it was still pretty good, and I definitely recommend it if you're in the mood.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
About As Good As Could Be Expected,"The only two Adam Sandler movies that I really, REALLY like are ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love"", and much of what I like about them is that Adam Sandler is in them; I can't imagine anyone other than Sandler playing either Robbie Hart or Barry Egan. With the exception of, say, the first 20 minutes, I don't see why somebody else couldn't have played Henry Roth in ""50 First Dates"". Mind you, I don't necessarily think that that's a bad thing; that first part was for me the least engaging piece of this movie.What worked for me here was the romance, not the comedy. Given the rather ridiculous premise they had to work around, I thought that Henry's attempts to court and, later, to help Lucy were really rather touching. I also felt that the way their relationship went up and down and up again was honest for the situation (again, granting the the premise was absurd), and I thought that the ending was both emotionally satisfying without being a cheat (given that they could have taken the easy way out).Of course, I could have done without the puking walrus and Rob Schneider, and Henry crying his way through 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' felt like a rip-off from ""Wedding Singer"", but Willy the penguin more than made up for all that.7/10 for Drew and Adam's second pairing.

Surprisingly good,"While I would concede that I am generally not a fan of Adam Sandler movies, I nevertheless found `50 First Dates' to be a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming movie with an intriguing plot and excellent acting on the part of the main characters and quite a significant number of the supporting cast.Adam Sandler provides an excellent portrayal of Henry Roth, somewhat of a playboy who has shunned commitment but finds his one true love, a woman with a very unique mental state of mind. Sandler gives his character a unique dimension of warmth, likeability and strength that ensures that he emerges as one of the strong points of the movie. With the help of an excellent script for his character, Sandler gives his character a dimension of warmth and humanity that is both heartwarming and thoroughly pleasant to watchDrew Barrymore is also excellent in her portrayal of Lucy Whitmore a sweet and kind person with a medical condition that plays a significant role in the movie. Barrymore provides her character with a wonderful dimension of warmth, kindness and sweetness that allows you to truly empathize with her and the dilemma she experiences. Barrymore really allows the positive dimensions of her character to shine through and this also contributes significantly to the movie's success.The script writers have done a wonderful job of examining and portraying Lucy's medical condition with sympathy and humour. They make you have a unique degree of empathy and warmth toward the characters while at the same time not transforming the movie into a series or sad affair. The portrayal of the plot comes across as unique and balanced.There are some minor flaws in the movie, in my opinion. The character development of Lucy's brother is rather unfortunate and is one of the weak points of the movie it would probably have been better if he were provided with greater substance and depth and less clichéd and annoying dialogue. Also Rob Schneider's character was given too much air time and became rather annoying as time progressed. He should have been more of a background character than he was. I agree with what another reviewer on this site said about unnecessary over the top humour and accents it really would have been much better without all that and it does detract somewhat from the high quality of the movieBut these flaws do not undermine the heartwarming and beautiful plot of the movie, the wonderful acting and the flowing interaction between Sandler and Barrymore. I would highly recommend this movie just fast forward the `yuck' bits",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly good,"I am not a big fan of Sandler's movies, most of his stuff I find too over the top and sometimes even cruel.  So I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy ""50 First Dates"" so much.  The only other movie of his I liked was ""The Wedding Singer"", which also starred Sandler and Barrymore.  I guess that is the recipe I need for a Sandler movie - add Barrymore.  They have very good chemistry on the screen.""50 First Dates"" was funny - of course.  But it was also touching and warm. Also liked Rob Schneider, as Sandler's friend he was funny and outlandish.

I *love* it. Really.,"First of all, this movie is one of my absolute all-time favourites. The first time I saw it, I cried like a baby at the end, and continued to do so for the best part of an hour afterward. I was watching it alone, on DVD, so I was able to fully let go, completely releasing myself into those blissful waves of emotion. And yes, I do cry in movies now and then. But never like this.50 First Dates is a synergy of many elements coming together: plot, themes, characters, humour, pathos, music, acting, etcetera, to create something that is entertaining, fresh, beautiful and real. The humour is less inane than you often get from Adam Sandler and his mates, and there is more genuine fun. But where the film really shines for me is that the movie is entirely about relationships, and there are so many of them ... Lucy with her father (Marlin) and brother (Doug), Nick and Sue at the diner, Henry and Ula, Ula with his kids, Henry with the aquarium animals, and of course Alexa mixes things up.Okay, so the primary plot device, Lucy's memory problem, may not be realistic ... but that doesn't seem to matter. The movie makers have taken that idea and created from it an original story which is both light-hearted and poignant. The writing, casting, direction and acting are all excellent. Ignore the posters, which were terrible, and don't let the name of the movie put you off either. Just see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A little less of the usual Sandler shtick would have helped,"Let's make one thing perfectly clear. I am not an Adam Sandler fan. If it is within my power to avoid seeing Adam Sandler on the big screen, small screen, or on the cover of People Magazine, then I do so at all costs. The problem is that I have this girlfriend. She loves to watch Adam Sandler movies. Then again, my girlfriend will watch just about any film slapped onto a DVD and put into a case. She truly believes that if it says on the cover 'hilarious and uproarious' it must be so because they wouldn't print false advertisement since the manufacturer could be sued. Okay, so I'm exaggerating a bit but only a little bit. Anyway, the first Adam Sandler film I saw was The Waterboy, a film many found to be 'hilarious and uproarious' I found it to be 'stupid and idiotic cinematic crapola.' From that point in time, I vowed to cleanse my soul by making it my life's mission to never occupy the same room if there was even a whiff of Adam Sandler strutting across the TV screen. Until last night, except for one bout with Mr. Deeds, I had pretty much succeeded in that regard, but then my world caved in again. Having been to the theater three times this week without her (she was working so don't blast me), the aforementioned girlfriend insisted I sit and watch a film of her choosing. Her choosing was 50 First Dates, a film she had borrowed from a co-worker. Catastrophe! And worst yet, co-starring Rob Schneider! Yech! Well maybe I could fall asleep and she wouldn't notice. Then again, Drew Barrymore was also in it and I loved her in E.T. and loved her in Firestarter when she was doing that really cool fire trick with her brain so maybe I wouldn't suffer too much.True to form, the early part of 50 First Dates is typical Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider shtick. Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a Hawaii Veterinarian who talks to his animals like Dr. Doolittle, and is heavy into one night stands with female tourists. To avoid having them become attached and want to stay in Hawaii with him he tells them stuff like he's a secret agent getting ready to go on a mission. So supposedly every female tourist that vacations in Hawaii is a dumb bimbo which they would have to be to fall for such nonsense. It wasn't funny and I was suffering already.Henry's best friend and hanger on, Ula (Rob Schneider) comes to see Henry whenever he needs stitched up after having had a shark take a bite out of him. He also comes to see Henry hoping that Henry will relate every detail of his one night stands to him, because Ula's wife just doesn't do it for him anymore. Ula also brings along his brood of kids. As it turns out, the kids are cute, Ula is surprisingly funny, so are the kids, and my pain eases a bit.Then there's Henry's assistant Alexa (Lusia Strus). She looks like Cloris Leachman had just made a wrong turn from the set of Young Frankenstein and ended up in the wrong movie. Her jokes are bad, we've seen the ugly assistant bit before and done much better, and then a Walrus pukes on her and I'm back wallowing in my misery once again. Soon Henry is having breakfast in a diner that specializes in spam and eggs so that later on we can have a few spam jokes thrown our way. It is then that he spots Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) making a house out of her waffles. He puts the moves on her, they have a nice conversation, Henry is attracted to her as a person and not as a bimbo, there's a funny guy sitting at the counter, the people that run the restaurant are kind of funny, and it looks like things are back on track. It's only a temporary reprieve though because when Henry goes back to the diner to meet her the next morning he finds out that she wakes up every day not remembering what happened the day before. This time when he tries to make hay with her, he fails and once again the film goes astray as we get scene after scene after scene of Henry meeting Lucy in the diner or down the road trying to get her to notice him so that they can have another first date. The sequences are totally done for slapstick, not remotely funny, and although we can sympathize with Henry's motives the low brow comedy just doesn't fit in with what he is trying to achieve or what the story is really about. Eventually Henry meets Lucy's father Marlin (Blake Clark) and her brother Doug (Sean Astin). There is a funny yet touching sequence where we see Lucy coming home and Marlin and Doug have to relive the same day over and over again because if Lucy finds out she loses her memory everyday, she becomes traumatized.As you can tell the film is all over the place. There are times when it's a very well done sweet romantic comedy, with a lot of heart. At other times, it seems to want to sink back into the usual ineptness of low-brow films like The Waterboy. Eventually, in the latter part of Fifty First Dates, the comedy low-jinks do subside for the most part and the film seems to get on track. A lot of this can be attributed to Drew Barrymore who gives a very sensitive portrayal of a woman trapped by circumstances beyond her control. Whenever she is on the screen, the film lifts itself up about ten notches. Despite my earlier comments, I have always felt Barrymore was often underrated in the acting department. Her problem is she picks some lousy scripts with which to display that talent. Sandler however eventually tones down his shtick quite a bit, leaving the lowbrow comedy up to Schneider which is where it should have stayed in the first place because most of his lines are the funniest in the film. Likewise, Astin and the rest of the supporting cast are good also, but there's a running joke about body building concerning Doug that continues on way too long and wasn't really necessary at all.This is the kind of film I find infuriating. There's a wonderfully romantic story, so why did writer George Wing not take that and run with it? Why sink to the idiotic antics that are so unnecessary especially when we've seen that kind of thing from Sandler so many times? When halfway through the film Sandler begins to show how much he does care for Lucy and the steps he takes to help her overcome her desperate plight, it's a side of Sandler we seldom see. He still can't act, as evidenced by his stupidly awful crying scene (at one point he does a fake crying bit, later he cries for real and both are the same), but Lucy and Henry's romance was good enough that we could easily have overlooked his failings.There was much about 50 First Dates that I enjoyed. There was a large amount of it that I didn't. In the end, I'd have to say that the last half of the film is so good that it's just enough for me to give it a recommendation. Those who love the usual Sandler films will enjoy the first half, and those like me who don't will fall for the second half of the film.And most of all it has a very nicely well done ending, that kind of touched me and when a film does that I have no choice but to give it my grade. I should probably just give it a C and leave it at that, but since it's an Adam Sandler film I have to grade on the curve and give it a B- but only because the romantic story was so well done, and I'm just a romantic kind of guy.

Two watch-worthy acts in a three-act Adam Sandler comedy.,"I don't particularly care for Adam Sandler's comedies. Most of them are crass and pull their jokes from bodily humor or the uncouth main character (usually played by Sandler). There are two exceptions to this: The Wedding Singer (1998) and 50 First Dates (2004). Since this is a review of the latter, I won't go into the details of why I like The Wedding Singer. Instead, let's talk about what works in 50 First Dates for me to recommend it. Yes, I'm not necessarily giving this a perfect ""5-star"" score, but I do think its story has enough merit that you should watch it.As mentioned above, I don't give this film a perfect score, mostly due to Adam Sandler's comedy style. This is mostly exhibited in the first act of the plot, where we meet a reprehensible man, Henry (Adam Sandler), who basically only has sex with tourists so that he doesn't have to deal with commitment. This could be an eye-rolling character flaw that we'd see ironed out at the end of the film if it weren't also for the gross-out humor involved in this section. I'd almost be curious to see a re-cut version of this film that dispensed with this type of ""comedy"" and stuck to the parts of the plot that worked.Much like Memento (2000) followed the life of a man with a special type of amnesia, 50 First Dates looks at Lucy's (Drew Barrymore) amnesia from the perspective of the outsiders who have to watch her re-live the same day over and over again. There is a certain amount of Groundhog Day (1993) charm involved with Henry trying to break through her amnesia. Sure, a scumbag like Henry isn't someone who I'd usually root for, except that he learns the value of commitment for something (or someone) greater than himself. The emotions involved in this setup are heartbreaking, and I still cry when I watch it.Two watch-worthy acts in a three-act Adam Sandler comedy, I give 50 First Dates 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
There are much smarter and much better made dumb comedies for you to enjoy,"I can like a lot of stupid humor but this is definitely one of the more annoying.Adam Sandler has proved he can be in a somewhat watchable movie (like Click or Grown Ups) but this is excruciating.The humor is the standard lazy, very biological approach to humor where the bodily function IS the joke. It's embarassing to see Sandler try and woo this woman. And uncomforable. I'm not saying it's totally wrong to date someone with that conditon nor that we shouldn't be allowed to make jokes about anything but there just isn't a lot of lucidity about what the movie is doing.And they try to make the dumb humor palatable by pouring on the saccharine..",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meh,"Watching 50 First Dates is about as funny as watching your grandma suffer from Alzheimer's. The main problem is that a film about short-term memory loss is more heart-wrenching than amusing, and the fact that 50 First Dates is being marketed as a light-hearted romantic comedy is more than somewhat deceiving.Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a veterinarian at an aquarium in Hawaii with commitment phobia who manages to bed attractive and naive female tourists every night of the week.Then he meets cute and quirky Lucy (Drew Barrymore) at a local diner.Apparently captivated by the way she builds houses out of her waffles, he is smitten. Likewise, she is smitten by his hands that smell like fish, because her dad was a fisherman.Henry and Lucy plan on meeting the following morning for breakfast.However, when Henry shows up the next day and greets her by asking her to smell his fishy hands. She baffles him by calling him a pervert. We soon learn that a year ago on her father's birthday, Lucy was in a car crash that caused her to lose her short-term memory.Each night when she goes to bed, she wakes up to remember nothing of the previous day, but remembers everything up until the time of the accident. Apparently, short-term memory loss works like clockwork.Lucy wakes up every morning thinking it's her father's birthday and proceeds to start out every day the same way, even in the same outfit.It must get pretty old for Lucy's family and friends seeing her wear the same pink T-shirt and white Capri pants every day. Her loving and protective father (Blake Clark) and little brother (Sean Astin) try to perfectly recreate each day. The two even go so far as to order hundreds of the daily newspapers that came out the day of her accident for her to read every morning.It's unlikely that someone who was as commitment-phobic as Henry suddenly wants to marry someone without a memory like Lucy, cute as she is. He talks her family into being open with her about her memory loss by setting up a tape of the past year's events for her to watch as soon as she wakes up. Lucy cries every morning as Henry consoles her. Sounds like fun.Sandler and Barrymore do have good chemistry together during their 50 first dates and 50 first kisses. It's the same chemistry that made the pairing work well enough in The Wedding Singer. Sean Astin provides some pretty funny scenes as Lucy's little brother who has a steroid problem and lisp.However, the audience could mostly do without Henry's pot-head best friend, played by Rob Schneider, who has a terrible Hawaiian accent and wears impossibly short shorts.The way Henry uses the aquarium animals to woo Lucy (including dressing up some kind of penguin in a floral shirt to sit in the middle of a road as Lucy speeds by in her Jeep) would surely have his management calling PETA, but that's overlooked.While 50 First Dates has the feel of an ultimately serious movie, it still relies on juvenile humor such as walrus vomit and genitalia to appeal to Sandler's fans. For those looking for a light-hearted comedy like the commercials for 50 First Dates advertise, you may be getting into more than you bargained, unless you find tragic brain-damage amusing.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Check it out ""chick-flick"" & Sandler fans!","I remember seeing the trailers for this movie when it was first released and thinking, ""I'll wait until rental...no cable."", but I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, I watched at the end of a long New Years Day, which could explain my sentimentality, but I liked it! Although I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, I tend to enjoy his work, though sometimes, when it's not straight slapstick, it tends to be over-sentimental and maudlin.50 First Dates does have its sappy moments, but with romantic comedies, that's what you've signed up for.In an effort to appease hardcore Sandler devotees, they throw in your zany, sidekick, Rob Schnieder, doing a nearly-insulting stereotype caricature of an Islander...but that's just a smoke screen for some touching moments delivered by Sandler, Barrymore and Blake Clark, as Barrymore's father. Sean Astin plays an additional comedy relief role as Barrymore's steroidal brother, with a couple of decent moments delivered.But the best moments are really the way you feel when Sandler & Barrymore are doing their thing, drama-wise, I mean!

Forgettable Spam,"I fully admit that I had very low, biased expectations coming into this. I've never liked Barrymore. She's had the world of movies in her hand since birth, with a famous lineage and many friends in high places -- and what does she do with that power?Well, she has no respect for herself or her audience, nor for the art or mechanics of movie-making. By age 14 she was already out of control with drug use. I would argue she popularized the very notion in our society that we have to 'sympathize with' and 'pity' the spoiled, wayward, self-abusing elitists, because they shape so much of our culture cinematically (who can forget ""E.T.""?).Having written that, I have to comment that she's the only reason for watching this. Even though this is Sandler's movie, she's the only one here with either an innate or learned sense of what it means to live within movie roles. She controls the picture, though the narrative was intended to lay the control elsewhere. Sandler cannot and never will escape his TV-skit/shtick. That goes double for Schneider.As for what this is, it's mildly clever in how it resolves itself through constructed representations of the world surrounding movies -- that is, through diaries, murals, watercolors, home movies, etc. Think of it as the inverse of ""Groundhog Day"", leaning heavily on ""Memento"".I've seen far worse movies...more offensive ones than this, too. But this one will never be great. Contrast this with a smart self-referential vision and construction such as ""Eternal Sunshine..."", and this fades into complete irrelevance.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

A warm romantic comedy after a very quesy start,"It's a good thing I stuck with this movie as the first 15 or so minutes (really, up until the love story starts and we see the lovely/always cute Drew Barrymore appear) are just awful. In fact, I considered switching channels when this was shown on commercial TV the other week. The reason it was so bad? The comedy was pitched at a level suitable for primary school children. Perhaps that is the norm for Adam Sandler comedies (I don't watch movies with him in it merely for the fact that he is in it...hence I haven't seen too many Sandler movies). It's as if Sandler, perhaps, didn't trust the script and insisted on low-brow, juvenile prat-falls and gross out humour be included. If it was intended to appeal to kids, then it is very surprising that in one scene Sandler's character Henry drops the ""F bomb"" in front of some primary school aged kids. The ""F"" word isn't really suitable for kids, you wouldn't think...and a love story might not appeal to them either.So, if I had bailed on the movie early on, I'd have been forced to rate it 0 stars or a very generous 1 star. Fortunately, I soldiered on and the movie changed in nature...into something more watchable.The premise of the movie has ""high concept"" written all over it: it draws on an actual medical condition-one in which a person has no longer any long term memory. To explain: just imagine that you get a knock to the head one day and you wake up the next day not being able to remember anything new-not after a while in any case. So, you could remember what you already knew before the knock to the head, but nothing afterwards...well, you could, but you'd forget it after a few short hours or whathaveyou.So, serial womaniser and liar Henry Roth (Adam Sandler), has to try and woo a woman who he finds irresistible but who can't remember any positive impressions he has made the day before...or even remember him.This movie has its heart in the right place. Not exactly plausible but nonetheless charming and at times poignant, mainly due to the lovely Barrymore. It's a rom-com, so criticising it for not being plausible is a tad ungenerous.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

hopelessly cute,"Sean Astin and Schnieder steal this film. The movie is cute, Sandler is charming, Barrymore is her normal self, but the role players really bring it. Sandler is known for bringing quirky characters to his movie. This one brings in a bunch of the old actors, and adds several unique characters to the picture. My wife really enjoyed it so I recommend it as a date movie. Laughed outloud about 3 times, far less than Sandlers other movies but this one is rewarding because your hopes get fulfilled. Not as repetitious as Groundhog Day, not as interesting or as intriguing as Memento, not as funny as Happy Gilmore, but definitely worth the time.

"OK twist on the ""Groundhog Day"" formula -- nothing special though","""50 First Dates"" is an OK movie that has some funny parts, but as a whole fails to leave any sort of impact. Theday after I saw the film I didn't particularly remember anything noteworthy and found that it's the sort of comedy -- unlike ""Groundhog Day"" (which basically uses a similar premise) -- I wouldn't want to watch more than once, or perhaps every few years.Lucy (Drew Barrymore) lives in Hawaii with her father and brother. Roughly a year ago she was involved in a near-fatal car crash that damaged her ""temporal lobe,"" meaning that her short-term memory process is disabled, i.e. every day she wakes up thinking it's the day of her car crash.Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a ""fish person"" (marine biologist I suppose, although he never really specifies) who works at a zoo with a walrus and a penguin. He is a playboy, enticing woman who visit the island of Hawaii to have one-night stands. He then leaves them the next day and escapes. He is afraid of commitment, but when he sees Lucy eating breakfast at a local restaurant, he is unable to resist her charm. Of course, the comedy of it all is that the next day -- when he meets her for waffles a second time -- she doesn't remember him at all. ""I've never even met you"" are the words she yells at him -- and he doesn't understand what's going on.Soon he finds out, and decides to help Lucy against the wishes of her family. Her brother, a fitness freak played by Sean Astin, is all-too-eager to beat up Henry (and he fails repeatedly). Meanwhile, Henry's best friend (Rob Schneider in another Sandler-comedy supporting role) helps his pal out in a number of ways.Sean Astin's scenes were all quite good (and unexpected -- from Hobbit to steroid-taking, swearing, lisp-talking loser) -- but Sandler just muttered through his lines again and Barrymore is doing her usual sweet girl routine.Overall this is fairly enjoyable but I think I agree with the majority of bad reviews it received upon release -- I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. It's just not anything special.However Dan Aykroyd's (surprisingly credited) cameo as the doctor was funny. ""Was your head always shaped like an egg?""Sandler and Barrymore fans will find enough to like here but as a comedy it's only sporadically funny. A good film for Valentine's Day but not something I'd want to own or watch very often.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly good - a must watch!,"When this movie first aired on TV years ago I did not know what I was getting myself into. I saw Adam Sandler and thought, ""Oh this is going to be funny"". Well, it did not disappoint.The story was really good, honestly, I did not expect much. I thought it was just going to be one of those comedy movies that was all about the bad jokes. I was, fortunately, wrong. The scenes were beautifully made (and I'm talking about a comedy movie) and when it's all put together, it turned into a love story worth knowing.The comedy was surprisingly good. This movie was one of the only movies that made me laugh out loud (hysterically laughing too). There was a scene that I would remember to this day because of how it made me laugh.Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore were also amazing actors in this. Drew was so beautiful too.

Not bad as far as rom-coms go,"Not the ordinary Adam Sandler film. Those who don't like Adam Sandler in things like Anger Management or Happy Gilmore might prefer him in this, he's less of an idiot. Its more relaxing than some of his other films and actually has an interesting plot. I don't generally like Drew Barrymore, though again she's actually OK in this. It is quite funny in parts and you can actually feel the emotion of Sandler's character in the predicament he find himself, through no fault of his own. It's worth watching just for the interesting plot, and it doesn't go on for too long, like a lot of romantic comedies can.

A movie not to remember,"Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a wildlife veterinarian in Hawaii, who meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) a woman who has a short-term memory loss from an auto accident a year earlier.  Henry is a ladies man on the island who has been breaking the hearts of female tourists for years.  Henry meets Lucy at a local cafe and takes her out on a date.  Henry falls in love with Lucy, but there is one problem when she awakens in the morning, she can't remember him or anything that happened that day.  Henry must devise a plan to meet Lucy everyday and try to get her to fall in love with him again and again. The movie premise was great, but the acting was mediocre.  This romantic comedy was kind of funny I think, but I really can't remember.

A Charming Concept That Doesn't Fully Click,"""50 First Dates"" has a sweet and quirky premise-memory loss and romance? Sign me up! But while it had its moments, it didn't completely sweep me off my feet.Henry (Adam Sandler) had his usual goofy charm, but it sometimes felt like he was stuck in cruise control. There were a few genuinely touching scenes where he showed real vulnerability, especially in the way he was so patient with Lucy's (Drew Barrymore) condition. Still, I wish his character had more depth. It felt like he leaned a bit too much on his typical comedy shtick.Lucy, though, was a delight. Drew Barrymore brought such warmth to the role, and I loved the scene where she sang ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" in her studio. It had this bittersweet vibe that hit me right in the feels. That said, I found her amnesia a bit overly convenient at times-it felt like the film stretched the rules of how her memory worked just to make the jokes land.Some of the supporting cast felt a bit too caricatured for my taste. Rob Schneider's character had me rolling my eyes more than laughing. And don't even get me started on the walrus puking scene-it was funny in a ""gross-out"" way, but I could've done without it.On the plus side, the Hawaiian setting was gorgeous. It made me wish I was sipping a Mai Tai on a beach somewhere. The soundtrack was a nice surprise, too-I caught myself humming along more than once.By the end, I appreciated the heart behind the story, even if it didn't entirely win me over. It's a fun watch for a lazy Sunday, but it's not a film I'd rush to see again.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Dunno I was left speechless after seeing this movie. I have had a day to reflect, yet still I am like errr. So either way I am neither happy nor unhappy about seeing this, yet I will file this movie as one of those that I have seen but do not wish to intentionally rent again.

Laughs And Romance,"This is a romantic comedy starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. With Sandler, you expect more comedy than romance, and it's true with this film as well. But the story does not short shrift the romance, truly allowing the characters to follow a normal, romantic arc. At the core of the relationship is a serious issue and it is dealt with seriously, if humorously.I like Sandler in this more serious role. And Drew Barrymore, who has a quirky side as well, also gets to emote in a realistic way. The mixture of comic banter and serious dialogue is just about perfect. These are likable characters and you can relate to their situations.Kudos also to the supporting cast, who also blend the drama and the comedy well. Director Peter Segal seems to be the one to compliment for this sensitive mixture. The result is a film that is watchable more than once.

I will in this case go even further, reliving my own childhood (I am now 23) and the time spent inside the wombs of my mothers and fathers. An entity is born on fifty, which this movie is referring to, but an experience takes place long before. Let us gather the end of time as a point of reference, and proudly explore, in the words of Sandler Adams, ""the great outlier of pure instinct"".

Rob Schneider is the comedic relief for when things get too serious. It is a bit cheesy in places but works well overall.This movie works as a romantic comedy or just as a comedy. My wife and I enjoy watching this one together but I also have watched it on my own. Totally recommend to anyone who likes the Rom Com genre, Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jon Monsarrat review: too sweet to be goofy,"A lot of films start with a silly premise. For example, Face/Off has two characters switching appearances. And The Butterfly Effect has this weird time-travel thing. The trick is not to dwell on the goofy premise, but to move past it.Unfortunately, 50 First Dates does dwell on the memory problem of Drew Barrymore's character... and it gets tiresome. The characters get caught up in the seriousness of her illness and it loses the goofy cartoony character of a good comedy. You know, like in Something About Mary, there's plenty of pain but it's all cartoony pain, not real.The awkwardness of dating the same woman in different ways got repetitive, I don't know, the film didn't work for me.Who should see this film:-- Only fans of the actors, on a rainy dayI'll give ""50 First Dates"" a wasted-my-time 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprising depth of conciseness,"The island is Hawaii, a temporary paradise for many women; the man on the island is Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) also a temporary paradise. Unwilling to commit to anyone or thing but his boat.Then he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). After an accident, she has lost her ability to transfer short-term memory to the long-term. So every day since the accident is erased and she starts over. So the relationship starts from a bet and ends up who knows where if anywhere.At first, the film looks just like any old Adam Sandler film that only Sandlerights could like. Then it settles down to cute. Then it settles down to meaningful, finally, you forget that you are watching a movie and then it is over. Drew excels in this movie and is very believable.The film would have come off a lot better without all the Sandleright leftover characters that contributed zip to the story. The two that came to mind are the brother Doug Whitmore (Sean Astin). And the what-not Alexa (Lusia Strus.)Another warning is that the version of the DVD had a bunch of coming attractions after paying good money I do not need forced attractions at the beginning. Wait for a better release or just press the ""Menu"" button to escape them.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than usual Sandler fare,"50 First Dates is a nice compromise for Adam Sandler. After Punch-Drunk Love, many hoped he would stick to dramatic roles, yet at the same time, legions of fans chanted that a foolish idea like that was ""Borophyll"". Thus, as a kind of compromise for both camps- we have 50 First Dates.The film tells the story of Henry Roth, a Hawaiian native with a massive fear of commitment. One day, Henry meets Lucy at a local pancake house, and after falling for her- soon realizes something is amiss. The rest of the film chronicles Henry's repeated attempts to woo Lucy- and once he gets her- his attempts to remind her how much she really loves him.Sandler is back to classic Happy Gilmore comedy form here. But he seems to have matured quite a bit. He actually seems to show a real love for Barrymore- and the two have undeniable chemistry on screen (even if the scenes with kissing in the rain are a little cliché). Having harnessed the anger of his early career, Sandler has finally made himself out to be one who is able to accomplish more than pee and fart jokes.Overall, 50 First dates is nothing special. it won't attract droves of prepubescents to their local Blockbusters, and it won't attract critical acclaim like a film by P.T. Anderson. But it is fun and sweet, and It makes work for Adam Sandler's friends.And isn't that what a movies are all about?-6/10Line of the Movie: ""You were going for a feelski!""Look of the Movie: Sean Astin when his...problem is revealed in front of his dad and sister.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Forgetfull Lucy : Unforgettable movie,"Really unforgettable movie. I love Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler of course. Drew Barrymore is really awesome in this movie. We know Adam Sandler normally do comic characters very well, he did the same in this movie too.

Lucy has a memory lose, But she remembers only the things happened till her father's birthday. She thinks that every day is the same day which is her father's birthday. Lucy does the same thing in every single day. One day the hero (Adam Sandler) meets Lucy in a restaurant and fell in love with her, but he don't know the fact about Lucy.

But one day Lucy thinks that the guy is wasting his life by loving and caring her, So she refuses him to marry her and she disagree to continue the relationship with him. It was really painful, But everybody knows that the movie will be having a happy ending.Its really a romantic comedy movie. In some part of the movie we feel sad about Adam for loosing Lucy. There is a song in this movie which says "" Forgetful Lucy, Her lips are damn juicy "" which is sung by the hero to make girl happy.Really the movie was unforgettable.

"High Concept, but too late","Okay -great concept - and some pretty good scenes. Okay - more than pretty good at times. It has a certain charm and lightness on it's feet. And I guess that's fine. But part of my wishes that the writing and acting talent could be put into something more original. It's been like a decade since Groundhog Day and though the plot is not the same - it somehow feel too unoriginal for my taste. I see why the film got made - it's trailer alone is a great example of the power of high concept. But I also wish that something more original could have been done here. I'm not knocking the film so much as saying - you managed to make a relatively good movie with this script - what if you'd really pushed for something as surprising as Groundhog Day was when it came out (not that it invented the genre, but it nailed it).",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is what we call a JOB WELL DONE,"Honestly, I am shocked that such a great movie would get a rating of 6.8. It's great fun to watch over and over again especially with the cast able to pull off the roles with sincerity, it's one of the few great Romantic comedies of the decade that manages to be sweet, fun and sentimental at times. It's a movie that is not to be taken too seriously with Adam Sandler again playing round about the same character he always plays, but Drew Barrymore has come up with something special , she manages to be really cute playing her character and gets the sentimental angle just right, it's loads better than ""Wedding Singer"" (Sandler and Drew's previous film together) what's refreshing is the funny dialogues of the side cast , the pet animals used in the shooting. All these things really go to show that the movie is making a sincere effort towards making you laugh and I laughed throughout the film indeed. If you are the scientific type and don't like Romantic Comedies this is probably not the film for you , for those of you who enjoy fun movies this is IT! It has a got a great soundtrack featuring Sir Paul McCartney, Beach Boys and at the end of it it is just fun to watch, it does not require you to think a lot and delivers on what it promises i.e enjoyment.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

In a word...Excellent!,"I'm not usually into romantic comedies, yet this one decided to work its way into my top favorite movies. I am a big fan of Sandler. His movies seem to be getting better as time goes on. 50 First Dates is about a man who falls in love with a woman whose brain damage causes her to forget him every night, and therefore he must make her fall in love with him each and every day. Despite its tragic plot, the comedic elements make the mood light and fun. The story fits together perfectly, the characters are great, and the ending is not quite what you would expect. It pulled at my heartstrings several times, as it will yours. It's one of the better movies out there. See it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Would have become a decent drama,"50 first dates was one of the big romantic comedies of this year. It contains big actors and it had major marketing behind it. I'm pretty neutral when it comes to Adam Sandler because he has couple of decent comedies but many very bad also. Drew Barrymore has convinced me just once in a good comedy (The Wedding Singer), and that one time she acted with Adam Sandler so I started watching this movie with little expectation.Movie was following pretty normal comedy line. It was made with certain formula, kind a like that it have to please a certain amount of audience. In itself it's not that bad thing, the movie was sometime funny but it didn't bring anything new to the comedy field. Also it shows that makers have to put a brake on some of the jokes just to keep the movie in that certain formula.(when they learn to make movies in more artistic way and less with dollar bills in their eyes --> I bet that the movies would be much better and they would have as much as audience than they have now, or ever more?) But now, back to the review:I found 50 First dates a bit of sad movie. There are couples of things witch made tears in my eyes and made me feel sorry for the character. It might have been better idea to make a drama from the movie because it handles such a `dramatic?' subject. Memory loss might have been a funny idea in a text but at the latest at the filming the makers have understood that it really isn't that funny. So the result is that the movie is little confusing mixing basic Adam Sandler humor to the dramatic things. Somebody should have just leash Sandler and make an effort to make the movie a decent drama.Although movie shows couple of pretty funny characters and couple of over top ones. There are also funny animal jokes and overall the movie runs pretty fluently. Idea of the film is interesting and not so often used. Adam Sandler is making a little tamed version of his usual `goofy' character and is giving an ok performance. Drew Barrymore is a real actress and gives her character a little more deep and realistic interpretation spiced with little sad tone. I liked it. Because this is a `Adam Sandler' movie it of course includes a funny beating scene and Rob Schneider in a funny minor role.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Way funnier and sweeter than expected,"First time watching this early 2000's rom com and I wasn't disappointed! I'm very particular on which Adam movies I like, and this one definitely ranks up towards the top.I didn't expect this movie to be so loving and so sweet. There was a lot of good comedy, but the premise wound up being incredibly genuine and heartfelt. An excellent surprise.There are some things that didn't age well, but I find those things forgivable in context. And, as usual (for me), Rob Schneider proved to be one of the most successful unfunny guys of the early early 2000's. But his character is enough of a sidenote it doesn't totally ruin anything.This is one you could watch again and again! Pun intended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Surprisingly Genuine Sandler Joint,"50 First Dates succeeds as a romantic film, with one of the better Adam Sandler performances. Sadly, it fails at being a comedy.

Interesting romantic comedy.,"This is an interesting romantic comedy starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Henry Roth (Sandler) is a worker at a Hawaiian ocean park and meets Lucy Whitmore (Barrymoore) in a local restaurant one day. They both get to know each other and feel a relationship forming but, the following day, Lucy does not recall meeting Henry. He later discovers that Lucy suffers from short term memory loss resulting from an accident and can't remember each individual day, meaning she does the same things every day.While many romantic comedies have the same story development and formulas (dating, falling in love, breaking-up, getting back together, etc.), this movie actually has a unique and interesting story line. It is astonishing to see the different types of memory loss people actually suffer like Lucy's - living each day only to forget what she did yesterday and relives the same routine events again. There is also a patient depicted in this film where his memory only lasts 10 seconds - astounding.It is pretty exciting to see Henry try to win Lucy's heart over and over again even though she forgets him the next day, and it is exciting to see all the lengths he goes through to win her heart despite her short-term memory loss. This gives the film a pretty entertaining plot and storyline.The acting wasn't bad and I especially liked the Marlin Whitmore character (Blake Clark) - witty and no-nonsense. I also liked the Hawaiian setting, giving it a fresh, carefree and bright atmosphere and the ending's song (Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's version of ""Over the Rainbow"") was a fitting piece of music for the film - sadness, yet hopeful in a huge horizon).Overall, an unique romantic comedy that will surely entertain.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a bad movie for Valentine's Day,"Adam Sandler does his best to make this an entertaining movie.  It works for the most part if one is looking for a mediocre romantic comedy.  I saw the movie on Valentine's Day and the theater was packed with young couples hoping to enjoy a romantic, ""cute"" movie.  There were a few scenes that just didn't jive with the overall sentiment of the movie.  But Sandler seems to always throw one or two lame, gross displays of simpleton humor into his movies.

This is my Forrest Gump.,"You know how you just HAVE to watch a movie, every time you run across it? This is that movie. The characterization is flawless. The story Arc is played out beautifully. And the dialogue .... well, isn't so memorable as much as the FEELINGS it invokes, paced by the musical score. That is truly the difference between 50 First Dates and Forrest Gump. FG has dialogue that you can quote, again and again. 50FD, has feelings that do the same thing. Not cutting FG any shortcomings, but 50FD does it better, emotionally.

That stuff should have been left on the cutting room floor, because they detracted for an otherwise enjoyable story. Drew was loveable in this film and I liked her performance.

"A sweet, humorous look at brain injury","My husband and I were drawn to this movie when it first came out, but only got around to seeing it last week. We were curious because my husband has frontal lobe brain damage, an acquired brain injury he got from meningitis fifteen years ago. My husband of course is not exactly like the girl in the movie (Lucy) but he does have short and longterm memory loss, as well as weakened impulse control and anger problems. We are active in the Brain Injury Association. This matters because Adam Sandler actually did a really good thing in making this movie. People with brain injury, and their families, rarely get the chance to laugh about it. Our family watched this movie together-although we had to cover our four year-old's eyes a few times. But he (the 4-year old) asked his daddy if he really has brain damage, and my husband answered him, and we had a real conversation about brain injury, all thanks to this movie, which opened us up. Yes, it is a sweet funny love story. But it was also a healing experience for our family-and I think Sandler may not have realized that he was really doing a good thing with this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Excellent Romantic Comedy.  This Is Good Whether You're A Sandler Fan or Not!,"Let me begin this by stating that Drew IS the star of this work. Sandler is a mere detail, although I found his performance very enjoyable. What did NOT belong here was Rob Schneider. He should have been excised from this work in every way, shape, and form. He had no place here, but we all know Sandler WILL employ his friends who have a hard time getting a job otherwise. You just can't hate that about someone. It is a trait to be admired. But when your friend is as untalented as Rob, get him a job as a crew member, NOT a cast member! Okay, enough of that.This was only mildly funny, because the subject matter was too serious to actually rate outright comedy. The comedy is light, because it HAS to be light in order to sell the later premise.The later premise is presented beautifully, in sensitivity, and with a fair amount of awe.

This Movie Broke My Heart,"Warning guys: this near tear-jerker is not your typical chick flick.I was pleasantly surprised by this powerful romantic dramatic comedy which shows the real meaning of true love without the triteness of the modern movie age. It's shallow title lulls you into expecting the typical silly chick flick motif. You're deceived into relaxing and expecting the same formula, but midway through you realized this is one of those rare movies that does what it's intended to do: move you. This movie has genuine emotion. You'll turn the DVD player off with a lump in your throat.It's silly comedic movements (read: Rob Schneider) distracts from the emotion of the film, but Adam Sandler and Drew Berrymore's surprising performances more than makes up for it. Adam finds an environment where his natural wit moves well with the movie, and Drew's shy innocence shines throughout.Don't be deceived---give it a chance and remember what it feels like to fall in love again for the first time.Pros: The best movie Adam Sandler ever made (ordinarily this isn't saying much, but this really is a great movie) and the most memorable romantic comedy of this decade.Cons: This could also translate as a great family film but for the unnecessary PG-13 materials which adds nothing to the film.Conclusion: A surprising heart-breaker you'll find yourself embarrassingly recommending to your friends.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I really admire how it was made a comedy and yet there was no fun or sport made out of Lucy's condition; that part was handled with care and sensitivity. I get teary-eyed every time I watch this movie. My father and I recently watched it and even he was getting choked.

A remarkably sweet scenario and cast,"Before watching this movie, and having read in several newspapers and TV guides that this movie was not really worth watching, I expected an all American loves story.

The film has pace, is brave in its dialogue, and the actors do their best to really make it work on screen. With this, the scenario is very original. Seeing loss of memory as a classic theme in the movies, this is a very original adaptation of a well known them that could easily fail when treated as a cliché.Drew Barymore is so very sweet in her performance renewed surprise, while Adam Sandler is his regular self, but this time filled with love and ambition in going a long way in pleasing Drew.

Wouldn't It Be NiceOh it is,"50 First Dates is the funniest movie of 2004 to date. It's hard to believe that there are people in the world who have short-term memory loss, it's even hard to believe how funny and original this movie is. For Henry Roth his life usually consists of hanging out with his friends, working with the animals that he now calls family, and preparing for a big trip that he plans to take in his boat. One day while out testing the boat, the boat breaks down and he is forced to get to land. He enters a nice little diner where the characters inside are as colorful as it is outside. This is where he meets Lucy Whitmore, a beautiful woman with a carefree attitude. After one change meeting the two make an instant bond, after hours of talking and laughing the two decide to meet again the very next day at the same time. Sounds good rightwrong, to Henry's surprise Lucy has no idea who he is. He soon leans that Lucy suffers from short-term memory loss, now Henry is out to make the woman of his dreams fall in love with him everyday.50 First Dates is a laugh out loud comedy that will have everyone in a good mood. The re-teaming of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore is awesome. The two have great screen chemistry, if this time around is as successful as The Wedding Singer one may expect to see another film featuring the two actors. And if the amount of people that were at the theater that I saw this at is any indication as to how big this film is going to be, then I'm getting in line now for their next movie. The always-funny Rob Schneider is the funniest I have ever seen him. His portrayal of Ula, one of Henry's friends is in short a performance by a comic mastermind. Sean Astin came out of nowhere and turned in a very funny performance as Lucy's muscle bound brother. All in all, 50 First Dates is a great movie with an awesome cast of characters, it is a feel good movie that will leave a little imprint on your heart. Ok so it may not do that but the movie is funny. 3.6 out of 4 and an A-",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adam and Drew are Great!,"Fifty First Dates is the second teaming of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore following their first hit The Wedding Singer; let us hope it's not the last.There's something about these two that clicks and I found that this most recent paring was just as enjoyable and enchanting as their first; perhaps even better. Sandler is charming while Barrymore is a graceful mix of innocence and beauty.The story goes something like this: Sandler is a island playboy who ends up falling in love with a local girl who has a memory problem; with each day she wakes up, she has completely forgotten what has occurred the previous day. Sandler is forced to make Barrymore fall in love with him day after day after day which is the cause of some hilarious as well as some heartwarming scenes.I really have only a few complaints with this movie, complaints that I consider really hold this movie back from being fantastic. The sub plots, which are there to provide humor, really fall flat, especially the scene with the vomiting walrus. These small glitches aside, the movie is wonderful and at the end, I even found my eyes a little misty.If you loved Sandler and Barrymore in The Wedding Singer, You may just love them even more after Fifty First Dates. Let's hope another Sandler/Barrymore project isn't too far in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

fun loving romantic comedy,I went to see this film because i knew Sean Astin was in it I am a very big fan of his. I wasn't expecting anything great but i was greatly suprised its a very wity film with some original jokes and i was laughing all the way through. Sean's charcater Doug was very wity especially with his muscle obsession. Some very funny scenes i.e with the walrus and in the hospital (10 second Tom). Drew Barrymore wasn't playing a cheesy character she actually seemed real. It is a fun loving romantic comedy which will have you wetting your seats.

Loved the Movie,"I gotta say this is probably my favorite Adam Sandler movie.  It had enough laughs to keep it goin, while was serious enough to draw you in.  Even though I have seen all of his other movies, the jokes never seemed stale. Everytime you get used to Sadlers humor, sean astin or one of the other characters step in and pick up the slack. My only complaint is ten second tom, really annoying and at the end when he interupted them in the studio. It did nothing but kill the mood.  It wasn't funny, it should have been left out.  The ending with ""somewhere over the rainbow"", just ties the whole movie together and gives you a good feeling to take home with you when you leave the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

An underrated classic. You all are going to say you were an adam sandler fan once he is gone!,"I saw this movie when it was first released and fell in love with it. I have probably seen it 100+ times since then. This movie is witty, funny, unique, sweet, romantic, thoughtful, well put together and sincere. The soundtrack is near perfect.

It makes millions of people laugh and has for 20 years. 50 First Dates is a masterpiece. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are the greatest duo and have so much chemistry.

"IMHO, One of Adam's/Drew's Best","I avoided seeing this movie for months until there was not really much else in my local video store I wanted to see so I reluctantly rented it. Just proves the old adage, 'Never judge a book (in this case a movie) by it's cover. Though I am not a big Adam Sandler fan (gross out movies turn me off) I found '50' to be a great movie with a beautiful love story to tell. The walrus gross out scene near the beginning had me almost ready to turn it off BUT I am more then glad the movie steered away from having more scenes like it and instead explored the love affair between Henry and Lucy. Henry's determination at winning Lucy's heat is a great part of this movie as is Lucy's tragic life altering event but love does conquer all especially when truth is allowed to express its self fully no matter how painful. They say the ending is the most important part of any story and this movie has a great one. Plus, as one reviewer has said already ""any movie that has a pivotal scene that hinges on a Beach Boys song is just alright with me"". All in all a great movie. If you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favor, avoid the sex and violence for one night and rent 50 First Dates. I am more then glad I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Loved this Movie,"I would like to start off by saying that I hate Adam Sandler movies. But I have to compromise if I expect him to see a chick flick with me. My husband loves SNL people movies and I find them stupid. I like movies with substance and that make you think. He hates them. I was forced to see this movie and I loved it. It was sweet without being to corny, I could have done without the other SNL guy (Rob Snider). I love romantic movies like this that don't seem to be like other movies.

Adam & Drew together again...and again...and again,"Wedding Singer duet team again in story of commitment-phobic Sandler who meets his dream girl Barrymore. Fact that, due to freak accident, Drew can't remember anything from one day to the next makes it even cleaner for Sandler. Or maybe not? Leads have the same chemistry that made Wedding Singer work. I'm not sure about the details of Barrymore's memory problem, it doesn't seem quite right, but the stars do their best even if it does play like a backwards Groundhog Day. Moderately effective supporting spots including Drew's family and Sandler's friend Schneider. Wraps up very nicely. Docked a point for frequent, excessive and pointless vulgarity from Schneider and some elderly Hawaiian gentleman. Obscenities from old people was, I think, blase' even before Sandler was born. 8 of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The only part I didn't like about the movie was that it ended on a slightly sad tone. It was a 'feel good' movie.. and yet not a 'feel good' movie...

My Thoughts on 50 First Dates,I have read many reviews and comments made by members of IMDb.com on the thought that 50 was very or very not similar to Groundhog Day. I myself have to say that the day to day repetition was very similar amongst the two but the romantic aspect was not.True like most romantic films the realism is blown out of proportion resulting in a fairy tale based love story. But Adam Sandlers evergoing effort to strive for Drew Barrymore's love was displayed very differently than I recall in a film of the past. It was very sweet how he in the end threw aside the major issue that she would never remember him the next day but still wanted to be there for her day by day :),8.0,Anonymous,Romance

My Favorite Adam Sandler Film,"I don't know what it is, there's just something about this movie. I don't know if it's the setting, or the story, or the actors, but everything just seems to work with this one. I have to admit, I am quite a big fan of Adam Sandler. Simply put, he makes me laugh. But I must also admit that I find much of his work to be rather cheesy, and many of his jokes, and sometimes whole films, fall flat with me, to the point that I have avoided watching certain films of his because the trailers made them look bad. But with 50 First Dates, everything seems so perfect. He has the same old actors and the same kinds of jokes as always, but there's this charm to it as well that makes the cheesy jokes seem not so cheesy when I watch this.

"`50 First Dates' is not a great movie, but with its surprising blend of a decent sincere love story and comedy, the film succeeds in entertaining us.","One can pretty much predict how bad an Adam Sandler flick can be. His last major big-budget movie, `Anger Management,' although having Jack Nicholson, could not keep itself afloat. After all, jokes and great actors cannot outweigh a lack of reasonable plot. Nonetheless, Sandler's flicks for the most part are big money makers and his fans are always there for him. With his new movie, `50 First Dates,' Sandler brings back his brand of slapstick and pubescent humor to actually make a film that is somewhat good. In fact, `50 First Dates' has a surprising bit of sentiment to a love story that seems like it came from the Farrelly brothers. 	`50 First Dates' tells the story of Henry Roth (Sandler), a sea-park vet who meets a woman at a local restaurant whom to his chagrin has lost her short-term memory. He realizes this when after meeting her, he goes back to the restaurant and finds that she does not even remember who he is. He learns from a waitress that the girl's name is Lucy (Drew Barrymore) and that she was in an accident about a year ago in which she sustained a head injury. As such, Lucy's father, brother, and the workers at the restaurant all make Lucy think that she's living the same day over again.Lucy's father and brother warn Henry to stay away from her feeling that his presence will only confuse her when she forgets about the day. But everyone knows that letting go of love is not an easy process. As such, Henry puts together a video in which he shows Lucy pictures of the crash and gently lets her know what has happened to her, and has happened during the previous year that she has missed. But the problem is that Henry will have to do this day in and day out-constantly reliving first dates for Lucy.Although the premise seems fallible if not insulting to those who suffer from forms of memory loss, this film's heart is in the right place. One can tell that the characters genuinely care about each other. Sandler provides his shtick of making up songs about a pretty girl that he loves who has lost her memory. Furthermore, the video that he keeps remaking for Lucy describing the changes in her life and in the world that she does not remember is actually heartfelt. 	On to the comedy aspect-it did not start out well. A perfect example that this film was heading in the wrong direction happened in a scene where a walrus vomits all over a fellow veterinarian. As an audience member, one cannot decide whether to laugh or be disgusted. Moreover, it would not be a Sandler flick without some character getting beat up-in this case its Rob Schneider who plays Henry's pal Ula, a burned out shark catcher.It was nice to associate Sean Astin with something other than `Lord of the Rings.' He plays Lucy's brother Doug, who is obsessed with perfecting his body-especially with the help of steroids. Other than his gross display of peck flexing, Doug speaks with a lisp and cannot fight to save his life. His funniest scene occurs when he discusses a supposed friend's problem of having wet dreams and his fear that it could be related to steroid use. The doctor, played by Dan Akroyd, simply says, `Get off the sauce!' 	`50 First Dates' is not a great movie, but with its surprising blend of a decent sincere love story and comedy, the film succeeds in entertaining us. ***",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sandler regains my favor!,"After Anger Management, Eight Crazy Nights, and Punch Drunk Love, I thought Sandler had gone the way of Carrey and Schneider...turning to movies that only played off their stereotypes.BUT, my sister and I watched this last night, and it was brilliant.

Wonderful Romantic comedy about a man (sandler) who falls in love with a girl who forgets everything the day before when she goes to sleep at night.,"50 First Dates is slowly climbing the charts and becoming one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. I saw it two weeks ago on DVD. I was skeptical that it would be any good. Sandler has gone down hill with his movies from Waterboy and Happy Gilmore. The Wedding singer was cute, but not great. 50 First dates is great! It has enough comedy to keep the typical guy laughing and it has enough heart felt moments for the women out there. The movie will have you laughing the whole time. It also makes you really feel for both characters. The ending will have to feeling happy and sad all at the same time. Must see date movie!

Better than the reviews,"I found this movie to be much better than the reviews for it.  I must admit I am somewhat of an Adam Sandler fan though.  I say somewhat because about 1/3 of his movies were awful in my opinion.  He and Drew have good chemistry in this movie and it's believeable that they have feelings for one another. Sean Astin is very funny in this movie even with the annoying LISP.  I still find the movie to be a bit sad and was hoping that some miracle would happen and her memory would come back.  It's a little unbelieveable too that any man would reinvent his love for you every single day.  That aside, this is a funny, romantic movie and I recommend it for ages 12 and up!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adam Sandler has to make Drew Barrymore fall in love with him over again each day,"The best film Adam Sandler has yet made. The on-screen chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore is compelling and very romantic.Lucy (Drew Barrymore) has a serious head injury in a car accident, and as a result, has no short term memory from after her accident. One year after the accident, enter Henry Roth (Adam Sandler),a man whose avocation is one night stands with lady tourists vacationing in the Hawaiian setting. Henry falls for Lucy one morning at an atmospheric cafe, only to discover she does not know him or remember anything about him, the following day. Beautifully shot on location in Hawaii, Lucy and Henry are quite the unusual couple. All Henry has to do it make Lucy fall for him all over again each day!Bravo supporting performances by Blake Clark as Lucy's dad and Sean Astin as her steroid slurping body builder brother. Their task each day is to make Lucy believe it is still the day of the accident, and they go to great lengths to achieve this-until one day the scheme backfires.Rob Schneider is hysterical as Ulla, Henry's ne'er do well best friend. Also great supporting parts by Dan Aykroyd as Lucy's doctor, and Lusia Strus as Sandler's gender bending assistant at the oceanarium where he is a vet/researcher.A great sweet romantic comedy with a great script that guides you gently through Henry's (Sandler's) attempts to work around Lucy's (Barrymore's) illness, rather than to confuse!

sweet,"Adam Sandler fans, fall in love with him again. Fans of ""The Wedding Singer"" will adore this one. Adam Sandler plays a young man who is quite adored by the ladies who go on vacation to where he lives. Did I mention he lives in Hawaii?? The number of women charmed by Sandler's character is quite impressive. But -- what if -- his friend, Ula, asks, he actually has a lady who wants to stay and with whom he wants to stay? (Yeah, right. Like that could happen!) Well... Henry Roth meets a mysterious, beautiful young woman at a diner (Spam, anyone??) and his life will never be the same! Be wary of letting kids watch this one. Some sexual themes which aren't meant for young ears/eyes. I loved the casting. Ever-present in Sandler films, Rob Scheider delivers a good performance as Ula, a native Hawaiian with a large wife and lots of kids. He is dysfunctional as a parent (well, as a person, actually), but he offers comic relief that is worth a belly laugh. The chemistry that was in ""The Wedding Singer"" between Barrymore and Sandler is also here. How can I describe the performance that is my favorite, though?? Sean Astin (Yes, THAT Sean Astin) plays Barrymore's brother, Doug. He also is delightful in his role and I just laugh each time I think of the things his character says and does.

romanticizing tough condition works for Sandler,"This movie is one of Mr. Sandler's glimmering jewels among dead weight rocks. In my opinion it ranks up there with The Wedding Singer, also co starring Drew Barrymore. Maybe its her characters' innocent charm that brings out Sandlers better, romantic side. The problem for me comes with way they romanticize the situation. Many married people split after one of them goes through the trauma Lucy has, and yet according to the movie, it is appealing to have to get your lover up to speed every day of their life. I admire the person that can do that, and only the best of wishes for those like Henry who know what lies ahead of them and they still make that commitment. But in reality, its not so exciting and uplifting. In that respect, it is good of them to have Lucy feel like she is inconveniencing Henry. The scenery is beautiful, the editing/styling on segments like the pineapple intro and crash scene were marvelous; really displaying what the company's/producers are capable of producing. aside from the 'birdies' (not including the penguin), the film is incredible! i love it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Quit Complaining about plots, this is meant to entertain","Considering I deal with a lot of writing depth, often mature material and research, and watch lots of serious and engrossing plots ... sometimes I want to unwind with something I don't have to think about a lot, but can make me laugh. The so - called critics, whose jibs I have read here, have probably never performed in public, published any literature, or studied drama. Adam is generally a goof in his parts. But have any of you ever diliberated on how difficult it can be to do any kind of comedy? He makes you laugh. If you don't like his brand of humor, don't watch. This particular film I enjoyed because not only was it light, but if you are intelligent enough to know what to look for you can tell he has a lot of range in his ability. Sure, he is goofy, but he has a lot of ability in those moments he actually shows emotion through his eyes and facial expression. Drew had some good moments as well. As to Sean, I can only imagine he had a blast just letting go and not having to be a lead. Anyone who doubts his ability doesn't have to watch his Hobbit, go back and watch ""Rudy"". Oh well, there is always going to be complainers. I watched, I liked, and now own a copy of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie!,"If you have read any of my other comments, you know by now that when I watch a movie, I am in it for a certain emotion. When I watch an action movie, I want to be on the edge of my seat all the way through. When I watch a sensual movie I want to be ready to jump my husband's bones at the end. This was truly a great romantic comedy. The comedic parts were hilarious- I was laughing the whole way through. The romance was awesome. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore really have great chemistry. I felt them the whole way through. The penguin and the old guy stole the show. This is not a chick flick, though. The guys will enjoy it too! This is a movie that I suggest you own!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
great movie about love,"This is a really good movie to bond with your G F or your Wife  or other . I think it is a serious ""chick flick"" if you want to call it that.  It is about a guy so determined to win the girl of his dreams that he has to first win her over every day.  then he has made this VHS tape to show her what her life is like and remind that they are in love but she breaks it off and things go down hill from there but the good guy wins as always.  Of course. I dont pay attention to plot development or directing style or plot lines and how the writer messed up or the director did not do something that only some one in directing school or in show business would worry about.  I just watch the movie and either enjoy or complain about it. I think it is worth the money spent and time invested in watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Hidden Gem,"Didn't know whether I'd like this at first but I've fell in love with it on the first date.50 First Dates is a great mix of comedy and romance, which made me laugh and tear up every time. It has such a great story idea, one which is so interesting and unique and it was pulled off really well. There were a lot of hidden morals that the viewer thinks about. Every character was interesting to watch and learn about, I just wish Nick and Sue got more screen time. Even the animals were lovable. Sometimes Sandler was a bit awkward to watch, not sure if this was the intention with his character, if it was he did a good job.The technicalities were pretty good as well. I thought this may have been one of the weaker areas at first glance. However with shooting most of the film in Hawaii you can't really go wrong. The music choice as well was excellent, it's great when the music matches the theme and location. There were some scenes that I wished were much longer though, they went by too fast to build up emotion sometimes. It just seemed to cut too soon in an emotional scene, and then before you know it we're somewhere else.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adam Sandler most talented film-maker in Hollywood,"Since the first Sandler movie i watched, i -felt- the movies of Sandler. They were always very funny, adorable and a kind of dramatic. Of course on a very light level, but everything always fitted together. The best part is, that he doesn't take himself or one of his characters he is directing to serious. Movies that takes themselves to serious make me sick. That's why i like Bollywood movies, if you see Sharukan ( i know, its 3 words..) acting, you realize that fast.In 50 First Dates we of course don't see high-level acting Hollywood Giants, i don't want to compare him to Clint Eastwood or Al Pacino. But in his way, he his delivering a message to me and i'm receiving it. Enjoy live, be honest to others and laugh a lot. Thats a feeling all of his movies left me with.In this movie, additional to the usual funny and weird characters surrounding Sandler, one can experience a very good acting Drew Barrymore, which perfectly fits into this movie. She is fitting to the other characters in this film in a very sweet way: They all don't fulfill common expectations. I really enjoyed the movie and think its one of Sandlers best - IF you are in the mood for a love story.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Overall, a funny and enjoyable film","I really enjoyed this movie.  It had a great scriptwriter, because everyone in the theater was laughing and looking upset in all the right places.  This movie was laugh out loud funny, but still not just slapstick humor. However, there was some crude humor that I could have lived without.  There was this character who was an ""it"", we weren't sure if it was male or female, who was more gross than funny.  And some lines were disgusting once you thought about it.  Overall, this was a funny and enjoyable film, that I could see again and again.  I think that this movie is appropriate for anyone over 11, because of disgusting humor. It also had a great ending.  I highly reccomend this movie to people with all different kinds of tastes. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

More than likely if you watched billy madison now, you wouldn't find it so funny! I challenge all of you to watch and see. He's made such major advances, that it's astonishing he's been able to put together such a cohesive movie collection. It's good, real good.

wonderful movie,"50 First dates is a great romantic comedy because its both a light-hearted funny romance and a serious story about love. Serious movies often seem overwhelming, or too much to deal with when we need some R& R. Yet light goofy movies can seem like a waste of time. This movie was both entertaining and fulfilling, the best of both worlds.For anyone with a disability or flaw that makes dating life hard (and who doesn't have one of those?) this movie is an uplifting tale of how people can come together and learn to cope. But don't think about the serious stuff too much! You'll ruin all the slapstick comedy that trademarks an Adam Sandler film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It continues to get better...,"In the beginning, this has a bit of a corny feel with a playboy picking up on and lying to women. They're setting the stage obviously as that leads him to a girl sitting by herself building a waffle house. They have a moment, and the next time they meet, she's clueless as to who he is.The movie meanders for a bit, but then this girl has a bad day. What ensues is a day of enlightenment and the movie suddenly gets a lot more serious.As the day comes to a close, the Father asks this playboy if he might not want to stick around, saying he's earned a couple of beers.At that point, the movie turns and it just keeps getting better. I found it fascinating, because many movies get to the midpoint and they don't always go in a favorable direction. But instead of fighting things, the Father is on board and it leads to a really wonderful ending where you see how they've essentially mastered this seemingly impossible situation.So that's about the best way that I can describe the movie without getting specific and blowing it for anyone. Granted the movie is some 20 years old, so there shouldn't be any spoilers anyway.I find it hard to believe anyone will be reading this review prior to watching, but I want to mention this one scene. There's a moment where Lucy's in the evening sun, Henry looks at her and says, in this lighting, man o man, you look... disgusting. She does this sort of cat hissing thing and the whole scene felt so real and natural, like really good improv. I think Drew and Adam are so great together and this movie is much better than The Wedding Singer.Needless to say, I love this film. If the 1st half were better, it might be worth 9 or 10 stars.One warning: When I watched on MTV, parts of scenes were actually cut so they could make more time for commercials. It's also censored; when one person flips someone off, it looks like a fist. So if you want your kids to watch, roll with it, otherwise I suggest you buy it or look for it on a real movie channel.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"An ""Up"" Movie","I thought this was an ""up"" movie with a kind of ""down"" plot. I saw Adam Sandler as a very caring person who took a very difficult situation and dealt with it in a very positive way. I thought Drew Barrymore looked prettier in this movie than in a lot of others I've seen her in. She has the classic ""Barrymore"" profile. I also liked Adam Sandler more than in other movies. Did you notice the credit he gave to his family at the very end? The scenery was beautiful. I had a little trouble with his helper at the Seaquarium - I'm not sure of the gender. Sean Austin could have done away with the lisp but his character rang true to some men I've known like that. Also, I didn't now you could train a walrus! I'd watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
breath of fresh air... in a weird way,"50 First Dates is a very entertaining movie. I was surprised that it actually had a storyline! I thought it was going to be some fun gag movie by Sandler but obviously, it proved wrong.What I like about this film is the way comedy was infused with more ""serious"" issues like brain damage and commitment. Bottom line, it was a great movie. The Sandler-Barrymore team-up works, and Schneider, as always, is a fantastic addition to this film. And ahem, Sean Astin. Last movie I saw with him parading his muscles was in Memphis Belle. Funny cast. Great music/soundtrack.Although the storyline has a fairy-tale-like approach, it makes you believe in something you don't see everyday...

Basically it's the story of a local in Hawaii who picks up cute tourists but is afraid of any commitment, so he tells every girl he meets silly lies to not have to talk to them anymore. How funny is that on its own? Then he runs into a beautiful local girl on the other side of the island (Drew Barrymore). I definitely recommend it. Very cute, very funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cary Grant? Rock Hudson? William Powell? Hell no - ADAM SANDLER!,"That Adam Sandler will become known as the 21st Century's king of romantic comedy by subsequent generations of filmgoers is not, I submit, cause for mass lemming-like stampedes of film buffs off the nearest palisades. Like him or not, the guy can really do this stuff in his sleep, and, if anything, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and this picture showed that he might actually enjoy doing it enough to start messing around in interesting ways with the genre's ground rules. One major hurdle remains: Sandler must be able to appeal to women in a more direct, salacious (but not offensively so; Grant is the paradigm here) manner than he's presently capable of (or comfortable with). Sandler's still putting himself forward as the cute little boy who eventually evolves into a more adult partner, and his appeal needs to be a little more, well, grown-up. But only a little.... 1998's ""The Wedding Singer"" (which first teamed Sandler with Drew Barrymore), ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and this film show how confident Sandler's become as the heir to Cary. And Sandler's already got his core audience locked up and on his side. Now all he needs to do is win over a few more egghead cineastes and he'll join the immortals, whether we like it or not....",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Imagine having to win over the girl of your dreams....... everyday?? Review of 50 First Dates!,"""50 First Dates"" was in fact a very decent film, i must admit! it reunites ""The Wedding Singer's"" Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore for a romantic comedy in which it tells the story about a Vet called Henry Roth (sandler) and in Hawii he is known for sleeping with female tourists before they head back home. but he has suddenly has enough and goes out on his boat to do some research on sea animals, than his boat crashes and goes to a local café' and thats when he spots a local women called Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) and he is instantly struck and is in love, they start talking and relies that they have a lot in common, and agree to meet again, but Henry realises that Lucy has short term memory Loss and can't contain new information and so from there he has to act like he has just met her and sometimes he gets rejected because Lucy makes up stories that shes got a boyfriend called Ringo Mcartney or she speaks Chinese to make him go away, so Henry makes up crazy ideas for her to notice and remember him. Lucy than discovers what had happened to her and wants answers and thats when she discovers that she and Henry are dating, to help her remember this she puts all of her thoughts into her diary, but she than decides to end it with Henry because she thinks its not fair on him and deletes him from her memory, shocked by this he decides to leave the island and carry on with his travels, but suddenly he thinks that Lucy remembers him and rushes of to find her. its obvious what happens in the end of the film but i really enjoyed it, Barrymore and Sander have amazing chemistry on screen and should do more movies together! this may not be as clever or brilliant as ""The Wedding Singer"" once was but its a good movie. The Acting was OK, Not Barrymores best performance, i am a big fan of her but it seemed she has just read the script, Sandler was OK as well i mean he is not the most amazing actor that i have ever come across but he was OK! 9/10 is a decent marking and the supporting cast was good as well!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nearly (and I say nearly) all of Adam Sandler's movies are the feel-good movies I'm talking about. Big Daddy, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and of course, The Wedding Singer. When they're over, you feel great. They give you a very subtle amount of hope, and hope is always a good thing.50 First Dates plays out in the same way as every romantic comedy does. Man meet woman, they have a great time, they have an argument, man does his best to fix problem, they live happily ever after. Sure, it's used all-the-time, but why not? It works and it never feels repeated, because you've always got new characters and a new concept.The basic plot revolves around one Henry Roth (Sandler). He's the ultimate guy, he's got it all; he lives in Hawaii, he's got a good job, good friends and all the skills to winning any girl he wants. Problem is, he's afraid of commitment. He meets a girl, scores and then makes an excuse to break up with them. Then, one day, he meets Lucy (Barrymore). She's different, and as Henry finds out, very special. They get along from the moment they meet, and Henry seems to have found he girl he can finally settle down with. One problem: she's got short-term memory loss and everyday she forgets she ever meet Henry. So, as love is, Henry has to win her over; every single day.The performances are great, especially from Adam and Drew. The cast was well selected and they two lead characters shine just like they did in The Wedding Singer. The old Sandler crew are back making great cameo entries and they really did make me laugh, as did the entire movie. The setting is beautiful, it's Hawaii after all! As for the musical selection, awesome! You really feel tropical and involved in the story. Seriously, check this one out, you won't be disappointed.(4/5)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie was hilarious!,"This movie had me laughing so hard I thought that I would pee my pants. The whole theater was in laughter half the time.  My favorite character was Lucy's brother, played by Sean Astin.  It was nice to see him in such a comedic role and between his lisp and his wardrobe, he had me laughing every time he was in a scene. I'd recommend seeing this movie to anyone who loves Adam Sandler's sense of humor.  It is both sweet and funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love overcomes handicaps,"I enjoyed very much this film. It is a comedy and many could argue that not a good one.. The movie will not get you rolling on the floor with laughter, but most likely smiling every now and then.The story is about a lady's man that accidentally falls in love with a girl who suffers a very incredible handicap. She loses her memory every day when she goes to sleep. Now there is a lot of distasteful ways in which this movie could have exploited this premise.. However after seeing it, I get the impression I saw a good movie about the power of love.If you are in for a romantic comedy without any high pretensions and full of good values, take this one, you will not regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful!,"Being the huge Drew Barrymore fan that I am, I just had to see this movie at the cinema when it first came out... And I am SO glad I did! Like usual Drew Barrymore makes a wonderful performance in this highly entertaining romance which is (In my opinion ) her best movie since ""Ever After"". Adam Sandler also makes a wonderful performance as Henry Roth. I absolutely love the soundtrack, characters and wonderful storyline.This movie is very funny and deeply romantic. The most romantic scene would have to be the scene on the beach when Henry says to Lucy ""nd I love you very much probably more then any one could ever love another person"" that touches me every time I watch it. I now own this fabulous romantic comedy on DVD. All the animals at the aquarium are so cute! This is a grate chick flick to watch over and over again. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great awwwww factor,"I lost count of the number of times the audience I saw this movie with said ""awwwwww"".  It was just that kind of movie.  There were several touching moments.  There was even a smattering of applause after the movie was over. Like many others who have seen it, I had no idea how good and how sweet this movie would be.My only beef with the movie was the preoccupation with some juvenile humor. Even more juvenile than most Adam Sandler movies.  But I guess if it had not included the humor for 11 year olds, it would have just been labeled a chick flick.And there is an ending you will remember long after the credits are gone.Note:  The dentist early in the film is played by Adam Sandler's wife, Jackie Titone.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Increbible friendship...,"I've watched this movie several times and I must say that it is a wonderful song of friendship, and awakening love. The multiple angles, or facets, are that it shows us friendship in itself has many forms. I've seen almost every movie from Adam AND Rob, and these two guys are always supporting each other. If I had a friend like these two have in each other I would be living a dream.Also, Sean Astin was accused of having a ""homosexual"" relationship with Elijah Wood because they had such a close relationship while filming Lord of The Rings. Subsequent clips of the movie LOTR, which showed how close they were as friends, is meaningful to the word friendship.If America, AND the rest of the ""western world"", would have this kind of closeness, there would be more peace in the world. I would like to rejoice in these forward thinkers of showing that friendship is what makes the bonding of life meaningful and special. Thank you Adam, Rob, Sean, and Elijah for showing the rest of the world how important true friendship is. Do NOT allow those closed-minded people to rule what true friendship means! You are, in my opinion, leaders of the future.I love all your movies, and may they continue to bring levity, happiness, and change to our world. KUDOS!!And as for Drew Barrymore, she is a TRUE inspiration for everyone!! I've watched this beautiful young woman grow from a child through her troubled youth to become an inspiration for all people. Like Ms. Barrymore, I had a problem with fighting my desires for substance abuse, and she was one of my lights to overcome this horrid problem. Today I hold her as one of the brightest stars in the sky. How wonderful to have such lights to shine for everyone to see. YEA!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I love this movie!,At first I thought that this movie is just a ordinary love comeday before watching.but I was wrong.it is a very enjoyrable firm.

Fifth time is a charm,"8.2 stars.For some reason, this movie improves over time more than most. It doesn't seem like the type of film that would repeatedly impact me so emotionally, but for some reason every new viewing brings new feelings. This time around it felt so different. Several of the scenes were unfamiliar to me. I wonder if those scenes were previously omitted, maybe it was the director's cut? It's very strange, almost as if they're trying to trick us as an audience into thinking we were watching it for the first time, just like Lucy wakes up every morning forgetting everything.I don't remember Sandler's performance being this good, and overnight Drew Barrymore transformed from looking great into looking absolutely bombshell drop-dead-gorgeous. Very strange feeling watching this a fifth time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best Sandler and Barrymore movie,Fifty First Dates was without a doubt the best Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore movie they have acted together in. The plot outline was great so I may say it was the best comedy with those actors together like Blake Clark and Sean Astin as Doug (Sean Astin)the steroid user in the movie was funny along with Marlin (Blake Clark) the funny and unharmful dad was funny too. Drew Barrymore who plays Lucy was funny along with Henry Roth the animal vet who is played by Adam Sandler who is so funny. The rating out of ten was a A+ and 10/10.Rated \PG-13 on appeal for crude sexual humor and drug references. People who did not see the movie should see it now in theaters.Believe me you will love it.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable, though very charming and very romantic.","Barrymore and Sandler showed with Wedding Singer that they were a great couple with a good chemistry, this was another test to see if Wedding Singer was a loner of if these two just were great together on screen, and indeed, they are fantastic together in this movie too!Henry Roth is a local womanizer who are afraid of relationships, until he comes along what appears to be the woman of his life, Lucy, there is only one problem here, the girl of his dreams is suffering from short term memory loss, so every day when she wakes up she has forgotten about him, this means he has to make her fall in love with him day after day, however this does make complications.This is a really good movie, honestly i was glad to see that they still can make good romantic comedies in Hollywood, even though it is the a definition of a romantic comedy, it's not really as stupid as one could expect, it does have its periods where it tries to be stupid, but it's not in front and it doesn't get noticed much, actually the ""dumb"" persons of the movie that could be there to annoy you, they actually work fairly good and even gave me a few laughs, though i hate dumb humour, but this movie was so loveable i guess i got into the mood.The direction isn't much, it's pretty much a standard movie, a classic one, it has all the ingredients Hollywood loves, and uses all the time, but it's very loveable, however not a cinematic masterpiece.Now what really makes this movie so good apart from the good story, is the two leading actors, Drew and Adam are just simply great together here, their chemistry is so good that all the romantic scenes goes directly to your head, and heart. I must admit i didn't think that they could do as good a job as they did in Wedding Singer, but this is actually just as good, if not even better, it's been a while since i saw that last, but this is a great performance from both.Sometimes all these romantic comedies Hollywood produces seems to be manufactured so much that you can almost feel the kliche, they all appear to be copies of each other, and most of them are blatant failures on the box office as well among normal audience, still they manage to release more of these than any other genre, however once in a while there are some that are unique, this is one of them. Even though this is a romantic comedy, it is actually in its own way rather original, well sure it has a few kliches and it is very predictable, but it has a different moral and a more intelligent angle than some of the others i thought, and besides from that it is well done. One thing i liked very much is that they weren't trying to hard on the humour, as many others in this genre does, and fails.In the later years i have thought Adam Sandler has been running around in a little room, doing only the same roles over and over again, just in a different scenario, i guess this is yet another one of those, but what is there to say, Drew makes him shine as a star. And he returns that and makes Drew shine as well.The movie works mostly because the romantic part is so good, that makes the dumb humour that are there to fade very far into the background, which makes it a loveable movie, rather than a dumb movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great flick.,"This movie conveys all that love should be. This is a fun movie that is about love, laughter and the first kiss. It is something that couples everywhere should watch. Adam Sandler has never been more attractive. Drew barrymore has never seem more innocent. She reminds me of a child who is experienceing love and life for the first time. It is of course a humurous movie. I mean c'mon Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, and Rob Schneider. Of course it's funny. I suggest this movie if your looking to just kick back, relax, be entertained, and find a new way to love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of my absolute favorites!,"I love this movie, if you are in the mood for something funny, entertaining and sweet, this is for you.This romantic comedy is about a woman, Lucy, who has an accident and loses her memory and every day onwards her mind resets at the end of the day. She doesn't remember the people she meets after her accident. One day she meets Henry, and it then becomes Henry's daily mission to see Lucy and take her out. In true Adam Sandler style, he is entertaining and endearing, and his character spends his time trying to convince Lucy's family and friends that he has her best interests at heart! It's lighthearted, and entertaining, and for anyone looking for something to make them laugh and smile, it is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unbelievable,"This film, although i only saw it the other day is one of the greatest films i have ever seen and it really completely reflects what any normal person would do in Henrys (Sandlers) shoes. Drew played the part down to a tee and it was a real tear jerker and a definite film for any couples who want a film to make them cry and laugh in the course of 90 minutes. We can only hope that the pairing of Drew and Adam can be reunited again to give us another golden film to be proud of. I hope that Drew takes another risk and lets it pay off which can only help her fast growing reputation and bank balance.Its a real gem and one for Drew Barrymore and the set to be proud of.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

50 First Dates,"I don't normally like Adam Sandler movies, but I do love Drew Barrymore. This is not your typical Sandler movie. Set in beautiful Hawaii, 50 First Dates is about a commitment phobic who falls for this girl with whom he can not possibly have a normal future with. Lucy, the girl of his dreams, is a sweet, art teacher who has no memory of anything lasting longer than a day. Her family support is her dad and brother who end every day by getting ready to start the day over like it is the same day every time, October 13, 200?. It is one of the sweetest romantic comedies I have seen in a long time. I love the music that accompanies the movie because it is set in Hawaii and it fits each scene perfectly. This movie is a cute way for a guy who seems to have no chance of a normal life with a girl who has memory-afflicted problems. It's sweet because he's willing to do anything to get this girl to fall in love with him each day. The ending is more realistic than most of these Hollywood-type movies. It's a must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"funny, heart-warming, funny","Before this film I thought The Wedding Singer was Adam Sandler's best film, but this one is the best yet.  This is a perfect date movie and the really nice thing is the ending isn't a cheat.  Rob Schneider's Ulla steals every scene he's in, but he stops just short of caricature.

Sandler's most mature and best movie he's starred in so far.,"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore deliver. The Wedding Singer was good, so is this. The idea for the film was brilliant, a well written, smart comedy(something Sandler hasn't done too many of) but I can see him turning into a great comedy actor. If you like this, I would recommend watching Click and Spanglish. Rob Scneider even has an excellent role, and Alan Covert as 10 Second Tom was absolutely hilarious. Sean Astin as the juice using brother was also great. And Dan Akroyd played his part very well. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that Steve Buscemi wasn't in it!! But... despite that, the cast clicked, and it was brilliantly written. Rent it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Valentine's Day Movie,"If you can get past a not too offensive gross-out scene and some sex jokes, this is a delightful romantic comedy, one which I predict will become a classic of its type, right up there with When Harry Met Sally, Groundhog Day, and Sleepless in Seattle. Sandler's and Barrymore's earlier collaboration, the Wedding Singer, was good, but 50 First Dates is even better. For each actor, this is their most appealing role yet. Sandler is in his sweet and lovable guy mode (think Wedding Singer or Big Daddy). Barrymore is radiant and charming. They have an amazing romantic chemistry.This movie shows that you can generate more romantic sparks between the characters if they don't go to bed thirty minutes after they meet (pay attention, Hollywood). Also, this is one of the few romantic comedies that is laugh-out-loud funny. Bottom line – highly recommended. I give it 8 1/2 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Schnieder rules,"OK everyone will laugh at this, but I think Rob Schnieder deserves best actor! That is quite a transformation. He is a little geeky guy, but in this movie he transformed into a pretty convincing Samoan (or Hawaiian native). I really bought into the role he played. No, he will not be recognized for an Oscar. Oh well, I still think he did a good job.I kept thinking the movie was very similar to Groundhog Day in a reversal role. Instead of one person being aware of a repeating cycle, all the people were aware of the cycle, and only one person was unaware of the cycle. It was kind of an annoying twist. I am sorry, but I thought it was so corny. Why was everyone around the amnesiac character, (Lucy), trying to cover the truth? It would be slightly annoying after a year pretending to re-live the same day over and over for the benefit of the amnesiac. Why not tell the person the truth every day? It just seemed dumb to me.The biggest question I have is: Why would a guy, (that can get any girl he wants), fall in love with an amnesiac with a short-term memory? My response is, he is really stupid or this movies plot is stupid. The character was lame, but not stupid. My conclusion is that the movies plot was really uninspired or ""Hollywoodish"". A guy that can get laid every night of his life would not fall for Lucy. Why was it established early in the movie that Adam Sander's character Henry was a ""player"". Henry could, and did, get beautiful women to fall for him on a regular basis. Why would this be established in the film? I think it was to prove he was not trying to take advantage of the mentally ill. If the main character were an average guy that could barely get a date, it would seem seedy preying on a mentally ill girl. Establishing himself as a player indicates that he ignoring Lucy's shortcomings and making a choice above and beyond what he is used to. An average person would just be trying to get a date and laid, and thus, it would be uncomfortable for the audience. Establishing someone that is a player establishes the character as being challenged and thus acceptable. I hate double standards. I would have like to have seen a person desperate for a date go after Lucy. It would have made the audience uncomfortable, and made me happy. IE. Punch Drunk Love. Almost a good one.78/100",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
fun movie!,"This was such a cute movie. Very amusing. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are great in this tale of a girl named Lucy with a fictional condition brought on by an accident involving a cow. Every morning she wakes up with no memory of anything that's happened since the accident. Adam 's character, Henry, happens to fall in love with her, and must make her fall in love with him again every day. Rob Schneider provides additional comic relief as Henry's buddy, a dread locked, one-eyed rasta mon. Sean Astin is amusing as Lucy's lisping, steroid-addicted, bed-wetting brother.It's not the typical laugh-after-laugh goofball Sandler flick, but it is pretty funny, and heartwarming. More of the chick-flick variety, although there's plenty of Sandler/Schneider interaction and walrus-schlong jokes to keep the guys interested!check out the soundtrack too, cool covers of 80s songs done reggae-style! great summer cookout music.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"50 SMILES, 50 TEARS","After watching this film, I can't wait for the next Barrymore - Sadler pairing. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sadler although maybe not quite Liz Taylor and Richard Burton on screen are truly excellent together. I thought their pairing in The Wedding Singer was good but it is well surpassed in 50 First Dates.Basically the film centres around Marine Biologist Henry Roth (Sadler) whose aim is to complete building his ship and set sail to study the Walrus and Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) who has totally lost her short term memory as a result of a car accident caused by an errant cow. Needless to say Henry sees Lucy and the die is cast for a not quite so unusual love story.There is certainly more than a glancing association with Groundhog Day, but for my money this enhanced the film.Everyone played their parts extremely competently and the reason I called the summary 50 smiles, 50 tears is quite simply because the comedic action was performed subtly and well, even the slapstick. The same can be said about the tear jerking scenes also.The icing on the cake of this film for me was the ending. Of course once we knew that Henry's aim was to get Lucy's short term memory back, it was a foregone conclusion that he would succeed and both he and Lucy would live happily ever after. But were we right? I was pleasantly surprised with the extremely well written and somewhat surprising ending.All in all an extremely well written and thoughtful script, extremely well directed and acted on all fronts.I have rated it 8/10 and would love to see it in my Christmas Stocking.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Throughly enjoyed,"My wife and I went to see this movie being Adam Sandler fans. We thought this was a great vehicle for Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. The movie had everything - drama, comedy, suspense, romance. We also enjoyed that it espoused family values. Even though Ula (Rob Schneider) had a warped sense of love for his family, it was evident. His kids were always with him and though he made cracks about his wife they were together. Like so Lucy's family and friends supported her and took care of her the best they new how. To finish, the movie also showed what real love is. Henry demonstrated sacrificial love for Lucy. Certainly not the pinnacle of excellent theater but it isn't intended to be. It is a good movie with minimal offensive elements that embraces true love and family values. We'll watch this one again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cute Movie,"I didn't have high expectations coming into this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have great chemistry in this film, just as they do in ""The Wedding Singer."" The premise is unrealistic, obviously, but the characters are so colorful and likable that you are willing to suspend your disbelief and become involved in the story. I am a big skeptic in general, yet the movie managed to draw me in! There was a lot of warmth and real emotion in the movie in addition to the usual comedic performances by Sandler and Rob Schneider, who seems to present in every one of Sandler's movies in one form or another. The supporting cast also does a good job. Overall it is definitely enjoyable and worth watching :)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie to move you in more ways than one!,"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore make the perfect couple in this romantic comedy. Although romantic comedies tend to consist of more romance than comedy or more comedy than romance, I think this movie did a pretty good job of combining both elements to create an extremely engaging plot. It's true that there are a lot of movies about memory loss, but there are also a lot of other common themes in movies as well. The reason why I can't bash this movie as some of the people on the message board chose to do is because it really made me laugh all the way through and brought tears to my eyes at the end. Very few movies can move me in more ways than one. That is why I encourage you to check the movie out for yourself. For those of you who are sticklers for really good acting, I'm pretty sure you'll be satisfied. Barrymore and Sandler tend to be great actors in their films and they don't fall short of their skills in ""50 first Dates.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

50 GREAT DATES!,"I just finished watching 50 First dates and I must say that I was overly and pleasently suprised.  Although I thought the on screen couple had formiddable charm in The wedding Singer it still seemed like a Adam Sandler film which are usually duds.  My expectations weren't very high but they were more than met.  The couple display extremely likable, gooey, chemistry and the film is Sandlers best it's heartfelt and more of a romantic comedy than just a dumb comedy. Drew Barrymoore stars as Lucy a young woman whom suffers from short term memory loss after a horrific accident with her father. she is prone to relieve the same day over and over again courtesy of her father and his friend's gimmicks. That is until Sandler enters the picture as a player of women but whom falls for Lucy at first site and doesn't give up when it comes to her disability. Many funny scenes ensue but he learns ways to make her fall in love with him each and every day. These two have sparkling, remarkable chemistry.  Individually they give some of their most heartfelt and emotional performances as they struggle day to day with the situation. And the humor which there is alot of is very, very funny and totally on key. The director treats the situation with suprising delicacy and heart. he doesn't teter on juvenile humor but instead embraces the romance as to ask what kind of sacrafices would be made for a perfect love. Rush out and experience an instant romantic classic and by far the best film of the year. 50 first dates is 50 Great dates!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Nutshell Review: 50 First Dates,"Call me a sentimental fool, but 50 First Dates, which reunites Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler after their successful pairing in The Wedding Singer, actually worked for me as a romantic comedy, balancing some hilarious situations and characters with a tragic romantic drama where the girl suffers from a medical condition (yes, quite staple in romances actually), except that this condition isn't life threatening, but life frustrating! Like Leonard Shelby and Sanjay Singhania in Memento and Ghajini, Barrymore's Lucy suffers from short term memory loss, in not being able to make new memories. She wakes up each day in Groundhog Day fashion, no thanks to her father Marlin (Blake Clark) and steroid-taking bodybuilding brother Doug (Sean Astin) who relive their lives day after day in the same day of her car accident (which led to the condition), and also with help from friends at a diner to recreate that perfect morning before that tragedy. And to Lucy, each day seemed like a brand new day, oblivious to changes around her, until she meets Sandler's Henry Roth, who intends to ditch his old womanizing ways, to spend the rest of his life with this new girl of his dreams.So you can already see the problems here. How do you ensure you get remembered, by someone who cannot make new memories? For someone as commitment phobic as Henry, and to Lucy's protective family members, this is the kind of guy whom they are wary of, because it's wham-bang-thank-you-ma'am opportunities abound, and it's far more easier to take off without the victim knowing just who you are. Henry has that reputation of taking advantage of, and in quite comical fashion, shaking off his victims since they are all from various states, only that this time Lucy proved to be a little more than savvy in reproaching his advances, and therein lies the chase, the unavoidable pity, and the falling in love.It's Memento gone romantic, and a touching one at that, with Henry having to be at his innovative best to woo the same girl all over again, to comedic effect of course with the multiple techniques employed, undoubtedly with Sandler being at his best without resorting to too many risqué moments like his recent Zohan adventures, and Barrymore complementing his effort seamlessly with great ease and chemistry. As far as recent romantic comedies go, none seem to be able to touch this one in terms of hitting the mark with its comedy and bringing out those tissues for its drama, and despite being made some 5 years ago, it still packs quite a punch for fans of the genre.If there's a little hiccup, that will be Rob Schneider's overacting as Henry's horny best friend, but that was balanced by the very limited cameo appearance by Dan Aykroyd. For scene stealers, look out for Allen Covert's Ten Second Tom, one whose exaggerated role of a man with an extreme memory problem providing enough wicked laughter at the condition. For fans of sea animals, there's enough penguins and walruses to tickle your funny bone as well, complete at times with complimentary toilet humour.At its core for the die-hard romantics out there, I guess it calls for a lot of effort in trying to craft opportunities to speak to someone, be interesting enough to engage and hold that attention, and generally have a feel good time at the end of the day. Try repeating that day after day and you'll probably appreciate the extent of the kind of tenacity required. Although it sticks to formula after boy-gets-girl (which calls for tissues), nothing beats being rewarded for all the hard effort, and it's a good thing too that the narrative didn't get plagued by the usual Hollywood miraculous ending.Oh, and don't watch this film before you watch M Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, as it reveals the ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Sandler Movie Yet,"While Happy Gilmore is my favorite Sandler comedy, 50 1st Dates is his best all-around film. It's shot beautifully, it has such a great heart, and Rob Schneider gives a genuinely great performance--I know Schneider and great performances usually aren't used in the same sentence unless in jest, but he's really good here. Even though there seems to be a lot here in common with other Sandler films, this one has something a lot of his other romantic comedies didn't: a really great story to go with the gimicky premise.As for the characters, Sandler plays his basic lovable-loser and Drew Berrymore is her usual sweet self and Tom Blake and Hobbit emeritus Sean Astin (who was basically a character designed for a running gag) also deliver in solid supporting roles. Throw in a walrus and penguin for the kids and you've got a classic on your hands.Let's hope Sandler continues to grow and go outside his usual gang of pals for future scripts and then somewhat ""Sandlerize"" them for a bit of irreverent comedy the way he did w/ 50 FIRST DATES.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply hysterical!,"I will tell you now. I am not a big Adam Sandler fan. I mainly saw this because Sean Astin is in it, and last night, gave it a shot with my friend. With in the first 5 minutes, we were cracking up. Incase you don't know, the movie is about Henry Roth is a guy who normally has one night flings with the tourist visiting Hawaii. That is until he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) and falls in love with her. The only problem is that she suffers from short term memory loss, that doesn't last through the night. Every day she wakes up, she thinks it's the same day as her accident. Her father, Marlin Whitmore (Blake Clark) and her brother Doug (Sean Astin) try to keep the secret from her by doing the same thing everyday, like watching the same football game, painting the same room... you get it. Henry will stop at nothing to get Lucy to remember him, but Doug and Marlin tell him to give up and stay away from the local diner which Lucy has breakfast at... everyday. This sets up for a 10 minute series of comedic events that will have you falling off your seat, including one moment where Henry's good friend, Ula (Rob Schneider) get beat with a bat by Lucy.Now, the acting is great. Sandler provides comic relief at all the right times. Schneider plays Ula, who has smoked one (hundred) too many joints, and plays the character great, and makes for some good shark bait. Sean Astin... I can't say enough. To go from the nice, humble, slightly overweight hobbit sidekick, Sam Gamgee to a buffed up, steroid user with a lisp here, he has proved he is an actor, and may just get a best supporting actor nod for a Comedy/Musical for the Golden Globes, next year. Drew Barrymore is a fine female lead in the movie, playing the forgetful Lucy. Also, she kicks Rob Schnider and Adam Sandler's butt in this movie.My final word: If you want a great comedy movie, or need a movie for a first date, this is it. I'm giving it 5 out of 5 stars due to the great acting by the trio of Sandler, Schnider and Astin. Bravo Adam, Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worth seeing 50 times.,"Ok ... maybe not fifty times, but this is a movie worth seeing more than once.I'm guessing those who have given this movie a low rating are the skeptics out there who have never fallen head over heals in love with someone, and I don't think you can really get this movie or buy into it unless you have.  I mean who would stick around with someone whom you knew wouldn't remember you the very next day, each day, day after day.  Love makes you do crazy things.I really enjoyed this movie.  I even went into it thinking that this is a movie done before again and again and was pleasantly surprised.  Rob Schneider was a great side kick (as he seems to play very well as oppose to starring in a film.)  He'll certainly keep you laughing along with Adam and Drew in their quirky semi-romantic one liners.  SO even if you've never been madly in love with someone, you'll get a kick out of quite a few secenes (especially in the beginning with the sick walrus -- one of the funniest scenes in a movie in the past year or so.)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious film that never ceases to amuse me,"Henry has commitment problems. That is, until he meets Lucy. The only problem is that she suffers from short-term memory loss, so every day he has to re-introduce himself. This movie really shows just how far people will go for the ones they love, all the while providing us with funny moments throughout the entire film.Adam Sandler has a habit of overacting in all of his movies, and the first time I saw this, I was crinching as I entered the theater. Fortunately for me, the only part where he has a lot of overacting is when he's on his boat singing the Beach Boys hit 'Wouldn't It Be Nice.' While Drew Barrymore was great in her role, the true star of the show was Sean Astin, otherwise known as Sam from 'The Lord of the Rings.' His performance as Lucy's clueless, steroid-using brother Doug is the best part of the movie. Every time he was on screen, the theater I was in was filled with laughter. I saw this twice in theaters and quoted him for months afterword, and he never ceased to be hilarious.There are some overly sentimental scenes, as well as some disgusting ones, but overall, this movie is full of laughs, and good fun for any romantic comedy fans.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's been a long time since a slapstick movie like this has really worked.  Adam Sandler and the adorable Drew Barrymore were a perfect match.  It is obvious in this role that Sandler has matured as an actor.  I wouldn't be surprised if he starts to look for more dramatically challenging roles.  I liked the story line, for a comedy it actually had one, which was surprising in and of itself.  I would have cut out some of the walrus scenes.  Seen one walrus seen 'em all I guess.  It is also fun to try and spot some of the characters and situations that Sandler has worked with in the past.  I'm really baffled how the critics panned this movie?

"Its the first romantic movie I gave more then a 6, and its a 10","I love movies that make me think, so usually its science fiction movies that I enjoy the most. I never watched a romantic movie that had even the slightest chance of getting me interested. Until this one. Memento is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made, partly because the amount of ideas that the ""no new memories"" problem can produce is enormous. 50 first dates takes a look at this problem from the romantic side. This intellectual spin keeps the movie interesting all the way. This love flick actually makes you put yourself in the characters shoes and think about what would you do. So although its ab love movie, I had fun almost every second of it- all I had to do is filter out the Schneider jokes (that didn't work at all, unlike his other movies). 50 first dates wasn't just a intellectual pleasure, It also moved me quite a bit. The fear of loving someone that doesn't remember loving you shook me up emotionally. So it was smart, funny and sad all at the same time. what else can you ask from a movie? for me the answer is - nothing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Real Surprise...,"When the movie starts out it is loaded with somewhat corny, low-end humor and obvious jokes for the simple-minded. One might even be tempted to initially walk away from it, groaning, that it is just another predictable Hollywood piece of fluff with cheesy jokes. But after the scene, where she first learns of her memory problem, this movie becomes an incredibly well done combination of near tear-jerking drama, and light-hearted humor. It does not end with everything becoming picture perfect and everyone living happily ever after, but ends with realism and happily ever after (which in my book is the best of both worlds). I'm glad I gave this movie a second chance. If I hadn't, I would have missed something great.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Masterpiece, overlooked by many because of anti-Sandlerism.","MY RATING: *** / ****Contains extreme battle violence and tentacle rape. (Maybe.)'50 First Dates' tells of an unusual romance being played out in beautiful Hawaii. Adam Sandler plays Henry, a marine biologist (I love Hollywood) who has no problem with the ladies. He falls head over heels in love with Lucy (Drew Barrymore,) who ever since a car accident a year ago, loses all memory of what she did that day. In other words, Adam's going to have to meet her and make her fall in love with him each day like the first day. Ouch.Adam Sandler comedies are unique in that I have hated every single one of them for the first ten minutes, and then I somehow 'tune in' to the humour and end up enjoying the movie. 50 First Dates has other familiar Sandler elements, such as Rob Schneider doing things no other star would possibly want to add to their credentials, and other scenes involving post - Farrelly brothers grossout gags (any comedy these days involving a walrus is going to have it vomiting or ejaculating or both.) These don't get in the way of the film's purpose, though, which is surprisingly spiritual.Analogies have been drawn between this and Groundhog Day, and that's not such a bad comparison. This film is Groundhog Day in inverse, that is, only one character is living out the same day of her life over and over, and nothing she can do about this will make a difference tomorrow. 50 First Dates is masterful in its exploration of this premise. We grow to understand the rules of this game much like we would a new sport. In fact, I grew to understand it so well that I had a very confused couple of hours immediately after the movie readjusting to the real world. I love that feeling.As we grow more confident of our grip on the ideas presented, the film uses this device to ask some seriously deep questions about human relationships. How we'd react if such an unusual situation arose, and how we'd let our humanity save the day. Henry gets to have a unique insight into both himself and the woman he loves by seeing that every day he finds something new and wonderful to love about her. Many couples' favourite memories are of their first meetings. Ever stop to wonder why that is? You won't after you see this. Some might call this Paul Ver Hoeven syndrome, after another famous director whose films explore moral problems that don't really exist yet, but I think 50 First Dates treads the line between fairy tale and drama with verve and intelligence.Of course, the film relies on us believing that Henry and Lucy could really fall in love every day, and Adam Sandler - Drew Barrymore give fine emotional performances, especially Sandler, who's more known for his distanced, slightly vicious characters. In 50 First Dates he wears his heart on his sleeve, and is all the better for it. Barrymore has the easier role to play here - her situation is so unusual that nobody really knows how anyone would act in it - but nonetheless we see what has rocked Henry's world. The supporting cast are up to the job too, despite being slightly lumbered with standard quirkiness (the camp bodybuilding brother, the old sea dog father, the I-don't-know-how-to-summarise-her colleague.) The choice of location is perhaps too postcard-perfect to really give the romance credibility, but watching dolphins and sunsets so beautifully photographed can hardly be constituted as a 'mistake.'All in all, I rate 50 First Dates very highly. It forced me to think deeply and quickly, and in today's movie industry, such a mental workout is rare without having to go to your local independent picture house and put up with your ten-a-penny artistic geniuses. I have to take off one star from the perfect four to reflect the disappointing ending, and that it is, at the end of the day, an Adam Sandler film. Sorry Adam. You came so close to eliminating my shadows of doubts.",,Anonymous,Romance

"not much of a comedy, but quite sentimental","The story follows a guy who is trying to win the heart of this one girl, who actually likes him back, except there's a twist -- she happens to have a short-term memory loss and thus, forgets everything that happened the day before.  I'm not particularly an Adam Sandler fan nor am I particularly anti-Adam Sandler.   I do, however, like well-done, funny films, and much of the low-brow comedy that is out there usually falls flat.  This movie, in that area, was no exception.  I often found myself nearly falling asleep at the jokes (I was also a little tired, admittedly, but good jokes usually keep me awake).  That is unfortunate too, since beyond the unfunny potty humor, the film is actually quite sweet and smart enough in the romantic areas.  It is also endearing to see a story where a guy tries over and over to restart a relationship (literally) that seems very hopeless.  Like the last good Sandler film, ""The Wedding Singer,"" the two leads, Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler, have good chemistry.  If this film had decided to drop the usual cheap humor, or heck, had just been a PG film, they may actually have had to resort to ""wit"" to make the film funny.  Now, that would've been something creative and perhaps this movie could've been the next ""Groundhog Day"" even.  As it is, it is like a good lollipop covered with really cheap ketchup.  5/10",,Anonymous,Romance
5 minutes away from an all-time classic,"As surprising as this sounds--especially to anyone who knows me and the kinds of films I normally like--but for the lack of a little restraint this good movie could have been a great one.  Instead, we are left with nothing but a near miss and the promise of what might have been.  Imagine a movie like Casablanca with a fart joke thrown in.I was furious when I left this movie. Except for a handful of ridiculously unnecessary scenes/plot points, this movie would have been near perfect. I can't remember being this mad since I saw ET and was surprised by the now infamous 'p@#$!-breath' comment made by the little boy Elliott, played by Henry Thomas. Note to Hollywood: STOP IT ALREADY!  I'm not a prude.  I don't mind R-rated movies, nudity, or foul language in the right context.  I even been known to laugh at potty-humor.  But dammit, this time it did not work.At various times, 50 First Dates touched me in ways that few movies have. The wonderful poignancy of it. The near flawless performance by Drew Barrymore as Lucy made the devotion of her father and brother all the more believable.  Adam Sandler, as Henry, has a goofy ""everyman"" quality to him that works well here. And he and Drew have a kind of quirky chemistry that works. As wildly implausible as the plot sounds on paper, it works too.I just wish someone had taken a stand during the production of this movie and fixed the 5 minutes that keeps it from being an all-time classic.

A heartwarming movie,"This is one of the few Adam Sandler movies I wish to recommend everyone to see as a must watch movie. As with all his movies you will see characters from the Saturday Night Live crew who are still close friends after he quit the TV show, and add a little humor to tickle your funny bone. Memory loss is a medical issue that still plague millions of people worldwide after vehicle accidents, which could have been prevented. Unfortunately the prevention issue has not been addressed in this movie, but the after accident solution that this movie successfully portrays has been applied successfully by too few therapists around the world. Hopefully this movie will change that. The soundtrack is another beautiful addition that I also recommend that you purchase along with the DVD to entertain friends and family at home during thanksgiving, Xmas, and other social group gatherings.",,Anonymous,Romance

watch a great film about a day repeated: Groundhog Day,"This movie suffers from a bad case of ACS (American Comedy Syndrome) where the writers are too scared to create a straight comedy, but have to insert a load if sentimental pap.

Will my sides remain together!?I will forgive a lot in comedy films as long as they are funny, this isn't (with the exception of scenes involving Sandler's Hawaiian friend)It struck me how similar in concept this film was to Groundhog Day, but whilst the former was a well told story with an ultimately profound message, this is just a B grade RomCom that fails the ultimate test (being funny).",,Anonymous,Romance
Lame Comedy,"`50 First Dates' is bad, a comedy romance that is totally unreal.  The stars portray caricatures, not characters.  This movie supposedly takes place in Hawaii, but the main exterior shots, lasting a total of about 8 minutes, seem to have been filmed in Waikiki by Chinaman's Hat Island and on either an isolated road in the Oahu's interior or in Maui by former pineapple fields.  In any case, Hawaii never looked worse, with the movie having a consistent muddy picture that was probably not a projectionist focus problem.  In Hollywood now, you can have a career even if you have no talent, look strange and have a crummy voice e.g. the career of Owen Wilson. If Adam Sandler continues to star in unappealing comedies like `50 First Dates,' he will end up with a core audience of teenagers who will watch almost any swill for the first weekend in release.  This movie represents a precipitous decline in quality from `The Wedding Singer.'",,Anonymous,Romance

The movie had me laughing on many occasions actually.What I actually found funny was that the character that Drew Barrymore suffers from the same condition as the character in Memento, and look how different the movies ended up. And the repetitive days were similiar to those of Groundhog Day. No matter what you compare this movie to it is still pretty original, non imitation, so do I suggest you go watch it?

"Drew and Adam are likable, but this movie isn't","50 First Dates (2004) Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Dan Aykroyd, Rob Schneider, Sean Astin, Blake Clark, D: Peter Segal. Sandler plays a genuinely sweet guy: a fish veterinarian in Hawaii (if you can believe that one) who has a real aversion for commitment. That all changes after he meets a pretty art teacher (Barrymore), but when he finds himself falling in love with her, he's shocked to discover she has short-term memory loss after a past car accident. Now that she only remembers the memories that took place before the crash, he figures he'll try to keep getting her to fall in love with him every time they meet-which is every day. It's a sweet, far-out premise and Drew and Adam work with the chemistry they had in THE WEDDING SINGER, but the juvenile gags linking to vomit, body parts, and androgynies make the cloying sentimentality standard Sandler.

Definitely a warm-fuzzy kind of film,"I truly adore this movie! I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and of Drew Barrymore, so this was ideal for me. This movie is THE perfect example of a ""feel-good flick"". Sandler and Barrymore have an undeniably sweet and believable chemistry on the screen. So much so, that I think seeing them in movies together (The Wedding Singer, of course) makes some part of us as viewers wish that they'd actually start a real-life romance. There are definitely some parts of the storyline that people who are more attracted to realism and practicality would have a problem with, because this movie is not about what's practical. It's about loving someone so much that you'd go to great heights to remind them of that in the best way you can, every single day. We can all definitely use a reminder about that kind of stuff, right?There are parts that will get a chuckle (maybe even a cackle) out of you, there are parts that will get you a little misty, and there are definitely parts that will get you all warm and squishy inside. I can safely say that even if I wasn't already a huge fan of Drew Barrymore, I'd still be extremely impressed by her performance in this movie. When she cries, it's hard not to bust a tear or two yourself. Overall (if you can't already tell), I think this movie is a fantastic love story with a refreshing and original plot, and an ideal movie to watch when you're in need of cheering up, or if you're slightly disenchanted about love (or if you're like me and you like to live vicariously through a great film). I'd recommend it to anyone with a sweet tooth. Hope to see Sandler and Barrymore together again on the big screen soon. RENT THIS MOVIE!!!",,Anonymous,Romance
It's a matter of expectation.,"I have been reading all the viewer feedback and something strikes me about whether or not you will like this movie. Expectation.I am willing to bet that almost everyone who goes to see this movie, will be expecting Big Daddy, Billy Madison or other trademark Sandler comedic moments. Add to the mix Drew Barrymore and the more discerning viewer in possession of the temporal lobe will call to mind The Wedding Singer.On that premise, they go to see the movie and are sorely disappointed. People aren't evaluating the movie on what they see and how they feel when they leave the cinema, they are comparing the movie to their expectations and that is a huge mistake.So what did I think? Personally I loved it. I think it was one of the best movies of it's genre that I have seen in quite some time. Everyone has commented that it is ""Memento meets Groundhog Day"" and so on, but I see past that. I see a metaphor.Think about it. In today's society, everyday we get up, go about our day, go about our lives in the same old way. It's no wonder so many marriages end in divorce. What this film provide a context. If we don't make an effort with our relationships, our partners start to forget the good things and the relationship ends. In Sandler and Barrymore's case, it's just a much quicker process.I admire the movie because to me it sends a message that every relationship should be this way and we should all treat our lovers this way. Even if they don't have a brain disorder.What I loved about this movie seems to be what other people hated about it. That Sandler, while still doing what he does best, has toned down his trademark crudeness and proven that he can play a serious role. That Barrymore was as cute and fresh and I think one reviewer described her as 'flower-girl.' Personally, I have long been a fan of Drew Barrymore and while I hated the Charlie's Angel's sequel, I think that she is a serious actress and people aren't always willing to look at that.Last week in Australia we were fortunate enough to have Drew Barrymore interviewed by our own Rove McManus and prior to seeing the film I was thrilled to hear Barrymore's thoughts. They echo my own. That the movie is powerful because of the inevitable futility.Something I have since realised is that accepting the challenge of making someone fall in love with you every day, is a proclamation of love in it's own right. The same thing that helped Sandler win over the father and brother in the film (God, Astin cracked me up!) is the same lesson I think alot of people need to learn.I think (and I know people will hate this) is that people who don't like this film can be sorted into several categories.1. People who can't be bothered to/or are afraid of showing extreme signs of love to someone2. People that are functioning on 5 brain cells and just spent ten dollars to watch Sandler chase a penguin, chase someone with a golf club, or chase his ever escaping childhood. (Don't get me wrong, I loved all of those movies, but if Sandler can grow as an actor, why can't we grow as viewers?)3. Bitter and twisted people who have been hurt to the point of never trusting again.I think what also confuses people with this film is that while they compare to Memento and Groundhog Day, it doesn't fall into an immediate formula. Let's try it. Boy meets Girl. Boy likes Girl. Girl likes Boy. Girl forgets Boy. Wow it's easy when you try, isn't it?Make no mistake, it is worth watching, but clear your mind before you do.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good but could've been better. The ending...,"The trailer for the movie made me think it would be a very romantic movie, since the guy has to win her love back everyday, you know, something that many couples don't use to do. Anyways, this is basically a comedy, and succeeds as that most of the time, but it's not ambitious enough to make us think a little. It entertains, but nothing more. Another complaint is the ending. Too forced and implausible, plus it kind of contradicted some things that had been said during the movie (can she remember her dreams????), and it just left us with many questions. It seemed that they just wanted to end the movie right away, and solved things the way they could. I give it a 6.5/10. Sorry because the premise was excellent, but the execution needed to be better.",,Anonymous,Romance
Very funny,Hollywood finally gets it together and makes a comedy that actually has laughs in it. This is NEWS ! All the cast does a fine job. And I thought the male/female  role was somewhat interesting just for mentally toying with the 'Is he/she or isn'e she / he.',,Anonymous,Romance
Love some Spam and Reese's peanut butter cups,"50 First Dates finds Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore returning to form with another great pairing. These two seem to have tremendous chemistry and they don't have to work at it too much. Sandler carries the movie quite well and seems to be enjoying himself. I was glad to see Sean Astin do a comedic performance after the drama that was the Lord of the Rings trilogy. And Rob Schneider steals every scene he is in.(When he put the joint in the crack of his ass, I almost fell off the couch) My mother even enjoyed this movie and she isn't usually a fan of Sandler's high school humor. But this movie mixes enough low-brow with sweet,sentimental moments to create a fun movie that feels so refreshing. I give it a 7 out of 10 and would have given it an 8 if she had gotten her memory back or had at least been on the track to doing so. *Look for the Happy Gilmore reference*",,Anonymous,Romance
A change of pace for Sandler,"'50 First Dates' is more of a romantic comedy than an Adam Sandler comedy. Sure, there's sexual and crude humor throughout the film, but they're not the main focus of the film. I thought 'Anger Management' was hilarious, and I'm going to see 'Happy Gilmore' as soon as I can. But enough about that. Adam Sandler is charming here, as is Drew Barrymore. This bizarre tale of love in Hawaii is funny, sweet, charming, and just plain feel-good. It loathes me to write that sentence, but it's true. I love the part where Drew Barrymore beats the bejesus out of Rob Schineder with a baseball bat. Rob Schineder is the most hilarious part of the film as Ula, the perverted Hawaiian local who is Henry's best friend. Overall, '50 First Dates' is a pretty good movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
Sweet and Funny,"The chemistry that Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler showed us in ""The Wedding Singer"" carries over into this sweet and funny romantic comedy. Peter Lucas gives us an abundance of wacky moments, over-the-top characters, and quasi-adolescent sexual humor, but considering the cast, we'd be disappointed if it didn't have all that and more. However, it's the ""and more"" that makes this movie special. Sandwiched between the zany moments are bittersweet romance, the powerful ties of family and friendship, and, finally, a surprisingly insightful picture of the true meaning of love. Cudos to Sean Astin, who shows us he's not afraid to take a risk!",,Anonymous,Romance
Bristol Bay,"The only thing that bothered me about that movie is that Bristol Bay is never, ever ever that calm, and that boat would have been eaten alive in Bristol Bay.Other than that I loved the movie. I thought it was pretty funny. For those people that are complaining about Adam Sandler moving into more romantic comedies, I think they need to expand their ability to think and handle more substantive issues in their movies.Anyway, that boat would have been ripped to shreds in Bristol Bay, nor would anybody be hanging out on the deck drinking drinks, because they would be trying to stay alive in the 80 knot winds and freezing temperatures. Living in Alaska, I hate it when people seem to show complete ignorance towards the state.",,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Start Tanks Effort,"There are some ridiculous scenes at the beginning of `50 First Dates' that for all intents and purposes tank any opportunity there might have been for us to love this movie.  Forever after we wince often for fear Adam Sandler will pull an over-the-top Jerry Lewis moment, disturbing our attempt to understand  or at least ponder - Drew Barrymore's problem.  And her problem, one of a permanent short term memory loss rendering her incapable of recalling her yesterdays, is pretty fascinating.Lucy Whitmore's (Barrymore) father and brother have built a world for her that is as touching as it is odd  they preserve a particular day for her to relive every morning.  Since, like Guy Pearce in the phenomenal `Memento' of a few years back, she cannot create new memories and every day is a new day. Thus they go through tremendous effort to see that she is not made upset by essentially anything new in her life.Alas, this is not `Memento'.  Absolutely none of the gritty realism, sheer guts of the main character as he searches for truth, none of the mystery or in particular the drive on the part of the memory challenged person to compensate for their new-found handicap is ever presented.  Lucy just wafts along, borne on the breeze created by the fanning of the spectators in her life.`50 First Dates' is a disappointment in that generally films not offered for wide release yet starring some really talented actors often have a chance to be very good.  So we suspected this might be a sleeper, perhaps in the vein of the very interesting 2002 Sandler effort `Punch Drunk Love'.  But no, Sander has reverted to form.Granted, he shows some real talent and even sensitivity in acting as a talented and caring young aquarist.  But when it comes to comedy Sandler has one dimension, and it is from the Jim Carey School of Goofiness.  So we get totally inappropriate outbursts, sort of juvenile and most definitely silly. Consider two particular examples of this in the film.  At the very beginning Henry (Sandler) concocts an enormously unbelievable tale designed to assist in brushing off a one-night stand.  Later in a restaurant he illustrates (in front of Lucy) the hammiest crying jag recorded by anyone in recent memory.Drew Barrymore, on the other hand, is such a treat to watch.  She has a few energetically comic moments and plays her character very believably, given her opportunities.  But for the most part Sandler acts as a moth to her flame, which has the effect of diluting, not enhancing, her performance. Ms. Barrymore can equal the best work of any of the good young actors available today and can be admired for trying just about anything role.There are enough quality moments in `50 First Dates' to allow that it has some appeal.  But in no way is it of the caliber of `Memento', and it should be quickly forgotten.Rating: 2.5 Stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
SWEET,"I recently saw 50 first dates on an airplane. Usually i don't rent movies on planes but i heard a lot about this movie and it was a long flight so i did. I thought it was a cute, sweet movie, but pretty basic. I did not like Rob Snyder in it and thought he totally over acted! He was not believable at all and I think he hurt many scenes and was very annoying. Adam Sandler played a slightly more serious character than his usual character that you see in all of his movies. I have never been impressed with his acting. Drew on the other hand carried the movie as far as I was concerned! She had the toughest part as the one with amnesia and she really pulled it off. I also liked the story line which kept the movie together. I am glad i saw this on the plane as i would not have been happy if i rushed to the movies to see it. I think it is a nice, mindless video rental movie when you can't find something better on the shelf.",,Anonymous,Romance
Decent flick...same actors as Waterboy,"This movie was good but I get kind of  bummed out when Adam Sandler gets a little bit too mushy.  Yet, that was ok.  This movie had lots of funny part. Even that darn Walrus who pukes in that hermaphradites face!!  Speaking of her, she was creepy!!!Drew Barrymore played herself, no big impact on my viewing pleasure.  Sean Aston, otherwise known as SAMWISE the HOBBIT was the best part of the entire movie!!!  He kept getting roid rage and saying the funniest things to Adam!!I give this movie a few good marks.  This is average but maybe I will see it again.  Ten Second Tom is great.",,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting story-line however fragmented it is at times,"Here we have another interesting look at the comedic genius abilities of America's most loved - Adam Sandler, and the corresponding girly charm of ever-likeable Drew Barrymore. Sandler turns in a mediocre performance with Barrymore in this almost unique plot(similarity in some small measure to Ground Hog Day) where a concussion has caused the protagonist Lucy to lose her short term memory. In an endeavor to fall in love with his most challenging conquest yet, Sandler's character attempts a series of wild and imaginative stunts to combat her Achilles heel. Knowing that every new day signals the beginning of winning her over once again, Sandler bravely and stubbornly persists in trying to indelibly etch himself into Barrymore's deeper subconscious. In an emotionally draining and sporadically amusing relationship(If one day flings with an individual with no short-term memory classify as a relationship) Sandler must try to stay the course and through some inventive way manifest their mutual 'love' for one another deep within her. Ultimately the trials and tribulations pay off and through clever scheming via prerecorded video cassette the nuptial is concluded in a lovely Jewish Style Wedding!",,Anonymous,Romance
"If you hate Sandler and someone tries to get you to see the movie, do it. You might still hate Sandler, but you'll like the movie.","Okay, I plagiarized the summary from jjs402's comment. But it pretty much summarizes how I felt about the movie.I hit a late (late, late, late) showing Friday night. I'm DEFINITELY not a Sandler fan. I find him, at best, dreadfully repetitious.I liked ""Little Nicky"", but mostly because it avoided most of Sandler's signature histrionics. But just about everything else he's in, I've avoided like the plague.So, with a bit of trepidation, I caught the flick.And I liked it.I still can't stand Sandler, but I liked ""50"".Heck, one of the best parts was Drew giving a beatdown, Sammy Sosa-Style, to a certain obnoxious comic.",,Anonymous,Romance
Funny. Adam Sandler Funny.,"Adam Sandler is a comic genius...however this movie doesn't prove that to the extent of some of his earlier movies (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, The Wedding Singer), but it does come close. This is as much of a sophisticated comedy from Adam Sandler as you will get (however that doesn't say much). I am a big Adam Sandler fan, I think he is perhaps the most unique comedic actor ever. The plot of the movie sometimes gets a little bit repetitive, but Sandler and Barrymore are quick to change that up. All in all, its a great movie. I recommend it to anyone who isn't in a serious mood, as 50 First Dates acts as a crossover between an Adam Sandler Comedy, and a dramatic comedy.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of Sandler's better films...,"...""50 First Dates"" is about a sleazy dude (Adam Sandler) in Hawaii who again and again tricks tourist women into sleeping with him (he doesn't like commitment...clearly).  This all changes when one day he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) and basically falls in love with her at first sight.  He talks to her.  They hit it off.  The next day, though, she doesn't know who he is. He's told that she can't keep short term memories for more than a day (think ""Memento"") because of a car crash so her father Marlin (Blake Clark) and brother Doug (Sean Astin) must recreate the same day over and over again (think ""Groundhog Day"").That's basically what this is, ""Memento"" meets ""Groundhog Day"".  The resulting fare isn't as impressive as either of those films, but it isn't bad either.  Lately you could say that Sandler is flushing his career down the toilet (with stinkers like ""Anger Management"" and ""Mr. Deeds""), but this redeems him.  There is lots of good comedy - specifically from Sandler's friend ""Ula"" (Rob Schneider) and Astin's Doug - and even the romance avoids being too sappy.One mentionable thing is Blake Clark's performance.  We haven't seen the guy in anything except small roles, but he shines in this one.  His performance as Lucy's dad is subtle and touching and funny, I want to see the guy in more.So, nothing amazing, but a considerable date movie, I give it a 7/10.",,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent Movie full of laughs. No over the top stupid humor,Excellent Movie full of laughs. No over the top stupid humor.There is excellent chemistry between Drew and Adam.

I'm appalled,"Okay, Adam Sandler is adorable, and Drew Barry More's face could make you melt, but this movie was simply unexceptable.  Last night my friends and I went to the movies and I wanted to see Lost in Translation, however they complained that they didn't want to have to ""think"", so instead I was forced to sit through a movie that made me fall apart in tears afterward.  My father died two years ago of severe brain damage.  The concept of having to woo some girl with short term memory loss every single day, and than eventually impregated her, and have her meet her child for time whenever she wakes up is just not funny.  I was so offended.  I mean ""ten second Tom"", the fact that people find brain damage funny takes away all my hope in the human race.  I'm not just saying this because I'm a bitter teenager without a father, but I'm saying this because it's depressing that sick people and hermaphrodites are now the target of jokes and laughter.  It's sick. I hated his movie and whoever decided to make it should be ashamed of themselves.",,Anonymous,Romance
